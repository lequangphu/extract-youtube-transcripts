Title: Dr. Matthew Hill: How Cannabis Impacts Health & the Potential Risks
Published: 2024-07-08 12:00:47 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. Matthew Hill, a professor of cell biology and anatomy at the Hotchkiss Brain Institute at the University of Calgary and an expert on the biology of cannabis. We discuss how cannabis affects the brain to produce its psychoactive effects (feeling “high”), including altered time perception, focus, memory, appetite, and stress.

We discuss how THC vs. cannabidiol (CBD) affects the brain, the effects of different routes of cannabis administration (e.g., smoking, vaping, edibles), high-potency THC, and whether cannabis is addictive. We discuss if there is a link between cannabis use and the development of psychosis, anxiety, bipolar depression, or schizophrenia. 

We discuss whether CBD has clinical benefits in regulating stress, promoting sleep, and treating certain diseases. We also discuss if there are real and consistent differences in the biological effects of different cannabis strains, if cannabis impacts hormones, and the uses of cannabis for the management of pain, stress, Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and nausea.

Listeners of this episode will get an up-to-date understanding of what is currently known about how cannabis affects the brain and body, including both its potential benefits and risks.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Matthew Hill Dr Matthew Hill is a professor of Cell Biology and Anatomy at the University of Calgary his laboratory studies cannabis and its effects on stress its effects on feeding and its effects on the behavioral impacts of cannabis exposure at different stages of development the origin of today's podcast episode is a bit unique so I'd like to share a little bit of that background with you previously I did a solo episode of The hubman Lab podcast about cannabis the biology of cannabis some of its medical applications and uses as well as some of its potential harms that episode came out several years ago now and remains a very popular episode it's had millions of views and millions of listens several months ago we posted a clip of that episode to X formerly known as Twitter and Dr Matthew Hill responded to that clip on X with criticism about the specific points made within that clip most notably my discussion of the data that cannabis use can in some individuals cause psychosis he also took issue with some of the specific points I Made In that clip related to potential differences in the biology of the effects of different strains of cannabis most notably indicia versus Sativa strains and a few other points as well now now as somebody who's been in the field of science for several decades now I'm very familiar with the fact that every field every single field within science has debates within it controversies and sometimes outright battles and to me that's part of what makes science interesting it's an evolving process it's something for which we should all be very curious to try and understand what we know what we don't know and try and get to the real answers so right off the bat on X I invited Dr Hill onto the podcast and he accepted the invitation so today's episode is really a unique one in that first of all we cover an enormous amount of biology and clinical data as it relates to cannabis meaning today's discussion is not a debate it is really an up-to-date discussion about how cannabis works so we talk about THC versus CBD we address the question of whether or not indas versus sativas have different biological and subjective effects or not we of course talk about the potential correlation maybe even causation between cannabis use and Psych is I think you'll find that discussion very interesting and we talk about how cannabis relates to hunger to memory to anxiety and to the treatment of anxiety I'm certain that given the widespread use of cannabis nowadays that you'll find the discussion to be both an informative and potentially useful one that could help guide decisions as to whether or not you or other should or should not use or avoid cannabis as well as one that can simply inform about this very interesting compound and of course you'll learn a lot of neuros science and biology along the way before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity I've spoken many times before on this podcast about the critical need to get sleep both enough sleep and enough quality sleep now one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is that your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3° in order for you to fall and stay deeply asleep and to wake up feeling refreshed your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3 degrees one of the best ways to ensure all of that happens is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and with Aid sleep it's very easy to do that you program the temperature that you want at the beginning middle and the end of the night and that's the temperature that you're going to sleep bat and it will track your sleep it tells you how much slow wave sleep you're getting how much rapid eye movement sleep you're getting which is critical and all of that also helps you dial in the exact parameters you need in order to get the best possible night sleep for you I've been sleeping on an eights Sleep mattress cover for well over 3 years now and it has completely transform my sleep for the better eight sleep recently launched their newest generation pod cover the Pod 4 ultra the Pod 4 ultra cover has improved cooling and heating capacity higher Fidelity sleep tracking technology and the Pod four cover has snoring detection that will automatically lift your head a few degrees to improve air flow and stop your snoring if you'd like to try an eight- sleep mattress cover you can go to 8sleep.com huberman to save $350 off their pod 4 ultra eight sleep currently ships to the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium in the correct ratios but no sugar now I and others on the podcast have talked a lot about the critical importance of hydration for proper brain and bodily function research shows that even a slight degree of dehydration can really diminish cognitive and physical performance it's also important that you get adequate electrolytes in order for your body and brain to function at their best the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium are critical for the functioning of all the cells in your body especially your neurons or nerve cells to make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of hydration and electrolytes I dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning and I drink that basically first thing in the morning I also drink element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing especially on hot days if I'm sweating a lot and losing water and electrolytes if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element.com huberman spelled drink lnt.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with the purchase of any element drink mix again that's drink element.com huberman to claim a free sample pack today's episode is also brought To Us by better help better help offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online there are essentially three things that make up great therapy first of all great therapy consists of having good rapport with somebody that you can really trust and talk to about the issues that you're dealing with second of all that therapist should provide support in the form of emotional support or directed guidance and third expert therapy should provide useful insights insights that allow you to better understand not just your emotional life and your relationship life but of course also your relationship to yourself and to career goals and school goals meaning excellent therapy should also Inspire positive action better help makes it very easy for you to find an expert therapist with whom you really resonate with and that can provide the benefits that I just described also because better help therapy is done entirely online it's very time efficient and it's easy to fit into a busy schedule because it's involves no commuting to a therapist's office

for my discussion with Dr Matthew Hill Dr Matt Hill welcome thanks for having me delighted to have you here because you're an expert in the biology of cannabis a topic that many many people are curious about for for a variety of reasons so just to kick things off maybe we can get people up to speed on what cannabis is a little bit about how it works in the brain and body to produce the various effects that it produces and how some of that comes to be and then we can dig into some of the Nuance I have a lot of questions about different types if you will of cannabis um the relationship to mental health potentially to mental illness we're going to drill into all of that so just to kick things off what is cannabis I mean cannabis is a plant that has been around for some time it's kind of got like a very rich history of use around the world for different cultures um for both kind of medicinal and spiritual and recreational purposes over several centuries um the plant has kind of become I mean in the west it really wasn't a thing mainstream wise until about the 60s uh and then it became kind of introduced as like a drug of choice that a lot of people started using during the rise of the hippie and I think that was a lot of the time that cannabis got popularized um and then I'd say more recently cannabis has you into the '90s and on has become kind of a very heavily used drug by a large swath of people ranging from teenagers on up uh in terms of what it is inside it I mean it's a plant with a lot of very complex chemistry and biology behind it so there's a lot of molecules that it carries in it uh we call these cannabinoids and they come in a lot of different flavors but the main one that's the most important one when we talk about cannabis and what drives the kind of intoxicating and what I would refer to as psychoactive effects of cannabis is uh Delta 9 tetrah hydroc canaban or what we call THC um and that really is what dictates you know the psychoactive and intoxicating properties of the plant and so the amount of THC that is within the cannabis plant will influence the you know how high a person's going to get when they consume it uh there are probably 70 to 10 and some odd other cannabinoids that are within cannabis most of them are pretty Trace levels like and they vary from different types to cannabis from one another uh but the other one that's had a lot of attention is cannabid or what we call CBD uh CBD is structurally looks pretty similar to THC but doesn't behave anything like THC it's not intoxicating at all um I'm not sure I would probably say it's not psychoactive in the sense that people can't tell if they're on it or not but I would some people still say it's psychoactive because people claim you know it can affect anxiety state or mood state or other things so in that context maybe psychoactive is still somewhat appropriate of a word to use um and then there's a whole bunch of other things like cannabinol canaberal and these other minor cannaboids most of which we really don't understand any of the biology of we don't know what they're doing um they may influence some of the effects of THC they may not um but they're there and they vary in their composition from you know different flavor of different cannabis to different flavor uh and then there's those other things called tpin which are kind of Highly volatile compounds but they're not specific to cannabis they're founds in tons of other plants so this is a lot of which seems to contribute at least to some of the smell and the flavors of cannabis so these are things like lemoning which U you know gives some cannabis kind of a citrusy odor or flavor to it um pinene which gives things more of like a earthy tree kind of smell uh beta caropine merine and these Turpin are also some of which do have gnome biologic IAL activity some don't and they vary quite heavily across different kinds of cannabis as well and again there's some thought that they may be influencing some of the psychoactive or intoxicating properties of cannabis but the reality is we really don't know a lot about them at this point there's kind of some emerging work that's starting to come out now that kind of plays with you know giving someone THC and adding in one other tpine or one other minor canabo and seeing how it influences things and so you can imagine with the plethora of molecules that exist in cannabis doing this in a piecewise manner could take decades to kind of really get to a point where we understand all the interactive um components of cannabis but people tend to refer to this as like an Entourage effect that's kind of a phrase that gets used quite widely in the Cannabis world and the idea behind that is that if you took pure THC um and so there are some like distillate pens and things that exist out there now in the product Market which are basically isolated THC with Trace levels of anything of other stuff would be very different than if you had THC in combination with some of these other molecules and how they might influence how THC itself is working or not so fascinating plant you mentioned the psychoactive effects um some people listening to this and watching this presumably have experienced those psychoactive effects others perhaps have not how could we describe for both groups um what the quote unquote psychoactive effects are you mentioned um the higher the concentration of THC the quote unquote higher someone will get right the greater the intensity of the High um what is the high um and I know people are probably chuckling saying you know does huberman not know because he's never done it I mean that's my own business I I just want people to understand what you mean by psychoactive effects so I mean the way that people would usually describe the the intoxicating effects of cannabis is uh they would I mean people often refer to it as there being some Euphoria or some positive mood not on the same order as what people would describe with say cocaine or some other stimulants but there certainly is some kind of positive aspect I mean if there wasn't people wouldn't be using it if they didn't feel positive about it afterwards uh there can be you know other aspects uh in terms of changes in feeding Behavior people might find things funnier than they found things it might change the way they perceive various environmental stimuli um but it can also for some people create a bit of a dissociative state to some some degree where people might feel a little bit out of body so it's kind of a a complicated intoxicating state to describe I would say because usually if someone's referring to something like a stimulant they're just like oh people feel like they're God they're like you know possibility everywhere yeah exactly like they're very happy and they're kind of jacked up and I think with cannabis the way people would describe it would be very different it's like kind of an introspective State you might be more aware of your bodily feelings and um states that are going on inside you you're kind of internal state but you also have like a different perspective on external stimuli you might process information a bit differently focus on things a bit differently so it's kind of a a complicated state to describe I would say usually when people are assessing if someone's intoxicated like um the kind of lab work where people get some on high they just kind of use a what we call a visual analog scale which is like a one to 100 or something or zero to 100 and say do you feel high do you enjoy this would you say you feel euphoric is your mood elevated so they're kind of scaling things like that so I think that's more typically in a lab setting how you would Define if someone's high or not from it and this is why when people do studies with something like a placebo cannabis or a very low THC cannabis you'll see kind of a scaling so um even if you give someone a placebo cannabis if they think that they're getting cannabis a lot of people still respond by saying they feel a bit High that's interesting is that true even if they've never used cannabis before I'm not actually certain if you are allowed to have someone in a drug study if they've never done something before I think they have to have had some previous experience with a drug be ened now smokers everywhere running to look at subject but I think yeah I don't think you can use drug naive people I mean I don't run human clinical lab studies so I can't explicitly say it but that's my understanding is that someone has to have had even limited like you know not much but at least once or twice they have to have experienced the drug before so I don't know if you would take someone who was completely blind cuz I don't know how they would replicate that state if they're not expecting it what about the effects of cannabis on time perception you know there's this um reputation that cannabis has uh for disrupting time perception that people will think a long period of time has passed when in fact very little time has passed maybe it's sometimes even the reverse um is the mechanism by which cannabis can adjust time perception known I wouldn't say it's well worked out there definitely seems to be some like temporal d like you're saying where people think things have you know someone will be high and someone will ask them how long do you think time has passed they would report usually longer periods of time have passed than I actually have I feel like there is some older work I could dig up to see if I could find that is either in like it might even be in pigeons uh but it might be in rodents it's looking at like temporal ordering and they give animals cannaboids and that's kind of a cleaner way of seeing because they are very good at learning like if I wait 10 minutes and then I engage in a behavior I get a reward and so you you can really train animals to have this ordinal timing where they kind of know distinct periods of time and if they give them canabo they respond differently so it in that context it does still seem to produce some state where there's a an altered perception of time passing and so I think if we were going to really understand the mechanism of it that would probably be the way to go but I'm not super familiar with the work because no one's I mean anything I can think of is pretty old I can't think of anything modern where people have actually looked at this interesting uh you mentioned effects of cannabis on appetite and I know one of the um medical uses of cannabis is in people that are undergoing treatment for cancer in order to stimulate appetite because oftentimes they have very low or even no appetite due to the cancer treatment um is the mechanism by which cannabis can stimulate appetite known and if so um what is the general trend of of effect makes people hungrier obviously but we hear again in um kind of uh recreational ter terms of people getting the munchies you know becoming exceedingly hungry is that related to some cannabis induced effect on say blood sugar like insulin or glucose regulation or is it happening at at a different level yeah I think we almost need to take a step back actually to talk about how cannabis works in the Brain before we kind of go into that so THC as a molecule exerts almost all its effects they're acting at this one receptor for the most part that's widely expressed through the brain called the cannabinoid type 1 receptor um CB1 yeah CB1 is the shorthand for it and and I think um you know as people tend to create analogies to describe what receptors are for those you who don't know it's most people use like a lock and key analogy that like a receptor would be a protein that sits on a cell and a molecule that binds to it like THC is the key that fits in that lock when it activates it it triggers some biological process in the cell in this case a neuron that changes its activity in some capacity um and so THC acts on these CB1 receptors which um are very widely expressed in fact outside of like kind of ION channel that are expressed in the brain the CB1 is I think one of the most if not the most widely expressed receptor in the brain it's everywhere so it's really important um and I think as as kind of you had alluded to previously uh it didn't it doesn't exist in the you know this didn't evolve in humans in the hopes that one day humans would find Cannabis this is just although cannabis users everywhere use that argument um I know people love to leverage U things if it's a plant it's you know it's natural and safe and there's obviously issues we'll talk about with that um but but I mean really this is just biological redundancy I mean you know nature only has so many ways to create something and so there's going to be things that end up overlapping in the way that they function and so the receptor that's in the brain and throughout the body the CB1 and there is also a CB2 receptor it's not really expressed in the brain it's in some of the immune cells in the brain and maybe maybe some limited distribution in um actual brain cell neurons where where in the body is it it's mostly immune cells so you'll see CB2 is mostly on like macroasia or other kind of immune cells cells that gobble up debris yeah and that basically you know regulate inflammatory processes and so the main role of CB2 seems to be much more about like regulating inflammation um so that's kind of a separate role that can certainly impact the brain in different ways but uh when we talk about the effects on the central nervous system and the brain and behavior we're talking almost entirely about CB1 and so both the CB1 and CB2 receptors like I said don't exist because nature was like humans are going to find Cannabis they'll this will all work together now so there are molecules our body producers which we call endoc canabo um and they are kind of funny little molecules because they don't really behave like certainly in the brain they don't behave like a normal neurotransmitter so I mean I assume most people who listen to your podcast are relatively Adept with the basic idea of how neurons work so you have Neuron a let's call it the Press synaptic neuron because you have that gap between the two cells where they communicate called the synapse so Neuron a releases a transmitter and it can be something that excites the neighboring cell neuron b or it can inhibit it um and so the way that we always kind of talk about neurotransmission in the brain is Neuron a releases a chemical that crosses the synapse acts on neuron B and it can either you know Jack that neuron's activity up or it can scale it down and that affects you know brainwide patterns of activity uh and we call that anterograde because it moves from neuron a to neuron B which is kind of the general flow of things um and how we usually think about it so endoc canabo are kind of this you know little bit of an oddity in the sense that they could do the reverse and so endoc canab are actually made in neuron B on the post synaptic side and then they go backwards and act on Neuron a to regulate how much transmitter is released and so in many ways this is like I kind of liken it to a thermostat model for the most part certainly if we're talking about something like excitability so if Neuron a is dumping out something that excites neuron B like glutamate which is an excitatory neurotransmitter as neuron b gets too excited it's going to start releasing endoc canabo to go back and Neuron a to stop driving it so so sort of a homeostatic scale and trying to maintain a middle range yeah I mean at the end of the day no matter how you discuss it and what system you discuss it I think the majority of people in the canabo field would agree that the primary physiological role of endoc canabo is to maintain homeostasis that's what they do they keep everything in its happy place let's say so like and that's probably why the CB1 receptor is so widely distributed is that neurons can excite or inhibit each other um that is raise or reduce the amount of electrical activity in the let's say nearby neuron cuz you talking about retrograde signaling but um ultimately you don't want runaway excitation that looks like epilepsy exactly and you don't want runaway inhibition because that looks like um suppression of ability to think move Etc exactly so you want to keep things in the in where they should be and so you want neurons to get excited but you want them you don't want them to get ere excited so endoc canabo in kind of a very prototypical sense act as this circuit breaker essentially where they go back and gate how much is coming in and they do this by through various mechanisms essentially turning off the electrical activity of that prestic neurons so that it stops releasing neurotransmitter um they can also regulate though inhibitory neurotransmitter release as well and this is usually done through a little bit more of a complex process where it's driven by excitation but then it regulates the inhibitory pathway so inhibiting the inhibitor leads to more excitation exactly I usually liken it to basically taking the brakes off of a car while you're going down kind of thing like you're you know you use your braking system to keep things in check but if you want to go faster you take the foot off the brakes and you let things accelerate and so this can be really important for things like forms of synaptic plasticity or or neuroplasticity let's say where you want synaptic strengthening to happen so like under a learning event or something you want that synapse to really hardwire better and so having endoc canabo kind of turn off the inhibitory component is one of the mechanisms to facilitate that but at the same time if you want to have a bit more adaptive flexibility endoc canabo can weaken that synapse at the same time by acting right at the excitatory terminal itself and so their ability to kind of play with the relative activity of a circuit is really dependent on which neuron they're acting on and so they can regulate excitation or inhibition differentially and I mean CB1 receptors are found on virtually every single kind of neuron in the brain um except one and I think you'll find this interesting because it's dopamine uh and and doine neurons are basically the only neurons in the brain that don't really at least as far as we've been able to characterize to date Express cannaboid receptors interesting uh if I may um earlier you mentioned one of the potential psychoactive effects of uh Canabis is Euphoria does that mean that the Euphoria associated with cannabis use is independent of dopamine and is more reliant on something like perhaps the opioid receptor system or the serotonergic receptor system yeah I wouldn't say that cannaboids don't affect dopamine because um what we understand in the ventral tegmental area which is kind of the hot spot of dopamine neurons or at least the ones that are involved in motivation and stuff um those neurons are are regulated by a lot of inhibitory neurons that dump out inhibitory transmitter and keep those neurons kind of quiet or so there's an opportunity for indirect reg exctly so what you have is those neurons that regulate the dopamine neurons are very rich in cannaboid receptors this is actually kind of similar to how mu opioid receptors work for things like morphine or heroin um and essentially what the cannaboid receptors will do is when they're activated they'll turn off that inhibitory control and that allows dopamine neurons to kind of uh move into a state where they're more prone to go into burst firing and have big dumps of dopamine whether or not that relates to you know the positive affect or the Euphoria I don't think anyone has cleanly demonstrated that I mean obviously dop mean's very complicated in terms of its relation to end points and whether it's reward or motivation um but canabo definitely do have an influence on dopamine transmission they just don't tend to do it directly and I think that's this very bizarre and interesting component of canabo signaling is why the brain would have evolved in a way to allow every other neurotransmitter system to be actively and directly regulated by endoc canabo but doemer is kind of spared from this so I don't know no one I mean obviously you can always just theoretically guess as to why someone do that I don't know what the reason for it would be but it is something that has kind of uh intrigued a lot of people because every other system in the brain is so tightly controlled to some degree by cannaboids and then this one circuit is kind of free of it so um but yeah so the main role of endoc canabo is really to to regulate plasticity of homeostasis allow flexibility of circuits to either Goose up their activity or or ramp it down if they need to depending on the environment depending on the experience of the organism so there's a lot of kind of roles that endoc canabo play in that domain but even within the endoc canabo um I mean there's there's two primary endoc canabo and again this is one of the weird things about how endoc canabo work because if you talk about things like serotonin or dopamine you have a single molecule that gets released in the typical anterograde way and it diversifies at the level of the receptor so serotonin has like I don't know like 15 receptors or 20 or something no uh dopamine has at least five uh and so the different actions that serotonin or dopamine will have is all driven by the diversification of The receptors it's one molecule whereas cannabinoids are the reverse not only do they work backwards across the synapse and work in this retrograde fashion but really you have one receptor that is regulated by two molecules so the diversification happens more at the level of the molecule than at the receptor which is again very unique and the two molecules that we know are kind of the Bonafide endocannabinoids there could be more um they're called anandamide which um is actually kind of a funny name because it comes from the Sanskrit word Anand for Bliss and so Rafi mulam who was in Israel when he discovered the molecule you know 30 odd years ago um wanted it to reflect inner Bliss and so he named it anandamide so it's like inner Bliss with an amide bond is kind of the joke he had for it and so he discovered um an emide and decided to call it Bliss because he had familiarity with cannabis or because he he took an emide as a as a direct experience and because it takes a lot for a scientist to discover a molecule but then for a scientist to discover a molecule and then name it Bliss for a particular reason you have to speculate that they they had some familiarity with with the m was also the guy who who isolated and discovered THC so I mean he has a very he's kind of the grandfather of whole cannaboid field so he has a landmark paper from 1964 which ironically um and this is one of these weird pop culture things I don't know if this is true that paper was published on April 20th 1964 and so the joke is is this where 420 came from because the original like birth date of the first THC paper was 420 1964 well now that that now that um potential myth is definitely going to propagate um but yeah so he he he'd been in the field for a while and so he had studied cannabis on that side and then in 1990 his lab isolated an andite has being the first molecule that activated the receptor endogenously and so um it was kind of uh yeah I think it was a little tongue and cheek that he named it the way he did a few years later the second molecule which is just called tonal glycerol or what we call 2ag that was discovered kind of in tandom both Again by Mulan but also by a Japanese group um and so we understand these two molec don't do the same thing like they are a bit different so the way anandamide binds the receptor is it's what we would call a high Affinity but low efficacy um Agonist or molecule at least and what I mean by that is very low levels of anandamide are required to actually bind to the receptor but once it binds its ability to stimulate a biological response in that neuron is kind of caps out pretty fast so it doesn't have like a sledgehammer effect whereas 2 a seems to require a bit more more concentration in the synapse to be able to bind to the receptor so it has a lower affinity for the receptor but once it binds to the receptor it's like pretty heavy duty so it evokes a very robust um intracellular signaling response and so why we have two endoc canabo we're not totally sure some of us have theories I'm of the camp that I think they may play somewhat differential roles either based on the synapse or the circuit that they're working in or this idea that maybe anandamide might be more of aonic molecule and what I mean by that is we'll say it's like a stage Setter so like an emide might just be kind of made by neurons on an ongoing basis and just released and its job may be to kind of keep the steady state of a brain circuit in a desired range so that under resting conditions it's not too active or too quiet your thermostat analogy is perfectly so in that context it kind of is like just the thermostat of the house whereas 2ag is like let's say the pinch hitter who gets brought in to do the heavy lifting and so 2 AG during a situation like let's say something like even like a seizure as an extreme example where you have a huge amount of neural activity those neurons that are getting heavily activated during you know massive amounts of neural activity start dumping out huge amounts of 2ag and that acts as the okay we really need to turn off this circuit very quickly in this situation and in most of these forms of like synaptic plasticity like I was saying earlier where you need to either strengthen or weaken a synapse in response to a change in the environment or in response to an experience or something that's going on most of that is driven by 2ag signaling and so um you know all these forms of like turning things up or down in an in a kind of rapid and ond demand manner that's mostly 2 AG so most people who study like neurophysiology and like record activity in neurons and look at endoc canabo they're almost entirely talking about 2ag when they play with stuff um so yeah that's kind of one of the ways we do it we say that anandamide may be more tonic and 2ag might be more phasic and like brought online when needed but doesn't do a lot there is some evidence that 2ag may also have a role to regulate some circuits under kind of resting conditions as well and there certainly are some situations where anandamide might get brought into play um to affect plasticity but as kind of like an umbrella idea of how we look at it that's often how we divide those two up so we kind of have these two molecules the end of the day do the same thing they're regulating neurotransmitter release um through retrograde signal but what stimulation brings them online or what drives their activity May differentiate and we don't really understand all the details behind that outside of the fact that we very clearly know 2ag is activity dependent so as that neuron becomes more active it's going to make 2ag to regulate its inputs um so yeah you have this very complex system and it's really widely distributed in you know it's everywhere cannaboid receptors and the endoc cannaboid molecules are in the cortex they're in the hypothalamus they're in the strum the hippocampus the cerebellum all over the except the one area where it's really interesting actually um where you don't really see much receptor is in brain stem populations that regulate um you know kind of unconscious cardiac and respiratory function so this is one of the things that really differentiates cannabis from opiates because a lot of the signaling mechanisms between opioid receptors and cannaboid receptors are quite similar but um as it's been well established people can overdose and fatally and die from opiates relatively easily and the way that that tends to happen is uh when you activate the receptors in the kind of cardiorespiratory parts of the brain stem it depresses neural activity so as the person loses Consciousness um they also unconsciously will stop regulating their own heart and breathing and they can it can be a fatal response because cannabinoid receptors don't really exist in those regions you don't get the same kind of impact in terms of suppressing heart rate um and breathing function and so that's I mean you know there's always the saying like there's never been an account of someone actually dying from a cannabis overdose or a THC overdose I mean certainly people can do stupid things while they're intoxicated that result in their death but in the same manner that someone can die from consuming too much opiates that doesn't seem to be physically possible with cannabinoids as far as we've seen so far um and a lot of that is just because of the localization like for some reason it's just not the receptors in that part of the brain so very interesting um a lot of uh kind of afficianado questions about the receptor biology I'll just um spare everyone the details by just um highlighting something that you already said far more eloquently than I will which is I think it is fascinating that this whole system has both a tonic like a steady release capability and uh a phasic you know so the ability to spike forgive the p p the neuroscientists will know what I'm talking about to spike more activity of the system superimposed on that tonic activity because this is something that you see in the dopamine system this is something that you see in essentially every neuromodulator neurotransmitter system um but it seems that the endocannabinoid system has accomplished this quite a bit differently so very interesting um uh unique system in in a number of ways that raise a number of key questions so yeah if you go back to the munchies question you had um so if we tie into that one of the so there's a few ways I mean cannaboids and feeding are a really interesting thing because Proto like if you ask people like kind of the prototypical responses to consuming cannabis most people would usually say Munchies is one of the things that pops up pretty regularly and so you know the cannabinoid receptors are very um they are expressed in these feeding circuits in the hypothalamus um and you know there's a lot of complex circuitry there that can regulate food seeking behavior and yeah we just had an episode with Zack knight from hhmi and UCSF where he talked about like the agrp neurons different neurons of the hypothalamus we can link to that in the show note captions um uh nowadays a rich understanding of the neurons that stimulate food seeking craving and and and so we know that like cannaboids they regulate again those inhibitory inputs around agrp neurons for example and so one thing they can do is disinhibit those agrp neurons so they become more active and that can drive food-seeking Behavior so that's certainly one mechanism of it but there's also a huge reward component to this um in terms of the munchies and so we know that like you can also just dump an anide for example this is you know Steve mer and Kent be did this work years ago where they just put an anide into the nucleus of incumbents and that can also stimulate palatable food intake so you also have this ability to integrate with the reward circuitry um and then there was also this fascinating paper from a Japanese group in PN I think about 12 years ago and what they found was they would um give a rodent a canabo and then they would stimulate different taste bud populations and then they would look at the gustatory cortical response to stimulating the populations and what they found is under the influence of a canabo if you stimulated sweet taste buds you got an enhanced response in the gustatory cortex but not if you did salty bitter or sour or I don't know if they did do mommy in that one but it was very explicit to sweet tasting and so you have this kind of ability to like jack up the way the brain is processing sweet tasting Foods you have this engagement of the reward circuitry and then you also have this ability to regulate agrp neurons as well as the Palm C neurons there's kind of both sides to that in the in the aru nucleus um to regulate multiple components of feeding but a big question is like my lab has become kind of interested in this as well because we have a a component of my lab that studies feeding behavior and one of my posts has been doing these projects for years now trying to understand almost like at a behavioral mechanism level what the munchies are and what she's been looking at is we kind of started thinking about the idea that you know what is it that because it's not just food seeking and it's not just you know like just want to consume something there's there's a maintenance of eating and so we know from humans and animals you can satiate them you can make someone full and then get them high on cannabis and they'll reinitiate eating so that's an interesting thing in of itself because that means you're disrupting either the ability of the brain to detect satiety or you're messing with a process we call reward devaluation and so reward evaluation is like you know if you haven't eaten for a day and you see like a picture of a pizza someone brings a pizza in front of you it just looks delicious that First Slice tastes amazing it's salty it's fatty it's delicious you eat five of those slices it feels greasy and nasty and so that process of how you perceive the food and its reward salience degrades as you eat and as your brain basically shifts into a thing of we don't need to consume calories and food anymore we're okay we're full now um and so we've done a series of experiments in the lab where You' get the animals and either satiated in advance where they have already devalued the food and under a normal State they won't eat it anymore they won't work to get access to it um and you get them high on like a cannabis extract we have these Vape chambers that are like um I don't know how else to describe it outside of like a little hot box it's probably the best way to this CU it's essentially a kind of a a locked airtight box that the rack goes in and it gets like Vapor Puffs and it fills up and then they inhale this and then it clears out and they get another puff and then it fills up and we do this for like 15 minutes and we've tit traded all this to get exactly blood levels of THC that you would achieve in someone who's you know consuming cannabis through smoking um and so we get them to that point and then give them access to food and they will yeah go Gang Busters they eat food doesn't matter what you give them you give them plain Chow they go to town you give them fatty you give them sweet they love it all but you pre satiate them and they get them stoned they will reinitiate eating again and you make them work for it where they have to like lever press um and you get them stoned and they will go to town on that and they will work and proof that even under the influence of cannabis um animals will work hard yeah they for food I don't know about other stuff but for food they certainly will I mean and at least weird it's in C Mo have done this at Hopkins as well they've shown similarly using what we call Progressive ratio which is a essentially a thing where it's like the first time you press a you immediately get a sugar next time you got to hit it twice to get a pellet then you have to hit it four times to get one yeah then you got to hit it 16 and then and it kind of scales exponentially up um I mean we've had this one female we kind of joke about in the lab this one female rat and you get her high and she'll do like 300 lever presses to get one sugar Pelt like she really wants it um so you can really kind of goose up their motivation to eat and so there's clearly a rewarding aspect of this because they're motivated to engage enough in working to get access to the food but you can also um do another way of testing this question which is you comp paare a food with um something that will make the animal feel nauseous like lithium chloride this is kind of the way that you would test uh condition taste diversion so you give them access to a food and then you give them something that makes them feel nauseous and the animals will avoid that food and so um that's another way to kind of devalue a food is by pairing it with a nauseant so the animal no longer likes it so again same situation you can get the animal stoned and it will re-engage in eating that food that it had devalued through being paired with a nause and so through either satiety or making it um kind of a a negative Associated flavor because the animal got nauseous before you can kind of override these Effects by giving THC and so that could be a complex process that either involves changes in the reward circuitry this could be something that's like from the orbital frontal cortex which is a very important part of the brain that scales reward and kind of assesses how much someone wants to work or an organism wants to work to achieve a reward at the end so we haven't figured out the circuitry of this and where exactly it's acting but I would say a lot of the stuff that you know we and others have done kind of supports this idea that a lot of what the munchies is is this ability to kind of almost lock in the reward value of food so that it doesn't Decay despite satiety despite eating over time it just keeps it highly Salient so that they want to work for it still um and then similarly we've also we and others have also done work to show it can block satiety signals so we know endoc canabo at least um are capable of overriding leptin so leptin is an anorectic molecule comes out from the fat and usually we release it when we've eaten a lot and it's one of these things that tells our brain stop eating you know it works through again uh populations in the arcu nucleus and changes the way those neurons function to drive food seeking behavior um and we and others have shown previously that that you know if you elevate endocannabinoid you can override that and actually one of the mechanisms by which leptin seems to suppress feeding is actually by turning on the the metabolism of endoc canabo so that their levels Decline and so as you lose that endoc canabo function the animal is less interested in eating and so you can prevent these anorectic effects of leptin by like goosing up endoc canabo activity as many of you know I've been taking ag1 for more than 10 years now so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast to be clear I don't take ag1 because they're a sponsor rather they are a sponsor because I take ag1 in fact I take ag1 once and often twice every single day and I've done that since starting way back in 2012 there is so much conflicting information out there nowadays about what proper nutrition is but here's what there seems to be a general consensus on whether you're an omnivore a carnivore a vegetarian or a vegan I think it's generally agreed that you should get most of your food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources which allows you to eat enough but not overeat get plenty of vitamins and minerals probiotics and micronutrients that we all need for physical and mental health now I personally am an omnivore and I strive to get most of my food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources but the reason I still take ag1 once and often twice every day is that it ensures I get all of those vitamins minerals probiotics Etc but it also has adaptogens to help me cope with stress it's basically a nutritional insurance policy meant to augment not replace quality food so by drinking a serving of ag1 in the morning and again in the afternoon or evening I cover all of my foundational nutritional needs and I like so many other people that take ag1 report feeling much better in a number of important ways such as energy levels digestion sleep and more so while many supplements out there are really directed towards obtaining one specific outcome ag1 is foundational nutrition designed to support all aspects of well-being related to mental health and physical health if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink ag1 / huberman to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs with your order plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman you you're talking about increasing endoc canabo activity um and we've said all this in the context of cannabis so maybe we could talk a little bit about how the components in cannabis THC mainly but also CBD um impact these receptors the CB1 and let's just leave CB2 out for the moment because it sounds like it's more of an immune system thing um but just to make it very clear um is there a way to increase the activity of endoc canabo with without ingesting THC yes I mean they dynamically change all the time so but you're I'm talking about um you're talking about experimentally or recreationally adjusting their levels but how does one do that um without using THC so okay few things there we'll take a step back so THC itself isn't going to um it does its thing by acting directly on the cannaboid receptor not so it sort of mimics the anandamide and and 2 AG yeah so THC going back to kind of the pharmacology of this so THC if you look at how it interacts with the receptor um it's not it's not a heavy duty molecule so I mean this was kind of one of the things that came up before as well is this idea that th use a sledgehammer and it overrides endoc canabo by the way um Matt's referring to the fact that I said that in a previous solo episode about this um and there I was nesting it in the concentrations of THC that can be found in high THC cannabis yeah um so essentially what I was saying is that at very high THC concentrations the amount maybe not The Binding Affinity but the amount of THC that is available to the CB1 receptors is going to exceed what's normally found in terms of the amount of anandamide that can bind to CB1 receptors because what you're talking about is a superphysiological condition it's I mean you don't really actually need much THC in the brain to produce psychoactivity like it's it's a little bit of a mystery to be honest exactly how it works I mean I think the main way that most people in the cannaboid theory field would look at this is that THC is not like a very strong Agonist I mean even if you look at its ability to trigger an intracellular response it's much lower than 2 AG it's actually more like an anide so you said an anide is high Affinity low efficacy so THC is the same THD is actually only a partial Agonist it's not even a full Agonist at CB1 but it is high Affinity it's high Affinity so it has the ability so but the tricky thing with that is it can out compete 2 a but because it's a lower efficacy Agonist than 2 AG in that sense it's almost blocking the effects not um amplifying them blocking the effects of 2ag but does it block the effects of anandamide um it you know to THD and anandamide I would kind of the way I would visualize it is because they seem to have relatively similar affinities and efficacies of the receptor they might let's say dance around so it would be somewhat interchangeable the difference there is and this I think is the big point about what THC does versus endoc canabo because we know now through the pharmaceutical development of drugs that can boost anandamide levels which exist we have Inhibitors that prevent their metabolism we can Elevate them there's no intoxication and no psychoactivity associated with elevating anandamide that's a very interesting point that we should highlight so there are drugs that now exist that can block the breakdown of anandamide make more available presumably by disrupting some enzymatic breakdown exactly and therefore lead to more binding of the now elevated levels of an anandamide that are available to CB1 and you see no psychoactive effect no psychoactive people are not aware that they yeah you can do no one can guess yeah no one can guess what is it used for um well I mean it was developed the first molecule really was developed by fizer to look at if it could work on pain um the first trial that was done did not work it was like um kind of strange osteoarthritic knee pain trial that was like even in that trial the positive control of nioxin barely worked but because the fa inhibitor which is uh take a step back FS the enzyme that chews up anandamide so the drug that is developed inhibits that enzyme so you prevent the enzymatic breakdown of anandamide so we just call them fa Inhibitors um so this drug will boost anandamide levels quite high and in animal research showed some efficacy in modulating pain and so they put it a trial and it didn't work against the positive control of nxen which is like an ends say just like Advil basically a leave yeah essentially yeah so um and that drug didn't work that great to begin with so it was maybe some issues with the trial but it essentially killed the development of the drug from that point on because everyone's like oh it's not going to work so it kind of sheld for a while um a colleague of mine Marcus hilig and leam Mayo uh Leah's now a colleague of mine in Calgary but at the time she was a postto with Marcus in Sweden and they were able to get access to this molecule right before covid essentially um and they did a a trial in just healthy controls with it which again this is kind of jumping the gun and so of other stuff I'll talk about so I'll tether back to that but what we did what they did was they dosed people for 10 days on this drug and then we looked at stress and fear because this is something that I study this is something that they were interested in um and we did find that boosting an anomid with this drug over 10 days uh was sufficiently cap capable of dampening stressinduced autonomic responses so like looking at heart rate or skin conductance I think skin conductance was the measure we did there but it's a proxy for like adrenaline release um so it blunted that and it blunted subjective feelings of stress as well so people had lower levels of saying they actually felt stressed um and it kind of helped remove this like conditioned fear memory that we had they had trained people to do and so I worked with them on kind of doing the biochemistry of this to make sure the drug was working properly um but it was very interesting because we did see in that situation where elevating anandamide produced kind of like a reduction in stress perception a reduction in stress physiology responses and kind of um help kind of reduce fear and so that is kind of an interesting outcome because it it tracks with some of the stuff we know about cannabis and I'm sure we'll talk about some of the PTSD stuff and anxiety later but um so that's kind of one of the things the drug has not really been used that widely yet it's still it's one of the frustrations I have is um a scientist who does a lot of translational work and with clinical Partners like Leah uh is that getting access to these molecules is not easy when they're not kind of wide they're not like out in the market so you can just go and get them you really have to try and get access from the drug companies to be able to do trials with them and so we are in the mid them trying to do that um we did just complete a trial that LE and Marcus ran that I worked with them on as well that was on PTSD um and so there are various potential indications for this I mean Johnson and Johnson developed one as well and they looked at it in social anxiety disorder they had some moderate efficacy in their trial so I'd say the jury's still out on exactly what we're going to do with these but um they have some potential I think in certain clinical settings we just have to figure that out exactly but I think going back to where we started this from they're not psychoactive and so I mean when fizer first made the drug they were actually initially concerned that it wasn't getting in the brain because no one could tell they were on the drug I mean this was the Wild West at this point no one had any idea what end cannaboids were actually going to do people were basing it on what we knew about THC so the Assumption was people would have psychoactivity but they didn't um fiser then actually had to do they did a sleep study to show that it did have some effects on sleep cycle um the same way THC does and then they also did like a an invivo pet binding study to show that they could displace um a radioactive molecule that would bind to the enzyme in the brain seems like a lot of gymnastics to basically confirm what they already knew which is that even greatly elevating the Anand by blocking this entic breakdown of an endide leads to at least from what I'm understanding vastly different subjective experience than ingesting or smoking THC which brings us back to THC so what's it doing and cannabis like you know um so I think it seems that this this thing that we call cannabis and THC are overlapping with the endogenous effects of anandamide but here you're not talking about endogenous normal levels you're talking about pH logically greatly increasing anandamide no psychoactive effect no Euphoria no Munchies you know Etc then people smoke or take an edible of THC or cannabis and you get a vastly different set of effects so maybe we could talk about uh THC and the CB1 receptor and since we're here we might as well um talk about CBD and and the I think you're going to tell us the lack of interaction with CB1 receptor right um and what is cannabis doing at the level of these receptors because um it makes me wonder whether or not these receptors are the whole story or whether or not cannabis is you know as you mentioned you know 70 plus uh active molecules in there tpin and a bunch of other things that may modify their action that this thing we call cannabis has many more actions than just mimicking the endogenous cannaboid system yeah I mean I think I would say the main way that we think about this is the difference between endoc canabo and THC is endoc can abono are going to be released in a very specific spatial and temporal manner so they evolve to do that yeah so there's going to be and I think like it's very clear that like anandamide for example is not active at every synapse that has CB1 and so when we boost anandamide signaling by inhibiting its metabolism all we're doing is amplifying anandamide signaling at the synapses it already exists whereas THC when you consume it orally or inhalation wise and it gets into your blood and into your brain um it's just blanket activation you're just carpet bombing the whole system indiscriminately and so you're introducing the Lian the thing that binds the receptor this is Far and Away different than say like the actions of amphetamines which are disrupting the normal biology in a way that's giving you an amplification of an endogenous mechanism yes right um if that was all just nerd speak for those listening it's one in the context of amphetamines what you're doing is you're taking an endogenous system a naturally occurring system and you're greatly amplifying the amount of dopamine the amount of norepinephrine that's available with what we're discussing today the endoc canabo system seems to be producing a set of effects that might overlap with the THC effects but THC is doing a bunch of other things it's and that's because THC and we'll talk about CBD but at least THC is acting as the Lian it's in some sense we don't want to say replacing but it's masking the effects of an andmine I think the problem is when you just blanket activate all the CB1 receptors in the brain indiscriminately like you do when you consume cannabis with THC the resulting effect is the intoxicating State and it's probably because there's a lot of CB1 receptors in the cortex and those are going to be differentially regulated at different times by endoc canabo whereas when THC hits them all of them are going to get affected at once and if you think of the way that I had described how cannaboid receptors work by essentially I mean in its simplest form what cannaboid receptors do is they change the way that two neurons talk to each other um and so so you're changing all the networks simultaneously yeah so if you hit a whole bunch of networks simultaneously you're just going to change the way that information processing and perception occurs and I think as a consequence of that that's what produces the intoxicating State not that THC is like a you know a super duper version of an endoc canabo or that it's boosting endoc canabidol as opposed to a system that's very finely tuned to do very specific things at very specific times that's very helpful so the analogy that I was considering using coming in here like the difference between endogenous testosterone or estrogen versus pharmacologic uh testosterone or estrogen given as a therapy doesn't app is very different because that's that's an that's a levels issue this is a levels and an extent issue yeah this is a lot more to do with just yeah the nature of how it hits everything because like so for example if we talk about feeding we know uh it's been established at this point that for example if an organism doesn't eat for like a day so you f Ed um at that point in those feeding circuits in your brain like the aru area where these arrp neurons and stuff are you'll start seeing elevations in endoc canabo so endoc canabo levels start kind of going up and up um following kind of fasting periods and part of this is because they're trying to engage that feeding circuitry now and they're Shifting the activity of those neurons to promote food-seeking Behavior because an organism is basically like energy detecting its periphery and saying oh you know we might be burning through our energy Reser reserves we should probably eat more and so there are obviously a few mechanisms that do this npy is another one and uh gin and things like that so there's a lot of redundancy in these systems but endoc can aboid are just one of the molecules that seem to fine-tune like the feeding circuitry and so in states of fasting endoc cannaboids go up explicitly in that circuit and there's some evidence they also go up in like the nucleus accumbens and affect some of the reward circuitry so they're probably driving food seeking behavior and enhancing the rewarding aspects of food at the same time and so that's like a natural IND ogous mechanism to regulate feeding B based on nutritional State THC on the other hand you know it hits the brain yes some of it's going to be the intoxication but in tandem you're going to hit the CB1 receptors that are in those feeding circuits as well and the consequence of that is going to be I mean the way I kind of analogize it to people is I say it's almost like tricking the brain into thinking that you've been fasting because you're now activating receptors that are normally activated following kind of a fasting State and as a consequence of that it pushes someone or an organism or human or whatever into a state of food seeking Behavior because now food also has high reward value and they're kind of the way their food circuitry is responding in the brain at least seems to be similar to what would happen if they' been fasted and the thought is that's why when people you know when someone gets Stone they're not like going eat lettuce they want high calorie food they tend to like things that are high carb high fat that that combo seems to be what people like when they're intoxicated with cannabis and that comes with a lot of calories and the point of that would be trying to replenish lost energy stores and so this at least is the kind of the theory that I have about what it is that it's doing is you know and I think you can make this analogy for multiple different things you know if we talk about pain or stress we can say similar kinds of things are going on is that endoc canabo normally do one thing but when THC hits the brain it's still activating these circuits in addition to everything else it hits so you still drive that response that the endoc canabo system normally physiologically controls but you're almost like tricking the brain into thinking you're in that State now and so then you then yeah you go into food seeking Behavior mode super interesting well I have to imagine that there are many people who use cannabis not to stimulate appetite but for other reasons they either like the Euphoria or to adjust their anxiety um what are some other known mechanisms by which um cannabis can change people's psychology um let me focus in on one particular uh aspect of subjective experience which is Focus do you think that some people use cannabis because it allows them to focus better um and I rais this specifically because I think that in the past uh cannabis has had a bit of a reputation for making people Spacey you use the word stoned I'm kind of out of it and yet I've heard of some potential uses for enhancing Focus I mean honestly this is a bit of a tricky one to speak to because I just don't think there's good evidence for it um either way or I just don't I mean as far as I'm aware it hasn't been studied in a lot of depth I mean there's some things you know a lot of the stuff that's been done is usually more like kind of acute memory tasks like a working memory or recall or something like this as opposed to explicitly studying Focus anecdotally there is certainly a lot of people that report that so my understanding is that people who use cannabis have poorer certain forms of memory but not necessarily poorer memory across the board is that correct I don't think I would say that I don't think you could lump anything in that context I mean I would say the only thing can say confidently that I would be comfortable saying is that acutely while someone's intoxicated on cannabis there is definitely shortterm effects on memory processing so people tend to negative effects or enhancements or decrements I would say most of it has to do with recall or consolidation so there does seem to be some I mean certainly the animal evidence is very compelling there but again we can talk to what some of the limitations of that are um but in humans I would say most of the work that's been done would suggest there is some short-term memory deficits that are present during the intoxicated State I have not seen very much compelling evidence of long-term effects that emerge like when someone's not intoxicated but they use cannabis somewhat regularly I don't think there's anything compelling for that um and even in that case like Carrie Cutler who's at Washington State she's done a lot of this stuff looking at cognitive processing and different kinds of memory tasks in users while they're stoned often and within a person either they have adapted to using it as much as as they do or they've developed some form of tolerance to it but even in regular users the impact on memory processing is usually not super robust um it's still there I mean I think the effects that are more often seen in kind of um let's say smaller laboratory studies where they're using people who've used cannabis but aren't regular users might be a little bit more profound because they may not be you know used to that state let's say I mean there's certainly something we call State dependent learning which I'm sure you're familiar with um and this is something people I mean I remember learning about this in undergrad through alcohol so like you know someone first time they get drunk tries doing something they're very bad at the task but if every time they're drunk they do that task they become better at doing it under the influence and so then all of a sudden you know they regularly do this task while they're drunk and someone tests them and they don't look like they're impaired at all because they've done it so much and so I should just say this point has often been confused by undergraduates and others to assume that just because one can gain proficiency at a task while under the influence of a substance does not mean that you have higher proficiency at that particular task while under the influence in fact the way it was presented to me when I was an undergraduate um uh was incorrect the I remember the lecturer said and later corrected himself um I won't call him out here because that's unfair he's not here to defend himself but it happens in lectures um that people who studied Dr drunk would be better off coming to the exam drunk that is not true from what I understand I don't think better off no but they would probably score better than someone who had never studied drunk and came to the test drunk correct just because they had had some State dependent learning uh and so I think when we're talking about if you're talking about someone who's a chronic cannabis user they're going to have done a lot of cognitive tasks while they're under the influence and so if you acutely test them the impairment you might see in them is probably less than you would see in someone who's relatively naive or much less experienced user that being said I think it's relatively well established most people would agree that uh acutely intoxication with cannabis doesn't paare memory processes in some capacity what explicit form of memory I don't think I could speak too comfortably just because I'm not a memory researcher and I know there's very specific things of like episodic and declarative and whatnot so um I can't say that but I'd say it's kind of generally and I mean again you can replicate this in animals where if you train them on a task while they're under the influence they don't seem to have consolidated information as well um but again I don't really think there's super compelling evidence that there's kind of long-term permanent effects on cognitive function in individuals who use cannabis at least I've never seen anything that's replicable or reliable or or stable in anyway so yeah thanks for clarifying that and also thank you for clarifying the um discrepancy between endogenous cannabinoid binding and affinity for CB1 versus THC I really appreciate that because that's something that you and I discuss in light of the solo episode I did about cannabis and uh now you've made it clear uh that THC does not bind with much higher Affinity it's just as you I think your words were it assuming high THC levels in the Cannabis carpet Bombs all the networks as opposed to binding more uh with higher Affinity at particular receptors yeah I mean I don't actually even think it matters if it's high THC in the Cannabis I think like some people can get very intoxicated off of very very low doses of cannabis is that right I mean you look at Edibles for example I mean this may be an interesting segue into root of administration stuff because I think it's an important point that a lot of people don't recognize is the difference between someone inhaling cannabis versus someone orally consuming cannabis is like a different game yeah let's talk about this because I know that um you and I um arrived at different understanding of the fastest typical and slowest um routes of Entry um for uh THC into the system um into to get to arrive at the brain right um the numbers I gave in the previous discussion about this were related to how quickly inhaled smoke moves from the lungs to the bloodstream and crosses the bloodb brain barrier which is very fast right which is very fast um I don't know if it's different than nicotine I'm not sure again I don't know if I would say that but yeah I it's very fast okay so so there may be um it may be that it is the same as nicotine it may be that it's faster but um importantly it it can be fast but but typically how fast is the onset set of the subjective experience of okay um you know somebody takes a hit off a joint or a bong hit and they start to experience the subjective effects of euphoria Etc how quickly after two to five minutes I would say fast I mean so this is one of the things with cannabis is and again this will kind of go into this idea of the change in potency of the plant as well um it's pretty quick and people titrate cannabis pretty well like at least people who've used it a couple times and understand this I've seen some people not tit tra it very well depending again on how you so again this can vary so like you know cannabis from the 70s was like I don't know 5% THC let's say it was pretty low uh and nowadays cannabis is a lot of the commercial stuff is between 20 and 30 although whether those are super accurate numbers not entirely clear but so it's gone up a fair amount um yeah I mean that's a that's not just a fair amount that's I mean if we if we were talking about alol concent Spirit of vodka yeah basically you're talking about a beer or a wine to a spirit and there are aquavit varieties so to speak um by the way I think when people um hear me talk about any kind of uh drug that can be used recreationally or alcohol I think some people assume that you know I'm um ult Ultra anti all these things I'm actually not right I'm not an alcoholic so I can um drink a little bit and I have I just don't tend to and um we could discuss cannabis in a different venue um but the uh the point here is we're not trying to frame this as what people should or shouldn't do we're just trying to inform people I want to be very very clear about that so um but when I hear about you know um 20 to 30% concentration as opposed to you know 5% concentration that's significant so I would say this is what's super interesting and this was something that came out of the way that cannabis research is done certainly in the states and Canada's been quite behind on this even with legalization we haven't caught up um but they have been doing lab-based studies of cannabis you know mag Haney Harriet dwit there's cluster of researchers around the country Zea Cooper at UCLA here have all done this where you know you have people come into the lab you give them cannabis you measure subjective outcomes or neuroimaging outcomes or whatnot so to do this you can't use commercial cannabis and pre even like the state-by-state legalizations hasn't Chang this so if you are doing cannabis research in humans and you're funded by like naida which is National Institute of drug abuse um you get all your cannabis sourced I mean this may be changing I think there are some shifts that are happening but historically in all the literature that we would talk about that's kind of pre the last couple years all that cannabis came from one source which was I believe a farm in like Mississippi that was essentially funded by naida to produce cannabis lucky farm and well the Cannabis that came out of it though and this is one of the reasons a lot of the clinical stuff people have kind of been like oh I don't know how representative this is cuz it reflects cannabis that I would say is more from like the 70s or ' 80s so it would be like 5 to 9% kind of THC cannabis now when you put someone in a lab setting and you get them to smoke to level of intoxication people would take you know whatever eight toes let's say something like that um and that's where they would stop and so you know a lot of the labs that use this have always been like our people who are regular canabus users are getting high off of it it's not as potent as the stuff that's on the street but they're clearly getting intoxicated from it and it's giving us reliable data um so when they started looking at the blood levels of THC that you achieve it was around 100 nanograms per male of THC give or take that seemed to be where it was now because of the way that the you can legally study Canada Cannabis in the States you couldn't just go down to a dispensary and buy the products that everyone on the street are using which is kind of like it's been a weird thing for a lot of people because they're like why wouldn't you study what we're using but because of the legal aspects of this you could bring those products into the lab they'd never been standardized no one knew exactly what was in them pesticides all this other stuff that could influence it so from a safety perspective it was always like no you use the the Cannabis that sourced from naida um so there's a group in Colorado Kent Hutchinson and Angela Bryan and cinnamon Bidwell have kind of I would say became very creative actually to figure out how to study cannabis that's being used I call it in the wild like in kind of an ecological sense setting let's say and so they created what was called the canavan and the canavan was a way to study people using products on the street but not have them come into a laboratory setting where it was complicated and so what they would do is they would drive the canavan to someone's house but they'd be parked on the street and someone would use the product whatever it was on in their own property and their own time and then come into the canavan to have blood taken to look at what their THD levels are and to undergo testing so it was actually like I think this was a a great advance in the field because it was this huge Innovative approach that allowed us to start comparing what we've learned from Lab based settings with this kind of old school weed that was coming from naida with what is being used on the street I love this I mean as somebody whose lab has done a in laboratory vr-based experiment on human anxiety and fear and then compared that to a you know a clinical study that we did sort of in Mass where people were at home doing specific respiration practices you have many more subjects but of course they're reporting back their effects um well you can monitor them by device you know look at HRV look at heart rate Etc um I think having the ability to compare and contrast in laboratory and X laboratory data is extremely valuable and I mean my view is you need both because you need the in laboratory for the control because we all need control over various things but you also need the ecological validity to see how it shakes out and make sure it looks the same yeah for people that have never been to a laboratory or tried to find a parking spot at a university that's an anxiety inducing experience of itself a novel experience while someone's intoxicated with cannabis can also create a very different altered state I wouldn't want to be stoned in a laboratory I'll tell you that much I feel like there's pluses and minuses to both sides but I think the data together is very compelling and that's where we get a lot of advance in the field so what uh Kent Angela and cinnamon did with the canavan was kind of create this situation that allowed this research to occur and what we found fascinating I remember talking to me Haney about this because all the people in her lab setes tended to always hit around 100 nanograms per male using this relatively lower potency cannabis when Kenton and Angela and cinnamon started studying this in the people and taking blood despite the fact that these people are now using cannabis that's 20 to 30% their blood levels are the same so they're still coming in around 100 nanograms per male because people are really good at self titrating now where Things Fall Apart is with the concentrates so then you go into things like dabs or these like high potency products that are now like cuz cannabis itself realistically from what I understand from the botanist that I've talked to you can't really grow a plant that's going to exceed more than 25 to 30% THC just by sheer biology so it Taps out there that's about as high as it's going to go concentrates can go up to like 90 98% so you can get really really is there tinctures distillates like yeah various just in oilbased forms that are very very high potency products those are incredibly challenging to tight trade like they cannot be tight traded because the sheer volume of THC that hits the system even from a single hit is so overwhelming and so when the Colorado group looked at those their blood levels were closer to 200 300 nanograms per Mill so with cannabis planned there does seem to be this ability for people to relatively self- titrate and then my buddy Ryan mcglaughlin who's also at Washington State he was really one of the ones that pioneered these Vape Chambers and rats and created this really cool model of uh self-administration which was like a very important thing to actually establish because it was very challenging to get rodents to self- administer cannabis if you're doing like an IV approach or something else because they found it quite aversive but when you let rodents actually tighter their ability to get Vape hits they will like work for this the same way they well other reinforcing drugs so it was a really important finding that you could do this um and what Ryan found was he actually did one study where he gave them access to a low potency product a we'll call it me medium and then a high and what you ended up if you look at the data is the one the rats like the best was the medium potency product interesting and if you gave them the high potency product they would actually take less Vape hits off that than they would off the lower ones and again all their blood levels tended to Cluster in the same range because they titrated like even at the at the rodent level they're able to titrate because of the lag between inhalation and feeling the effects is only on the order of a couple of minutes people can titrate better I mean not just people it seems like the rodents can as well so the higher potency cannabis where it becomes a problem is if someone's highly inexperienced and they consume a whole bunch of it without allowing that time lag to occur um and then they can probably exceed the levels they intended to and consume too much and then have a probably an adverse response so does that mean that cannabis use rarely leads to tolerance of cannabis use I wouldn't say that there's definitely some degree of Tolerance the Toler is definitely more prominent when people start using concentrates there's no question about that I mean we can talk about the concentrates I guess separately after because I would say if we're talking about a harm reduction thing that's that's more where we need to focus a lot more is this idea of these high potency products yeah sounds like those are are precarious that somebody who thinks they have a lot of experience or God forbid no experience takes a concentrate and is what no longer um getting the euphoric experience that they anticipated but instead are getting what a a paranoid anxiety I think I think you're you're far more likely to go overboard and have an adverse response but also I think the problem is if you're using a product of that potency and that much THC floods your system on a regular basis the biological changes from that are going to be very different then what you get if again you're titrating your your THC from um inhaling plant at roughly the same level whether that's a 10% 5% or 25% people generally tend to scale this is a very important point and I'm going to highlight it because I think it's um it's very very very important although you're making it very clearly already which is these days we hear a lot about the quote unquote problems with high THC containing cannabis as relative to what was um present in the 70s and 80s and presumably 90s as well yeah I'm a uh I was a teen in the 90s so maybe I'm alluding to to something there um but what you're saying is that unless one is talking about concentrates that people and animals in the laboratory will self-regulate the amount of intake in a way that leads to approximately the same blood levels of THC so it may not be as much of a concern at least in light of the concerns about oh these levels are so high that um people are overwhelming their system with THC basically um this could be stated in real world terms as people are taking fewer tokes um of the higher concentration stuff that allow them to match blood levels that were present in the person taking many more toes in the 70s so the joke I always make to people is they say go watch a chich and Chong movie from the late '70s look at the size of the joints that they smoke in movies like that relative to what you would see someone on the street consuming nowadays like it's just I mean so the advantage that existed from a titration perspective was with like 70s weed there's a large window to titrate so people could you know take small amounts and not overc consume let's say because there was a much lower concentration of THC in the plant so they're able to consume assume you know even if they were doing it relatively fast because of how little THC was coming into the system it was a little easier to scale that so there certainly is the propensity for people to overc consume higher potency cannabis even independent of concentrates if they're not allowing that titration to occur also if you have someone who is just exquisitely sensitive to THC for various reasons um even one or two toes could be too much for them because at the higher potency they they may not have that ability to titrate quite as well and so a lot of people um anecdotally you talk to people about cannabis and a lot of people who don't like cannabis have say oh you know I've tried the new stuff's too strong and if there's someone who's kind of more in our age range who grew up in an earlier decade where things were a bit different they may be referencing their own experience from when they were younger and what they were able to consume and now they try doing the same and it hits them like a sledgehammer so it's a little different in that sense but you know and I don't think it's to say it's like not concerning that cannabis is as high as THC as it is I just think if I'm going to put my efforts into kind of like you know Public Health perspectives of this I would be digging my feet in much more about the access to concentrates and the issues and the potential harms that are going to come with them than I would about the Cannabis flower myself that's just my opinion based on what I see with the concerns and what we've seen from the data in humans and I think the the real world e ecological studies that the Colorado group have done have been very informative in this sense because yeah if the if the blood levels of THD you achieve from concentrates are double to Triple of what you get even from higher potency flour that's a concern like I think that's where problems start arising because then you're going to start seeing a lot higher degree of Tolerance I mean there used to be more of a debate in the field as to whether people develop tolerance because one of the things with cannabis that I do find very interesting is with a lot of chronic users they don't escalate the way you would see with cocaine or alcohol where there's very profound tolerance that develops and so I mean people definitely see this in cocaine where people can become um tolerant almost immediately and so dosing starts scaling up very fast yeah usually it's the life destruction that that thwarts their Progressive increase seriously or the cost I mean the sheer cost another form of life life life life deterioration yeah that is required to be able to maintain that but with cannabis um it seems like there is some degree of Tolerance that people exhibit it varies from person to person but you know as like I've you know as me has said to me many times you know the guys that come in her studies these are very heavy users and then you know they will use this relatively low potency product and still get high off of it and so it's not to say that there's no tolerance it's just it's not as profound as I think we see with a lot of other drugs and this is probably due to the fact of just like you know we definitely see like if we look at some PET Imaging studies chronic cannabis users do have some down sorry I have to interrupt pet positron emission tomography not pets um don't although people get their pets high and we don't know what those uh pets think about that not good don't get dogs if also High one can assume a lot of things about what your pet is thinking while also High um sort of half joke there um but yes positron emission tomography is one way to assess their binding of um drugs within the brain as well as activity of endogenous uh neurotransmitters neuromodulators such as um anandamide uh dopamine Etc yeah so so a typical pet study in a human looking at this they'd give a molecule that's radi labeled that will bind a CB1 receptor you can scan them uh and then look at the emission rates of the radiation to get an idea of the density of receptors that are in the brain chronic cannabis users tend to have less um what that means in terms of the functional outcome is unclear I mean there could be some I think there's a there's a lot of evidence that there's some degree of a reservoir of CB1 receptors that you know there might be a lot more receptors there than we necessarily always need or are always using let's say so we might be downregulating component of this but maybe not all of the ones that are required to produce the psychoactive effects because there's clearly some maintenance of the system that allows someone to continue to get intoxicated uh and so with cannabis users we do see that but you do see much more profound tolerance with people using High potency extracts and concentrates and things like this and again Sheely I think as a response to the biology of hitting the system that heavily with that much you know THD as it comes in because they can't titrate it the same way it makes sense yeah these concentrates sound like something to at least pay attention to as a potential problem I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor insid tracker insid tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals now I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term Health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test now major problem with a lot of blood tests out there is that you get information back about metabolic factors and hormones and lipids and so forth but you don't know what to do with that information with inside tracker they make it very easy to know what to do with those numbers because they have a personalized platform that allows you to see the levels of those metabolic factors lipids hormones Etc and they give you specific directives that you can follow related to nutrition behavioral modification supplementation and more that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you if you'd like to try insid tracker you can go to insid tracker.com huberman to get 10% off their new membership program insid tracker membership offer significantly reduced prices on insid tracker comprehensive blood panels again that's insid tracker.com huberman to get 10% off along the lines of use tolerance Etc is cannabis addictive Andor habit forming and I think it's probably important that we distinguish between the two I I may have made this joke in the previous episode on I did on cannabis um I've known a lot of chronic cannabis users um and none of them admit to being addicted um it's not my place to uh challenge them on that but they do seem in my experience this is not an experiment U but in my experience more irritable when they don't have access to what they call their quote unquote medicine yeah so um you know that speaks to a dependence or something um but then we need to be careful because in the classic sense addiction you know I've defined and others in the field of addiction um have defined it as a you know Progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure such that you know it causes um disruption to other areas of life your life becomes maladaptive yeah I mean I'm not going to play with the definition of addiction I feel like I have enough friends in the addiction space and it's a very contentious field so I mean I will try and not use that word although I understand talking to the general public that's kind of you know if you say someone has a use disorder versus an addiction that may not make sense to them right but that's the nomenclature now that people are using alcohol use disorder cannabis use disorder this is what you start to see now instead of saying being addicted to pot or being addicted to alcohol and so I mean an addiction is obviously a very complex thing that again I don't want to touch it simply because it's not my space um but that being said there's no question that people can develop cannabis us disorder I mean it's it's definitely a thing so if we say is cannabis addictive in kind of a you know normal lay speak I would say yes it is addictive what does that look like how does that relate to other substances of abuse I mean certainly um the outcomes associated with it are going to be slightly different than someone something like opiates or alcohol because that's a totally different Beast because you have uh fatality potential there's a whole bunch of other health consequences but if we look at how we would Define a disorder the criteria for someone hitting cannabis use disorder is really no different than how someone would hit alcohol use disorder or opiate use disorder in the sense that it can consume their life it can shift the way that they behave they can put themselves in Risky positions to get access to a drug it can consume their time and their energy to have it like you said if they don't have access to it it can trigger you know an assembly of behaviors that looks like irritability anger frustration things like that so I mean the numbers in terms of the conversion rate of use to developing use disorder I would say are not entirely clear the kind of old numbers that used to get tossed around where like 9 to 11% of people that would start initiating cannabis use would probably transition to develop use disorder the more modern numbers I would say you know if we're looking at people who are already using weekly we're talking probably closer to 30% like so it's a much higher I mean when you're using that frequently then the rates of people who would qualify as having cannabis use disorder probably go higher so so I just want to make sure I'm understanding clearly for people that use cannabis weekly the propensity for developing cannabis use disorder is on the order of about 30% i' say in in that neighborhood they would probably qualify as meeting criteria for a cannabis use disorder because weekly doesn't seem like that often no I mean it's it depends again on how you vary this like and I've had a lot of conversations with the public and I think depending on someone's experience in their own or in their own inner circles life with cannabis the way they would view it is very differently cuz I think a lot of people you know again regardless of anyone's opinion of alcohol if someone told you they had a glass of wine with dinner every night I don't think people would say you have an alcohol use disorder I think that's not uncom I don't think they would uh similarly if someone had a Brandy at the end of the night or like you know a night cap to go to bed and they did that on a nightly basis I don't think anyone would say that they have a use disorder and I think with cannabis there are a lot of people that kind of fall into that bracket that would use it you know even daily but relatively infrequently and kind of as an end of the day thing I think some of them certainly would fall under the criteria of cannabis use disorders because if you start looking and say well you know if you travel to like Egypt are you going to go put yourself at risk of going to jail to get access to cannabis because you can't function without it if you do then yeah you know you've got cannabis use disorder you know are you going to burn relationships are you going to start failing at meeting responsibilities or getting things done in time because you're preoccupied with cannabis yes you're GNA hit the criteria for cannabis use disorder if it's someone who's kind of just intermittently using it the same way that a lot of people casually use alcohol I would say a lot of them probably wouldn't hit criteria but I think to someone who has never had cannabis in their Inner Circle or in their life they look at it like a drug like cocaine whereas they're like wow if you were using cocaine on a daily basis we'd be super concerned about you and so I think that's this like it's just as you go I mean cannabis is in this really weird transitionary period I would say of going from elicit to not just because of the changes in the legal regulatory framework I mean in Canada now we're like five and a half years into legalization so in many ways I would say the transition has happened where a lot of people view cannabis very similarly to alcohol whereas you go to some states and the perspective is still very different and certainly if you're still in one of the states where there's no legal access people still look at cannabis the same way they look at a lot of other um illicit drugs like cocaine or amphetamines or things it's interesting I I was under the impression this has really changed over the last you know 5 10 years you know growing up it was I mean I think there are still people in jail now because of uh possession and sale of of cannabis and then of course there are stores not far from here where people are selling can ironic yeah sadly it's a very I mean obviously a big push for legalization is not um endorsement of the safety of cannabis it's more the the harms associated with prohibition outweigh the harms associated with legalization I think that's generally the public health perspective that's certainly what motivated it in Canada um and there was a you know some attempts let's say at restorative justice in terms of removing criminal records and things may not have been entirely as successful as people had hoped it would be but it certainly has changed things I mean we can look at our federal data and see that arrest rates related to cannabis are obviously very low compared to what they were um that obviously becomes very important because there are clearly minoritized communities they get they get hit more with this than other communities and so the kind of Perpetual disenfranchisement that happens with a Prohibition model in communities that are already suffering from various other things that affect them um just potentiates all that so I can understand the legal framework behind why there would be a move to a legalization state over a Prohibition state which again a lot of people confuse legality with safety which is a weird I mean alcohol is the perfect example of this I mean you look at the scale of harms on a public health level I mean alcohol Stacks at the top it across the board in terms of harms to the individual harms to society it's it's a lot cannabis has harms there's no question on that um it just would fall lower than alcohol um but the way that people view it a lot of people are like alcohol is legal therefore it's safe and it's not something to judge people on cannabis at least historically was illegal and in some states still is so people view it very differently and I think it's an interesting thing um because I feel like you know despite the fact that some people hate the government and hate the way that it regulates their life there's this weird passive belief that like if the government dictates something is legal that means it's safe is the legalization of cannabis leading to more cannabis users or fewer um Andor um incidents of people going into the emergency room uh suffering from Cannabis induced psychosis something that I hope we can also talk about yeah um so it depends on how you break this down so what we've seen in Canada is i' would say there's like demographic differences uh proportionately when we look at the biggest change in use it's actually elderly communities it's like 55 plus um especially women over 55 tend to be more cannabis use more cannabis use now granted their Baseline was quite low pre- legalization so if you look at a fold change it looks like a very dramatic increase raw numbers it's probably not that that high but I mean it was like 1 to 2% or something before and now it's gone up to like 8% or something so it's a four-fold increase kind of thing so we do see the magnitude of that seems to be the biggest in terms of where the uses come from definitely the young adult population like 20 24 that group has definitely seen um increase use as well does it split male female historically cannabis tended to be more male biased i' would say the the gender separation there has kind of narrowed quite a bit um where you do see a lot more like more females used and historically had um there is a little bit of difference females tend to prefer Edibles over males so um males tend to like inhalation over females so like roots of administration vary a little bit based on um who someone is but um yeah interestingly we don't have a lot of actual indication that teenagers have used more um so like you know you look at 14 to 18 year olds that has been now granted our Baseline going in was pretty high as is down here in the states I mean Canada and the states both hover you look at like grade 12ers and you know it's somewhere between 35 and 40% of them have used cannabis now I mean you even have some that are like probably around 5% are probably almost daily users so like you do have a pretty high Baseline to begin with in that group but that has remained relatively unchanged uh if anything some of the states when they legalize saw slight dips in in teenage use of cannabis so I think like that's obviously an important demographic to have ra this was one of the concerns with legalization was you'd Pro you know increase access teenagers would get it from their parents and whatnot or had just you know other siblings and stuff and so you get this big boost in consumption um but we don't seem to see that in terms of raw numbers of teenagers who are using cannabis so so that's good ER visits um so we did a an interesting role out in Canada we legalized flower for a year before Edibles came online so we have kind of a before and after um once Edibles became available there was a notable increase in unintentional pediatric consumption that resulted in ER visits because kids would you know a lot of these look like gummies and candies people are buying them not you know storing them properly kids would find them and eat them and like become very intoxicated I I want to make mention of something along those lines um I actually know somebody whose child um accidentally a at THC containing gummies um fortunately the child was fine um but they're actually pretty serious ramifications for this um the parents actually are quite susceptible to uh legal action if this happens right so this is something to like really keep in mind I mean there are a million other um Health rated reasons why this is probably I don't know if that's true in Canada the same way but I in the states yeah like if if if your kid gets into a of THC containing gummies and ends up in the emergency room there will also be uh most likely there'll be a police visit to that emergency room also and it doesn't bode well for the parents so it's it's a very serious issue and again this was highlighted to me by someone that I know who um didn't anticipate any of this but you know kids are good at finding candy yeah and if that candy contains THC and they end up in the emergency room serious issues nonetheless if your kid is acting strange because you think they ingested THC containing anything take them to the emergency room anyway well so this was one of the things that also in was influenced by legalization is in Canada like some of the increase in the ER visits was because of the shift in legalization and the change in policy and so you know if your kid ends up drunk underage it's not the same ramifications as if your kid used an illegal substance underage and so people are when some once cannabis was legal people were more likely to actually go into the ER because the consequences were different I see and so sure some of this is availability and some of it is just like okay I'm not as concerned now about something happening because I've taken my kid in like I'm not going to have my kid taken away from me or whatnot so so there is I mean both those factors I think have contributed to it but we definitely see the majority at least of kids ending up in the ER is almost all based on Edibles that's I I can't imagine a situation where that would happen from inhalation it would be very rare if it would it's almost always Edibles cuz kids find them so as long as we're talking about Edibles is there any fundamental difference between um the dose regulation that you talked about earlier of inhalants versus uh excuse me versus Edibles um meaning earlier you said that even if it's high THC containing uh cannabis people will self-regulate to achieve the same approximately the same blood concentrations but with Edibles I imagine you eat half a cookie a quarter of a cookie and um you can end up in a vastly different place than you expected so Edibles so this throw is a wrench in the whole system and I'll say this in the context of blood levels and then what that means for my regulatory capacity as well because of the impact this has so Edibles are very low doses for the most part um I mean in Canada at least you cannot buy a pack of Edibles and I think this law might be changing at least when they first brought it in no pack could have more than 10 milligrams of THC in it so that either meant one 10 Mig gummy or two five Mig gummies or four 2.5 Mig gummies you get it um so you couldn't in one package have more than 10 milligrams of THC now for people who are I would say relatively naive to cannabis or THC even people who might use it intermittently most people will feel five milligrams like they'll feel some form of intoxication you know some will even feel it at 2.5 migs most people will feel it at five virtually everyone will feel it at 10 now if you look at the blood levels these produce we're now talking blood levels of 2 to 5 nanograms per Mill so folds lower than what you get from inhalation before you said 100 yeah so this is dramatically lower and so also the time course of this is fundamentally different so an uh oral consumption you know you're looking at a minimum of 30 to 45 minutes for onset of intoxication for some people up to 90 minutes after they've eaten now this is also the reason why the majority of Adverse Events that happen with cannabis happen with Edibles because people don't understand this and so they eat a cookie or a gummy they wait half an hour like I'm not feeling anything I clearly didn't take enough and then they'll double their dose and then like 15 minutes later it starts hitting them and then like once it fully kicks in it's just like a steamroller like I've heard of this happening yeah I mean there was that New York I think it was Moren Dow or someone went down to Colorado and she ate like an insane amount of THC in a chocolate bar or something like 50 or 100 milligrams and spent like the weekend on the floor of a hotel room being like this was the most aversive experience why would anyone do this um and again I think people just don't understand the dosing around this and so this is one of the things we're trying to do in Canada and I was create this idea of standardized dosing units so that people have an like we with alcohol we always say one beer is the equivalent to one glass of wine versus you know like a shot of tequila or something so that there's some uh comparator that people understand how many drinks are you know you know say two drinks you do you're going to hit legal limit kind of thing it seems very important yeah and so this is very difficult to do with cannabis because the dosing with oral consumption is just a different ball game it is with inhalation but what happens with oral consumption is like it kind of very slowly leaks out of the GI tra and it also goes through first P metabolism in the liver and what happens there is you get a metabolite called 11 hydroxy THC which seems to be a bit more potent than THC is in terms of its ability to activate the receptor so its efficacy at least at driving a response through CB1 receptors seems to be higher than what you would get uh with just the parent molecule of THC itself self um and so and it it seems to accumulate a lot more as well so at any given time you know you've got THC kind of leaking out of the gut going through the liver making 11 hydroxy and it progressively accumulates in the brain and that's one of the reasons why it takes you know 45 to 90 minutes to kick in but then the high itself also lasts like six hours four to six sometimes eight depending on the person what they've eaten versus inhalation is just this like Spike so you get this very rapid because it goes right through the lungs into the blood goes into the brain but it also clears out and so yeah people will start feeling intoxicated two to 5 minutes they the peak high is like 15 to 30 minutes maybe from consumption and then they'll start to come back down and you will still see some indications of intoxication that can go on for 3 to four hours but the bulk of the intoxication from inhalation is done by two hours for the most part as long as we're on the topic of time course um you know based on what I was able to find um I believed and tell me if I was wrong that cannabis can stay in one system for as long as 80 Days the reason I brought this up yeah um previously was there are a number of people who have used cannabis are going to take a drug test and want to know how fast it can clear from their system um but based on conversations we had offline um sounds like that 80 Days might be a bit too long I mean you could still fail a drug test at 8s I would say I feel like I think I think the way it was worded more it was like that you made it sound like that was the standard I wouldn't say that was the standard at all I would say for the majority of people 30 days probably after that they would not pass or they would be able to pass a drug test but that so abstinence for 30 days yeah after abstaining for 30 days and it's going to be highly variable depending on how much you consume I mean if you're talking about someone who's used it once I I don't imagine it would be in your system that long that'd be surprising the thing is THC is a lipophilic mod fat so it's fat soble it likes the stor it doesn't like the blood the blood is aquous and watery it likes fat so it goes into the brain it goes into the fat and it kind of resides there and it can essentially kind of slowly leak back as it as you know THC concentrations in the blood would reduce THC that's in the fat will start kind of leaking back into the blood still so detectably you will still have THC for quite some time I mean some of this again it's going to be dependent on how much cannabis someone's used how much THC they've consumed how long it's been in their system for I would have thought this was going to be somewhat reflective of people's body fat content although talking to colleagues who do this they say not always um but we do know you know certain things like exercise for example anything that's going to trigger adrenaline because adrenaline is lipolytic so adrenaline causes fat to metabolize and release stuff that's inside it so there are plenty of cases I've heard from people where they were testing themselves and were negative and then went for a run or went to the gym and then tested positive or lost weight yeah or they've lost weight and anything that's going to cause the the lipolysis to occur so that it releases that THC um you can certainly all of a sudden test positive again when someone had tested negative previously just because of the fact that there still is some in the fat and so this is where something like and this is what I mean by standardization of regulatory issues become very complicated was remember right when legalization happened in Canada all these kind of chemists were like talking to me about they're going to create like a breathalyzer for cannabis because this way they'll be able to do roadside detection the same way they could do with alcohol and I kept trying to say to them I'm like the rate limiting step here is not the science of detection thresholds it's the biology of how the body processes cannabis and you're never going to get a test that works because you can take someone who has eaten an edible and is profoundly intoxicated at and they will have possibly under 5 nanog per Mill of THC in their blood but you were talking about this metabolite that can come from the uh Edibles that doesn't come from inhalants that can have a much more get B from inhalent but not nearly as much as you get from Edibles um so it's a different it's sort of a different situation altogether it is but it's also the timeline because of the fact that with inhalation it's like a a a bolus that hits you at once so you get a high blood level um with Edibles it's like the time course so I mean it's going to be like 5 nanog per Mill let's say but it would be like that for a long time whereas the 100 nanogram per Mill from smoking is like for 20 minutes and then it starts dropping so but the problem is with the way that um you detect it is you can take someone who's a chronic cannabis user and is completely sober and hasn't consumed in a day or two and their basil levels of THC in their blood may be higher than someone who's profoundly Intoxicated by an edible just by the sheer nature of the fact that it would reside in their fat tissue or their it would leak back into the blood and so you have this issue where you let's say your cut off was 5 nanograms per Mill which is for some of the stuff detection thresholds would hover around that area so you could have someone who's dead sober that tests positive and someone who's profoundly intoxicated who test negative so it's like what's the value in this it's it's not telling us anything well I guess it sounds like the drug tests either have to be revised or discarded and it also sounds like if somebody is going to take a drug test for cannabis and they have used cannabis in any form in uh the previous 90 days let's say uh going for a run right before your test is going to liberate uh whatever um THC resides in the fat stores potentially yeah so I mean it it is it is a lot of people are writing this down along the lines of what's known and not known I'm curious uh what is known and not known about the effects of cannabis THC in particular on hormones um I've seen studies that site increases in testosterone from cannabis use I've seen studies that site increases in estrogen from cannabis use and they argue for increased aromatization of testosterone into estrogen as the mechanism I've also seen studies that say the exact opposite yeah so um is there any Global takeaway message yet or is it just highly variable or depends too much on dose and individual age Etc that we just really can't see I would say it's you it's there's nothing that's super clean cut um I mean I know in the previous podcast you talked about a prolactin thing right well there there's um and this is where I think it's important that people understand um that you know on this podcast we cover science and studies but we also pull from common experience that people want explained if we can um and one of the experiences that is talked about a lot in certain um let's just say online communities is the experience of people who had no pre-existing gynocomastia male breast development yeah will smoke does do we call it marijuana these days I got we'll go with cannabis I actually got I got um someone I got a lot of comments that said marijuana is an inappropriate term okay smoke well go back to that I I that was new to me I didn't know so forgive me if I I mean I understand it but yeah a lot of people don't know that so um will'll smoke cannabis and experience gynecomastia or in females so males and females both have breast tissue but in males it's typically um uh it's not hypertrophied um but they'll smoke cannabis and get a um gomia growth of the male breast tissue um that's sometimes reversible sometimes not presumably through the aromatization of testosterone into estrogen which then acts on the tissue makes it grow as well as um reports of breast tissue tenderness after cannabis use in in females so that was sort of the origin of that discussion around does cannabis impact aromatization of testosterone into estrogen and you can find a little bit of evidence for that but you can also find evidence to the contrary in the scientific literature I'm just curious your thoughts it's super mixed so I mean you talk about something like prolactin for example that is another one that's obviously involved in in this whole Cascade stuff generally I would say the the bulk of the literature actually says that cannabis would suppress prolactin not increase it that's the majority of the liter because dopamine is one of the main ways that prolactin is suppressed they're kind of in a seesaw they work in somewhat seesaw fashion um and it probably I mean the rodent work would suggest it's through dopamine that's turning off prolactin because you can reverse some of these Effects by playing with so I don't doubt that's the mechanism but so typically I would say more often I mean there's studies with inhalation and IV that have generally found reduced uh prolactin and in chronic canvas users they find somewhat lower resting states of prolactin that's been found in one study that came out of Yale interes um testosterone gets a little bit more complicated because there are a lot of studies that find a to begin with cannabis users may have higher levels of testosterone just at rest now whether that's a pre-existing any reason to think that would be the case I don't know I yeah I mean that being said a lot of the stuff now granted this was mostly done in the 70s um and like this is from my previous life because my undergrad and graduate supervisor he was a neur endocrinologist focused much more on sex hormones and reproductive hormones so we've written a few reviews so I've done like reviews on this area and I know the literature somewhat um it's mixed but generally from the70s studies what they would often see is that if they um would look serially look at testosterone after someone consumed they would have little dips like that wasn't uncommon for them to find it not every study found it um that being said the kind of range the testosterone stayed in was always the normative range like it was never that it went so low that someone would have classified as being hypogonadal or would lead to something like gyom at least from a testosterone deficiency side in terms of the balance between testosterone and estr um I don't know as much about the aromatization side of it again I'd say it's pretty mixed I mean I don't think the gyne kamasa stuff is I mean certainly people online might be talking about it and there might be some other components to this I've also heard and again this isn't like science this is just the same kind of stuff you see on random internet communities people talking about oh well you know it has plant estrogen so maybe they're subbing in and having estrogenic effects I don't know how valid any of this is yeah it seems a bit I mean they're f estrogens and tons of different plants the sort of attacks on soy and the attacks on uh this I think grew out of the um kind of the soy versus meat communities and plant-based versus carnivore this podcast has always been agnostic with respect to nutrition and is really um if we encourage anything it's that people consume um unprocessed and minimally processed foods um as the bulk of their food intake there seems to be enough dat on that but whether or not people choose to be vegan and eat a lot of plants or carnivore and eat just meat you know we've essentially stepped out of that debate because um let's just say it's as futile as um about any other debate you're just never going to it's it's completely circular you end up right back in Twitter yeah and I think that um I mean when it comes to something like this I don't I I've not seen any compelling evidence for it so I can't I certainly wouldn't say that it's a a typical side effect that men would experience is like developing breast tissue in response to Canabis I feel like if that was the case it would be very known in the scientific Community as something that comes out so this seems to be something that um Ur purportedly occurs on a backdrop of elevated androgens meaning in puberty or a backdrop of some other um form of Androgen incre like someone who's on steroid yeah that's not the community I'm referring to it seems that um because transient um gomasa during puberty is actually fairly common um because of there's just so much Androgen being produced in puberty that some gets aromatized and that um the the idea I'm not saying stating this as fact is that it may exacerbate that in any case it sounds like the takeaway from this is that there aren't a lot of conclusive studies about the effects of cannabis on testosterone or estrogen or aromatization in any direction I I don't I mean I'd say like yeah this enough studies that suggest that you might see transient drops in testosterone from Cannabis and it seems to be relatively shortlived um it doesn't seem but again a lot of these studies also find that the basil testosterone is already kind of high to begin with so staying in a normal dynamic range it is again it's homeostatic just like just like the endoc canabo yeah so and that's the thing I mean testosterone fluctuates across the day anyway so there already I mean there's other things that fluctuate it's like cortisol these hormones have Cycles so as long as you're in this normal range there really shouldn't be any kind of like behavioral like in terms of sex drive for testosterone or like physiological like gyom or some change in I mean now there are potentially effects of THC directly on the testes that could affect sperm that could happen independent of changes in testosterone are those positive or negative changes I'm I'm assuming that they the studies you referring to saw um disrupted what they call sperm quality which has to do with motility Etc yeah I mean a lot of the uh kind of invitro stuff definitely would suggest that some of the animal stuff as well the human stuff is definitely a bit mixed I mean but again if anything it would be like yeah could have some effect on sperm so I have like as we say this I'm just um chuckling to myself because anytime this convers ation comes up about a substance and um sperm quality or egg quality I always get a barrage of comments of people telling me how many children they conceived while Under the Influence no one is saying that you're going to be infertile um but you know if people are having challenges of conceiving it might be something to think about I would say that I would agree on that so I would say if someone was asking me this and they were trying to get pregnant and struggling I would say well definitely cut cannabis because some people may be more impacted at by than others so for some some you know various biological reasons that we don't have a biomarker for there may be some men that use cannabis and it has a profound effect on their sperm quality their sperm capacit and so their ability to maintain fertility and for the bulk majority of man i' say that's probably not the case but again if you're someone who is struggling and you use cannabis male or female I would say cut that out and see if that has an effect for you along those lines I saw it kind of a jaw-dropping statistic and I I'm not sure I still believe it um um but you tell me what you know about this um which is that up to 15% of pregnant women in the US have used cannabis during pregnancy that just seems that number just seems too high and yet you know it exists out there yeah it's very I mean I've heard higher numbers lit no I've heard higher numbers than that as well on the low end of this well I mean so I've heard as low as two and I've heard as high is 20 okay two sounds like okay I that I could imagine um but as high as 20 and do we know what the effects on the developing fetus are there's a lot to unpack there so first thing going back to the the the levels that's challenging because again this depends on are you talking about self-report or are you talking about verified blood levels because those have varied so some of the higher numbers actually come from blood levels where they've taken blood samples and found THC but the women have reported not using cannabis and so they're the idea that it's like the self-report numbers tend to come in around two or three my guess is the real number is probably somewhere around 10% but that also is going to vary depending on what you're talking about because there are a proportion of people who are using cannabis and become pregnant and are unaware they're pregnant and are still using cannabis and that would still qualify under the way that it's defined that someone used cannabis while pregnant so the majority I would say the overwhelming majority of people once they learn they're pregnant now that can be all the way up to almost the end of the first trimester typically stop using cannabis that seems to be the norm I would say important point there yeah and I think also the number that carry on through the entire gational period is is going to be a lot less I would guess now the motivations for this quite often are more in the capacity of the kind of anti- nauseant um qualities that cannabis can have for some people and for women struggling with morning sickness now anecdotally I have heard women say you know with the history of things like thalidomide and Other antinauseant Drugs that had profound teratogenic effects on the fetuses women have said that they would rather use cannabis than one of these other compounds because they're less concerned about the impacts of cannabis than they are because of the you know the theide effects that happened and theide effects are um malformation of the limbs and and other uh bodily structures in fetuses it was a absolute tragedy of medicine that um this occurred and even even one um birth but um yeah the reason why thalidomide is now I believe banned as a as a drug for use during pregnancy yeah I I would I actually have no idea but I would imagine um I think it would be one of those hard things to sell given its history especially but so I think there's a reticence of a lot of people to consider using Pharmaceuticals to regulate nausea because they're uncertain of the consequences of it and they feel that cannabis may be safer now that in itself could present some problems um in terms of that thought process now there was also a study that I thought was like some of these things just frustrate you it's where they actually decided to call this was done in Colorado where they called dispensaries and just acted naive and asked what their recommendations were and it was something like 80 to 85% of them were actually recommending that people would use cannabis to manage morning sickness and I thought that was like it's just one of these disappointing things where you're like why are you being so wildly irresponsible to kind of promote these things and this is you're talking about the irresponsible that the dispensaries would say that or irresponsible that the study was carried out that way because it's a little bit of um entament you said it not me could be I mean I I mean you can you can bulk at either side of this I think it's I mean I have a lot of frustration in general with the information that bud tenders put out into the world is that what they're called Bud tenders Bud tenders that's kind of the colloquial term that people will use for someone who sells cannabis at a dispensary we see this in Canada and I've heard this throughout the states as well I personally have been a huge advocate for the fact that I think so you know I worked uh in restaurants and bars and stuff when I was younger and for me to serve alcohol I had to undergo I don't know if you do this in the states in Canada you have to do like a it's like a weekend course essentially called like serving it right or some other terminology where you learn the basics of alcohol harms blah blah blah how to tell if someone's intoxicated when you have to cut them off all these things that you have to do to be able to serve alcohol I I have no idea if this exists in the States but it it was a thing in Canada bartenders uh in the US put in the comments on YouTube do you have to undergo training about alcohol to bartend anything even if it's just like an online quiz but like so I my perspective is because um pre- legalization at least in Canada there was somewhat of I think of a misguided thought that people would leverage their Physicians for knowledge about cannabis and what's become very apparent is that the overwhelming majority of people talk to the people selling them the Cannabis and yet those people selling cannabis don't need to have undergone any form of education and so like this kind of kills me because we've worked very hard to try and create educational platforms that are like agnostic in terms of our position on cannabis that are just based on the science I'm an executive director of an organization called the Canadian Consortium for the investigation of cannabinoids the ccic and it's we've done CME courses for Physicians to try and train them about cannabis because I think it's important that Physicians understand this but I've tried suggesting that I think that anyone selling cannabis should undergo a course like this just so that there's some consensus in the informed level that someone who comes in because a lot of people going to buy cannabis are quite naive about it and they just I mean even when we're talking about dosing what we've talked about with Edibles or smoking or how people consume it like you need to have a reliable source of information at the front line that is able to relay that to people and it it becomes very frustrating to me that that they have become the main source of information that people go and I'm uncertain of what their level of training is you're certainly doing your part to provide the public education about cannabis now so we all appreciate your highly informed and and Broad distribution of this information because this is also an issue with psychedelics which currently don't have legal status in the US this is an ongoing process of whether or not it will right now things are really on the teeter totter with MDMA where we await the decision from the FDA but the early recommendation to um to the FDA was to not approve MDMA as a treatment for PTSD that's as of today in you know mid mid to late June 2024 we'll see what happens but this is also the case for um ketamine uh which is has legal status but many people are accessing ketamine not through a physician but through online sources so what you're speaking to here is is a much larger issue um and uh I absolutely agree with you I mean I think most people are probably not aware except by experience positive or negative in some cases about the differences in blood concentration as it relates to number of tokes versus concentration versus edible I me these are critical themes especially for where we're going to go next which is you know all the discussion about high THC and psychosis yeah yeah exactly so I think that I I I just wish I mean again even if this was just like an online course that wasn't that much but at least had some consensus of information that was the basics about how to you know have conversations and I I mean some of the our our system at least is somewhat provincially regulated so like you know our organization has worked with like the Ontario group that deals with cannabis distribution the Ontario like the OCS which is antario Cannabis stores um and help to create some information pamphlets and stuff again it's not the same as a teaching course but at least it's like these little infographic stuff that kind of like gives people rough breakdowns of things and kind of gives you a little bit of information about dosing and understanding things like especially with something like Edibles how long you should wait just stuff like this like it sounds like the take- home message is uh proceed with caution go you know low and slow I mean that's the yeah the don't don't ingest too much too quickly like really you know if one is going to explore this legally of course um you know take a little bit wait take a little bit wait um because otherwise you're going to get the who was the reporter I think it was Morin D but I right you're gonna I don't know actually when I say that is she still on the floor in a Colorado Hotel she may have recovered reporting from the floor in Colorado um but like it yeah it's it can become very frustrating it's just the kind of lack of understanding that exists in this space and so I think this is one of the reasons why we've really kind of tried to push the public health side of this a lot more and we have I mean there was um the center for addiction of mental health in Canada which does a lot of the organization of these things they did kind of put together what I found to be really useful which again could be leveraged in the states these are all accessible onlines it's called the lower risk cannabis use guidelines they kind of tried to create a framework that is similar to how people have done stuff with alcohol um that just kind of goes through and a lot of it is this low and slow approach but it's like obviously you want no risk you abstain if you're going to use these are the different ways to engage in harm reduction um you know like obviously oral consumption has you you avoid the issue of lung damage that you could get from smoking um but then you know with oral consumption you have to be aware of dosing and timing and all these other considerations but what about vaping um Can people self-regulate their THC concentration in the blood by vaping as well as they can by joint or bong or other form of depend on exactly what you're vaping so in the states I've noticed when people say vaping they almost exclusively refer to some kind of oilbased product that's in a pen so in those situations um that's going to really heavily depend on what the concentration of THC in that product is now the other form of vaping that I think is a little bit more common in Canada maybe is vaping of the plant matter itself and so this is where they have like a vaporizer device that heats the Cannabis to a point that will ENT hit the lift point to vaporize THC in the canid a big bag yeah yeah like a volcano um yeah um but it doesn't create any plant combustion and so there are studies that have been run on that that have shown that you avoid the combustion byproducts so people don't like exhale carbon monoxide or these other things that we know can be damaging um if they're vaping plant matter that was actually somewhat approved as like a medical device pre- legalization when can cannabis in Canada was only under medical authorization um because of the reduced harm associated with vaporizing the plant matter versus smoking it um that is I would say a safe guideline for harm reduction that if you're going to try and avoid you know there's still going to be some issues that happen with vaporization of plant matter but it's not the same as combustion so you avoid like some of the other issues that come out when we're talking about um oil-based Vapor Products or whatever they're in they're usually in some kind of oilbased solution um who knows I mean we don't have the research on this like we just don't know I mean we certainly know like there had been some pretty big errors of like the things that happened in the states like there was that problem where all those people developed um kind of I don't know popcorn lung or that lung inflammation where several people died from vaping products which seemed to be like a byproduct I believe of them adding like vitamin E acetate or something into the because again everyone just assumes it's a nerd but then when it when it combusts through the vaporization process it creates a massive irritant on lung tissue and so that was just you know again in my mind this is a problem with a lack of a federal um regulatory framework because stuff like this happens you you would not see that on a federal landscape because you'd have to go through testing like people it's kind of the Wild West you get down here every state has its own rules people there's not really a lot of like regulation of things well if you go overseas it's even more wild I mean then there's I mean then you have no idea what you're consuming anywhere I would say just because outside I mean again Netherlands is a little bit of a different situation um they're not legal they're decry alized I don't know how well the regulation over there the product is you know we're going to be doing episodes on stem cells and you know you got people flying out of country do stem cell injections people were getting them down in Florida who went blind from the injections of stem cells into the eye in an attempt to save what little vision they already had probably don't want to get me started on that one um I I'm in total agreement with you um by the way I want to make sure that I ask about psychosis and paranoia yeah um I've previously said and I was sort of I wasn't joking but I have um observed um in my history that uh when people started to uh experience some degree of anxiety or paranoia when um smoking cannabis that sometimes the message they would receive back is to take more to just adjust the the subjective experience I think that's a terrible idea um terrible idea baffled that you heard that I have no idea let's say I did more than hear it um see I I've observed it I I cannot even understand that that is the strangest thing I've ever heard but okay yeah well usually the advice of of of people in terms of that was recreational drug taking is um is rarely excellent advice that's that's so I I mean I agree with you on that point for sure that you should not be consuming more if you're having a bad reaction to it because that will just like Grease the wheels going downhill for sure yeah um I also am aware that there are some very high-profile papers that been published in the last really 5 years or so pointing to potential increased risk for psychosis of lasting duration um even after the effects of cannabis have worn off in high THC cannabis users in particular high THC cannabis users that initiate that cannabis use young and this might be preferentially impacting males I I want to make clear that what I just said is not a statement of absolute fact it's my understanding of the conclusions of these papers um there are other conclusions in these papers also but that particular conclusion seems to be important enough that they place it in the abstract and it's reached major press headlines so I guess the simple question which probably doesn't have a simple answer is does THC cause psychosis so yeah there's not a simple answer to that and I think that also is a question over whether you're talking about acute drug induced psychotic episode versus the development of a chronic um psychotic disease like schizophrenia so um the first arm of that is just can people acutely have a psychotic episode to THC or cannabis and the answer to that is yes it's not common I would say in terms of Adverse Events that happen with people consuming cannabis it's on the rarer side um but it definitely can happen so less than 5% of people that oh much less than that I mean certainly I mean it's if something like this was happening at a regular frequency it would be very well known what about anxiety attack yeah anxiet attack is I'd say more of a standard uh indication that someone's kind of gone overboard like that's not dosage overboard or does it carry the same set and setting considerations that um you know psychedelics like psilocybin have uh both so I think there's some contextual component to it there was like I mean back in the 70s when they did more let's say interesting studies there's one where basically they dosed people on THC and then had them undergo oral surgery which seems like in hindsight a very bad idea and I think virtually everyone in that study had a panic attack like so it really potentiated the stress of what they were undergoing and had they been given that same dose in a different setting I'm not sure it would have evoked that kind of response but there is definitely a dose effect to this in terms of like you know the kind of classic lowd do aspects of like of THC or cannabis like that are usually considered more the positive pleasurable responses that are why people use like it reduces anxiety it relaxes blah blah blah um that is more of like a low to normal-ish dose let's say of what someone consumes to produce those responses if they start going upwards though it's not like it's graded it's like a full flip like it's not linear at all it's almost like it goes in the opposite direction so you know someone can use cannabis to reduce anxiety but then cannabis can also trigger anxiety in other people and even in the same person if they consume too much and a lot of this at least we think has to do with the ability of it to regulate both excitatory neurotrans and inhibitory and so for reasons that we don't totally understand there's like way more cannaboid receptors on inhibitory neurons than there is on excitatory neurons but in the early days of creating the genetic lines um gavan Marano and beat Luts over in Europe created um like deletion of CB1 only from excitatory neurons or only from inhibitory neurons okay so to just clarify for people these are um laboratory mice that are genetically modified so that they contain or lack specific receptors on particular neuron type so that researchers can parse the effects of THC on what we're referring to as inhibitory neurons which quiet other neurons versus excitatory neurons which excite other neurons and so forth and in doing so to understand some of the network biology um which is basically impossible to do in a typical Mouse what's called a wild type Mouse um or a human um because when one ingests the drug or when the mouse is given the drug it affects any sight in the brain potentially any site in the brain where the CB1 expressor recept do like a full body deletion of CB1 and you give a mouse THC doesn't respond to it at all not surprisingly that's a comforting experiment you want to see that result yeah exactly so that's how we know CB1 drives all the kind of psychoactive effects of THC so if you delete CB1 off of inhibitory gabin neurons even though that removes like 70% of the neuro of the CB1 receptors in the brain those animals look just like wild they still get like they still exhibit all the classic signs of intoxication in terms of how that would respond to like pain sensitivity or Locomotion or these other like assays we use in mice to tell if they're high if you delete the CB1 only off of excitatory neurons the glutamate neurons then you see um what looks like the full knockout so now the animals don't seem to get high so even though the majority of CB1 receptors seem to be on these inhibitory gabin neurons it's the CB1 on the glutamatergic exy neurons that mediate most of the classic signs of what we would consider intoxication from THC or cannabis but what's interesting is um uh bat worked with the Spanish group 10 12 years ago then they showed they're looking at anxiety that if you delete CB1 only off of excitatory neurons you lose the anti-anxiety angiolytic effects of THC but you still have the you know panicky angiogenic effects of hos if you delete CB1 off of only the inhibit at gaban neurons you still have the lowd do anti-anxiety effect but now you don't have the high do angiogenic panicky effect so what that was suggesting was that for some reason CB1 like THC will initially hit CB1 on kind of glutamatergic neurons and essentially the thought is this will reduce excitatory transmission and probably quiet down circuits and if we're talking about something like the amydala this is probably how it's reducing anxiety whereas as dosing starts to increase and you start to saturate the CB1 on the gabin neurons and turn off inhibition then the network effect is more of an amplification and that seems to result in the development of kind of an angiogenic uh pro- anxiety response that's obviously undesirable why there's this differential shift it's not exactly clear I mean it's probably either due to some of the like biology of exactly where the CB1 receptors sit uh on excitatory or inhibitory neurons relative to all the Machinery that regulates transmitter release I mean bat loots has definitely done some stuff looking at the ability of uh cannaboid receptors to evoke signaling responses in a cell and on glutamate neurons they're much more sensitive than they are in gabin neurons so there's probably a dose threshold so it does look like this kind of you know low dosing what most people are trying to achieve I would assume when they consume cannabis is probably these effects mediated by quieting down excitatory transmission and then the adverse effects when someone consumes too much and they have a negative response that's probably due to the the higher starting to saturate on the inhibitory neurons now we obviously can never test something like that in humans because we can't know but based on what we've seen in animals that's my theory of kind of how this is working and why we see these kind of classic biphasic effects so yeah too much THC not a good thing because then you start maybe disinhibiting things like the amigdala producing these kind of panicky angiogenic like outcomes on that scale though I mean paranoia obviously that's a hard I don't know how you study that in a rodent I mean that's just a strange thing so but I mean that's kind of the precedent of when you start going into the psychosis because obviously paranoia would be a big component of that um someone once asked me a question about you you know have you know what happens in the brain um like Imaging wise when someone's having like a psychotic episode from Cannabis and I was kind of thinking like how would that study get done like probably on accident because somebody takes cannabis is in the scanner and then starts having a psychotic episode but chances are they're going to try and get for those that don't know these I don't want to scare people out of doing MRI or fmri but you know you're typically told to stay extremely still there's sometimes even a bite bar you know like this is a very controlled environment not not an environment that you would want to be in during a psychotic episode no I can't actually even imagine how that would go down so I'm like we this is something I don't think we're ever going to have an answer to because I don't think I don't think you can actually ever test it but in terms of people having this kind of psychotic response it is pretty rare I mean and I say this because I can think of Canada kind of whenever it's happened and someone has actually done something wildly unpredictable because they've had a psychotic response to cannabis it tends to make headlines so it's not it's not common I I could not give you an actual number but it's it's certainly not a frequent thing because we would hear about this a lot more if we did and there's also the issue of polypharmacology which is simply when people take one drug then there's often the tendency to take another drug either because it's available in those conditions or because they threshold to say yes is a little bit lower um do most people who take cannabis and achieve the the High um have a tendency to do other drugs it doesn't seem like a drug that people combine with a lot of other drugs um I wouldn't say part I mean there's certainly cannabis is used in tandem with other drugs alcohol psychedelics at times for sure but that being said um I mean it's I there are is clearly a population of people that use cannabis as their only drug that they use I don't think that's that uncommon um but in the context of the psychosis stuff I would definitely say sure you know if someone mixed it with amphetamine or something you could have a very unpredictable response there but I mean I think the psychotic responses that have been documented are usually purely due to cannabis like it's not it's not necessarily due to some kind of uh drug interaction there there is something about the way that cannabis is changing the way the brain functions in a way that for people who seem to be prone to this they can have a psychotic response I again I don't think it's a very typical thing but talking about what that means in the context of like an actual disorder like a chronic disorder like schizophrenia which is characterized by psychosis I think we're talking about a whole different ball game here and this is an area that is I mean I think it's an important thing to discuss in the context of science because you can't establish causality like in my view it's it's virtually impossible because there's just no way to control all the variables that play into this what we can say definitively is individual who have schizophrenia first of all they use cannabis at a higher rate than the general population that's very clear yeah they definitely use cannabis at a higher rate than the general population there is definitely a relationship between um using cannabis and having the uh initiation of the development of schizophrenia uh and this is where a lot of the statistics that have uh been used to develop the risk assessment essentially like so that you have a greater risk if you know like you were saying if you've used cannabis as a teenager use high potency as a lot of the research has shown though they've done these studies and they say it relates to um a greater risk of schizophrenia essentially this is just a statistical Association that they found that people who use cannabis the conversion into schizophrenia happens at a higher rate and there's more people with schizophrenia who are using cannabis is there a bias towards uh males developing psychosis I know there may be a bias initially toward males in schizophrenia that could confound this so we want to be careful to be honest in all the research I've and all the literature I've read on this I don't ever remember there being clear sex descriptions of the differences of males and females I mean again historically cannabis was more used by males than females so that could lean towards any bias that may be out there in the media the popular um like just in general that people talk about I can't think of any study that I've ever read that explicitly said this was you know male biased per se they usually just report numbers or proportions of people um the the issue is so yes there's this relationship that exists and yes we know that um cannabis can trigger psychotic episodes so if there's an individual who has schizophrenia we know for certain that cannabis can lead to the onset of you know uh increases in positive symptoms like hallucinations and delusions um and a full-blown psychotic episode so I think the first thing to say which is very clear is in my view if someone has schizophrenia cannabis is contraindicated like you shouldn't be using cannabis if you have schizophrenia I think that's a risk across the board what about a first relative who has schizophrenia because there's a strong genetic component to schizophrenia so I was going to say then the next question is um knowing who's going to develop schizophrenia obviously we don't know this and as you say the only real predictive variable that we know of is a first-degree family member that has schizophrenia means that you have a higher risk of developing schizophrenia so again uh same with bipolar I would say if there's bipolar or SCH and a family to me those are the people who should avoid cannabis um just in terms of the likelihood there's a much greater likelihood that they'd have it would relate to the onset of a disease or could accelerate its its presentation in some capacity I think where things get really complicated um in this whole cannabis schizophrenia story is the causality and there is a camp of people who have looked at this literature and definitively believe that cannabis causes schizophrenia um and they attribute a proportion of people who have schizophrenia to only having that schizophrenia because of the fact that they used cannabis um and I think You' had some discussion about this in the last podcast I can't remember exactly the way that you described it yeah I was um looking toward um some of the recent studies in uh Lancet jamama Psychiatry I believe I we can provide links to these again and now more recently there's been a lot of um let's just call it mainstream media coverage of this potential yeah I think is the right way to refer to it potential linkage between um adolescent teen and young adult use of high TC cannabis and Lasting psychosis but um the more I hear you talk about this the more I'm wondering if that idea is being uh Amplified more than than perhaps we ought to let it be Amplified I mean I think this is what happens when you have I mean obviously you're familiar with this in science there's different some things that we can be a little bit more definitive about and then there's some things that we just can't know for certain it's just the way it is because of the way that we gather data and because of the way humans are and this isn't a question I believe we can ask from an animal model perspective in the same capacity um so I don't think anyone would deny at least anyone who's read the literature that there's this relationship between cannabis use especially in adolescence in the development of schizophrenia now my perspective on this is and I'll explain why I have this perspective and how I justify it is to me cannabis is fuel on a fire so if someone is prone to developing schizophrenia adding cannabis into the mix I think will make it kick in faster and harder so um if there is a genetic vulnerability for for um developing schizophrenia or some biological predisposition that's there I would say in that situation cannabis can trigger an initial onset of the first episode and it can make the prognosis of the disease in the long term a lot worse let's say as I recall and I may have this incorrectly but as I recall from my undergraduate years what you just said is also true for military service for people that have a predisposition to develop schizophrenia that active military duty can exacerbate it as well I mean I've never heard that but that would be a stressor and stressors are other ways I mean a lot of you know there situations where uh IND I mean some of it's the age but like you know for example if someone is prone to develop schizophrenia they move away to college even that stressor can be something that brings on an episode but cannabis very specifically like different than any other drugs like alcohol or cigarettes as far as I understand it at least the temporal relationship between cannabis use and the development of of a first episode can be pretty linked um but the arguments that I've always had with people in this area who are very definitive on their end of the spectrum that this is a causal relationship is first of all um we have a few things that like I would leverage as kind of real world evidence that makes this questionable so the first one is like I was saying earlier in the episode I mean we really didn't have cannabis use in the west like as a normal thing as one of the drugs that was part of the repertoire of what people use recreationally until like the 60s so unlike alcohol which has like been there for centuries we have a little bit of a before and after what we can look at the Grateful Dead yeah so um now granted we don't have like really good prevalence data of what schizophrenia was in the era prior I mean even even nowadays our prevalence stat is not perfect but if cannabis as a solitary variable was driving the Genesis of schizophrenia denovo in the absence of any kind of biological predisposition or genetic predisposition I find it very hard to believe that we wouldn't have seen a shift in the prevalence of the disease as cannabis became more mainstream and more widely used and generally schizophrenia rates have remained largely stable people can make arguments about that better care other things that to challenge that argument sure so another modern perspective would be okay well let's look at Canada and the states let's say where we have as I said earlier teenagers in Canada and the states by grade 12 35 to 40% of teenagers have at least used cannabis somewhat sporadically and somewhere around 5% is are probably using almost daily so we have a concentrated group of what would be the high-risk population here that are using at a pretty high rate and then we compare that to somewhere like let's say Norway or Sweden or any of the Scandinavian countries where cannabis is like not a thing certainly not at a recreational level and not in teenagers and I mean the rate use rates there are probably under 5% globally for teenagers like probably closer to two or 3% so you have two countries that have pretty similar social structures and other capacities of things we're both Western countries and yet our schizophrenia rates prevalence wise are relatively comparable and yet in Canada and the states our cannabis use rates in adolescence are wildly Amplified compared to those countries so again if this was causing schizophrenia to develop as a disease out of nowhere how would that not track like how would that not be seen when you just look at individual variances across countries and prevalence rates yeah I I hear your point loud and clear I seem to recall that there is a higher incidence of schizophrenia independent of cannabis use um closer to the polles you know and less so at the equator I don't know if those statistics still hold up but I have no idea yeah interesting for us to look into that because then then it would argue that you know since uh you know we're comparing very Northern locations to less Northern locations that um perhaps cannabis was you know sort of exacerbating you probably use Greece or Italy I mean they going to have cannabis use higher than Scandinavian countries but it's going to be way lower than North America still because it's just what is it about North Americans and cannabis use I have no idea I mean I think it's just part of the culture here it's just evolved totally differently I mean Grateful Dead no I'm not picking on the Grateful Dead I like the Grateful Dead Rick Rubin convinced me to start listening to them again and uh cuz my sister used to listen to them and there're some great songs and they're from Meno Park pal Alto so I've done I've done uh my duty to listen they're some great songs so I'm not picking on them but but I mean like you also have like in Europe though alcohol is also much more normal normalized in general like kids will drink it's not abnormal for kids who teenagers to drink alcohol is just much more of a cultural thing as well and there are just differences I mean it's the same thing you look at like the opioid crisis that we're going through it's sure it's there to some degree in Europe but it's nothing like it is in North America we are just a different Beast for a lot of drug use do you see differences between United States and Canada with respect to either cannabis or opioid use I don't think dramatically I think we're pretty comparable from I mean for cannabis rates I would say they're almost the same I I've not seen sure you might get some Regional differences like we I think Quebec has much lower rates of cannabis houst than some other parts of Canada and you guys probably in some Southern States maybe are a bit different than other states so I don't know about that but again overall at a federal level I think the which is where more of the most of the data Aggregates I would say that they're pretty comparable with each other so they're not they're not wildly different at all and again even if you talk about climate a lot of the US is a lot warmer than Canada and you guys are certainly closer to the Equator than we are so I I I mean we know like you do see higher rates of schizophrenia in urban settings than you do in rural settings and so I me a stressor there's other you also have more like there's just yeah there's a lot of transitory populations that come in and out of cities that you don't see as much in rural communities there's a lot more Mental Health Services there's other variables that can influence that and no one's really I think sused out a mechanism to explain why you see that but um so there are there are things that shift across places but I don't think it has anything to do with the rates of cannabis use and I mean the other thing that became very interesting in this whole debate over the last 15 odd years that people have really been talking about this a lot more is the fact that there's also been several studies now that have done genetics either at the the gws level or just even just looking at um polygenic risk scores and there's at least three papers I can think of off the top of my head that I could put the citations down for for sure after this um that do look at this from an somewhat let's say unbiased perspective where they see you know there's some there's certainly some genetic architecture that relates to people either initiating cannabis use or people developing cannabis use disorder and there's clearly some genetic architecture that relates to risk for schizophrenia uh and what these Studies have found kind of across the three of them was quite similar which was from their analysis the the directionality suggested much more that having genetic risk for schizophrenia predicted cannabis use more so than cannabis use predicted the development of schizophrenia interesting so what that would mean is that there is some underlying biology that might be shared between a biological vulnerability to develop schizophrenia and some factor that relates to people using and or liking and or excessively using cannabis I've spoken to many psychiatrists in an effort to find someone expert in ADHD we've done two episodes on ADHD focusing on everything from behavioral to nutritional but also prescription drug treatments for ADHD and what's interesting is that all of them have relayed the fact that many people not just young people but adults with ADHD will often use not necessarily abuse but will use stimulants like coffee and other forms of stimulants to a high degree and then of course you can say well perhaps the stimulants are causing ADHD but they actually argue for the opposite which is that people are attempting to self-medicate and then it's perhaps no surprise that most not all but most of the medications that are approved for the treatment of ADHD are variants of amphetamine or similar so it it's another case where you know depending on whether or not you look through the lens of the drug leading to the condition or the condition leading or through the lens of the condition leading to the the use of the drug you can end up in um two very different places but it looks exactly the same um through each lens so to speak I think you so I mean and this is you know I've debated with other researchers in the area in print and in person about the different interpretations of this and one of the possibilities is again the this idea of self-medication I mean independent of there being some underlying biological thing that just is a third variable that explains the relationship between cannabis and schizophrenia the other possibility is self-medication and there there are some studies that suggest this and others that don't support it um anecdotally from um having done work in the community and talk to individuals who have schizophrenia who use cannabis what their perspective on is what I've heard from a few of them is um you know the medications that they're provided to manage the disease are relatively effective at managing let's say the positive symptoms like hallucinations delusions that aspect of the disease is is somewhat well managed but then there's another component which is the negative symptoms which is kind of like things that you know avolition I don't like engaging in stuff um there's some anxiety some depression some social withdrawal and a lot of the medications don't manage that component of the disease and they have said that they find Cannabis helps that side of it or it helps them de arouse a little bit even though a lot of them recognize it may trigger the development of some of the positive symptoms they feel that they don't have any tool in there kit to manage the negative symptoms and so it could be in my mind when I look at that it could be a bit of a vicious cycle where someone's using it to kind of Band-Aid one aspect but making other aspects of the disease worse at the same time so it can get very complicated but so I mean there are various ways of looking at this in terms of you know so it's either you could say there's a causal argument which is made by many saying cannabis causes schizophrenia and therefore if we eradicated it um and I think you had alluded to something like that in the last podcast that if you removed it would have this big effect in terms of reducing schizophrenia rates and that's similar to the argument that a lot of the researchers in Britain have made and I'm not personally convinced of that and I say that simply because I look at the data from Scandinavia and I'm like well there you have a population that barely uses any cannabis and yet their schizophrenia rates are the same so the only way in my mind if I look at this kind of scientifically from a data perspective that cannabis could be causing schizophrenia denovo in a subset of people is that there must be an equal proportion of people for whom for some reason and somehow cannabis is preventing them from developing schizophrenia so that it's a zero sum game at the end of the day and there's no change in rates like I can't actually understand any other model that could explain this yeah no I the way you you're explaining it now makes perfect sense I do want to make sure that we distinguish between um schizophrenia like psychosis or schizophrenia itself induced by cannabis yeah and manic bipolar um episode so people who have a predisposition or full-blown manic bipolar sometimes called manic depression but that's you know there's a lot of nuance there we did an episode about this um that people can uh also find Linked In the show note captions but in any case is there any evidence for the fact that people who suffer from or have a predisposition to manic bipolar conditions like bipolar depression for instance should avoid high THC cannabis um so well first of all I mean for in like hered ability family trees for example where you look at something like bipolar schizophrenia the two do kind of track together sure so it's not I mean I think it's hard to separate these in some capacity because um you know I remember years ago at Society for Neuroscience Glen Close was one of the I don't know if you were at that meeting but Glen CL was one yeah she was one of the public speakers and she had talked about schizophrenia in her family tree and she kind of put up this family tree of like you know her family and the the one uh the previous relatives in her family and showed like the individuals who had schizophrenia and bipolar as well and this is something I think that's been seen a fair amount is um there is some co-relationship in the way that these track at a hered ability level and so I don't know that area really well enough to to be able to comment on and from the Cannabis perspective bipolar is definitely much less stud studied and focused on than schizophrenia is but I think also to the comment about the high-thc thing I think this is the other part of the argument that's emerged out of this and this is the other part where I see a lot of the um causality arguments kind of crumble onto themselves to some degree and there's been others who've made these very similar arguments to what I'm making here which is um the push that came out of this out of the UK at least was much more that it's this High potency kind of skunk cannabis they referred to which first of all was based on a smell which they didn't really hadn't done a lot of analytics on so it was people make the Assumption if it smells stronger it's more potent cannabis that's not really true because THC doesn't dictate the odor that's as I was saying more of a tarpine thing but certainly I'm sure some of the skunk cannabis they were referring to is high potency cannabis and so the analysis on this if you actually go back to those papers and read is they often use like hash or low potency cannabis as their control where they show no association with cannabis and so that's what's use this argument that it's the high potency cannabis that has driven this so now the problem with this argument in my view again I look for what is the um answer that fits in with the data like what's that's the most parsimonious explanation here that everything can be explained by and so the problem with that argument is if you look at the Cannabis schizophrenia literature everything goes back to this one 1987 Lancet paper out of Sweden where in that paper they essentially looked at um they have really detailed life records and health records and this was Swedish conscripts and they essentially found that if someone had used cannabis the rate the risk of developing schizophrenia had gone up and up and so this was based on a cohort of people when it was published in ' 87 that the data would have been collected through like the 60s 7s early 80s so we're talking about Sweden and cannabis it's not a country that has high cannabis use rates and an an arrow in cannabis was hovering in a 2 to five% THC range that was the initial finding that provided this association between it and yet the Cannabis in that study that they would have been referring to would have been incredibly low potency compared to what has happened or like what it is today so if the argument is that it's only related to high potency how would that initial finding have ever been found because it doesn't make any sense whereas the alternate explanation that others have put forward which I agree with and is far more sound is that there is some biological reason why individuals who either prone to develop or who have schizophrenia like cannabis and they will tend to seek out the highest potency product they can get access to so in the 7s in Sweden that would have been 2 to 5% THC cannabis nowadays it's higher potency cannabis or maybe they seek out lots of different forms of recreational drugs and cannabis just happens to be one that they land on which raises the other question which is it's hard to imagine that these people who develop psychosis who happen to be using cannabis are only using cannabis it could be but I mean they also there's there's no question there's a a lot of nicotine consumption I mean individuals with schizophrenia use they smoke a lot of cigarettes I mean that's also much higher than the general population rates which is known to stimulate dopic and and other pathway and there could be other reasons you know again there may be some reason why they like it um and I think this is something that I think we just don't understand it's a very challenging thing to figure out why it is that individuals that have certain diseases may like certain substances is it is it helping them I mean some people have argued that perhaps nicotine for example might enhance cognition in individuals with SCH schizophrenia and that may be why they like it I think it enhances cognition in everybody it just carries certain health concerns and by the way it doesn't enhance all forms of cognition but there there there is a nice body of work to support the idea that nicotine delivered in any number of different forms can improve cognitive function to some extent but I don't suggest people run out and do it and in fact it's um one of the more um quickly uh uh abuse drugs nowadays because of the non-smoking delivery routes that are becoming really popular pouches and and things in fact I was chewing a little bit of Nicorette gum to kind of do experiment I liked it a lot and then um I decided to stop completely recently because it just um it wasn't having the same effect and I found myself reaching for more and that's the time when I usually back out well um yeah no nicotine's a whole other thing which I yeah uh we'll have you back to talk about n no I would definitely don't not know enough about that to have any kind of informed conversation but um so I don't know I I would say it to me at the end of the day if I put all the data together what I would kind of the perspective that I have on this is for some reason be it genetic architecture biological predisposition individuals who are prone to develop schizophrenia also seem to be prone to use cannabis and use it at possibly at excessive levels or possibly higher potency products they seek out um using cannabis if someone is prone to develop it may initiate or trigger the onset of the disease um and I think in the long term it will likely make the prognosis of the disease worse so if you were a psychiatrist in a clinic and you consistently see patients presenting saying I didn't have psychosis I used cannabis now I have psychosis and it converts into schizophrenia I can understand why the association would be made regularly that there's kind of a domino effect here and causality becomes attributed but I think when we take a step back and look at the larger data in its kind of entirety to me it's a very tricky argument to make because there's a lot of things that you just can't explain from that perspective and this is also one of the things that I find absolutely bizarre about cannabis in general is uh it's a wildly polarizing topic of conversation and people have incredibly Dee rooted opinions on both sides of the spectrum and for some reason if I don't say cannabis is the devil and causes disease that means I'm an advocate and then on the other side of the coin if I don't say cannabis cures everything I'm a prohibitionist so like I'm in this fun position where I get hate mail from both sides and everyone just generally depending on their perspective thinks that I have a bias kind of going in one way or the other and I'm very you know want it this way or want it this way at the end of the day I'm just like no I just like data so I'm like I'm going to try and answer things as best as I can with data and to me that's the perspective I've maintained and I do think that like these aren't trivial questions because when we went through the legalization process and Canada this was something that came up again and again and again was this association with schizophrenia and in the UK this is something that comes up again and again and again because whenever there's any discussion about the UK moving forward to legalization these ideas come back and so the public health kind of consequence of this is not intangible and so for people to be making these very strong causality arguments and having this kind of um opinion that a lot of people just take up I think can have a lot of influence and so that's why like there's literally no reason I should have a dog in this fight I don't study schizophrenia in any capacity um and it's not my area of research but because I'm in the Cannabis field I always feel very strongly that we need to maintain Clarity over what the data says and not get caught in these opinion-based arguments and I feel like this is one of these areas that has just kind of the amount of people I talk to that regularly tell me that they know that cannabis causes schizophrenia and they're terrified if someone uses it cuz it's going cause them to become um schizophrenic I am just kind of shocked by so this has clearly permeated you know the general population that there's a widespread belief of this yeah I think it's because of these uh very high-profile papers and the way those were picked up by traditional media um and this seems to be something that every couple of years is's a Resurgence of this idea um clearly people are curious about it and so not I just want to say thank you for clarifying um what is now to me obvious that it could be that there's a relationship there um it's clearly not the case yet and it may never be the case that there's a causal relationship there and it could just as well be that people who have a predisposition to schizophrenia are seeking out cannabis use and engaging in cannabis use and I think that's a very important principle for our listeners and viewers to just hear and understand anytime we're talking about a substance and a condition yeah and I mean I think again this is again no endorsement that that doesn't mean that it's safe and that that's without harm I'm just strong of the opinion that I don't think individuals with schizophrenia who are or who have you know first deegree relatives should use cannabis because I think there's a high degree of risk there but that's a very different argument than making saying cannabis causes schizophrenia and if we remove it from society we'll see drops in rates of schizophrenia I don't believe there's any evidence that actually could support that um so it's just a nuanced argument and this is a good thing about more of a long form podcast is it allows for nuance so yeah absolutely let's talk about strains of cannabis um I've spoken before uh about the sativa versus the indicia strains and certainly there is a lot a lot a lot of subjective anecdotal descriptions about differences in the quote unquote effects of those as reported by users um when I talked about this before um in the Cannabis episode I leaned on a paper that took those subjective reports of arguably many many people um push those subjective reports through what was known about the strains they claimed to have used so this is you know people are reporting their use we assume honestly but you always have to assume that they I guess people could be lying about which strains or misinformed but and then using machine learning to couple their subjective experiences as they report them to indicia versus Sativa strains and then by looking at the chemical composition of those different products because these were products that they had consumed trying to attack chemical composition to to strain in this case the mainly the Inda sativa discrepancy to subjective experience and I know that you and presumably others in the field of cannabis research take real issue to that sort of approach and perhaps I have the the feeling this is what you're going to say um rest on the idea that we at least at this point in time really can't say anything about the different biological effects of sativas versus indicas and yet at the beginning of the episode you said that there are many many different cannabinoid compounds in cannabis so three questions and I'll keep these um very short one um do you think that there are different subjective effects of different strains of cannabis that can be attributed to the different strains right not just to individual differences in experience and then the second is do you think that there will ever be a time in which we can understand this plan flower right to the extent that we can engineer it to provide specific subjective experiences perhaps more positive than negative Etc and then there's a third question but I'll hold off okay so um yes so going back to uh just the idea with the Indica sativa thing so the Inda sativa names at least from everything I've understood from everyone that I talk to and being in this field is it's those are are Botanical terms that largely refer to shape of the plant the you know the way the bud grows blah blah blah they do not track with chemical composition in any way um in fact Nick jacomas has done like a lot of analysis of like thousands and thousands of different kinds of canab cannabis that have been submitted for kind of um biochemical analysis to understand THC CBD Tarpin minor canabo content and essentially um his his work as well as from all the people that have done the genetics on this is the variability that exists within what someone calls an indicia or a sativa is uh greater than the variability that there is between them and there's no there is no such thing as a chemical profile that exists in something that's a sativa versus something that's an indicia is it possible that there's a chemical profile that relates to the most common indicas or most common sativas I mean I think in Nick's analysis there was like a couple of tpin that may have loaded on a little bit onto things that were sativas but there was tons of sativas that didn't fall into that bracket okay well then that immediately to me uh negates the sort of premise of this paper that I was referring to that divides according to indicia sativa and yet the paper is also trying to distinguish among all the different types or products of cannabis meaning is there some other feature of the cannabis plant that does relate to these different subjective effects because people do seem to get different subjective effects from different products that relate in some way to things other than the concentration of THC yeah I would my honest opinion is this is expectancy bias this is all expectancy bias I mean I see so they purchase something that they think is going to make them calm and it makes them feel calm if 20 people tell you that taking this makes you calm you cannot remove your expectation bias from the fact that when you consume it you feel calm like and this has been I think one of the most common things with with cannabis is like this whole area is so ripe with these expectancy biases that people have about what they assume if you go someone goes into you know and a bud tender tells them this is a sativa it's going to energize you there's no way to remove that expectancy bias from from what you get and I mean like from talking to a lot of people that kind of study this more explicitly they always say the biggest predictor of what someone feels when they consume cannabis is what they're told on the label it's going to do to them I mean and a lot wild it speaks to you know I did an episode on the placebo effect and a lot of people hear placebo effect and they go okay well then everything's a place placebo effect is amazing there's dose response to the placebo effect of nicotine on cognition dose response if you're told you got a high dose when you actually got a low dose you will exhibit the high do neurocognitive enhancement effect and by brain Imaging it shows a high do like enhancement of the relevant brain areas in other words the expectancy drives changes in brain activity across the board I mean it's again this is not unique to cannabis in any way it's just cannabis is so ripe for this because of the like myth like the lore that it just exists like people say this I mean the issue has been uh and I just asked Ryan Vander this as far as I know I don't believe there's actually ever been a clinical trial that has blinded people and given them sativas or indicas and actually had them predict what they are or been able to characterize any kind of phenotypic description of what that intoxicated State feels like and because all the like the paper that you were referring to where it was users who had got the product they can't remove their own inherent biases from their own experience it's it's going to it's going to influence it there's no way around it and so people kind of lean into this and I probably not consciously but they I mean the amount of people I've talked to that really genuinely believe this to their core that sativa does this and Inda does this is fascinating to me because again like you have these two like THC is what drives the high that's very clear and you can take a sativa and Inda that have virtually identical levels of THC and yet people will report very different intoxicating states that come out of that do you think this also explains the um lore or perhaps it's real that different alcohols produce different drunks um you know I mean I've heard of you know i' I've got friends who will swear that whiskey makes them feel aggressive and vodka you know is mellow and that white Tequilas feel different than than the other Tequilas and you know for people listening to this they go okay well that's not science I agree that's not science that's just anecdote yeah and yet um you know the chemical composition of these different drinks is different but ultimately we're talking about alcohol right different sugar contents you know different hangover propensity I mean I have to believe the majority of that's an expectancy bias I have a hard time believe that these things are really driven by fundamental biological differences within because anything else that's I mean that's the thing like sure some of the labs now there is a movement to start looking at can certain compositions of other things in cannabis start to maybe modulate or influence this is called like I think I've said this before the Entourage effect this idea that THC alone might do one thing but then layering in other tpin or minor cannaboids May influence that effect that is a theory that's not a thing that we know definitively in any way in fact there's virtually no research that's ever been done to test this there's some stuff that's starting to come out now like Ryan vandry at Hopkins recently published a paper where they kind of in a dose dependent manner added lemon which is one of these Tarpin like I said I think gives it like a citrusy odor into the THC and did find that a really high dose probably a dose that I don't think you could actually find in cannabis it's a little bit higher than what you would have gotten there but lemine did seem to be able to curb the ability of high do THC to make someone feel anxious and this was was done in a blinded manner so um there's I think some validity to the interaction whether that's occurring in cannabis naturally because of the levels of THC toonine I don't know but it really was one of the first demonstrations that adding in a tarpine could actually influence a a component of the intoxicated state in a in a blinded manner I think is interesting and Zea Cooper who's here at UCLA is doing some work with beta caropine which is probably probably the second most abundant tpine I think from Nick jom's work I think mercine may have been the highest prevalent tpine across all types of cannabis beta carry offing is probably the second and limine I think is probably the third um and so I think they I mean and so they're looking at I think Zea's work is in the context of pain so they're trying to look at if a fixed dose of THC if you add in varying levels of beta carry offlane does this influence this so because again you do see this in patient communities where they say well this strain helps my pain better than that strain and so it's like okay is there actual legitimacy to this or again is this just an expectancy bias because someone who sold this to you told you that this strain is better for pain and the problem is these are all subjective end points I mean this is like pain sleep anxiety these are all it's how someone personally experiences it we know from all the clinical trials that study pain sleep and anxiety there's massive Placebo effects that happen in all these conditions and so it's very difficult to actually make any kind of sound statements about this in the absence of there being kind of clinical trials that have clearly started to do this but it's like as you can imagine when you start doing the math given the amount of Turpin and the amount of combinations of different levels how overwhelming this could become because maybe you know there's a few that you need in there that interact with THC not just one there is like a lot of work that's happened in the last few years that has really started to try and look at if these tpin or minor cannaboids act at the cannabinoid receptor which none of them seem to so this isn't like you've got things that modulate how THC is binding to CB1 if they're doing something else it's probably through an interaction with another neurochemical system that's influencing what THC is doing so I'm not against the idea that like different choar or what people call strains of cannabis could do different things subjectively I just am remiss to believe this until I see some blinded data because I think outside of that we know how powerful an expectancy bias is so it makes it very very challenging to make any kind of firm statements and so kind of in the context of like how you introduced this that was again I think like one of the issues that I took with the other podcast was because as you've said I understand the thought process you went through like you you know you had this paper where people were reporting subjective effects there's some neuroimaging data that's been done with cannabis so you kind of said okay this is what that was and that was what sativa did and versus this is what Indica did um so I think it's important that you explain that because I do think that like well that's how that's what the data pointed to but now what I'm realizing is that anytime we're talking about cannabis because of the 70 plus cannabinoids present that could modify or join uh so work in parallel with the effects of THC we're really talking about polypharmacology it's not a pure sub it's not like giving anandamide or or it's not like you know adjusting levels of indis and anide you know this raises I think an equally important issue for us to resolve which is um CBD which we didn't talk about earlier when um Nolan Williams who's a psychiat he's he's one of these phenom triple board certified Psychiatry neurology um colleague of mine from Stanford School of Medicine who mainly works on ibigan and transcranial magnetic stimulation but we talked about uh cannabis a bit when he was on the podcast and he mentioned a strain of cannabis that is available in Colorado which is pure CBD I think it's called Charlotte's Web um and the parents of children who have epilepsy MH will move there or there just to get this strain because it seems to help their epileptic seizure I mean I would say that's definitely not true nowadays that pre- legalization anywhere outside of Colorado that was true people were were gravitating there towards it yeah so the questions are um could you tell us a little bit about the biology of the CBD receptor um mainly as it relates to CB1 or not you know does it bind CB1 as well um if not um how is it working and you mentioned that people will not report any subjective effect of taking a pure CBD compound so lacking THC but it sounds like it may have some usefulness for uh treatment of epilepsy and what are some other established meaning clinical trials and or lab um data to support the use of CBD for any type of either um you know psychiatric condition pain Etc so I mean the first thing that's interesting that I think a lot of people don't understand about CBD is CBD like doesn't really exist in any form of Street cannabis and it hasn't for a very long time you meaning there's no CBD in there there's some there's very very low levels of CBD and the reason that is is because THC and CBD are both made from the same precursor molecule and which direction it goes in is based purely on which synthetic enzyme converts it to either THC or CBD and so as people have clearly chased THC and wanted cannabis that's rich in THC and so cannabis has been bred to become higher content in THC by default CBD has been bred out of the plant and it has largely been bred out of the plant for quite some time uh and so this I I always find it interesting that there's this community that's like oh well THC is the recreational cannabis and CBD is the medical cannabis I'm always like that's bizarre because historically there's always been like THC has been what people have bred cannabis for and so kind of any medical benefits that people have reported from Cannabis per se usually are THC and CB1 driven CBD is this other molecule that we can go to the pharmacology in a second but again it's just it's I mean I think in the in the analysis that Nick jomas did of all these strains and types of cannabis that exist uh in the United States when they went through their thing of thousands and thousands of kinds of cannabis it was like 3% of them maybe had like more than 1% CBD like it's very low like there's almost none and in Canada to get a CBD Rich strain you have to basically explicitly buy it because it has to be bred to make CBD and so this is the kind of choar Distinction I think you did allude to this last time which is the type one type two type three so type one is high THC type two is like somewhat balanced and type three is high CBD and now I think like 90 to 90 something low percent of all cannabis that are out there are type one like they're all high THC because that's what's been bred there's a few that have been mixed um and so are kind of equal proportions but you're never going to get high equal proportions so like a high THC cannabis is like 20 to 30% if you go for Ty two which is mixed they're both going to fall around 12% uh maybe a little more but in that range and then same if you got a type three it's high CBD it's going to be 20ish per CBD and very low THC and so no one has ever kind of grown CBD Rich cannabis outside of this recent boom in the last decade that's happened about people wanting CBD because of the charlott's web which was popularized by uh I think sanj Gupta on CNN in like 2012 or something it was a while ago but that was what got a huge movement going around this idea of CBD and yeah so the charlott's web was I I believe that was what they had named that kind of cannabis that they had extracted it from and so it was this it was a tincture that they were using that was very high CBD content that they were finding was controlling um pediatric seizures and kids now this has actually been studied pretty effectively uh most of it's come out of Boston um Elizabeth teal um has been one of the main leads on this and she's a neurologist there that has done a lot of the work on this and so they have I think very clearly and the data is incredibly compelling their research is one of the reasons why CBD has been descheduled or changed in its scheduling down to a u what is it five what is it class like CBD yeah like CBD CBD I mean given the uh availability of CBD everywhere in gummies and drinks and I mean you can get it in a convenience story so it's been kind of a lot of it's been like shifted in its classification status um because it actually has been shown very clearly to have medical benefit and so in and it was very specific it was a very specific form of pediatric epilepsy called DVA syndrome now I there's other forms of uh pediatric epilepsy I know Elizabeth has studied in addition that has found comparable levels of efficacy but essentially what they have shown is that like very high doses of CBD uh are relatively effective at um calming down the seizures in some kids it's profound like in some kids talking about kids that were having dozens of seizures a day to essentially none and so um and I can understand I mean that's super impr from a Grassroots perspective I can understand if you were a parent who had a child with a disease like this that was largely intractable and not that well controlled from the medications they on and then something came around that showed this level of efficacy you would gravitate towards it like that makes sense to me and I think the work that Elizabeth and her colleagues have done has been really important to establish the efficacy of this of CBD in these in these um disease States and so I don't think at this point there's a lot of controversy around that the question that comes out though is so how is it working and we don't have a mechanism so as you said like CBD receptor there is no CB like there's no receptor that CBD binds to I was under the impression that CBD also bound to the CB1 receptor no I I mean certainly or that it or that under some conditions it can modulate the shape of the receptor to adjust THC binding but now you're telling me that these two things rarely coexist together so I guess the question you can dose them like you can certainly I mean you can have products that are made that are like oilbased products at least that have a certain amount of CBD and a certain amount of THC and people do go for those and there's this I mean one of the arguments people make is they say oh introducing CBD reduces the adverse effects of THC and like well if you're using it in a strain that's simply because the strin of cannabis has less THC now so you sprad it out but I mean like a lot of this was based on some that came out a long time ago from Brazil where they showed that like um giving CBD with a relatively high dose of THC could curb some anxiety that came out from hios THC I thought the explanation for that was that c CBD can modify the CB1 receptor in some way that makes THC less able to engage with the some evidence to support that that like we would call these aleric modulators there's some evidence that suggests that CBD May interact with a aleric site on the canono receptor that makes THC bind less doesn't sound like you're particularly convinced by that evidence I think I mean like at the look on your face for those listening I'm looking at Matt and he's I think he's he's being generous here let me ask you a little differently does anyone know what CBD binds to no and so the most convincing thing that I've seen that CBD binds to is the work that CC Hillard has done looking at its ability to um essentially block adenosine uptake and so it can inhibit the adenosine transporter so it causes people feel more alert no because you're getting more adenosine so you get an accumulation it blocks the adeny transport mechanism I see so you get an accumulation of adenosine which is more sedative um and that I mean in the pnas paper that um CC's lab had from 2006 they showed that that also mediated it was the adenosine I think 2A receptor that drove the um anti-inflammatory effects of CBD so it was a secondary effect by sort of the opposite of uh caffeine of caffeine yeah I know if I remember the way you're describing this it sounds like the the anti- caffeine that's kind of how I describe to people if they ever ask me for what the pharmacology of CBD is I'm like that's not the only mechanism but the thing that was important in CC studies that I think is relevant is that it was not super high concentrations of CBD that caused that so you could get this adenosine accumulation at you know you're not talking like micromolar levels of CBD which is what a lot of Studies have done and so even when we're talking about the alisic modulatory site like yes there's evidence for it and it it is convincing evidence it's just the dose range in there you're kind of like who's getting hit with CBD at that level where you're getting these effects and more so when they've done the blinded work like when Ryan Vander at Hopkins again who is one of the main people who's done a lot of this work has actually blindly given people CBD dosing with THC finds the opposite that it actually amplifies some of the effects of THC and this was something we learned from the Pediatric epilepsy world was that when you start giving CBD relatively high doses one of the things that does is saturate a lot of liver enzymes and so some of the efficacy in the Pediatric epilepsy space may be a secondary effect due to an accumulation of some of the anti-epileptics as well because they're not being metabolized the same way and this has now been very well replicated we know that once you start taking CBD when they hit doses that are at the clinical level you're going to start having hepatic effects so it's going to affect the liver and it's going to affect the ability of the liver to chew up other drugs good and there's very specific um uh sip enzymes like the cluster of enzymes that metabolize things there's very specific ones that CBD hits and so as a consequence one of them is what choose THC up so you can get a potentiation of THC by inhibiting its metabolism if you have high enough CBD on board given the effects on adenosine that you described before that it's sort of the what we're calling just for sake of discussion the anti- caffeine how do we explain the preponderance of CBD added to energy drinks that also contain caffeine there's like no logic there bias there you go everything everything can't be expected I have a feeling it's going to be interesting to see in the comment section on YouTube I mean presumably there's some um Regular pot smokers uh listening to this and you know the expectancy bias is so strong as I alluded to in the placebo episode and we've been talking about here um and yet it's so strong that I think people will also be convinced that there are real differences between different strains because they've maybe done the you know non-formal blind uh you know someone someone gave them their weed and someone else and then they got a completely different effect right they're not expecting something um different necessarily um or in a particular direction but they get a very different effect but that to me just speaks to the idea that again cannabis sounds like polypharmacology 70 different cannaboids THC being among the more powerful components but it's um it's yolked in the sense that as you said people self-regulate their intake provided they're smoking not ingesting it by edible and so it's almost like T is being held constant and then there's this constellation of other things around it that are modified and people eventually Veer towards what they like what they can afford what works with their lifestyle and then they come up with a bunch of theories based on packaging what they're told but presumably also some real effects of these Turpin the CBD component Etc it can't all be just psychological expectation I mean so what you're saying is like what we said is the Entourage effect and I think that is a theory that is held by a lot of people that this exists I mean the reality is these tpes and minor canab exist at such low levels that like there's a couple of kinds of cannabis that might have like a high enough level where you're seeing something but yeah I mean I agree to the extent that it would be a little wild if everyone's subjective experience across different kinds of cannabis was entirely driven by some kind of expectancy which I can't imagine is accounting for all of it but I think when we talk about sativa versus indica I think there's a huge bias that's going into there um but one of the things with CBD that's interesting unlike THC is you can actually do pretty clean blinded studies because it's really hard to give someone THC and them not know they're on THC right this was the big problem with the MDMA trial that happened recently is that people who got the placebo knew they got Placebo people got the drug knew they got the drug it's very hard you could do a dose response but it's very diff it's very challenging to give someone a psychoactive drug and a placebo and them not know which one they have whereas because CBD doesn't produce an intoxicating state it's not really perceptible from the person who's taken it um that it's doing anything that actually does make it far more amenable to do blinded trials with and so I mean the interesting thing with CBD and this is where I get a lot of people that get angry at me as well is that I would argue that the overwhelming majority of the effects of CBD that people report are all Placebo effects and I say that because people Leverage The epilepsy stuff and some of the clinical work and say but we know it does things and my response to them is do you know what dose those people are getting because this is something that for some reason has not made the transition from science into pop culture this is a similar Phenomenon with glp1 um I and other people have pointed to the fact that certain food products or certain um drinks or certain activities can increase gp1 Glon like pepti which is now becoming more um commonplace knowledge uh because of OIC monjaro Etc as um very powerful weight loss tool although there's questions about muscle loss Etc and then we had Dr Zachary Knight on who explained that even a four-fold increase in glp1 brought about through a prescription drug or ingestion of a particular food or drink does not lead to any appreciable weight loss however when one achieves thousandfold increases in glp1 through the use of things like OIC monjaro you see profound weight loss meaning that you need enormous effects in order to see the the clinically relevant changes in in that case weight loss so it sounds like a similar thing with with CBD so so if somebody um takes a CBD gummy and they feel that they sleep better you would argue that that's entirely expectation bias I think that's a placebo effect and I say that because the majority of gummies are what like two migs five migs 20 migs maybe I I've never taken a CBD product I know a few years ago they were all the rage I just I was never tempted to do it um and I'm aware and we'll talk about this a little bit more that there is evidence according to Matt Walker who did a six episode series with on sleep that THC does help certain people fall asleep but it can dramatically alter the architecture of sleep in ways that are probably not great yeah yeah I mean THC and sleep is definitely a whole other thing um but sure a lot of people report this with CBD but again so most CBD Edibles or things that people take that are sold through commercial markets are in the range of two to 25 Megs of CBD so then I say to them so you're aware that in the pediatric epilepsy studies the dose ranges are like 1,500 to 2,000 M and then you're talking about a child who weighs on the order of what 20 kilos maybe you know like 40 60 pounds somewhere in that range versus so if you start dosing by weight which is how most of these things are done well they'll say 20 Megs per kig or whatnot um so so someone my size so I weigh a bit over 200 pounds for me to take that dose of CBD uh and let's say 20 migs per kig at like 90 odd kilos I mean you're talking about me taking a liver damaging dose an insane or maybe I wouldn't say damaging um it's definitely influencing how the liver metabolizes other things because it's going to saturate those enzymes but you're taking a very high dose so if for instance you were to take a high dose of CBD and then maybe uh have a couple alcohol containing drinks that could be problematic right because now you're talking about the two- hit model yeah I I can't speak to that because I actually do not know the metabolism of alcohol well enough I don't believe so cuz that's alcohol dehydrogenase so that would probably be a separate enzyme pathway than the sips this is more like separate enzyme pathway but you're but you're um challenging the liver yeah but I don't know if it would have an effect in that capacity I mean they've definitely seen this like they know the list of medications that this is a problem for so it's things like warin um and like blood thinners uh in the anti-epileptics funnel into the same metabolic pathway as this THC so there's certain things that this would influence I don't know if I would say this would be in the context of alcohol but I think more so I mean what I try and point out to people repeatedly is I have yet to see a blinded clinical study that has found any effect of CBD that's efficacious that's under 300 to 500 milligrams and yet in in the wild and people who are using it on their own we using doses of 10 to 20 milligrams and Reporting these effects and the thing is that I think a lot of people don't also realize is CBD has absolutely horrific bioavailability like so if you take it orally in a in an oil or in a gummy or whatever you consume it in now this might be different with some of these beverages that are out there I don't know if anyone's actually ever done the pharmacokinetics on them at least I've never seen it um but standard Roots we're talking 4% like very very little actually leaves your gut into your bloodstream now we do know from the studies from GW who created the pharmaceutical version of CBD that was used for a lot of the Pediatric epilepsy studies that they did I don't know if it was random or intentional find that opposite to something like alcohol if you had just eaten a fatty meal that actually enhanced the bioavailability of CBD dramatically so then it went up to like maybe 20% got into the blood but that's probably because again CBD is a fatty molecule it likes fatty environments and for some reason having fat in the stomach and in the gut seems to promote its ability to get into the bloodstream you can see it now it's the steak in CBD or the the CBD with omelette uh protocol I'm just kidding folks I'm not I'm not suggesting that protocol but yeah it I mean and so because of this it's like you're taking very low doses of CBD that have very poor bioavailability and then people really stand by the effects of these and so I'm like you know what I would always say is if it works for you there's no reason to stop it but because you're having benefit from it but would I ever recommend someone to do this no I wouldn't because I I can't say that I think that this has any biological activity because even when we start looking at these potential targets of what CBD could could interact with there's a couple receptors people have said you know it might interact with a serotonin receptor there's some of these like random orphan receptors that we don't know a lot of what they do that CBD might interact with but like the concentrations you need to hit those are reasonable and you're not getting that in the blood and certainly not in the brain of people from consuming incredibly low doses of CBD so the whole Market that exists for CBD to me is is a little bizarre and I think for a lot of us in the Cannabis field this has been one of the most bizarre social experiments we've ever watched because like you know if you asked me in 2010 to walk into a room and ask how many people knew what CBD is like maybe one out of a hundred like no one knew what CBD was and now it's like 80 to 90% would know what it is because everyone you can't walk down a street in any city in North America and not see CBD products whether it's some kind of cream or like a shake or some random like concoction that people have added CBD because now it's going to you're saying the energy drinks like it's just it's bizarre to me how much has taken off because it seems to have somehow migrated into being a health product in some capacity so yeah I've never tried any of these CBD containing products I think uh a lot of what you're describing speaks to the fact that um you know people are eager for things that can help them adjust their anxiety and sleep better you know which is a large um reason why a lot of this podcast has focused on respiration based tools and other based tools that um can help people with anxiety I think that many people suffer from um just too much uh activation in their autonomic nervous system and um I I would argue there are much better things that are not of a ingestible type you know things that one can do that are science supported right there are clinical studies um meditation breath work any not so much breath work I would argue but um certain patterns of breathing meditation cognitive behavioral therapy there are a whole bunch of different things as you know um so I don't know what explains the CBD craze but you certainly have shed light on what is and mainly what is not known about CBD and I think it's really important for people to hear yeah it I I mean again it's I think from my point of view it's an ethical thing as well because like this isn't covered by insurance people are spending their own money on this and so I find it really challenging to recommend someone to be spending what can I mean if you're especially if you're talking about an actual clinical dose I mean for someone to take CBD at the level where it could actually be shown to have some benefit in some condition of which currently it really is just Pediatric Epsy like this idea with sleep pain anxiety there's not a lot of super conclusive data and I'd say most of the trials that have been done have not found really good evidence of benefit in any capacity so it makes it very challenging to recommend this in any capacity especially I mean if someone if finances aren't an issue sure go for it but um you know I understand people are like you say looking for Solutions so ites doesn't sound like CBD is the solution I I would I I am not convinced by the data that exists that it's really doing what a lot of people claim it's doing yeah except supporting the placebo effect perhaps perhaps it's a great study of the placebo effect I want to make sure before we close that we touch on some of the potential harms or asserted harms of THC because I think there's a lot of misunderstanding about this uh we talked about psychosis and the lack of evidence for a direct causal effect um you give a beautiful description as to how we should think about all of that based on the current literature but cannabis and driving is a potential Hazard yeah right some people will laugh they'll be like oh driving too slow as opposed to you know driving drunk or driving too fast okay we can talk about that um we talked about the potential for addiction and the evidence potentially for and against that right um there's also this the big black or gray box of you know all the things we don't know about what regular cannabis use could do um and yet I know a lot of people who've used cannabis for years mainly as a replacement for alcohol at least that's how they describe it well it's not as bad as alcohol that you hear that a lot okay um but what are some actual if any um what are some actual harms of cannabis use that people need to take into account and just weigh against the fact that every compound caffeine even water can kill you if you drink too much of it um and then let's make sure that we touch on this issue of cannabis and driving or operating Machinery but I think the machine most people are thinking about about uh these days um is driving yeah um so Health harms I mean someone smoking obviously there's risks for lung damage I would say the evidence for things like lung cancer certainly don't hold the way they do with cigarette smoke um because people are smoking less of it or there's just fewer carcinogens in there I don't think you could make the argument about fewer carcinogens per se I think probably it relates more to the frequency I mean Donald tashkin who's in California here I think he was at UCL I'm not 100% sure but I know he was in California he did like very long-term studies tracking cannabis smokers and basically did not find associations with lung cancer the way that you do with cigarette smoking why that's the case I don't think anyone has like people have theories some suggest because a lot of this inv vitro animal work with really high dosing suggests it could have anti-proliferative effects for tumors whether that's real or not I don't know but like I think more likely it's because most people who smoke cigarettes at least that were um you know the relationship with lung cancer were people who were smoking regular throughout the day and it's very rare someone smokes cannabis at that frequency maybe if they isolated that population they would see relationships with lung cancer I just don't think it's been borne out by the data the same way certainly lung damage empyema things like that are on par if you have any combustion product you're going to have damage there there's no question about that so again harm reduction perspective would be you know oral roots of administration bypass lung damage they come with their own issues with dosing and whatnot but if you're talking about physical harms that's one thing to avoid that you could bypass that aspect of it with um there is some I don't think we are at a point where we can say the the state of it there is something with cardiovascular function and cannabis that relates to higher frequency of Strokes perhaps or cardiac events in some capacity the data is not entirely clear in this in this sense yet I mean we don't see again it's not like super clean relationships like we're seeing that we're there when we they established you know cigarette smoking and lung cancer kind of thing I think that effect was so profound and the population of smokers used to be so high it was can can this um potential I want to highlight potential um relationship between cannabis use and cardiovascular issues um be bypassed no pun intended by using Edibles not inhalant or is it related to THC itself I would probably guess and this is a guess um that the you know any again combustion smoke wise I mean maybe not vaping plant matter but at least the combustion from smoking probably exacerbates this just because any kind of combustion product is going to have some vascular effects to some degree on the system so I imagine would make it worse but THC itself has a very complex effect on cardiovascular function because it tends to cause um typically vasod dilation so you get widening of the blood vessels which is why it relates to a lot of people will experience postural hypotension so sometimes when what that is is if you stand up and your blood pressure doesn't catch up with you so you get really laded and people will collapse and so this is not uncommon to happen to people when and with Edibles as well so it's not just from smoking um but when they've consumed cannabis in some capacity there are some people that seem to be very sensitive to the vasod dilating effects and so when they stand up their blood pressure can't match the shift and gravity that happens and so not enough blood peruses the brain and they go down and that can be transient they'll come to a minute or two later but it happens um but but as a consequence of the Vaso dilation is it triggers Tachi cardia which is an accelerated heart rate and so that's a very reliable physiological response for a lot of people who use cannabis and so um it's a bit of a tricky thing because obviously if there is some underlying heart or a cardiac sensitivity or issue the tacky cardia itself can be a problem I mean So like um you know if someone has like an underlying heart condition where at rest it may not present itself but the shifts into that kind of beating faster to compensate for the fact that you've got a drop on blood pressure um can do put strain on the heart in a way that could unmask a vulnerability or an event and again this is me theorizing what I think it could be based on what we understand to some degree about how it affects cardiovascular function um there are occasionally people who um have reported having like elevated blood pressure I mean some of that also could be from like an anxiety state or whatnot coming around but the typical response and this is usually driven by cannabinoid receptors that are in the um the vascular beds themselves that it causes a vasodilatory response and so that is usually the first step the second is the the uptick in the in the heart rate so you get these kind of effects over time there's some work looking at like um you know vascular stiffness that can evolve over time and cannabis users there's some evidence that suggest that you might get more of that emerging and so again that could relate to uh a vulnerability to have strokes or other kind of cardiovascular events in that in that sense so I think the issue in terms of like why it is more difficult for us to say anything definitively at this point is just obviously the the timeline of this I mean you know cigarette smoking was an easier thing to establish in that context because you know once antibiotics and Medicine advanced in like the 40s and the 30s and stuff and people started Living longer you started seeing a lot of these effects of cigarette smoking emerge because and yeah it took a while for the um medical community to adopt the idea that cigarette smoking was bad oh I know it's wild Physicians would smoke in clinic the ashtrays in the doctor's office I mean my grandparents grew up in Belfast they had smoked for years and they had even said like when they were younger doctors would say oh have a cigarette after a meal it promotes digestion so it it's kind of wild to hear that stuff when you think of how cigarettes are viewed nowadays but um it is I don't think we've we've kind of been able to track this long enough to be able to say with certainty what we're seeing but I think there's like if people ask me about risks and harms of cannabis the the the first thing I always say is you know schizophrenia and bipolar those are the main concern areas I think where you want to avoid cannabis um and I would also say if anyone has cardiovascular issues they should avoid cannabis just because that's more of like I would say a being safe because I don't know how to actually explicitly say what I would say the harms associated with it are but I think there is something there I've seen enough evidence that's like starting to coales into um a story that's like there's something here so I would that's where I would say that I think there's risk there's also things like um this bizarre cyclic vomiting syndrome which is this really strange thing that has become really apparent uh we've seen this in Canada a bit more now with legalization again because people are going into ERS more where it's this somewhat strange phenomenon where it's usually people who are pretty excess cannabis users um they just start like puking and they can't stop it and it's like this intractable vomiting that they get into and then bizarrely um like one of the things that seems to Cur it is a hot shower which is I can't even begin to understand this I mean there's also the I'm chuckling at the example because you are so very clearly rooted in science but that just came out of nowhere like okay cool a hot shower deliberate deliberate heat exposure folks there it is I have been trying to understand how I'm I'm not I'm not enjoying it because it's deliberate heat exposure but it just speaks to the fact that we you know we're talking about um you know smoking being uh a regular part of the the the medical community behaviors up until you know a few decades ago um and then you know a hot shower being the treatment for this like chronic vomiting and it it speaks to the fact that like with science and medicine we do know a ton it's amazing how much we progresses especially in the last 100 years last 25 years even but it's also astounding how um the seemingly surprising um antidotes to uh uncomfortable conditions can hold up over time with in the absence of any randomized control trials or mechanistic data I mean I I've really struggled to understand because certainly I don't think it was doctors that figured this out this was people I think who were experiencing this and then they started telling doctors this and then I think and I could only imagine I'm like maybe they're going in the shower CU they're like vomiting on themselves and then inadvertently realized that being in a hot shower somehow seemed to calm this down I have seen a study where they actually applied capsacin cream and that also seemed to provide benefit something about activation of the the something with thermal regulation because the other thing that seems to have shown some benefit is propanolol which again would suggest some kind of sympathetic which is a beta Block it's a beta blocker so yeah it's your effect so there's something with autonomic it must be messing up some kind of autonomic balance or something with thermal regulation why that results in this kind of bizarre vomiting syndrome I have no idea but I remember when I first started hearing the the stories of this years ago and I was just like how cuz I mean it is again surprisingly counterintuitive because one of the um Medical uses that people have used canabas for is as an antinauseant especially in the context of chemotherapy and so something that typically has antinauseant qualities suddenly triggering a vomiting syndrome is kind of a paradoxical and yet we started off today's conversation with you explaining beautifully how activation of these um CB1 receptors are are homeostatic in some sense the thermostat analogy and you know maybe after you know chronic use there there's some you know the Seesaw sort of get fli to one side get stuck I think that's how most people have tried to uh kind of conceptualize what's going on is maybe like and it seems to involve the insular cortex at least the antinauseant effects of cannabinoids are involved through the insul cortex um and so maybe you like have burned out those receptors from chronic use and so that endogenous mechanism isn't working or it's somehow flipped in the other direction now and that circuit becomes sensitized but it is it is a very bizarre but very real thing that seems to happen again this isn't common like I've I I've heard a couple of people I've met describe it but it's not like it's happening to every 10th or 20th person or something it's little it's a little more infrequent but it's certainly happening enough that we've now captured it at a federal data level that this is a thing that people are showing up in the a for so interesting so a hot shower yeah so apparently if it happens hot shower is what people claim so yeah so for me I would say the the the main harms that people need to be aware of the schizophrenia bipolar um possible cardiovascular effects and then this is one of these syndromes that can come out of it as well as possible lung damage from from smoking those are the main I think genuine Bonafide health issues associated with cannabis that people should be aware of I mean and if you I mean I know we're not going to probably go into depth with it on the other side with the medical stuff it's a little bit more challenging I mean a lot of this is just because we really don't have good studies that have been done in any capacity that have really definitively told this of cannabis has like really Bonafide medical benefit yeah I was going to ask you about that it's always nice to end on positive side and you know we don't want to demonize cannabis nor do we want to glorify it it um but you know the examples that I've heard of medical uses for cannabis include appetite stimulation we talked about that um for glaucoma lowering eye pressure and glaucoma the age and age related increase in eye pressure um are two of the major risk factors for glaucoma which is the most common blinding disease second to cataract um more than 70 million people suffer from from it everybody regardless of age get your eye pressures checked there are drops for this but okay cannabis can reduce eye pressure glaucoma um nausea you mentioned and then anxiety um it sounds like if people get the um the dose right and it's right for them that in some cases it can help them with their anxiety and the reason I raised that one is because it seems that most people who decide to use cannabis regularly are using it as perhaps for its euphoric effects but as a kind of a mild sedative a way to relax in the same way that they would use a glass or two of wine what are your thoughts on that because I think this is the most common use case yeah it I mean you look at I mean the other one that that wasn't on there but you've mentioned this before and I have as well as pain so chronic pain pain is I would say the number one so pain is certainly the one that there's the most amount of evidence for and um I I would say when you talked about this in the previous podcast you were mostly correct about this component of it in the sense that it's not that cannabis is a profound analgesic it's that cannabis it has some analgesic properties but it's not like super Sledgehammer in that sense but what it does seem to do is it seems to strip away the affective component of pain to some degree and so what I have consistently heard from chronic pain patients when they use cannabis is they say yeah my Pain's still there but now the Pain's background noise so I can sleep at night and just being able to sleep I think is actually providing a huge amount of the benefit to that Community um but it's the day-to-day like they're able to function with the pain because it doesn't um they don't become focused on it the same way because they're able to kind of push it to the background that seems to be the main ability of cannabis I mean yes there's some mild analgesic properties to it to some degree but it really seems to be much more of that component of it and I think you'd alluded to something like that in the previous podcast you'd said something about it's changing the emotional state of pain so and we know from the biopsychosocial model of pain that emotions and interpretation of the sensation of pain is a huge component of what people refer to as chronic and acute pain yeah so so the pain thing I think is is a central one and that's one of the only ones that there's a little bit of actual research on most of it's either with isolated THD I think there's one or two studies that have actually looked at smoke cannabis and found small signals of benefit but so um anxiety is is an interesting one so I mean obviously this is more near and dear to my heart because I study Stress and Anxiety as my primary area and cannabinoids and endoc canabo in that space um and yeah you look at questionnaire based um studies about why people smoke cannabis and like 85 % of them will say because it reduces stress and it makes me feel less anxious I mean that was like a big impetus as to why we started studying endoc canabo regulation of it because similar to feeding and pain where we know endoc canabo are involved in regulating feeding circuits and endoc canabo are also integrated into pain circuitry and can provide some endogenous analgesic signals um we figured the same was going to be true for Stress and Anxiety which to some degree it is um but it's very complicated because it can be like I said before basic where some you know lower doses or angol higher doses can promote anxiety but for the majority of people who use cannabis regularly it's because it helps reduce anxiety now whether that would hold weight in a clinical trial is a different story there is some old evidence from like I'd say the 70s or early 80s where they were using synthetic forms of THC like naalone which is something you can get in Canada or Marinol or dronabinol which I think is what's accessible in the states where they did find some evidence to suggest it was on par with like a benzodiazapine like diazapam or something I can't remember exactly what the comparator they'd used there but there was some evidence for there being some anti-anxiety properties of THC um and that tracks generally well with um the self-reported literature that's out there um now whether that's the same as an ability to have benefit in something like PTSD is a different question it gets a little bit more complicated because obviously PTSD has an anxiety component to it but there's a lot more to it as well um and again there's very little research in this space there was one really really small study done by the Canadian military um first they did one version of it that was an open label uh open label trials for people who don't know it's just basically everyone knows what they're getting it's not blinded in any way but because of the self-reported data from the veteran population about um cannabis helping especially with sleep and the big thing that they reported was that it suppressed their nightmares and so you know post-traumatic stress disorder is a very complex disease for many reasons and one component of it is the re-experience events that happen during sleep where there's a lot of nightmares and individuals will kind of re-experience the trauma that led to the development of the PTSD um and there does seem to be some suggestion that because they're remembering it and maybe changing the details because they're in a Dreamscape space that they reconsolidate it a little bit more and there's often a high degree of sympathetic activation and arousal that goes on with these nightmares and some of the belief is that this is part of the sensitization process that can happen in in PTSD where the disease can work person over time because the reexperiencing and the reconsolidation and the sensitization of the disease that happens over time in this kind of sleep State can make it worse and so the majority of veterans who have used cannabis and Report benefit if you actually talk to them about it um as I've done in a few different situations and also just look at the anecdotal data almost all of it talks explicitly about sleep and they say oh we you know we use cannabis or THC before bed we find we don't have the nightmares and just the simple trickle down effect of that is hugely beneficial for them and so the Canadian military did an open label trial on this again not blinded it was small numbers but they basically found soon as they put people on naalone this um synthetic version of THC it very in like a large proportion I think like 85% of them almost stopped having these nightmares and this was a like a treatment resistant population that was pretty severe so this was a big benefit so they then took the open label and did what you should and moved forward to do a double blind Placebo control now it was a very small sampled studies and that is obviously always a problem with human work is if this was like 15 or 17 people so not powered enough to really make any kind of firm conclusions but interesting in the sense that at least it was done in a proper crossover design where they got Placebo at one point they got nablo at one point it was switched they didn't know which one they were on um because they're taking it right before bed maybe that will remove some of the subjective bias again you can't totally remove it but like if someone's taking it within you know an hour or so if we to sleep they may not feel the high the same way but even under the double blinded conditions they found a very effective suppression of the of the nightmares and the reexperiencing and then they also at the same time found this increase in kind of quality of life measures which tracked with the fact that they were probably sleeping better um I don't think they actually reported any change or even looked at maybe the overall PTSD score they only reported or really focused on the nightmare component of it because that was the primary outcome of the study but so I thought that was interesting because that's if you look at the anecdotal data in PTSD that's where a lot of it is focused on is the using it as kind of I wouldn't maybe call it a sleep aid because it's really more of a modulator of the dream state and I think this presumably because it's reducing the amount of rapid eye movement that you're getting which most people will probably hear and interpret as bad but you know uh REM deprivation is actually one treatment for depression so there are certain um case conditions where um dreaming and REM is not advantageous and you're describing I mean depression and PTSD are both two two disorders that are characterized by changes in Ram like they have earlier onset to Ram so they go into RAM faster they tend to have some altered architecture of the REM component of their sleep so in those States maybe suppressing REM isn't actually a bad thing at least certainly for PTSD I would imagine in terms of the context of the nightmares that's providing some benefit whether or not it globally is is changing the disease severity or improving the disease I don't think we really have any evidence to say um but again I can understand the um the desire for people to kind of self-medicate let's say by using this as an approach to try and reduce that component of their sleep so so they sleep better they feel better maybe you know maybe down the road it would help the prognosis of the disease long term if it's not sensitizing the same way but I don't think we have any strong data that we can leverage in that capacity to be able to say it but um to me it's one of the more interesting areas I think anxiety disorders in general um there's definitely some potential so as IID mentioned earlier um the the fall inhibitor that elevates anandamide levels so Johnson and Johnson did do a trial in social anxiety disorder it's published I think from a few years ago 21 or something I can pull up the reference for that where they did find some benefit it wasn't huge and some of this had to do with the design of the study because they kind of underdosed the patients a bit and so not everyone actually showed the elevation in an anide when they went back and looked but when they actually isolated the group of people that had higher anandamide in that proportion of the patients they did see some symptom Improvement so it did support it and this is I mean very similar like for us this is a big thing because all of the work that we focused on is looking at how stress and stress hormones regulate largely anandamide signaling and I mean one of the main things that we've demonstrated that's been replicated relatively well over the years is that stress exposure um can actually cause a rapid loss of anandamide signaling and it's that loss of anandamide signaling that seems to facilitate some synaptic strengthening in the amydala and promote activity in areas that are involved in these anxiety circuits and so um the thought has always been well if an emide you know it's that job is its kind of tonic housekeeper at keeping things in that homeostatic range let's say we're talking about explicit an anxiety circuit you know there's individual variation that exists in humans across everything so one of our predictions has been maybe people who are on the high end of the anxiety Spectrum might be on the low end of their tonic and anomid signaling spectrum and we've gotten a little bit of support from that from animal work where we've screened animals based on anxiety and looked at endoc canabidol and found lower anandamide that's extremely interesting because um it squares with u my uh again non-laboratory observation that a lot of people use cannabis to deal with their anxiety yeah right so what you're saying is that you know there's a range of um kind of let's just say Baseline circuit activation within the amygdalin related structures in mice in humans presumably in other animals also if people take a compound that adjusts the sort of homeostatic level of what's considered low moderate and high activation of those circuits that include the amydala then perhaps they're bringing their anxiety into range um in a way that perhaps is different than with alcohol which is more acute you know people have a couple drinks they'll feel relax but then there's this phenomenon of of anxiety you know the next day um feeling a little anxious when they're not drinking whereas um it's interesting that many people who use cannabis for this purpose are not using it all day long they are perfectly able to wait until the night time or evening and of course people can wait for happy hour for a drink as well but it's far and away different than the way we envision something like Al alol use disorder where somebody discovers that alcohol really helps with their anxiety and then they're drinking you know maybe one at lunch maybe a couple at dinner and then in the evening to fall asleep at night um I'm describing extremes here but I find your hypothesis um to square really well with the real world observations yeah it's an interesting one there is some evidence to actually support so my buddy S Patel who's at Northwestern now but he was at vanderbelt when he did this study um they basically played with these drugs that you can use to prevent endoc canabo synthesis so you can create a state of like um impaired endoc canabo function and in humans and they did this in rodents okay so this was done in mice and they basically but the one of the questions was is so a does like you know reductions in endoc canabo function produce states of anxiety and they did demonstrate that so you could deplete endoc canabo levels and you got the emergence of an anxiety state so then you could give drugs that would boost the endoc canabo to normalize this um so again it kind of fit with the idea but then they did one key study where then they gave THC and saw could THC fell in the Gap and they found that like boosting endoc canabo giving THC on a background of low endoc canabo was able to reverse that anxiety phenotype and bring it back into more of the normal range so again maybe for some people this is if this is again this is theoretical so I don't know how much of a spectrum there is if there are people that are at this low end but certainly I think from the animal literature there's some foundation for making a theory that's similar to what you're saying which is maybe some people are trying to fill in a gap of something that's icient in them and therefore that can help them feel less anxious and that again may be very different than someone who is like you know very anxious for different reasons or has normal endoc canabo function or something else might be at play there so very interesting yeah I think it could explain some of the heterogeneity that exists out there for sure yeah so perhaps genetic differences in s Baseline levels of anxiety perhaps map to endogenous levels of anandamide and might predict propensity for THC use yeah I mean we have definitely found uh in human population through work I've done with a lot of clinical collaborators and others like you know we look at endoc canabo in the blood and it's not in the brain but they are lipids that can move pretty easily back and forth um and we have found relationships between peripheral endoc canabo levels and mood States both anxiety and kind of depressive measures which does you know somewhat relate to the the possibility that this could be real we don't know um it's it's it's been hard obviously for various reasons to really track this but we've never looked at an anxiety disorder population we've done some work with post-traumatic stress disorder populations there's been work in depression populations that have found some relationships that are pretty similar so it's certainly a possibility um but again this is all like our Theory at this point so we'll see as things kind of move forward if they pan out but yeah fantastic and I really appreciate that you're able to share some of what your laboratory is working directly on now and looking into the future and I want to thank you uh for what has been an incredibly clear precise and in many cases actionable whether or not it leads to a yes or a no um actionable information here because cannabis and CBD as you pointed out are kind of everywhere around us yeah and people are making decisions about um cannabis and CBD and I also want to thank you because what initially started off as a bit of a confrontation online which I alluded to in the uh introduction that I gave um has evolved into a collaboration that I'm certain based on the uh exquisitely clear and generous information that you've provided um has led to better education more clarity and therefore better informed choices for all the people listening and watching so I really truly appreciate you coming out here sitting down with me discussing these issues uh clarifying points that were unclear before um and and also pointing the fact that this is a complex system a complex bi ology um you know there are a lot of things about psychosis about negative effects about potential um positive uses of cannabis that just are not yet clear and thanks to excellent researchers like you are likely going to be clarified in the years to come so um thank you ever so much for your time for your research and for your attention to the public health education effort around cannabis thank you and I think it's also important I think it's good as you had said that like uh for people to see that scientists can have disagreements absolutely I think it's important um I think it's good that you kind of provided me an opportunity to correct the record um and did so in a very appropriate manner I think this was a great discussion for people to understand um different perspectives also good to highlight where it was that I had had issue with your previous podcast and um I think the discussions that came out of that were for the better so that's all the best and Hope hopefully if there's other contentious issues that happen down the road similar things move forward and you chat with people are well yeah if somebody who is expert in a particular area takes issue with something specific and can substantiate it with something that um can foster better understanding um without fail I'll reach out to them now how quickly we're able to get them here uh Etc is is always an issue sometimes uh we can put an addendum to a podcast um now nowadays that's easier using um what's called Dynamic insertion where we can go back and actually make a correction but listen the best situation is always when this podcast can mimic the real world of research science as you and I both know it to exist where uh if we had been in a meeting and you presented data I presented data and we disagreed what we would probably do would be to head well traditionally it' be to the bar but we'd grab a cup of coffee or go for a walk and we would um talk about it hash it out and then potentially bring it up again at the next meeting so in some sense what we've done here over the last month or so um and certainly during today's podcast is to do something uh to that effect so and I think it's really good for people in the public to know this is how science progresses this is you know someone says something someone disagrees with it you get an opportunity to clarify things and I think that that's really good uh just to move things forward so I think that was a a good process that we've gone through yeah likewise and it's certainly within the spirit of the podcast in no way shape or form do I um purport to get everything right and where I've made mistakes I I really strive to correct them and listen it's been a real honor and privilege to have you out here thanks for coming all the way from Canada and I do hope to have you back again as the research evolves and we can learn more about these topics and more so thank you so much Matt appreciate you great thank you for joining me for today's discussion about cannabis with Dr Matthew Hill I

Title: How to Improve Skin Health & Appearance
Published: 2024-07-01 12:00:01 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I discuss skin health appearance and why both are important indicators of the health status of your immune system, gut microbiome, and other organ systems. I explain why sunlight is essential for skin and hormone health and how excessive sunlight can accelerate skin aging and cause certain skin cancers. I discuss the different types of sunscreens (physical, chemical, and mineral-based) and potential health concerns of the chemicals found in some (but not all) sunscreens.

I also discuss the importance of getting your skin (and not just moles) checked for pre-cancerous and cancer growths, the role of nutrition and lifestyle factors that improve skin health and appearance, and how to improve your skin by reducing local and systemic inflammation and supporting your microbiome. 

I explain what works to improve your skin's youthfulness and appearance, including reducing wrinkles, sagging, and pore size. I review the data on ingesting (or topically applied) collagen, vitamin C, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and retinol, and what is known about the use of peptides (e.g., BPC-157, copper peptides) and red and far-red light phototherapies for improving skin health and appearance.

I also discuss the causes of acne, rosacea, and psoriasis and explain nutritional, skin care, and prescription-based approaches to treating these common skin conditions. 

This episode ought to help everyone better understand the biology of the skin and help them make the best possible decisions for their skin health, care, and appearance according to age, goals, and current skin conditions.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today we are discussing skin Health our skin is an incredibly important organ not just for our appearance or because it serves as a barrier to the other organ systems of the body but because it actually reflects the health status of all the other organs and systems in our body including our brain as well you'll learn today about the direct and reciprocal relationship between the immune system and our skin and if you think about it you've seen this relationship in action before when any of us is feeling fatigued or sick the color the tone of our skin tends to be a bit quote unquote off at least for us relative to what it normally is conversely when we are feeling particularly well rested and vibrant and healthy our skin reflects that so today we will discuss the skin as an organ we'll talk a little bit about the biology of skin so that everybody is on board the nomenclature of the different cell types in the skin and how they're affected by various things and then we will discuss those things such as sunlight and sun exposure as it relates to skin cancers we'll talk about sunscreens of course something that I know Garners a lot of interest these days and even some controversy we will talk about common conditions of skin that concern people such as acne rosacea psoriasis eczema and of course we will talk about so-called anti-aging treatments for skin that is the things that can be done to help reduce the degradation of the protein components in skin things like collagen things that you can do to improve collagen turnover as well as elastin these are other proteins within skin that give skin its youthful or in some cases where it's degenerative non- youthful appearance things like wrinkles and sagging skin so we'll talk about all of that we'll also talk about the various products that have been developed in order to treat wrinkles treat sagging skin reverse acne Etc we'll talk about which ones are safe which ones are not safe and which ones for which there still is no clear answer I want to make very clear here at the outset that while I'll discuss various skin products during today's episode I nor the podcast has any Financial relationship to those products I will provide examples of certain products and provide a few links in the show note captions but I want to point out that those serve merely as examples that I found during researching this episode which by the way included speaking to several board-certified dermatologists including a dermatologist expert in oncology cancers of the Skin So by the end of today's episode you will have a much clearer understanding about skin and what it is at the level of biology and function its relationship to other systems in the body including the immune system and gut microbiome and you will be armed with the knowledge to make the best possible decisions for you in terms of skin health and Skin Care depending on your age your goals and any current conditions you may have before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is ju juv makes medical grade red light therapy devices now if there's one thing I've consistently emphasized on this podcast is the incredible impact that light can have in our biology now in addition to sunlight red light and near infrared light have been shown to have positive effects on improving numerous aspects of Cellar and organ Health including faster Muscle Recovery improves skin health and wound healing even improvements in acne reducing pain and inflammation improving mitochondrial function and even improving Vision itself what sets juv lights apart and why they're my preferred red light therapy devices is that they use clinically proven wavelengths meaning it uses specific wavelengths of red light and near infrared light in combination to trigger the optimal Cellar adaptations person recently I use the ju handheld light both at home and when I travel it's only about the size of a sandwich so it's super portable and convenient to use I also have a ju whole body panel and I use that about three or four times per week if you'd like to try ju you can go to ju spell jv.com huberman ju is offering an exclusive discount to all huberman lab listeners with up to $400 off select ju products again that's Jew jv.com huberman to get $400 off select Je products today's episode is also brought To Us by betterhelp betterhelp offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online I've been doing weekly therapy for over three decades initially I didn't have a choice it was a condition of being allowed to stay in school but pretty soon I realized that therapy is critical to overall health in fact I consider doing regular therapy just as important as getting regular physical exercise which of course I also do every week research tells us that excellent therapy includes three critical ingred ingredients the first ingredient is a strong Rapport between you and the therapist somebody that you can really trust and talk to about the issues that are concerning you second great therapy should provide support in the form of emotional support or directed guidance towards the issues you're facing and third excellent therapy should provide insights either directly from the therapist or that you arrive at that you would have otherwise not been able to arrive at had you not have that emotional support and strong rapport with better help they make it easy for you to find an expert therap with whom you can have those three critical components and because better help is carried out entirely online it can mesh well with your schedule you don't have to commute anywhere you don't have to find parking you can fit it into essentially any schedule if you'd like to try betterhelp go to betterhelp.com huberman to get 10% off your first month again that's betterhelp.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by Roa Roa makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of different challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly from moment to moment Roa understands all of that and has designed all of their ey glasses and sunglasses with the biology of the visual system in mind Roa eyeglasses and sunglasses were first designed for use in sport in particular for things like running and cycling and as a consequence Roa frames are extremely lightweight so much so that most of the time you don't even remember that you're wearing them and they're also designed so that they don't slip off even if get sweaty now even though Roa eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed for sport they now have many different frames and styles all of which can be used not just for sport but also for wearing out to dinner to work essentially anytime in any setting I wear Roa readers at night or Roa eyeglasses if I'm driving at night and I wear Roa sunglasses in the middle of the day anytime it's too bright for me to see clearly my eyes are somewhat sensitive so I need that I do not wear sunglasses in the morning when I'm getting my morning sunlight viewing for sake of setting my circadian rhythm but I do wear sunglasses often at other times throughout the day when it's very bright out I particularly like the hunter 2.0 frames which I have as eyeglasses and now as sunglasses too if you'd like to try Roa you can go to roka.com huberman to get 20% off your purchase again that's roka.com huberman to get 20% off okay so let's talk about skin health and by extension skin care what should we all be doing to take care of this organ that we call our skin our skin is a very interesting organ as I mentioned earlier not just because it protects all the other organs of our body and I should mention it protects them not just by a physical barrier but there's also chemical things a chemical composition a skin microbiome to the skin that also provides additional layers of support such as neutralizing different bacteria that land on your skin there's a lot more to skin than you might realize but to start off let's just talk about what skin is at the level of its structure some of the cell types because in understanding that you'll be best equipped to understand some of the recommendations for skin health and Skin Care the skin like many other organs in the body is a layered structure so the very outermost layer is called the epidermis the epidermis has cells in it below that there are other cells that comprise What's called the dermis or sometimes referred to as the dermal layer and then beneath that you have subcutaneous fat now of course in different areas of the body the skin and as a consequence these different layers of the epidermis and dermis and the fat layer below it are of different composition and different thicknesses think for instance about the thickness of the skin on your forearm versus the thickness of the skin on your belly versus the thickness of your skin on your eyelid okay and as soon as you think about your eyelid you realize okay this thing that we call skin varies tremendously in thickness depending on whether or not we're with the scalp the eyelid the face the chin even you know neck versus chin body Etc so what we think of as skin while it may have a designated set of layers that have particular names can vary tremendously in terms of its overall thickness and therefore its vulnerability to things like sunlight which indeed can mutate the cells within the skin cause them to you know have disregulation of the expression of DNA and the production of other cells we'll get into that so I just want you to think about skin as having these critical components of layers epidermis and dermis below it and by the way within the dermis is where you're going to find the blood supply the vessels and capillaries that innervate the skin innervate simply means that Supply or go-to the skin you of course have hair follicles and hair growing out of those follicles in many cases and then of course you have skin that does not have hair the so-call glabrous skin like on the palms of your hands the bottoms of your feet Etc so I don't want to give the impression that skin is the same everywhere it varies in thickness it varies in terms of the presence of hair or lack of hair it varies according to a lot of different parameters including how much oil is produced in one region or another but if you just know that the skin has an epidermis an outermost layer a dermis or sometimes referred to as the dermal layer which is below it and then it has fat below that and that the vasculature right the vessels and capillaries are at the level of the dermis they come up through the subcutaneous fat and into that dermal layer but they don't reach into the epidermal layer that outermost layer and if you understand also that that nerve endings okay the little terminals as we call them of neurons nerve cells also go up into that dermal layer you've got temperature sensors in the skin all of this becomes very important for our discussions of skin conditions things like rosacea things like acne which sometimes can be painful or can be exacerbated by things like heat they can be suppressed in some cases or even activated by things like cold okay so if you just understand that there three layers epidermis on the outside dermis below it subcutaneous fat and that skin varies in thickness and that nerves that is nerve endings and blood vessels and capillaries are within the dermal layers of the skin well you're going to be very well equipped for the rest of today's discussion I'll throw in some additional information about oil production within the hair follicle and a few other things like extracellular Matrix which as the name suggests is extracell it's outside where the cells reside but gives it its composition as either plump and moist appearing on the outside or it can be kind of sag and wrinkled and dry appearing all of that relates to the different components of proteins and other things within those skin layers but if you understand what I just told you even at a crude level if you can just imagine it just a little bit those three layers you're going to be very well equipped for the rest of today's discussion I should also mention that there are glands within the skin this won't be surprising to most of you those glands will produce oil either more or less depending on certain conditions and there are things that live on the skin on that epidermal layer and within it that we call microbiota you've no doubt heard of the gut microbiome right the existence of trillions of little microbacteria that live within your gut that provided they are varied in their composition and of the right sort really support your immune system and other aspects of Health including brain function and health well you also have a skin microbiome that is the existence of microbiota on the outside of your skin that serve as a barrier to infections but that also provide things that are nourishing to the skin and give it that vibrant look that most people want and by cleansing your skin in particular ways that is washing it with certain substances and avoiding other substances you can support as opposed to diminish that skin microbiome okay so to start today's discussion I want to jump right into the deep end meaning into one of the more controversial issues related to skin health and Skin Care out there right now which is sun exposure and sunscreen now it makes sense why this would be such a heated issue no pun intended because most everyone is exposed to the Sun or has the opportunity to be exposed to the Sun to some degree or another every single day even on cloudy overcast days it's also the case that we've learned a lot in the last 10 years or so about how different sunscreens and their components may be good for us may be less good for us and today we're going to talk about what is known and what is still unknown but before we do that we need to take a step back and look at the context in which all this controversy is happening my read of the online community as a whole as it relates to sunscreen and sun exposure in particular is the following I think most everybody I didn't say everybody but most everybody out there seems to accept the idea that excessive sun exposure can cause certain cancers of the skin that's the general belief out there and there is good reason for that belief because indeed the Sun as full spectrum light includes long wave lengths it's probably easier to think about those long wavelengths as the Reds and oranges and yellows and so forth that are present in well they're always present from sunlight but they're most obvious to us when the sun is low in the sky so-called low solar angle sunlight at sunsets and also at Sunrise but of course as full spectrum light sunlight also includes UV ultraviolet light of different types we'll talk about those types today as well as blue light and green light and in midday sun when the sun is overhead we just see the Sun as white light right because containing all those different wavelengths so while this is not a discussion about wavelengths and optics for sake of today's discussion just understand that long wavelength light tends to be more of the red orange yellow variety okay Loosely speaking and down at the other end of the spectrum the short wavelength light is more of the blue and green and so-called ultraviolet light so it's well accepted light of different wavelengths such as UV Blue Light Green Light all the way out to Red Light even near infrared light can penetrate into cells it can actually pass through surfaces it turns out that long wavelength light can actually go deeper in into the surface of our skin right it literally can penetrate just by shining a red light on your skin it can actually penetrate the skin to a deeper layer then can short wavelength light like UV light and it's well accepted that UV light when it penetrates mostly that epidermal layer of the skin that outermost layer it can cause changes in the way that DNA functions it can cause mutations such that DNA which as many of you probably remember from high school biology DNA is transcribed into RNA and RNA is translated into proteins the proteins are the things that the cells produce they're actually made up of proteins well UV like can disrupt which DNA are expressed and how they are expressed in some cases leading to overproduction of too many cells or disruptions in the functions of cells and that's why people link UV light to skin cancer that's the whole idea there and that's the whole notion behind using sunscreens and notice I'm saying Sun screen so ways to screen out UV light or maybe all sunlight in some cases in order to prevent that penetration of the UV light into cells which can cause mutations which in some cases can lead to skin cancer now I realize as I'm saying this there's probably a group of you out there saying what's the evidence that sunlight can actually cause skin cancer well there is clear evidence that sunlight can cause skin cancer so which skin Cancers and how deadly those skin cancers are we'll get to in a few moments that turns out to be a very interesting twist in the whole story but I want to highlight the fact that there's very little controversy as to whether or not UV light can cause mutations in cells right but what you should be asking yourself is well why would long wavelength light like red light perhaps be good for skin we'll talk about that later there are therapies phototherapies that use that exploit red light which can penetrate deep into skin that actually can enhance the health of skin if done correctly whereas short wavelength light which only hits that epidermal layer on the outside of the skin may be bad for our skin and I say maybe because it's really a function of dose and timing and genetic background okay if all this is seeming rather complicated I'm going to make it very simple and before I do that I do want you to ask yourself a question I want you to ask yourself where you reside on the Continuum of beliefs about sunscreen UV light and skin cancers so here it goes my read of the landscape out there is that there are some people it's a small minority but there are some people who feel that sunscreen in any form is bad for them they think okay sun is great for them and sunscreens of any kind chemical or physical barriers bad for them okay some people believe this I'm not saying I believe this in fact I don't believe that I'm a big believer in sunlight and the power of sunlight for health but I am not what is called a sunscreen truther okay I'm not somebody who thinks that sunscreen has no value in fact quite the opposite under certain conditions and certain sunscreens I want to say that for the record other people out there believe that certain sunscreens can be valuable but only the sunscreens that lack certain chemicals because they are concerned about chemicals in certain sunscreens being so-called endocrine disruptors or maybe even causing cancer on their own okay other people are so afraid of sunlight and believe that it causes so many issues as it relates to skin cancer that they basically create beekeeper uniforms for themselves so that anytime they're out in sunlight they want to have sunglasses on they want to have a hat they want to cover their neck every part of their body okay they sit at the opposite extreme of the people who don't believe in using any sun protection whatsoever and now of course there's the backdrop of how much natural melanin production we each make that is how dark our skin happens to be according to our genetics and of course there's the issue of where we live on the planet and how much sun we have available to us in order to potentially expose ourselves to and perhaps also ask yourself if you are in what I believe is the largest category of people out there which is the category of people who probably don't wear sunscreen every day maybe they put it on occasionally but only if it's very bright out very hot out because they don't want to get a soall sunburn and I believe most people fit into that General category of a not wanting to be burned B not wanting to age any faster than they would were they to not wear sunscreen at least that's their belief and C they've just been told that sunscreen's good for them and they'll reach for whatever sunscreen is on the shelf or that was recommended to them either by their dermatologist or that they they happen to find in the pharmacy or when they're out skiing and they you know they notice it's a bright day and so they buy some sunscreen and slather it on so before I go any further just ask yourself those questions you know where do you reside are you afraid of sunscreen do you love sunscreen are you in The Beekeeper category like you think all sun is bad it's going to give you skin cancer it's going to age you faster we'll get to the Aging component in a few minutes but just ask yourself that question as we wade into the material I'm about to cover so what's the story with sun exposure sunburn sunscreen skin cancer and aging I spoke to several different dermatologists about this including one expert in skin cancers specifically and what I was told is the following first of all sun exposure will disrupt the collagen and elastin but mostly the collagen composition of your skin in a way that makes it appear as if you're aging faster okay so sun exposure yes ages the skin now that does not mean however that you want to avoid all sun exposure because the same dermatologist said that some sun exposure is healthy for us why because our skin is also an endocrine organ it's involved in making various hormones it's part of the vitamin D production pathway although a little bit later we'll talk about the fact that most people get their Vitamin D from their diet and in some cases also from supplementation but it is a good idea to get some sunlight for sake of vitamin D production but also the production of other hormones like testosterone and estrogen okay so every single dermat ologist that I spoke to said that some sun exposure is good for us but that too much sun exposure will accelerate the appearance of Aging in our skin so let's pin that up on the wall as fact okay this again is not saying you should avoid Sun completely it's also not saying you should get excessive sunlight exposure it's saying sunlight exposure by virtue of the UV wavelengths ability to cause mutations in the epidermal layers of the skin and to impact the collagen composition of the dermal layers below it as well as some of the other proteins present in the cartinos sites okay one of the major skin cell types and other cell types of the skin does lead to the appearance of aged skin which is one rationale for wearing sunscreen now when I say sunscreen everyone including myself thinks about lotions or in some cases sprays but let's pay attention to the one fact that I do think everybody regardless of what category they are in the general population or what background training a dermatologist has believes which is a physical barrier a shirt a hat a jacket a physical barrier can provide in some cases very good protection from the Sun and I don't think there's any controversy whatsoever as to whether or not the composition of the physical barrier is having negative effects on the skin okay you will find those Niche communities out there that are saying okay certain chemicals present in certain materials that clothing are made with can be problems for the endocrine system but we're not talking about that here okay what I'm saying is that all dermatologists I spoke to and I think most every rational human being on Earth would say that a physical barrier can help to a great degree in order to protect our skin from the Sun as it relates to sunburn but also acceleration of the appearance of Aging in our skin okay so I don't think there's any dispute about physical barriers for protecting the skin how much you want to protect your skin from the Sun well that will depend on what category you decided you were in from the earlier discussion we'll get back to that what else did all the dermatologists and skincare experts that I spoke to also agree upon well they all said that indeed excessive sun exposure can increase the propensity for certain skin cancers I want to go on record by saying I believe that why well because of this ability of UV light and some other wavelengths of light potentially to cause mutations in skin cells that can lead to certain skin cancers okay I don't think that's a debated topic out there there might be a few people out there who are going to hang their hat on a study that I'll go into a little bit later which is that the relationship between sun exposure and all-cause mortality is a tricky one it's one that will parse okay meaning I'll just give it a little you know hint into what I'm saying people who avoid the sun entirely don't tend to live as long as people that get some sun exposure but there are a bunch of confounding variables that have to be understood in order to really interpret that statement and the study that we'll parse a little bit later for now let's just accept the reality that the vast vast Ma majority of dermatologists out there and skincare experts really understand that sun exposure can accelerate aging of the skin but most will also tell you that some sun exposure is good for you not just for skin Health but for overall brain and body Health now as it relates to skin cancer the dermatologist oncologist that I spoke to all right who did his training at Stanford and I'll provide a link in the show note captions to his clinic and you can learn more about some of his work he's published some really nice papers said following and this was surprising to me he said it turns out that the skin cancers that sun exposure causes while they can be serious and should be taken seriously they should be treated those generally are not the most deadly of the skin cancers now why would he say something like that okay he said it because it turns out that there are lots of different kinds of skin cancer some of them arise or can arise through sun exposure others and indeed some of the most deadly of skin cancers are independent of sun exposure and this is where things can get a little bit tricky you'll hear out there oh you know Sun can cause skin cancer but not the skin cancers that kill you I don't think that's really a fair statement you'll also hear however that all the skin cancers that are out there are the consequence of sun exposure and that also is not true and if anything this provides motivation not just on the part of the dermatologist but it should be motivation from within all of us to make sure that we understand our background genetics not just how much pigmentation We Carry in our skin by virtue of our genetics but we should know by asking if you're not going to get genetically sequenced which you can do nowadays of course but you should know whether or not your family your genetics tends to carry certain mutations that make you more prone to skin cancers in general not just the type that can be exacerbated by sun exposure what I'm basically saying is that if you have particular genetics in your family even if you avoid all sun exposure you know nobody should do that of course you need some sunlight I mean like all other or most all other uh creatures on Earth sunlight is important for us it's important for setting our circadian rhythms that's why I'm always telling people to get sunlight in their eyes early in the day which by the way when the sun is low in the Sky low solar angle sunlight the UV index tends to be very low okay so you are at the lowest possible risk of getting burned of getting any kind of mutations to your skin that doesn't mean you should overdo it it doesn't mean you should stare at the Sun and damage your eyes I've talked about this a lot on other podcasts how to get morning sunlight exposure properly but when the sun is low in the sky that's generally a safe time to get sun exposure it's that midday Sun typically between the hours of you know 11:00 a.m. or even 10: a.m. Depending on time of year and where you're at and 2 or 3 or 4 p.m. that the sun is overhead and at its greatest intensity and where the UV index can be very high it's very easy to look up the UV index and when the UV index is very high right I was down in Australia earlier this year and the UV index down there is so high you can almost feel it you actually can feel it you step outside and you immediately feel like wow my skin is really being bombarded with the sunlight and I'm somebody who tolerates sunlight pretty well because my dad's fairly um you know dark pigmentation just Naturally by virtue of being South American normally I can tolerate the skin pretty well but you should not rely on just that subjective feel you should look up the UV index and we'll provide a few Links of good UV index sites that you can look up the UV index and where you might want to be extra cautious about providing a physical barrier or a chemical barrier to protect your skin now a lot of people out there also believe that if you avoid sunburn you're avoiding skin cancer perhaps you're very pale or it's the early phase of the summer season or you have a susceptibility to sunlight such that you know you step outside and you get too much sunlight on a given day and you get a sunburn that reflects an immune reaction an inflammatory reaction within the dermal layers of the skin so that means the vasculature right those vessels and capillaries they're going to dilate you often times will get infiltration of things like cyto coses which are of the immune system you get an inflammatory respon that's why it's red that's why it's tender to the touch the nerve endings there can be overly activated so the reason why your skin actually feels warm right when you touch your sunburn is because in fact you have an activation of some of the nerve endings at that site as well as the activation of the local immune system properties that give rise to again vessel and capillary dilation it's a wound of sorts induced by excessive sun exposure now does sunburn cause skin cancer there's no direct relationship between Sunburn and skin cancer except the fact that sunburn reflects excessive sunlight exposure and yes as I mentioned before it's conclusive that excessive UV sun exposure to the skin can cause certain mutations in skin cells that give rise to certain skin cancers why are we parsing things at this level of detail right is this all just semantics no it's not just semantics many people believe that if they didn't get a sunburn they are not at additional risk for inducing skin cancer or other issues with skin right we're not just talking about skin cancer we're talking about accelerated aging of the skin according to sun exposure so let's make this very simple you don't need a sunburn for the sun to accelerate the Aging appearance of your skin you don't need a sunburn to induce the kind of mutation that may again I want to highlight may give rise to a skin cancer it's also not the case that if you got a sunburn or even multiple sunburns that you'll necessarily develop skin cancer although by virtue of the fact that sunburn reflects UV exposure multiple sunburns would reflect increased UV exposure and therefore increased risk for certain skin cancers so all this to say avoid sunburn however you can and if you're somebody who just loes sunscreen that doesn't want to even hear the discussion we're about to have next about which sunscreens are safe and which ones appear to be less safe if you're just one of these people that does not want to put sunscreen on because you're very concerned about whatever chemical might be in sunscreen well then consider that the physical barrier of an article of clothing or a hat or a bandana of sorts can indeed Shield you from the Sun to some degree often to a great degree and again I don't think there's any controversy as to whether or not those are safe as many of you know I've been taking ag1 for more than 10 years now so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast to be clear I don't take ag1 because they're a sponsor rather they are a sponsor because I take ag1 in fact I take ag1 once and often twice every single day and I've done that since starting way back in 2012 there is so much conflicting information out there nowadays about what proper nutrition is but here's what there seems to be a general consensus on whether you're an omnivore a carnivore a vegetarian or a vegan I think it's generally agreed that you should get most of your food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources which allows you to eat enough but not overeat get plenty of vitamins and minerals probiotics and micronutrients that we all need for physical and mental health now I personally am an omin and I strive to get most of my food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources but the reason I still take ag1 once and often twice every day is that it ensures I get all of those vitamins minerals probiotics Etc but it also has adaptogens to help me cope with stress it's basically a nutritional insurance policy meant to augment not replace quality food so by drinking a serving of ag1 in the morning and again in the afternoon or evening I cover all of my foundational nutritional needs and I like so many other people that take A1 one report feeling much better in a number of important ways such as energy levels digestion sleep and more so while many supplements out there are really directed towards obtaining one specific outcome ag1 is foundational nutrition designed to support all aspects of well-being related to mental health and physical health if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs with your order plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman okay so before we dive into our discussion about sunscreens and the chemicals in sunscreens let's just take a moment and talk about vitamin D vitamin D is important for a great number of bodily and brain functions as I mentioned earlier most people get their Vitamin D from the foods they eat if you eat dairy in most countries the dairy is fortified with vitamin D many people nowadays supplement with vitamin D anywhere from a th000 IUS to 5,000 IUS that folks out there who perhaps even take 10,000 IUS seems a bit high for most people but it's going to depend on how much sun exposure you get the pigmentation of your skin but there are a number of people especially in countries where they don't get a lot of sun exposure in particular times of year and maybe they're not eating enough Dairy fortified with vitamin D who would benefit from vitamin D supplementation and many people find they feel better when they supplement with vitamin D but I encourage you that if you're going to supplement with vitamin D to probably start at the lower end of supplementation like a th000 to 3,000 IU maybe 5,000 IU best would be to measure your vitamin D levels many people are surprised to find that even if they live in a part of the world where they get a fair amount of sun exposure and they eat some Dairy that's fortified with vitamin D that for whatever reason their vitamin D levels are still too low and benefit from supplementation with vitamin D the dermatologist that I spoke to told me that yes even if you wear sunscreen or a physical barrier okay this is interesting even if you wear sunscreen or a physical barrier when you get outside into the sun it can still have a positive effect on your vitamin D levels this was surprising to me but then of course it makes sense sunlight is full spectrum light it's not just UV and short wavelength light the ability for longer wavelength light to penetrate the skin is clear and those longer wavelengths can also impart a positive influence on the vitamin D pathway okay so if you're concerned about wearing sunscreen because you're worried that it's going to impair your vitamin D synthesis or metabolism in any way probably no reason to be concerned now if you're somebody who is in The Beekeeper category who's completely avoiding sun exposure for whatever reason well then you probably want to get your vitamin D levels checked and you may want to rely on supplementation or something of that sort at the same time because of variation in genetic background there will even be some of you out there who are super anti-s sunscreen who are peeling your shirts off all the time who getting lots of sun exposure who may surprisingly have vitamin D levels that are still low that's rare okay for all the obvious reasons but it could still be the case and indeed some of the dermatologists that I spoke to said they occasionally have a patient like that vitamin D as you may recall is involved in a bunch of different things it acts as a hormone it's involved in calcium absorption it's involved in some of the other hormone Pathways and I should mention that there's a study I'll link to this in the show note captions that shows that some amount of sunlight exposure to the skin this is an Israeli study where they had people you know get several tens of minutes of sunlight exposure in the afternoon during particular times of year uh they didn't have them going naked outside okay this was sort of like context and culturally appropriate um skin exposure to the upper body and to the legs could induce increases in hormones such as testosterone and estrogen which were correlated with it wasn't causal but it was correlated with improvements in mood well-being libido Etc well some of that probably relates to testost Stone and estrogen synthesis directly again the skin as an endocrine organ okay there are certain elements within the cortinos sites skin cells that can literally communicate with some of the organs of the body that produce testosterone and estrogen even some of the glands pituitary Etc this is through a number of different stations it's not necessarily direct but also through the sun's ability to impact the vitamin D pathway that then impinges on those testosterone estrogen and things like luteinizing hormone Pathways we don't have time to go into into all this now I covered this in an episode about testosterone and estrogen you have hormones such as lutenizing hormone which then stimulate the gonads the testes to the ovaries to make testosterone Endor estrogen the skin is a not so obvious player in this whole thing whereby external environmental stimuli such as the availability of sunlight which in most places in the world varies across the year can stimulate more or less vitamin D production luteinizing hormone production that can hinge on testosterone and estrogen production these pathways are one of the reasons why when we get the right amount of sunlight not too little not too much we feel better we feel better because certain hormones are being produced at certain levels when we're getting that sun exposure and when we don't get that sun exposure we have lower levels of those hormones this is well established and the study that I linked to in the show note captions which I've covered in previous episodes is but one example of that phenomenon okay let's talk about sunscreens now the reason I changed my tone of voice voice with this is that if you look on the internet you will see claims that I don't use or believe in sunscreen that is just false I've worn sunscreen my entire life I don't necessarily wear every day I don't tend to burn easily okay I have some natural level of pigmentation in my skin based on my genetics as I mentioned earlier but as we talked about earlier just avoiding sunburn is not going to protect me or anyone else against certain sun-induced mutations in skin cells and the aging effects that sun can have so I do believe in certain sunscreens meaning I will put sunscreen on on certain days on certain parts of my body however I do believe now having spoken to multiple dermatologists and looked into the literature very deeply that there are certain chemicals in certain sunscreens that are of concern I don't mean that if you put these on once or even twice that you are going to suffer negative consequences I mean they are of concern meaning we should pay attention to them and when given the option we should opt for the healthier choices and in fact there are known healthier choices to make all of this very clear I'm going to tell you what is very clear to the Dermatology community at this point in time okay in June of 2024 here's what we know there are two major types of sunscreens out there well really three we talked about physical barrier before no one argues about a physical barrier no one's worried about the chemical compos I of physical barriers okay when we talk about sunscreen so lotions creams sprays Etc there are two major types the first are organic types which is essentially chemical sunscreens okay so when you hear organic sunscreens that means chemical type sunscreens and then there are inorganic types which are sometimes referred to as mineral-based sunscreens here's what most everybody seems to accept that mineral-based sunscreens meaning sunscreen that tend to include either zinc oxide or titanium dioxide or both in some cases are generally thought to be safe up to concentrations of 25% 25% is a pretty high concentration you can find sunscreens out there that have 25% zinc oxide or 25% titanium dioxide they're rare to find however more often you'll find sunscreens that have 15% 10% 18% zinc oxide sometimes alone or in combination with titanium dioxide you'll find some pure titanium dioxide sunscreens out there alth those are a bit more rare right a little bit harder to find here's the story zinc oxide and titanium dioxide reflect back UV light those short wavelengths of light that would otherwise potentially cause mutations in your skin cells at the level of the epidermis okay in the outermost layers of skin remember short wavelength light doesn't pass very deeply into the skin sunscreens containing zinc oxide Andor titanium dioxide were engineered for that specific purpose to reflect back UV light this is very different than organic or chemical sunscreens which contain certain compounds these Go by different names oxybenzone avobenzone there are a bunch of these different chemicals that are contained in so-called organic or chemical sunscreens those chemicals in general don't serve to reflect back UV light but rather absorb UV light okay so when they're applied to the skin they're designed to absorb the UV light so that the UV light can't negatively impact the skin those chemical again chemical AKA organic components within organic sunscreens again sometimes called chemical sunscreens are designed to absorb UV light mineral-based sunscreens so-called inorganic sunscreens containing things like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are designed to reflect back UV light why am I telling you this well I'm telling you this because it's generally believed that the zinc oxide and titanium dioxide containing sunscreens are safe up to concentrations of 25% whereas there is some again some concern about the chemicals within chemical AKA organic sunscreens as potential endocrine disruptors so disrupting things like testosterone synthesis estrogen synthesis and other hormones it's not all just about testosterone and estrogen folks other hormone Pathways that many people including some governing bodies and agencies that assess the safety of different cosmetic and sunscreen products are concerned about now how concerned they are depends on where you are in the world okay so in Europe they have different stringencies for what is considered safe versus unsafe or just of concern as opposed to in the US here's what every dermatologist in the US because those are the ones I spoke to told me which is that it is advised that on children younger than 6 months of age you do not use chemical based B sunscreens why well young skin even the skin on the external part of the body in children 6 months or younger acts more like mucosal skin in that it can very easily absorb things transdermally through the skin however even as we age so into puberty our young adult years and even into our elderly years there is still a capacity for things to pass transdermally through the skin although because of some of the additional barriers formed within the dermal and epidermal layers of the skin like extracellular Matrix the changes in collagen Etc there is less tendency for compounds to pass transdermally through the skin now that just simply highlights the fact that if you are a very young person or if you're applying sunscreen to a very young person maybe six months or younger but also perhaps older depending on how careful you want to be to avoid these chemical-based sunscreens there is very little if any evidence that the mineral-based sunscreens are of concern for transdermal pass into the skin at concentrations of 25% or less meaning sunscreens containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are probably safe or at least have been deemed safe enough that they are freely available on the market and we are told that they are safe for people of all ages so if you are somebody who is concerned about the chemicals in sunscreen most every dermatologist or chemist who works on sunscreens will tell you well mineral-based inorganic sunscreens are going to be your safer option if you're concerned but get this the chemical-based sunscreens while some of the chemicals in them indeed can be quite scary when you read the literature you look at some of these things like oxybenzone um avobenzone and some similar chemicals even at low concentrations have been shown to be endocrine disruptors people talk about how the fact when they apply these sunscreens they can taste them in their mouth there's a lot of fear around these and some of that fear is substantiated when one goes and looks at the studies that have been done on these chemical-based sunscreens you may find it interesting to note that the way these studies were done often involves having people apply a ton of these chemical based sunscreens like two full bottles of these sunscreens over the course of a very short period of time and then have their blood drawn and then it's revealed that some of these chemical components are within the blood so a big issue that's not often discussed because it's very difficult to control for in a natural setting but is straightforward to control for in a laboratory setting is how much sunscreen one is applying and how often and across how many years of time so there's no real prescriptive that can tell you hey if you put chemical sunscreens on once that's problematic although certainly pay attention to that six months and younger what is essentially a rule that I mentioned earlier and do not put chemical based sunscreens on really young kids you might want to avoid them entirely depending on how stringent you are about this stuff but when it comes to chemical based sunscreens personally I avoid them but then it becomes a question of if you could only use a chemical based sunscreen you simply look at the label some of these have by the way zinc oxide titanium oxide and chemical based components okay keep that in mind some are purely mineral based some are purely chemical based but if you look at a sunscreen label you know okay well this is the only thing available on this very hot day with a very high UV index and otherwise I'm going to get a burn well if you're really concerned then I would resort to a physical barrier if you are less concerned then you could perhaps tell yourself okay you get to put it on that day but you might not want to use it every day and you might want to use a small volume of it right or maybe just on parts of your face or your ears or your neck that are particularly sensitive to Sun okay these are the things that need to be taken into consideration but when we step back from all of this all of the literature including by the way some of the literature that assessed and I'll put a link to this review a review on the potential neurotoxicity of titanium dioxide nanoparticles I'll get into this in a moment it has been explored whether or not titanium dioxide is more risky than zinc oxide talk about that in a moment but when you step back from all of this here's what you get physical barrier no one argues About That No One Believes that clothing is dangerous per se when it comes to avoiding excessive sun exposure again excessive relates to your skin tone your background genetics your activities and where you are in the world and what time of year okay very specific to your needs very few folks are concerned about mineral-based inorganic sunscreen so if you want to use sunscreen as many people do and you want to make sure that it's not an endocrine disruptor and it's not a neurotoxin or something else that's been raised for some of these chemical-based sunscreens well then find a sunscreen that has 25% less zinc oxide and or titanium dioxide if you were a bit more concerned about say titanium dioxide and some of the suggestive evidence only suggestive evidence that maybe titanium dioxide is more risky than zinc oxide especially when it's in its Nano form the very small form that may indeed allow it for more easy Passage through the layers of the skin that transdermal passage will then find a sunscreen that is purely zinc oxide sunscreen and again they always have other things in them but what I mean is the only active ingredient in a zinc oxide only containing sunscreen is zinc oxide and then there are a bunch of other things that allow it to be a lotion for instance again up to 25% concentration why would somebody not want to use zinc oxide containing sunscreen up to 25% and opt for anything else you might ask right if that's considered safe the reason is the consistency of the zinc oxide is it's pretty sticky and thick and it's kind of pasty right back in the 80s and 90s some of you may recall that had um zinc oxide um sunscreens that would actually you know color the nose white so you could really see it was really prominent on the face they tried to turn that into a fashion statement didn't go over so well over time but in any case the addition of titanium dioxide to those zinc oxide containing sunscreens allow it to be a bit silkier so that it would spread on more evenly and then you may say well why even put chemicals in sunscreen at all if there's risk the reason why chemical-based organic sunscreens even exist is that they can come up with compositions of those sunscreens that are very silky and that could spread on clear over makeup and things of that sort but there are these concerns about some of those chemical components as endocrine disruptors and potentially as mutagens that could cause other issues or you know any number of different things you you know you can find all sorts of concerns out there on the internet most of those concerns are not substantiated but these chemicals can be problematic at high concentrations and that takes us back to the point made earlier which is that in the studies of those chemicals and the reasons in some cases being banned in certain countries and other countries carrying uh warning recommendations the amount of those chemical-based sunscreens that were applied was exceedingly high so if you're wearing sunscreen very often you're wearing a lot of it probably best of year towards a mineral-based sunscreen if you are concerned at all about the chemicals in chemical based sunscreen wear a mineral based sunscreen and or use physical barrier and if you're somebody who just doesn't believe that sunscreens are safe whatsoever well you know as far as I know it's a free world you don't have to wear sunscreen but then I would say you need to be very aware of the fact that sun can induce the appearance of accelerated aging in the skin right that's an actual process that takes place there's really no debating that frankly and sun exposure can potentially accelerate or even give rise to certain skin Cancers and nobody wants that okay before we move on to a discussion about what can be done to to increase the youthfulness of our skin or the appearance of youthfulness in our skin we need to have a bit more discussion about skin cancers notice I said skin cancers plural because there are many different forms of skin cancer some of them relate to sun exposure as we discussed earlier others do not and in fact some of the more deadly skin cancers are independent of sun exposure they can relate to genetics and to other factors so the most straightforward story about all of this is that approximately 80 to 90 % of melanomas which are skin Cancers and they are very serious skin cancers that can indeed be very deadly arise in what's called denovo skin denovo skin is non mole skin now does that mean that you should not pay attention to the shape and any changes in your moles no you absolutely should but for people who have naturally darker pigmentation everywhere or who have very few moles then you aren't going to be able to use the monitoring of your moles as the only readout of potential development of skin cancer and frankly everybody should be thinking about these more serious skin cancers independent of moles or changes in moles here are a couple things that everyone should pay attention to if you have a pimple like lesion or you have any kind of spot on your skin that seems like it's an acne that's lasted more than a month or you have an area that's seeping something that might look like plasma or pus or blood and it persists over a long period of time like a month or more absolutely get that checked out by a dermatologist okay don't wait any longer than a month get it checked out in addition it's highly recommended that you go in and you get your moles checked by a dermatologist and frankly that you get all of your skin checked by a dermatologist at least once per year this is going to really protect you against both the sun-induced skin Cancers and other forms of skin cancer the most common form of sun exposure induced cancers are basil cell carcinomas and indeed those are less deadly many of the melanomas but they still can be exceedingly problematic and they can be deadly so it's very important to get these checked out now there are websites and I'll provide a link to one of them in the show note captions for which you can look at a bunch of different examples of different moles and how they change over time and if you happen to have a mole that resembles the appearance of any of the moles in that image gallery then you would be wise to go to a dermatologist right away because it could be again could be cancer of some sort you do not want to let these things linger for too long at the same time many people get concerned about one mole that didn't have an irregular border and then suddenly has an irregular border there are a lot of different features as you'll learn from the website or if you talk to your dermatologist that relate to whether or not something is predicting skin cancer or has become skin cancer it's not just irregular border it's changes in size certainly changes in pigmentation vascularization bleeding any kind of seeping there are a lot of different things there so don't be alarmed at first appearance of one of these things but do take it seriously and keep in mind that there are things that your dermatologist can do to help prevent certain skin cancers so for instance there's a growing Trend now among dermatologists to suggest laser resurfacing of skin that is a laser used to essentially disrupt that epidermal outermost layer turn it over so that it regenerates because it can indeed regenerate to create new cells there keep in mind that UV light and other factors in the environment can cause mutations within that skin layer sometimes they're caused by genetic factors but often environmental factors like sun and chemicals and other things and by encouraging turnover of that skin layer through laser resurfacing which by the way may also increase the sort of youthfulness appearance of your skin so many people are motivated to do it for that reason can dramatically reduce the incidence of certain kinds of skin cancer in fact the dermatologist I spoke to who's an expert in Derm oncology okay cancers of the skin said that laser resurfacing can cause a 30% reduction in skin cancers because of this ability to rejuvenate that epidermal layer and that's especially true for areas of the body like the face ears neck tops of the hands etc for which the sun often induces the most damage because those are the most exposed parts of the body on a regular basis and by the way this whole thing about skin cancer is not a trivially small number it's a big number in the us alone there are up to four million cases per year of what's called Squam cell carcinoma one of these forms of skin cancer so getting checked out by a highly qualified dermatologist on a yearly basis maybe even more if you're really concerned about this because you have a lot of familiar genetically inherited skin cancers things of that sort is really highly advised I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge one of our sponsors element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need that means the electrolyt sodium magnesium and pottassium in the correct amounts and ratios and nothing you don't which means no sugar now I and others on this podcast have talked about the critical importance of hydration for proper brain and body functioning even a slight degree of dehydration can diminish cognitive and physical performance it's also important that you get adequate electrolytes the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium are critical for the functioning of all the cells in your body especially your neurons your nerve cells drinking element dissolved in water makes it very easy to ensure that you're getting adequate hydration and adequate electrolytes to make sure I'm getting proper amounts of hydration and electrolytes I dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning and I drink that basically first thing in the morning I'll also drink element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing especially in hot days when I'm sweating a lot losing water and electrolytes they have a bunch of different great tasting flavors of element my favorite is the watermelon although I confess I also like the raspberry and the Citrus basically I like all the flavors and element has also just released a new line of canned sparkling element so these aren't the packets you dissolve in water these are cans of element that you crack open like any other canned drink like a soda but you're getting your hydration and your electrolytes with no sugar if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element El spelled l mn.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with the purchase of any element drink mix again that's drink element.com huberman to claim a free sample pack now with respect to everything we've talked about about sun exposure sunscreen and skin cancer I'd be remiss if I didn't discuss a study that's often used kind of as a wedge or a weapon in the online debates about sun exposure skin cancer and mortality and the title of this study is quote avoidance of sun exposure as a risk factor that's right sun exposure as a risk factor for major causes of death a competing risk analysis of the melanoma in southern Sweden cohort so the basic design of the study was to evaluate people's self-reported amount of sun exposure across many years and then to correlate that with all cause mortality and then to relate it to different causes of disease in particular cardiovascular death compare this to smokers keep in mind that some of the people who were reporting their sun exposure were smokers some weren't and the conclusion of this study that Drew a lot of attention and continues to draw a lot of attention is the following quote and here I quote from the abstract non-smokers who avoided sun exposure had a life expectancy similar to smokers in the highest sun exposure group okay I'm going to repeat that non-smokers who avoided sun exposure had a life expectancy similar to smokers in the highest sun exposure group so what many people take this to con clude is that avoiding sun exposure is as dangerous as smoking okay that's not the conclusion that I'd like you to take away because what this study basically shows is and here I continue quote compared to the highest sun exposure group life expectancy of avoiders of sun exposure was reduced by 0.6 to 2.1 years so way a second can this really be true that people that are avoiding sun exposure have a low life expectancy than people who get sun exposure and indeed in this particular study that does seem to be the case but the interpretation of this is not completely straightforward here's what we know getting some degree of sun exposure appears to be good for life expectancy that is true but is it directly related to sun exposure that's a critical question and is the increased sun exposure that one gets if you do get sun exposure linked to other issues in particular the development of melanoma as you recall melanoma was even in the title of the study so here's how I think we should think about this study it does appear that getting sun exposure is correlated with longer life expectancy but there could be any number of different reasons for that for instance people that are getting regular sun exposure presumably are also enhancing activation of the vitamin D Pathways which is related to any number of different things they no doubt are experiencing increased feelings of well-being I talked about papers that have substantiated that earlier and frankly we didn't even need a scientific study to substantiate that although it's always great to have it we know that being out in sunshine for some period of time each day as long as we don't get burned in the sun feels good why does it feel good it leads to the production of testosterone estrogen some of the endorphins that generally make us feel good it is directly related to the pathways associated with dopamine release there's a whole story there about seasonality both in humans and other animals about dopamine synthesis when we get sunlight there's elevated dopamine and serotonin and testosterone and estrogen and feelings of well-being and libido this is all well substantiated in animal models and humans so getting sun exposure makes people feel good when people feel good they tend to be lower stress when people are feeling good and they have energy because there indeed is a direct relationship between sun exposure especially to the eyes early in the day and our feelings of elevated mood and alertness and energy they tend to exercise more walk more and of course if you're outside exercising more walking more cycling swimming you're also going to get more sun exposure and we know that exercise is strongly related to improved or extended life expectancy okay so the study basically says getting sunlight as opposed to very little sunlight is good for life expectancy but it doesn't say get too much sunlight right because and this is interesting it is very clear that the people who lived longer because they were getting more sunlight also tended to have more cancers including melanoma but this is a very important point it's also the case that the longer one lives the more likely you are to develop a cancer okay so as you can see these studies that many people just draw one straightforward conclusion from such as people who get less sun exposure don't live as long as people to get more sun exposure well that's true but when you get more sun exposure very likely you're doing other things like exercise and feeling better that relate to living longer so it's very difficult if not impossible to isolate one single variable in this case sun exposure as the key variable however I'm happy to go on record saying that we know from so many studies of animal models and humans that sun exposure especially early day sun exposure when the sun is low in the sky to set your circadian rhythm and late day sun exposure okay I'm not talking about middle of the day getting baked in the Sun and you know sunburned or things of that sort but around the time of sunset especially sun exposure to the eyes is powerfully modulating your circadian rhythm to elevate daytime mood focus and alertness and improv sleep both of which are strongly correlated with improvements in mental health immune system function feelings of well-being enhanced cognition I mean there's this whole story about people with Alzheimer's and disruptions in circadian rhythms and sleep so sun exposure to the eyes in terms of setting circadian rhythm powerful powerful Improvement of life expectancy and immediate health sun exposure to the skin no doubt very powerful positive modulators of certain hormone and neuromodulator Pathways such as dopamine testosterone estrogen and so forth that make people feel good and do things generally that are good for them okay generally not all the things people do with elevated dopamine testosterone and estrogen are good for them we know that for sure but getting some sunlight that is some appropriate dosage of sunlight especially to the eyes ear in the day don't stare at the sun don't damage your eyes but getting some of that sun exposure to your eyes early in the day and some to the skin especially in the early and later part of the day clearly is positively correlated with various Health metrics in terms of mental health and physical health and not surprisingly with lifespan so I mentioned the study because I do think it's very interesting right I think it's really interesting that people who completely avoid sunlight are not living as long as people who get some sun exposure and some of this actually is on par with what's experienced with cigarette smoking I think something that everyone agrees is negative in terms of life expectancy and certainly is not good for a great number of different systems within the brain and body but I think the study sometimes is used to highlight the wrong conclusion which is that sunlight itself is extending lifespan I think that that very simple conclusion can be taken too far and can start to negate some of the equally important messages about excessive sunlight exposure causing certain problems as it relates to skin cancers which we talked about earlier as it relates to things that you can do in order to offset some of that risk with if I were to suggest a physical barrier if you need it a chemical based sunscreen if you choose to use sunscreen and of course that's an independent choice that each of us have to make for ourselves okay let's talk about youthfulness of skin or the appearance of youthfulness in skin before I did this episode I put the call out on social media for questions about skin and skin health and I must say that the vast majority of questions related to this topic and it's a very interesting one because it relates to a lot of decisions that people are making about what to do what to buy or not BU as the case may be and it is an enormous probably hundreds of billions of dollars industry if not trillion dollar industry over time this business of devices products and procedures to try and reverse aging or the appearance of Aging in skin or even create denovo new synthesis of collagen and skin and other things to make skin look more youthful okay so if we step back from this whole area we have to ask ourselves what do we know for sure about what makes skin look youthful and what can be done to make skin look more youthful and to understand the answers to those questions we simply have to go back to the beginning of today's discussion for just a moment remember that we have the EP dermal layer of skin we have the dermal layer of skin where you have the vascul the blood vessels and capillaries you have the nerve inputs there and you have a bunch of different cell types in there the cartinos sites you have different proteins within those cells like collagen elastin that over time can yes be mutated by things like UV rays from the Sun but that over time tend to lose their elasticity which leads to wrinkles and sagging skin you also have this issue of hydration of the skin right the skin has a lot of watery components within it actual water within it and those watery components are what give it its kind of plump moist look smooth look as opposed to desiccated you know sagging wrinkled look to speak in extremes and there are hundreds if not thousands of different chemicals out there that dermatologists as well as cosmetic surgeons as well as just you know frankly manufacturers of products assert are going to be good for skin so let's talk about where there is a lot of evidence for certain things that you can do if your goal is to increase the youthfulness or the appearance of youthfulness in your skin and one of the main ones is collagen itself now I have to admit I was very surprised when I looked at this literature but I was positively surprised here's why as you know there are various macronutrients present in foods you can have proteins fats and carbohydrates when we ingest proteins such as beef chicken fish eggs as well as some vegan sources of proteins like beans or lentils or tofu things of that sort they contain different amounts of different essential amino acids and those essential amino acids and other amino acids are used as the building blocks for proteins in our muscles in our tendons in essentially all the organ systems of our body the lipids are also used for cell membranes Etc okay this has been discussed various times on this podcast before people like Dr Lane Norton Dr Gabrielle lion and others it's well established that when these proteins are broken down in the gut some of those amino acids go and serve for the purpose of tissue repair others are for the purpose of other things what most people in the field of nutrition agree upon and what certainly I believe is that if you were to say eat a little bit of liver right you might have a little bit of cooked liver or a little bit of skeletal muscle in the form of like a steak that there's no selective trafficking of the amino acids that are broken down from the liver that you eat to your liver right so when you hear that eating liver supports your liver it may do that by the broad process of certain amino acids and vitamins and lipids Etc serving your liver and other organ and tissue systems of the body but not selectively your liver however when we talk about collagen this protein that forms one of the most essential aspects of what makes our skin what it is which is elastic and you know and and to have some tensile strength where we can push on it it returns to its uh original position especially if if it's well hydrated and makes our skin very youthful in appearance when we're young and then as it degrades when we get old makes it look less youthful wrinkles and sagging and so forth well then why would eating collagen protein which can come from any number of different sources it can come from fish sources it can come from Believe It or Not animal hoof sources can come from any number of different sources tendon Etc why would ingesting collagen be selectively trafficked to the collagen in our skin right that doesn't square with everything we know and yet when you look at studies including metaanalyses of studies where people supplement with collagen powders and these powders typically come from fish or Tender any number of different sources when people do this and then measures are taken as to skin appearance skin elasticity there are a bunch of measures that could be done in humans in the laboratory to do this you often will find studies that show statistically significant improvements in collagen composition and skin appearance and even the appearance of reduction in wrinkles and so forth so this is an interesting exception where the ingestion of a particular protein that naturally exists in abundance in certain tissues such as Skin but also other tissues like tendon ligaments Etc seems to be assisting in either the repair and Rejuvenation of collagen or perhaps some other aspect of collagen synthesis that leads to improvements in collagen composition and the appearance of skin in humans that's very interesting and the stud study that I find particularly interesting is one that I'll link to in the show note captions it's entitled quote exploring the impact of hydrolized collagen oral supplementation on skin Rejuvenation a systematic review and metaanalysis and the basic takeaway of this and other metaanalyses and the studies with in this metaanalyses is that when people supplement with anywhere from 5 to 15 grams okay grams of hydrolized collagen per day in particular in combination with vitamin C it doesn't have to be a of vitamin C that one can observe okay not always but can observe some visible improvements in skin composition meaning less wrinkles even some reversal of wrinkles less skin sagging more youthful appearance more kind of um let's just call it rebound elasticity of the skin I realize that's not the appropriate technical term but uh the ability of the skin to bounce back from an indentation when you push down on it as opposed to saying down or or sagging so some pretty impressive results when one considers that what people are basically doing here is just mixing up some hydrolyzed collagen protein and then uh drinking that down once per day or so now that is not to say that you have to supplement with hydrolyzed collagen why well collagen is also present in various Foods so for instance drinking bone broth beef bone broth chicken bone broth is a rich source of collagen you can go online and simply look up just by web search you can just say you know what foods contain high levels of collagen and you'll get a list of things back there hopefully a few of those are not just palatable to you but you actually like and you can start to include those in your daily diet or you could supplement with hydrolyzed collagen protein there any number of different sources for these it's interesting that while indeed I don't believe and there is frankly zero evidence for Selective trafficking of amino acids arising from a particular organ source to that particular organ when you ingest it it is interesting that consuming hydrolized collagen in the form of a supplement or deriving it from foods like bone broth Etc does seem to be able to improve collagen synthesis or the appearance of skin making it more youthful for those of you that are interested in ingesting collagen peptides as a way to improve the youthfulness of your skin should mention that the dosages there uh come in a Range depending on the studies that you've looked at and the dermatologist that I spoke to said if one decides to go down this route of supplementing or getting collagen from food sources you want to aim for anywhere from 15 gam to 30 gam of collagen peptide per day okay that's a bit higher than what was used in a number of uh studies but you'll find studies that use 30 grams and that that whole process can be augmented can be improved through ingestion of 500 to 1,000 milligrams of Vitamin C as well but check the label on those collagen peptides that you might be supplementing with because often times they already include that 500 to 1,000 milligrams of Vitamin C I should also mention that the dermatologists I spoke to said that they like collagen protein supplement ation not just for the reasons discussed up until now but that they like them for a number of other reasons such as the potential anti-inflammatory effects of collagen proteins to be honest I don't know what the exact mechanism of that is maybe if you get a certain protein threshold the inflammation is down but anyway that's still cryptic to me but in any case they did describe some of the potential mechanisms by which collagen ingestion can do its thing in terms of improving youthfulness it's broken down in the blood into dipeptides and tripeptides which then are used within the collagen itself of the skin this is the hypothesis and that it can increase the chemotaxis the mobility of fiberblast which make up some of the skin tissue and give rise to the appearance of more youthful skin there's also evidence that ingestion of hydrolized collagen peptides can improve the elasticity of the Skin Barrier on the outside right make it look nice and taut if I guess we say nice we're sort of passing subjective readout on this uh make it appear taut um through the increase of certain proteins unrelated to collagen such as filigran elastins Etc what about other peptides okay so this is a big topic nowadays especially in the online communities I did an entire episode of this podcast about peptides keep in mind that insulin is a peptide OIC what is essentially an Agonist for glucagonlike peptide one this is a very popular prescription drug now for the treatment of obesity and for the treatment of diabetes there there are lots of things that qualify as peptides a peptide is simply a small chain of amino acids a polypeptide is a bit longer chain of amino acids and then proteins are made up of amino acids okay so when we say peptides that means many many things but these days when you hear about quote unquote peptides especially in online communities generally people are referring to exogenously given okay so pills ointments or more typically injections of peptides that are designed to achieve some specific biological or physiological outcome and one of the more common of these peptides being used nowadays is one that I've talked about before called bpc157 body protection compound 157 which is essentially a synthetic version of something found in gastric juice in all of us it's known that certain peptides within the gut that bpc 157 is known to mimic or actually is a synthetic version of that exact sequence or a portion of that sequence can assist in tissue and wound repair of different kinds tendon anything involving fiber blast all of that has been well demonstrated in vitro in a dish okay so not in Vivo as well as inv Vivo in certain cases but only in animal models to my knowledge there's only one study and frankly it's not a very good study at all on bpc157 in humans and yet a lot of people are taking bpc157 either orally in the form of a capsule or pill or more typically injecting it what does it do or what does it likely do in humans we know from animal models that pc-1 157 increases angiogenesis the growth of capillaries in blood vessels we know this it can accelerate wound healing by virtue of increasing fibr blast motility for this reason it's used post injury in sports it's used by people who want to build more muscle it's used by endurance athletes it's used for cosmetic purposes anytime people are using bpc157 for any of those purposes it's likely that they're using it in part to increase the blood flow that's available to a given tissue and the repair of that tissue now again I do want to caution people that there is very little basically no evidence in humans besides the anecdotal evidence that people say they healed faster what I do know is that anytime you get vascularization of tissue you're going to get improved blood flow so it all makes sense mechanistically I also know that vascularization due to bpc157 even if it's injected locally into a given tissue is likely to occur globally throughout the body this is why some people taking oral bpc157 or injecting it you know just subcutaneously at the level of you know their stomach a little bit you know Under the Skin at the level of their stomach report faster wound healing even in a distal limb or like a hand or a nerve injury in their foot or something like that that also tells us that there's going to be increased vascularization of other tissues such as Skin such as tumors if tumors exist so you need to be very careful I need to say that upfront as a cautionary note because it is very clear that many many people are starting to either inject bpc157 or apply in the form of a topical cream in effort to get more vascularization of skin in order to make that skin appear more youthful and more and more products are out there that contain bpc157 I can't in good conscious recommend those products I can only offer to you the likely mechanism by which they work if they work and also offer you the caveat that it is unclear that bpc 157 can go transdermally if it's applied topically so if you put on a say wrinkly portion of your face so like I've got crow's feet crow's feet come from either aging smiling or both um you know crow's feet are the kind wrinkles that extend out the corners of your eyes when you smile or for me because I'm you know 48 you know probably do that even when I don't smile the the logic would be that if you take a cream containing bpc157 and you put it on there that you'll get increased vascularization of that area delivery of more growth factors in nutrients and those wrinkles will either be halted in their aging progression or that they will reverse that's the logic to my knowledge there are no clinical studies and I'd love to know from you if you've tried these products please put your experience of those in the comments on YouTube so we can get a sense of whether or not people are having good um results with this that of course is not a controlled study but I'm very curious as to know many of the products that contain bpc157 by the way also contain copper copper is a trace mineral it's found in your diet there is some evidence that copper is important for some of the collagen and other elements of skin synthesis Pathways and so the mechanistic logic and the biochemical logic is there on paper however it's also clear that ingesting too much copper can induce an inflammatory response and would lead to the exact opposite desired effect that people who are using copper and usually copper bpc containing products are taking them for which is to Halt or reverse the appearance of Aging in their skin why am I going through this whole gymnastics of you know bpc157 and copper well because nowadays many many products are starting to include quote unquote peptides for skin Rejuvenation and most often those peptides are of the copper variety of the bpc 157 variety and often times also with things related to collagen synthesis sometimes collagen directly so you'll find oral products that one takes by pill form that are bpc157 copper and or things that promote synthesis of collagen you'll find ointments that are pure bpc157 still unclear if those go transdermal okay so this is still a very very young science and most of this is not being explored in randomized control trials however I know some of you out there are pretty experimental you like experimenting with this kind of stuff you like hearing what's working for other people here's what I suggest if a sunscreen or a lotion or a pill or an injection is asserted to contain peptides to help with skin Rejuvenation make sure you look and see which specific peptides are included know the risks associated with bpc-157 it's uncertain risk about acceleration of tumor growth but the mechanistic logic is just as strong for that with bpc-157 as it is for bpc157 encouraging vascularization of any other tissue muscle tendon ligament or skin for that matter so I'm not telling you what to do just know what you're doing and understand the likely mechanisms behind it um in the absence of any of these randomized controls trials I will say in service to making sure that your diet and/or supplementation includes enough Trace mineral copper copper has been shown to play a key role in DNA repair which is a critical component of the turnover of collagen and other proteins in skin it has been shown to reduce so-called reactive oxygen species so it serves as a so-called antioxidant and and this relates to what I just said reduced inflammation but too much copper is a problem so I wouldn't run out and start supplementing with excessive amounts of copper please don't do that but you want to make sure that you're getting sufficient amounts of copper from your diet and you can simply look up online what sufficient amounts of copper are given it's a trace mineral and it's very likely that if you ingest any kind of supplement that is a multivitamin mineral supplement or a foundational nutrition supplement that includes at least some copper so it's likely that you're sort of quote unquote topped off in terms of the amount of copper that you need but very unlikely to be excessive amounts of copper but if you start supplementing with copper beyond that again you can induce an infl inflammatory response so it's a dosage uh kind of Middle Ground issue there you don't want your copper too low you don't want your copper too high you want it right there in the middle okay as I mentioned before we will talk about other components of food that are great for skin health and we'll also talk about components of certain foods like Advanced glycation end products I don't know if you've heard of those before but very interesting not good stuff that you want to avoid if you can especially if you're concern is youthful looking skin and healthy skin and frankly Health overall but before we do that I think it's worth paying attention to a few things that you can potentially take that can really improve the youthfulness of your skin for which there is excellent science to support it okay so when I spoke to board certified dermatologists who trained at excellent institutions what people can do to improve the youthfulness or the appearance of youthfulness In Their Skin and that there specifically be peer-reviewed studies to support their statements they mentioned hydrolyzed collagen protein in combination with vitamin C we talked about that earlier they mentioned a bunch of dos and don'ts as it relates to sun exposure and nutrition Etc some of which we've covered some of which we are yet to cover but will soon and they mentioned supplementing with niacinamide niacinamide is a form of vitamin B3 it is also sometimes referred to as nicotinamide and I was told that when taken at twice per day at a dosage of 500 milligrams per dose for a total of 1 gram or 1,000 milligrams per day that niacinamide supplementation can increase the production of ceramides which relate to the lipids in skin that improve the moisture in skin and by the way moisture in skin is a key component of the youthfulness or plump appearance of that skin and when I say plump I don't necessarily mean outwardly rounded plump I mean the fact that the skin looks like the outermost layer of the skin which you now know as the epidermis is kind of taut and the skin looks hydrated and smooth at the level of its outer appearance all of that is improved by niacinamide supplementation but that the supplementation has to be carried out for 3 to six months or more before that effect is noticed now the origin of the niacinamide effect on the youthfulness of skin could also be related to the fact that there's evidence that niacinamide supplementation can reduce inflammation of skin overall we haven't talked so much about the immune skin relationship although as I alluded to at the beginning of the episode this is a key relationship but for those of you suffering from rosacea from acne so rosacea being a rening of the skin we're going to talk more about it later and specific things that can be done for it acne almost always involves some rening often painful rening of specific pox on the skin sometimes even the appearance of you know pus-filled bumps this sort of thing that nicomide supplementation may also assist there because of the reduction in inflammation and we'll talk all about the relationship between inflammation and acne regardless of whether or not you suffer from rosacea acne or not at all that ninite supplementation May benefit you also because nicomide supplementation appears to balance the level of oil production in the skin you need oil in the skin you need oil down in those pores but not too much and that it can definitely help reduce the appearance of clogged pores and if you're concerned about pores that appear too large this typically happens in the face around the nose on the upper cheeks although other regions of the body as well nicomide supplementation May assist with that as well there's also a number of people out there that are concerned with specific spot spots that they see as hyperpigmented spots so regardless of whether or not overall your skin is very light or very heavily pigmented supplementation with nicomide can reduce the appearance of accumulation and maybe even the actual accumulation of melan in at particular spot so-called dark pigmented spots that some people decide that they don't want for whatever reason usually just cosmetic reasons although there may be reasons why hyperpigmentation in a given area could relate to skin cancers we talked about that earlier another reason to go get not just your moles but all of your skin checked at least once per year now if you decide to supplement with niacinamide you have the option of either taking that th000 migs and 2 500 Mig dosages per day you also have the option of using any number of different topical niacinamide ointments or serums that exist out there keep in mind that many skincare products already contain niacinamide so check the label and there the dermatologists tell me that to be effective the nicomide needs to be present at at least a two and as high as 10% concentration within those ointments or serums keep in mind that many serums and ointments also contain what's called hyaluronic acid hyaluronic acid is a natural component of the skin that provides a physical substrate for holding in water so moisture within the skin it does a bunch of other important things too within the extracell Matrix and elsewhere the regions between the cells that is and supplementation with hyaluronic acid or ointments or serums that contain hyaluronic acid and niacinamide are pretty common out there because of the already stated effects of niacinamide and the fact that hyaluronic acid can serve as what's called a humectant something that serves to S barrier in moisture at the level of the skin okay so it gives that kind of um Plumping uh moist look of skin that's characteristic of youthful skin as opposed to aged skin the dermatologists and the cosmetic surgeons that work on faces that I spoke to I told you I consulted with a fairly large and Diversified Group of folks um in preparation for this episode all agreed that supplementation with collag vitamin C niacinamide and hyaluronic acid was something that they suggest to their patients the other supplement well actually it's a prescription treatment most often that dermatologists recommend if the goal is youthful appearing skin are things within the so-called retinoid pathway such as retinol okay many of you have perhaps heard of this and it's a whole story related to the relationship between vitamin A and skin okay so Trenton Noah is the common name for it although some of you may know it as retina and prescription drugs that are similar to that are basically derivatives of vitamin A why why are these used for skin care why are they used to increase the youthfulness of skin well vitamin A gets into skin cells and is converted into something called retin aldhy then into something called retinoic acid now very important to know that retinoic acid is involved in a lot of different cellular processes especially during neural development this is why and please pay careful attention to this this is why women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should avoid taking these products because it can seriously disrupt the development of the fetus okay and keep in mind that many times people don't realize they're pregnant for some period of time so this is of Paramount concern okay we could have a whole discussion as to the role of retinoic acid in fetal development but you don't want to tamper with that pathway okay very serious consequences can occur okay so when retinoic acid gets into cells it can activate what's called transcription factors transcription factors bind to DNA okay your genetic code and can induce the transcription and translation of DNA into RNA and RNA into proteins of particular types so think of transcription factors is sort of setting a menu of different proteins that ultimately will be formed okay by binding to DNA and then you get DNA to RNA rnate a protein and you're getting a set of proteins related to a particular process that's generally how transcription factors work and retina Treno and things similar to that are going to induce the formation of collagen protein within skin as well as other proteins that relate to the formation of denovo skin new skin and can replace old degenerated skin so the dermatologists that I spoke to were really bullish about the fact that believe it or not they felt that people starting in their 20s could very well as long as they're not pregnant or lactating or planning to get pregnant could take a or things similar to it in order to stimulate the production of more skin and look more youthful now for people already in their 20s you know by my RAID they're already youthful but that they could initiate the use of these compounds at least in one's 20s and continuing on really as long as they wanted through life and they told me about quote remarkable results so I said well why isn't everyone aware of this why isn't everyone taking them well it turns out that these different compounds can also increase sensitivity to life make you more prone to sunburn to some of the other effects of light on skin even from screens or from artificial lights so one has to be careful about inducing too much skin sensitivity to light of all kinds not just sunlight that they can also induce some redness or dryness so one has to get the dosage right the frequency of use right they can be a little bit tricky to work with but that if one can home in on the right dosages the right frequency Etc the dermatologist felt like this was one of the best things that one could do to improve the youthfulness or the appearance of youthfulness in one's skin now I find this interesting for a number of reasons first of all I've heard of retina right I've heard of these compounds before um but I hadn't heard about all these you know reportedly spectacular things like improved angiogenesis vascularization of the skin this is why people are taking the rather um experimental untested bpc157 that I talked about before um the improved elasticity of skin which somehow seems related to the ability of these compounds to remove degenerated elastin within the skin to clear that out as well as to induce denovo synthesis and even the number of different fiber blasts that are present in skin so more new skin clearing away of old skin improved vascularization and while all of this sounds a little bit too good to be true the mechanisms by which it's asserted to work all hold up so that's always reassuring right mechanism isn't everything but it's really nice to see there for instance these compounds are known to get into the nucleus of cells right to impact gene expression and we talked about that before you have receptors on the surface of cells okay so cell surface receptors you also have nuclear receptors and the ability of certain things we call them ligans but these are chemicals right in this case you know in the vitamin A pathway to get into the nucleus of cells and impact gene expression this is actually how hormones like testosterone and estrogen change the way that people look so dramatically during puberty they actually you know they operate by binding the cell surface receptors they also get into the nuclear compartment of the cell they bind to nuclear receptors and they turn on entire genetic program prams that cause for instance deepening of The Voice or the growth of hair or breast tissue Etc so these are powerful compounds now I talked to a cosmetic surgeon expert in face specifically uh remember cosmetic surgery is done for a number of different areas of the of the body but for face specifically who also specializes in these sorts of treatments for skin and they've started using and are frankly quite confident in the use of retinoid Esters that can be applied to the surface of the skin these things are available not by prescription there's far less research on these sorts of compounds but these compounds get enough positive support from the people that have tried them reporting improved youthfulness of skin Etc that some of them are becoming quite sought-after and um people let's just say are very enthusiastic about them and I will say that in discussing the various mechanisms of this with these cosmetic surgeons and some dermatologists the logic holds up so you're starting to see more and more of these now as I mentioned at the beginning of today's episode there is zero business relationship between me the podcast or any of these um people that have marketed serums or creams or prescription drugs for that matter related to skin health and skincare however I have provided a couple links in the show note captions of some of the different sources of these obviously if you need a prescription for something like Trent noan or something similar because you're interested in this whole retinol retina um vitamin A pathway story you need to talk to a board certified dermatologist who could potentially prescribe that for you if they decide it's right for you but in terms of these topical ointments and serums and creams and things like that I do provide a link to at least one source of those that uses the retinoid Esther just keep in mind that these various ointments and serums do not yet have the randomized control trials to support them that some of the other compounds that we were discussing do have now I'd like to talk about things that one can do to improve the health and appearance of one's skin that don't involve taking anything or putting on any kind of ointment or serum or anything like that and what I'm referring to is phototherapy now at the earlier part of the episode I talked about how different wavelengths of light like UV light and long wavelength light can penetrate skin to different depths and some of the negative but also positive things that that can do so for instance we talked about UV light mutating DNA in cells and potentially causing cancers accelerating the aging process and so forth but as you also recall long wavelength light so-called red light and near infrared light which is even longer wavelengths of light can penetrate deep into the skin tissue so pass that outer epidermal layer into the dermal layers of the skin and can access the vasculature the neurons some of the glands located deeper in the skin and of course the cells there like cells in the epidermis I should point out contain things like mitochondria for which red light has been shown to be beneficial why red light and near infrared light phototherapy has been shown to reduce reactive oxygen speed species and thereby to improve mitochondrial function in cells and that in turn has been shown to be beneficial for all the different processes within cells that involve mitochondria which of course include energy production but a bunch of other things too so when I say that photo therapy has been shown to be beneficial for cells of the body it's not just cells of the skin in fact a Nobel Prize was granted in the early 1900s for the use of phototherapy for the treatment of Lupus so this is not a new technology at the same time while there are many studies exploring the use of phototherapy for improvement of skin health and appearance most of those Studies have fairly low sample sizes but there are a lot of those studies and fortunately by now there are a few metaanalyses and reviews that take into account lots of different studies using slightly different wavelengths of light appli to different portions of the face for different purposes treatment of acne U maybe even um putting red light near infrared light on one half of the face to have a so-called within person control to compare you know the changes in skin or lack of changes in skin as the case may be between one side of the face and the other um I'll put links to some of these studies and some of the metaanalyses and reviews of these studies one that I like in particular was published in 2018 entitled light emitting diodes in dermatology a systematic review of randomized control Trials of course randomized control trials being one very powerful way to analyze the utility of a practice or a compound it's not the only way to assess the utility of something I know some people argue that they are very use ful but keep in mind in the field of medicine we often have entire fields or even entire chapters of medical books that are based on case studies for instance we implicate the so-called hippocampus of the brain for its function in human memory which it absolutely has and that fact largely Grew From one major case study that then exploded into a number of different animal model and then human studies later on so we all love randomized control trials reviews of randomized control trials and the uses of the phototherapy for treatment of skin conditions and improving the quality of skin are wonderful and point to the fact that phototherapy can indeed improve the appearance of skin in conditions like acne can accelerate wound healing can improve the youthfulness appearance of skin but these effects tend to be somewhat mild to moderate when they occur and certainly there are many studies that show no significant effect no statistically significant effect that said I'm of the belief based on my read of the literature and this is a literature I've spent a lot of time with frankly because I did an episode all about light and health I've also been very interested in the use of phototherapy for the treatment of eye diseases and offsetting age related decline in visual function there's some interesting evidence there again mild to moderate effects but that can be meaningful in the real world and when I step back from all of the literature here's what I see and this is what I ran by a dermatologist to make sure that they they thought that this protocol would be useful or not useful right I asked them I didn't tell them do you think this will be useful tell me yes I asked them and what we basically converged on was that if somebody decides to do phototherapy the use of phototherapy that involves long wavelengths of light so red light Plus near infrared light typically at a distance of about a foot to 2 feet from the light source depending on the intensity of the light source although that doesn't seem to be so critical but one can't be across the room from the red light source nor should one get right up next to the red light source so that there's a lot of heat generated from the red light source that one can feel but at a distance of about a foot to 2 feet away at fairly High intensities done for anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes 5 to 7even days per week on a consistent basis does seem on average to lead to improvements in the youthfulness appearance of skin why this would be the case isn't exactly clear but there are number of different logical interpretations such as reduced inflammation improved mitochondrial function all Downstream of reduced reactive oxygen species improved blood flow to that particular area because of the effect that long wavelength light can have on vasod dilation of expansion as opposed to contraction of blood vessels and capillaries all of this makes mechanistic logical sense and the effects that one sees in these various peer-reviewed papers randomized control trials seem pretty good meaning there are mild to moderate none of them are sort of jaw-dropping like wow complete reversal of severe acne or you know massively accelerated wound healing and we also of course have to take into account that many people who are doing phototherapy often are combining it with other things sometimes in today's era like injections of bpc-157 or the use of hyaluronic acid or niacinamide Etc so these things aren't always being examined in isolation but when we look at this literature I think it's fair to say that there is now substantial evidence for the use of phototherapy y for improving the quality of skin and in some cases for reducing the symptoms of acne reducing the symptoms of psoriasis basically any condition where improved blood flow lowered inflammation fewer or reduced oxygen species improved mitochondrial function delivery of nutrients anytime some or all of those things are going to be involved phototherapy makes logical sense and so it's no surprise that we're seeing increased evidence for phototherapy in these conditions now I've provided a link to the review of the random control trials that I mentioned a bit ago I also provided a few links to some specific studies that show pictures of before and after some cases on two sides of the very same face I did an entire episode about light and health I'll also provide a link to that episode and if you don't want to listen to or watch that entire episode you can go to specific um timestamps in that episode to learn about the uses of phototherapy for the treatment of skin eye and other conditions related to mental health and physical health now keep in mind that when people hear phototherapy they almost immediately think about a device and that makes sense right red light near infrared light however if you recall there's this thing called the Sun that emits full spectrum light which of course includes red light and longer wavelengths of light okay so just because you can't see those longer wavelengths of light that doesn't mean they're not there just like UV light you can't sense UV light with your eyes by the way ground squirrels and some other animals can it's thought to be the case that they have photo receptors to detect UV because they actually this is sort of strange but interesting you'll never forget this that they'll take their urine and they'll spread it on their stomach with their little paws and they'll stand up and they'll like signal flash one another from across the Prairie or whatever it is across the lawn to signal to one another so they're sending uvp signals across the lawn I'm not making this up I actually studied a little bit of this when I was an undergraduate but not at the level of the urine and the signaling at the level of the retina any discussion about skin has to include a discussion about nutrition why remember the fact that I mentioned at the beginning of today's episode that your skin and your immune system have a very intimate relationship it's bidirectional your skin reflects the status of your immune system in many ways and this is why many people with autoimmune conditions things like lyen planis you can look it up or if you you know mind uh particularly you know striking photographs please don't look it up but people that have autoimmune conditions that often manifests in skin conditions we'll talk more about this in the context of psoriasis in a little bit but anytime we're talking about the immune system or skin we need to take into account the gut microbiome and nutrition so many people asked what are the things that they should eat to have healthy appearing youthful skin they also asked what are the things that one eats that could exacerbate things like acne and what can one eat in order to reduce their acne so let's just start off with the basics and here I'm going to be fairly brief because I think we all know the big take-home message about nutrition nowadays we hear over and over again and we should pay attention to the fact that the vast majority of our food well I should say if one desires to be healthy mentally healthy physically healthy and a high performing individual in any number of different things cognitive physical or otherwise we want to consume the vast majority of our foods from nonprocessed or minimally processed sources so-called Whole Foods so fruits vegetables if that's within your diet some people include grains some people don't I'm not here to discuss that meat eggs fish chicken and so forth if that's within your diet plan or your nutrition or if you're a vegetarian or vegan you make the associated adjustment so that you can make sure you're getting enough protein and amino acids but it's in keeping with your ethical and maybe your health goals okay so we're not here to discuss vegan vegetarian omnivore of which I am or carnivore okay that's not the discussion I think all of those groups agree that getting the majority of your nutrition from nonprocessed or minimally processed foods is going to be best and that of course if you're human sometimes you'll ingest processed foods but really trying to avoid highly processed foods is critical now with respect to the specific foods that can improve skin appearance and skin Health it's very clear that diets that are of the so-called lowi inflammatory type that don't spark inflammation so these would be things that sometimes are referred to as the Mediterranean diet or a Paleo like Diet you hear these terms but what what are we really talking about mostly Whole Foods minimally processed foods okay and then there's variation depending on whether or not you emphasize or deemphasize meat and fish or emphasize or deemphasize vegetables this kind of thing again I'm an omnivore I love fruit I love vegetables I do like rice oatmeal and some pastas I like a great sourdough bread I like butter I like olive oil I like meat I like fish I think I am representative of most people out there because I eat most all those things but I also eat the occasional croissant I also eat the occasional slice of pizza I don't eat a lot of that stuff but I eat it now and again and then of course you have people that are super strict what do we know about the relationship between specific foods and skin health and skin appearance well anti-inflammatory diet we've more or less spelled out what that represents without getting into too many specifics and then there are the specific components within Foods so vitamins minerals and micronutrients as well as things like collagen present in bone broth that can be really useful to include so one one of the I think best accounts on dermatologic health and skin health and appearance on the Internet is Dr Andrea Suarez she's a medical doctor board certified dermatologist and she has a wonderful video that describes the various foods that one can eat to promote skin health and skin appearance and rather than repeat that entire video because a that wouldn't be right and B um it already exists out there in excellent form I'll just give a brief synopsis of some of the things that she suggests because I entirely agree and again there's no need to be repetive and she does an excellent job so she certainly mentions collagen and bone broth she also mentions various sources of omega fatty acids that are often lacking in people's diets that they should pay extra careful attention to get so things like walnuts flax fatty fish I personally am a big believer in supplementing with liquid form fish oil that's what I do why am I a big believer in that well I don't tend to cook much fatty fish I love the taste of it if it's prepared right but I don't tend to do that very often so I use a liquid form fish oil or capsules but the liquid form is generally more affordable this was discussed in episode that I did with Dr Ronda Patrick so we can put a link to that particular segment in the show note captions it's also suggested that we eat a lot of leafy greens so dark leafy greens you're probably noticing a lot of these recommendations are kind of typical for what people describe anytime they're talking about nutrition for health she highly recommends people get enough folic acid for the role that folic acid plays in DNA synthesis is and repair of skin cells as among other cells and cell proliferation and of course we should get our colored fruits and veggies so our oranges our strawberries the Reds and oranges are critical out there and she also highlights something very important that I want to reiterate which is that we have a critical need for Vitamin A for our skin health and this was covered albeit through the lens of exploring the pharmacology of trentino and those retin A compounds but vitamin A is crucial for a number of different processes with in the cell types that make up skin she appropriately cautions against supplementing with vitamin A because it's a fat soluble vitamin it's very easy to overdose vitamin A if one is supplementing with too much of it she recommends rather getting enough vitamin A from things like oranges carrot sweet potatoes she recommends as much Berry intake as is appropriate for someone and one can afford the berries are so delicious but they tend to be expensive Depending on time of year ingesting things like garlic because garlic has sulfur which is key for collagen synthesis and repair and she talks about the critical role of torine anyway she does such a terrific job of describing the nutrition for skin health and skin appearance those are just a few of the highlights I do encourage you to check out that video and her other content is spectacular as well again she has an Instagram account YouTube channel that are really wonderful so again without doing a deep dive into nutrition decide whether or not you're going to be vegan vegetarian omnivore or carnivore and then make sure that you're getting enough of the vitamins and minerals and micronutrients from your Foods or supplement if necessary but note that caution about vitamin A supplementation in excess and also make sure you're avoiding excessive amounts of Highly processed foods you know I mentioned earlier these Advanced glycation end products these are things that are present in a lot of processed foods like crackers and chips and things like that that make those Foods inflammatory so you're getting the theme now inflammation is bad not just for the skin but for all organ systems of the body it's not just about the high density of calories and the high density of taste present in highly processed foods those are problematic but a lot of the issue with these highly processed foods is the high heat conditions used to make those Foods stable on shelves or stable in packaging over time okay so there's a whole discussion to be had here that frankly I don't think iy had enough but that is outside the scope of today's episode the point is that when these highly processed foods are basically made right they're constructed um they involve the interactions between sugars and proteins and fats at high heat that make them stable on the shelf or in packaging and those can be very inflammatory and that can show up in the form of reactive skin it can make your psoriasis worse yes it can make your acne worse it can make your skin more tender and painful it can make your skin basically more reactive to some of the underlying predispositions you might have either because of genetics or other things you're doing or not doing maybe you're going through a particularly stressful time maybe you're getting a little a little bit of extra sun and you're eating more highly processed foods and those things are combining and making your skin break out or flush more than it would ordinarily again there's so many reasons to eat most of your foods from non-processed or minimally processed sources and of course and now I sound like a broken record because you can hear this all over the Internet ingesting foods that are excessively high in sugar excessively high in sugars combined with fats just not good to do pro-inflammatory it's going to cause all sorts of issues and we're going to get into this more as it relates to acne in particular because as you probably know when you ingest foods that are high in sugars or even just carbohydrates generally that also contain a lot of fats and in particular when those foods are highly processed well then you initiate an inflammatory response and you often can initiate additional things happening in the pores of cells that can start to really aggravate acne and cause more acne this has to do with the whole insulin pathway so when we talk about acne I'll talk about diets that create a high glycemic load we're not necessarily talking about the glycemic index of food you may know that when people measure the glycemic index of food they're looking at the blood sugar response after eating that food typically in isolation and not in combination with other Foods what I'm talking about is eating combinations of foods that induce high levels of insulin high levels of blood glucose that then lead to all sorts of things in the hormone Pathways and cell growth Pathways that exacerbate acne so we'll get there in a moment but I think the Takeo message around nutrition is pretty clear so much so that I don't want to to spend any more time on it we all know what the best nutrition really is for us regardless of whether or not you're vegan vegetarian omnivore or carnivore it's nonprocessed or minimally processed foods representing probably anywhere from let's say 75 to 100% of your food intake depending on how strict you want to be and then sure make some room if you want for some processed foods but just know that those Advanced glycation end products and the high glycemic load that comes from those processed foods can really exacerbate inflammatory responses in skin and set for it a whole domino set of issues related to hormone Pathways and cell growth Pathways that make everything acne psoriasis and overall appearance worse yes your skin will appear to age faster and on the positive side most of the foods that we think of as healthy and anti-inflammatory are actually quite delicious so enjoy ah and I forgot to say what's absolutely clear you know that myth that they told us when we were teenagers they eat a lot of fried food would make you break out would make your skin worse guess what it's true that high heat preparation required for creating things as delicious as the doughnut or french fries right there's a reason people love these Foods they're so delicious they do cause problems they're pro-inflammatory does that mean you can never have a french fry no you decide what's best for you but know what you're doing as a segue to talking about acne we need to talk about the gut microbiome and this is a direct outgrowth of our discussion about nutrition here's the simple takeaway that I believe everyone should follow not just for sake of healthy appearing skin but also for sake of every organ and tissue system in your body which is the data clearly show that ingestion of sufficient amounts of fiber so Prebiotic and probiotic fiber so fruits vegetables sometimes this can also come from grains some people will supplement with additional fiber if they feel they need it as well as ingestion of low sugar fermented foods talked about this before so regular listeners of this podcast may have heard this things like kimchi sauerkraut the sort of sauerkraut that has to stay in the fridge so not the stuff that's stable on the Shelf at room temperature anything containing a brine that salty brine so pickles but not the pickles that are stable at room temperature the ones that have to be kept in the refrigerated section of the grocery store these low sugar fermented foods are powerful enhancers of the gut microbiome and when the gut microbiome is healthy you have reduced overall inflammation in the body this is often reflected at the level of the skin and basically skin health and the youthfulness appearance of skin is enhanced okay this can also help with conditions like acne or psoriasis especially in conditions where there's a direct immune system skin relationship that we'll talk about more in a little bit okay so I highly recommend people have anywhere from 1 to four servings of low sugar fermented foods per day or try and enhance the health of their gut microb biome generally maybe you take a pill probiotic although those can be very expensive there's a little bit of data suggesting that if you chronically take pill probiotics that yield very high levels of bacteria well then maybe there's some Associated brain fog that's a little unclear pun intended but you know they are very expensive they have to be kept refrigerated and let's face it low sugar fermented foods if you find the ones that you like are really great to ingest cuz they're tasty and they're good for you now why am I talking about this in part because we keep coming back to inflammation as a general issue for skin health and that points us also towards some specific dos and don'ts as it relates to Lifestyle let's face it pun intended if you sleep well so maybe you need six hours maybe you need seven maybe you need eight maybe you need nine but if you sleep well on a consistent basis your skin is going to look so much better so much healthier more vibrant than if you are not getting enough sleep if you drink alcohol and you wake up the next morning you know your Skin's going to look puffy it's not going to look good but many of you can ingest alcohol without issues I've an entire episode about alcohol yes it's a poison up to two drinks per week for adults who are non-alcoholics is probably safe zero is better than any but let's face it alcohol is going to exacerbate most skin issues this is just clear from the literature doesn't mean you never have a glass of wine doesn't mean you never have a beer or a cocktail if that's your thing but alcohol consumed in excess and it doesn't take much to get there is going to cause sleep issues microbiome issues so indirectly and negatively impact the skin appearance and health and indirectly and negatively impact the health of other tissues in your body but it's clear some of that is reduced to increase inflammation some is related to decreased Sleep Quality or duration so get great sleep avoid alcohol in excess maybe avoid it allog together drink plenty of water this sounds like such basic advice but proper hydration is key get enough water in electrolytes it absolutely will impact your inflammation Levels by reducing them it absolutely will impact your skin health and appearance in a positive way so these are just basic things that I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the other one is smoking and nicotine from non-smoked sources so it's very clear that smoking vaping dipping or snuffing is bad for skin appearance and health bad bad bad every dermatologist said this why well with smoking you can imagine why okay a lot of carcinog and toxic end products generated from smoking even from vaping yes even from vaping it will make your skin age faster that's clear but it's also the substance itself why all of those things in addition to increasing inflammation nicotine itself is a vasoconstrictor so you're doing the exact opposite of what you want when it comes to skin health and appearance and that's why people take things like bpc 157 that's why people take nicotinamide that's why people are trying to improve the hydration status of their skin so if you're somebody that's vaping nicotine or even taking nicotine in some other form pouch or smoking nicotine and you're interested in having youthful appearing skin you are really shooting yourself in the I know face and as we all know our emotions impact the appearance of our skin and yes it can exacerbate so-called breakouts and we'll get to that in a moment as to what the exact pathway is but I've done entire episodes about controlling your stress we have a master stress episode that talks about real time tools that you can use like the physiological sigh provide a link to a clip about the physiological sigh it's the fastest way that I'm aware of to reduce one's levels of stress this is something my laboratory has studied in detail at Stanford there are also things you can do and we're all aware of what they are proper sleep meditation non-sleep deep rest we'll provide a link for that all things that we can do that are zero cost very minimal time investment physiological side takes about 10 to 15 seconds uh non-sleep deep breast AK Yoga Nidra sometimes called takes anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes per day and that reduced stress can dramatically improve not just the health but the appearance of your skin and it makes perfect sense as to why that is the stress hormones such as cortisol but other hormones too such as adrenaline when they are chronically elevated because of the fact that adrenaline impacts Vaso constriction in the skin it's going to reduce blood flow to the periphery to the skin it can cause all sorts of issues at the level of nerve endings that can lead to believe it or not enhanced Flushing when we're under stress this is why we measure the galvanic skin response so not just sweating but also blood flow and other things to the skin when we are studying stress okay so direct relationship between stress and skin appearance learn to control your stress stress is part of life but learn to control your stress in real time and through tools like non-sleep deep rest that are zero cost that can help you reduce your overall levels of stress get great sleep don't use nicotine if you do use nicotine know what you're doing maybe use it sparingly and please don't smoke or vape it dip it or snuff it there are other form forms and I don't recommend those forms because they're very very addictive and keep in mind that things that improve blood flow reduce inflammation give you lower stress better sleep all of that is going to make you look more youthful it's not an imagined effect it is real let's talk about acne acne is very common it impacts anywhere from 80 to 90% of young people at some point some people get very bad cystic acne you know deep acne in the cheeks on the back of the neck the back it can be very uncomfortable very painful some people only get the oal pimple but they get them very deeply they're very painful and look nobody likes acne nobody likes the appearance of acne on themselves it can be very distressing for people it can cause additional stress that then feeds back in terms of inflammation and you know I guess my first uh you know request I suppose I I can't tell people what to do and never do but you know for people that have acne you know be compassionate okay young people be compassionate I remember when I was younger some of the kids with bad acne got teased and it it really upset me as is really frustrating especially when going through puberty because there's this hormonal component to acne now fortunately there are things that we can do for acne I'll provide a link to one of the major sources I used for researching this episode I also of course spoke to dermatologists one of whom really knows an exceptional amount about acne and its relationship to the immune system the paper that I'm referring to now is a systematic review and network metaanalysis of topical pharmacological oral pharmacological physical and combined treatments for acne GIS which is the technical name for acne there are a lot of things that impact acne let's just briefly talk about what acne is anytime you talk about acne you're usually thinking about pus or oil that's called sebum the sebum accumulates in essentially the follicle around the hair this also occurs on non-hairy skin or where they're just tiny little hairs that often aren't uh visible that's why it's very unusual to get acne on say the glabrous skin of the Palms I suppose it could happen but it's very rare at any given moment 10% of people worldwide will have acne as I mentioned up to 90% of young people have acne so very common very distressing the accumulation of that sebum in the follicle can be due to a number of different things some of it can be related to androgens things like testosterone increasing the amount of sebum that's produced okay this is why you often see acne during puberty in addition the anabolic the progrowth effects of androgens such as testosterone and by the way these occur in both males and females because both males and females have testosterone and estrogen the androgenic effects of testosterone can also cause hypertrophy growth of the hair follicle right so an increase in the number of catinos sites the cells in and around the follicle which can compress that and hold some of that additional sebum beneath the surface and that's why you're getting a swelling of what looks like a pimple or a cyst so there's the potential for a hormonal influence on increasing acne now if someone going through puberty you just have to deal with that increase now if there's a sudden increase in acne when one is post puberty you may want to look at levels of androgens that are being produced and nowadays with increasing numbers apparently of things like polycystic ovarian syndrome which in part relates to increases in androgens this is becoming an additional concern so getting a quality blood test looking at Androgen levels over time can be very beneficial for both males and females now in addition insulin that is related to our diet so insulin and glucose generally go up together or down together depending on whether or not we're ingesting Foods or amounts of foods that greatly increase our insulin and blood glucose so insulin is part of an anabolic pathway as well a cell growth pathway progrowth pathway we should call it that involves mtor mamalian Target of rapamycin that is a general growth signal for cells so this occurs in the eye this occurs in the liver you know mtor is involved involved in growth of cells of all kinds including cells within the skin when our diet increases the amount of insulin and glucose to a degree that is in excess of some threshold that's going to be different for everybody depending on your activity levels your metabolism the way you manage insulin when that happens you get increases in mtor that then can feed back on those Androgen receptors increase the levels of things like testosterone further that then feed back on the production of increased SE okay that oily stuff increased kosy proliferation and you get more acne in other words having a diet that has a high glycemic load or evokes a large insulin response can be problematic so what to do well we talked about it before you want to eat mostly nonprocessed minimally processed foods you definitely want to exert portion control right you don't want to eat much sugar or sugar in excess you don't want big spikes in insulin and blood glucose you want to avoid inflammatory diet so again fewer if any highly processed foods because of those glycation n products that we talked about before and on the positive side if one exercises something like say intermittent fasting and here I don't necessarily think young people especially people going through puberty should do this because they're growing they need nutrients so you have to strike that balance between getting enough nutrients and not overloading the system with insulin glucose and calories but things like intermittent fasting could be useful or making sure that if you ingest complex carbohydrates as I mentioned I do okay I'm an omnivore that you don't do it in excess to the point where you're getting big spikes in insulin and blood glucose all of this the dermatologist tell me can help serve to reduce acne and while it might seem indirect you know this relationship between testosterone and sebum accumulation the relationship between insulin and mtor and increased testosterone and SE sebum accumulation and growth of the carattino sites these are real Pathways that have been established and some of those are discussed in detail in the review so much so that there has been the exploration of specific Foods in particular Dairy and Whey you know we hear a lot about ingestion of whey protein it's a very high quality protein High bioavailability high in the amino acid Lucine which for those of you that are interested in muscle building and repair there's a lot of discussion about Lucine being a critical component there you want Lucine but it does appear that people that overc consume whey people that over consume Dairy can run into issues now does that mean you shouldn't consume whey protein no I take whey protein do I suffer from acne no if I did would I reduce my whey protein intake well I might decide to run a bit of an experiment where I reduce the amount of whey protein that I eat for a little bit and see how that goes should I reduce the amount of dairy I ingest ah well here's where things get interesting so in discussing this with a dermatologist who also happens to know a lot about nutrition they told me something very interesting a lot of people think that high-fat Dairy will exacerbate their acne but here's the situation nonfat and low-fat Dairy has emulsifiers this actually based on work I believe some of which was done at Stanford that can Spike insulin more than full fat Dairy so some people in an attempt to reduce the amount of acne they're getting will move from high fat dairy or full fat I should say to non-fat milk or non-fat dairy or low fat Dairy and their acne will actually get worse and that could be because of the insulin Spike associated with some of the Ulsa fires in that non-fat and low-fat Dairy so what this means is that you don't have to avoid Dairy altogether but you might be better off ingesting full fat Dairy you might be best off not ingesting any dairy at all maybe you want to run that experiment on yourself and just see what works and what doesn't work or if there's no change at all in addition if you're consuming a lot of fried foods so those french fries you're ingesting cheeseburgers and things of that sort it may not be so much the fat content of those meals but rather the big insulin response that occurs when we ingest high fat meals in common with things like sugary milkshakes or fried foods like french fries and things of that sort that's leading to the acne by way of increased inflammation right so there are a lot of different Pathways inflammation androgens like testosterone insulin leading to increases in testosterone and inflammation a lot of Pathways converge to exacerbate acne and often times it's just the removal or even just the reduction of some of this food intake or types of food intake that can really lead to Big improvements in one's acne so all of these things combined to support lower inflammation appropriate amounts of sebum production because you do need sebum production you do need cartinos sites in and around the hair follicle but you don't want too many of them and so on but what can be done to directly address acne well there are a number of different prescription treatments that your dermatologist can suggest but one thing that all the dermatologists agree upon is first of all getting adequate sleep reducing stress taking care of your gut microbiome the nutrition recommendations that we've been talking about up until now but also get this this is interesting not over cleansing a lot of people with acne will start to wash their face constantly and we'll often use harsh cleansers that can exacerbate that acne either by virtue of removing some important skin microbiome components that then lead to even other infections like fungal infections or additional inflammation because you're removing that microbiome barrier but they all recommend regular cleansing of the skin usually two or three times per day but not in excess of that using a gentle unscented unfragranced cleanser okay so they're number of different types of these I personally my basically my entire life that I at least as far as I can remember I've always used unscented unfragranced Dove soap okay I have no relationship to Dove soap I'm sure people out there are going to say oh my goodness you know it contains a bunch of things that are bad for you but that's what's worked for me and not the liquid form just bar soap and there are things like Cetaphil these are some brand names and there are a bunch of other more sophisticated gentle cleansers that one could use there are also a lot of products out there that contain what's called salicylic acid okay this as often as um you know clear fluid that you put onto a cotton ball or a tissue and then you you spread on on the face it's very important very very important that if you're going to use these products that you do it on clean skin that is skin that's been cleaned with a combination of mild zero fragrance soap and lukewarm water okay because of the relationship between inflammation and acne that's what gives it its red appearance you don't want to use extreme temperatures of especially hot water when washing your skin so lukewarm water mild soap and then and only if it's been recommended by your dermatologist the salicylic acid salicylic acid comes from the same class of drugs as aspirin so it tends to reduce cattiny stickiness right the extent to which um those cells stick together why do I mention aspirin well you may have heard that people will take aspirin to reduce the stickiness between their platelets and an attempt to improve heart health we'll cover that on another episode at some point but salicylic acid reduces the stickiness of the coratin oyes so it can lead to less clogging of the pores by accumulation of carattino sites or I should say by less accumulation of the cortinos sites and it can reduce swelling in and around the area related to the acne sometimes if people get an acne pimple especially if they have an event or they don't want to be seen with that pimple the use of a little bit of corticosteroid cream put on there can reduce the redness or swelling the dermatologists tell me you should absolutely not pop your pimples part of the problem when you pop a pimple I know there entire videos about this online I know please don't go look at them these uh the whole communi is around this is super gross but I know people find it very satisfying in some cases to pop these pimples get the infection out while there are certain use cases for that where someone has an infection it just absolutely needs to get out then be cleaned then covered with a bandage and maybe some topical antibiotic that would be a use case for that the dermatologist practically begged me to tell you don't pop your pimples because a they will go away in not too much time if you leave them alone and B you can always put a little bit of corticosterone cream on top of them to reduce the redness or swelling but most importantly they tell me that when you pop those pimples what ends up happening is you get a mechanical a physical disruption of that area which to you might just seem like okay whatever it turns a little bit red and that's transient but you get the influx of what are called Matrix metalloproteases these are enzymes remember anytime you hear an ace it's usually an enzyme Matrix Metallo proteases that then and go eat at The extracellular Matrix and then you can get an indentation scar that is permanent okay so if you're concerned about the appearance of your skin avoid popping those pimples I know it can be hard to do but really try and avoid popping pimples it can lead to scarring because of the Matrix metallic proteases and the eating away of the exellar Matrix keep the area clean cover it up if you need to get some cortico stero and cream on there if you want to reduce the redness if it's really bad and you have some big important event like you're getting married tomorrow and it's right on the tip of your nose or something like that then you can potentially go to the dermatologist and get it injected with a corticosteroid to reduce the redness um in a more potent way but they did ask that I ask you to please not pop your pimples and if you're somebody that suffers from acne I'd like you to know I provide a link to a paper in the show note captions entitled acne and diet a review of pathogenic mechanisms and I also provide a link to the review I mentioned before that covers all of the other aspects of treating acne topical pharmacological oral pharmacological physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris because again I do sympathize with the fact that acne can be very distressing very painful fortunately there are a number of different avenues that you without a dermatologist but ideally you and a dermatologist can use use to attack acne at the level of inflammation through diet through lifestyle if needed prescription medications and again gentle cleansing and thinking about the various things that indirectly will impact that acne so much so that a few of the derms told me that they have patients young and old who will be suffering from really bad acne that will sometimes just make a few adjustments to their diet the exclusion of certain things mainly highly processed foods maybe reducing Dairy a little bit or weigh a little little bit or completely and increasing the amount of things that reduce inflammation so more fruits and vegetables and meat fish eggs from healthy sources and seeing dramatic improvements in acne so that's always reassuring to hear doesn't always require prescription medication but if you need it you should take it okay let's talk about rosacea rosacea is rening of the skin and some people suffer from this pretty severely other people mildly some people transiently but it tends to be kind of distressing for people and the reason it's stressing is that it can look like blushing or flushing of the face when in fact one isn't emotionally embarrassed however being embarrassed or having any flushing of the skin can exacerbate existing rosacea so it's thought to be caused by a combination of genetics there can perhaps be some again over inflammation of the skin which probably reflects inflammation more globally at the level of the gut and body Etc we've been talking a lot about that today and there are things that can exacerbate rosacea such as alcohol intake or anything that acts as a vasod dilator that dilates the vasculature innervating the skin so the approach to treating rosacea is pretty much similar to the other things that we've talked about consuming a low inflammation low glycemic low diet trying to get enough sleep keeping alcohol intake in particular to a minimum or cutting out alcohol completely the reason I say in particular is that a lot of people that suffer from rosacea who cut out alcohol completely essentially eliminate the rosacea or dramatically reduce it so often times it's alcohol that's the culprit either directly or indirectly we don't know again alcohol is a poison but could be the indirect manner in which alcohol impacts sleep and the gut microbiome negatively that's causing the rosacea without knowing the direct or indirect mechanism reduce or even eliminate your alcohol for a bit and see if your rosacea improves that will give you a strong indication of what might be going on and even better it could give you a potential solution to the problem now now for those that don't experience a reduction or elimination of rosacea If you eliminate alcohol get your sleep right get your diet right there are some additional things you can do first of all you want to follow the same recommendation we talked about for acne which is also the general recommendation for skin care use lukewarm water not excessively hot or cold water a gentle unfragranced cleanser you want to use sunscreen regularly remember sun damage to the skin is also inflammation so that's going to exacerbate rosacea and of course sunlight because of the release of nitric oxide is also going to act as a vasod dilator does that mean you have to go full beekeeper mode no it doesn't you can if you want to I suppose but use a quality mineral-based sunscreen which we talked about earlier in the episode and you should use some sort of moisturizer to help lock in the moisture within your skin you could use things like hyaluronic acid or use any kind of gentle moisturizing cream that's not going to cause inflammation or kind of irritate the skin in any way and can keep the moisture within the skin and there are a lot of different versions of these available out there and frankly a lot of them are not terribly expensive you can find super expensive varieties of any and all these things but many of the things that meet the criteria of gentle unfragranced cleanser SPF 30 mineral only sunscreen as well as a quality moisturizer are not necessarily the most expensive available and you know what justifies the higher expense in some cases could be I don't know the silkiness or the um packaging it could be any number of different things I'm not going to say that the cheapest varieties are necessarily as good as the most expensive varieties but I do think and the dermatologist that I spoke to definitely confirmed that there's a lot of price inflation out there related to kind of the overall milu of packaging and ex and purported exclusivity of certain skincare products look for the things that meet the criteria you are trying to establish for your skinc care but just like with acne just like with General skincare if you have rosacea you want to think about mild treatments for the skin at the level of cleaning at the level of sun protection at the level of locking in moisture and then there's some additional things that if you can spare the expense could also be beneficial like nicotinamide niacinamide as it's also called or there's also been some evidence that things like licorice root can be of benefit okay these things are typically found as a topical ointment or in a topical ointment but in the case of niacinamide nicotinamide talked about how this can be available in an ointment form a topical form or it can be taken as 2 500 milligram dosages per day I gave you the long list of the various mechanisms by which it can improve skin Health reduced inflammation production of collagen Etc all of that still holds for the potential treatment of rosacea be sure to avoid any kind of things that are acting as strong astringents or that increase heat so people who have rosacea will often try to avoid hot peppers so spicy foods of any kind I know that's tough I'm somebody who really enjoys spicy foods so if you have to avoid spicy foods I sympathize with you um that's rough um anything that acts as an EST stringent or can you know really irritate the skin from the inside or from the outside so think not excessively hot foods as it relates to spicy or temperature things of that sort now I should point out there are different types of rosacea the dermatologist I spoke to who is expert in rosacea told me there are four major types of rosacea many of them respond to the sorts of guidelines that we've been talking about up until now some of them that also include acne need some additional treatment we talked about acne treatments that can be easily folded into the treatment for rosacea there are people who have very stubborn rosacea this may be due to excessive use of cleansers and again we're talking about how over cleansing can really be a problem so we're not saying don't wash your face we're not saying don't take a shower please do in fact and I should have said this earlier by the way for a lot of reasons related to your comfort and appearance and other people's Comfort after you work out at a gym regardless of whether or not you're rolling around on the floor with a foam roller or you're rolling Jiu-Jitsu or you're lifting weights or you're doing cardio it is a good idea to take a shower and cleanse with a gentle cleanser as soon as possible I know this sounds like just basic advice but a lot of people just throw on a clean shirt or they don't rinse off or they don't wash their face and they're wondering why they're getting all sorts of skin issues well there's a lot of bacteria gyms a lot of sweating people um there are a lot of bacteria on you a lot of bacteria on the equipment and yeah you can spray down the equipment and do these various things but it's a good idea to shower as soon as possible or to bathe rather as soon as possible wash your face after going to a gym for your sake and for the sake of others now some rosacea is very stubborn meaning it does not go away even if somebody makes all the appropriate LIF style adjustments tries any number of different Medical Treatments and by the way rosacea is a medical condition and in some cases people will get angomas um you know the accumulation of blood vessels near the surface of the skin that can be you know for them something they don't want so we could say unsightly but they just don't want it or in some cases they'll treat their rosacea and then they'll get an accumulation of Broken Vessels near the surface of the skin this is pretty common for people that experience rosacea and treat rosacea for these people there is a treatment it has to be done in a dermatologist office called pulse die laser where they use a laser of a particular wavelength that can penetrate excuse me The Superficial layers of the skin and now you know how different wavelengths of light can penetrate to different depths within skin and destroy the blood vessels or the broken blood vessels that then call in immune system cells to clear out the destroyed endothelial cells and other stuff around it and take it away get rid of those blood vessels that sit beneath the surface let's talk about psoriasis so when I was researching this episode I asked the dermatologist is psoriasis related to yeast or overproduction no skin cells and what they told me was really interesting they said for more than 80 years within the dermatologic community it was thought that psoriasis was just an over production of skin cells but it wasn't really known what the source was and it turns out that now almost all the derms at least the ones I spoke to said that it has something to do either directly or at least powerfully and indirectly with the immune system so what can be done to treat psoriasis you can probably guess things that reduce the overall level of activation in the immune system not so much that you become susceptible to infections because that's not good but you treat this like any other autoimmune condition there are now drugs these are prescription drugs that directly Target the inter lucans the components of the immune system that are directly involved in psoriasis such as interlukin 17 and interlukin 23 and I'm told that these drugs are very effective in the treatment of psoriasis so that's very reassuring you know I know um especially in communities online that are focused more on behavioral tools and nutrition based tools or supplementation based tools of which I am right we focus on those but as you probably noticed in this and other episodes of The hubman Lab podcast we also talk about prescription drugs that have proven to be very effective in certain conditions so it's very reassuring to hear that there are excellent prescription drugs that can Target the specific inter lucans that are overactivated in psoriasis because psoriasis is now known as an overactivation of the immune system and a kind of uh turning of the body on itself if you will to create this itchy scaly uncomfortable and in some cases unsightly uh overproduction of skin cells at the scalp and elsewhere Okay so we've covered a lot of topics thus far we've talked about skin biology we talked about various skin conditions that are very common such as acne psoriasis and so forth we talked about ways to increase the youthfulness or the appearance of youthfulness in skin that are based on data some that are a bit more experimental and we talked about even some laser procedures and phototherapy things of that sort and at the same time I acknowledge that there are many topics and conditions related to skin health and skin care that we did not talk about we didn't talk about Eczema we didn't talk about Botox we didn't talk about an enormous number of topics that I know are of interest and relevant to many of you so as a consequence the plan is to host various expert guests both dermatologist expert in particular areas as well as yes a cosmetic surgeon who believe it or not does not like to cut but rather likes to use fairly non-invasive procedures that touch on some of these very same mechanisms yes injections of certain things things that operate at the surface level of the skin and sometimes surgical procedures that you know I know when people hear cosmetic surgery they think oh people just trying to improve the youthfulness of their look or something of that sort but you know that also relate to certain serious skin conditions for which surgery and non-surgical approaches can assist in so the point is that any discussion about skin health and Skin Care is going to be an ongoing discussion one that I do plan to continue on this podcast in the form of expert guest episodes maybe even another solo episode we've occasionally done so-called toolkit episodes where we summarize some of the main points of previous solo episodes and that arrive with guest episodes and that reflect the latest knowledge that gets published in between episodes I do plan to cover this topic in more detail going forward meanwhile I like to think that what I've covered today provides at at least an introduction to the biology of skin and an understanding about the various things that we all can and should do for our skin health and appearance as well as ways to attack certain pain points related to certain skin conditions that come from expert sources from excellent literature that has been established over many many decades and I personally find this organ that we call skin to be infinitely fascinating not just by virtue of what it does but by virtue of all the different organ and tissue systems that it interacts within our body and by virtue of the fact that our skin is this incredible living organ on the outside of our body that tells us oh so very much about how we and others are doing in terms of our immediate and potentially our long-term Health if you're learning from Andor enjoying this podcast

Title: Should You Intermittent Fast?
Published: 2024-06-26 03:55:25 UTC
Description:
Time-restricted feeding is just one approach to regulating food intake that many people find useful for weight loss, but others find it less useful than simply caloric restriction across a “normal” meal distribution.

Of course, this is individual, but there are certain incentives to fasting that most people don’t consider. Dr. Gabrielle Lyon is the guest on the current Huberman Lab podcast, which is out now. She discusses some of the advantages of fasting as well as who should probably avoid fasting.

During the episode, we discuss protein intake and sources and specific types of training for men and women as it relates to physical health and longevity of the body and brain. There’s also an extensive discussion about nutrition and supplementation and a discussion of different types of training, as well as essential takeaways about mindset for building lasting vigor and health.

Title: How to Exercise & Eat for Optimal Health & Longevity | Dr. Gabrielle Lyon
Published: 2024-06-24 12:00:35 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. Gabrielle Lyon, D.O., a board-certified physician who did her clinical and research training at Washington University in geriatrics and nutrition. She is also an expert in how diet and exercise impact muscle and whole-body health and longevity. Dr. Lyon is a bestselling author and public educator. We discuss how healthy skeletal muscle promotes longevity, brain health, disease prevention, ideal body composition, and the health of other organs and bodily systems.

She makes specific nutritional recommendations for optimal health: what to eat, how much to eat, the timing of meals, the essential need for adequate quality protein (including animal and plant-based options), supplementation, and how our dietary requirements change with age. She explains why specific types of resistance training are essential to build and maintain muscle and overall metabolic health. She also describes how to include resistance training as part of your exercise regimen — regardless of age or sex. 

She also provides specific mindset tools to encourage sustained adherence to healthy eating and exercise practices. Women and men of all ages will benefit from Dr. Lyon’s practical, evidence-based protocols to improve muscle and whole-body appearance, function, and health.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine I'm pleased to announce that my new book which I've been working on for more than 5 years is now available for pre-sale purchase the book is entitled protocols an operating manual for the human body and within the book you can find as the suggests protocols for everything from how to improve and even optimize your sleep for increasing your motivation and focus for nutrition that is specific nutritional guidelines to follow for health and performance as well as exercise Stress Control your oral and gut microbiome both of which are critical for brain and body Health as well as protocols for creativity and much more within the Book You'll also find the scientific basis that is the mechanisms and specific studies that substantiate these protocols and the book is designed to be incredibly easy to use such that if you're suffering from a particular pain point in life such as difficulty sleeping or excess stress or any number of different issues that you can go to a specific chapter in protocol and begin to resolve that issue so my goal in writing this book is that it not only be exceptionally practical but that it also be extremely informative that is teaching you a lot about the science that underlies the protocols that can improve your mental health physical health and performance to order protocols go to protocols book.com and there you will find links to any number of different vendors and you can select the one that you prefer again that's protocols book.com my guest for today's episode is Dr Gabriel lion Dr Gabriel lion is a medical doctor who did her clinical and research training at Washington University in St Louis she is an expert in geriatrics in nutrition in Health and Longevity and during today's episode Dr lion explains how if we are interested in our immediate and long long-term Health Muscle is the organ that we need to pay attention to she explains how this is true for everybody men and women alike and that there are specific things that we all can and should do with our nutrition and our exercise in order to maximize the health of our muscular tissue now in some cases people will be interested in building more muscle but it's important to point out that much of today's discussion is simply about improving the health of your muscular tissue and the specific ways to do that in order to support brain Health body health and movement of course as well as the health of every organ system in your body again placing a focus on improving muscular tissue itself as a way to improve all the organ and tissue systems of your body Dr Lon explains the specific science and protocols that can be applied in your everyday life at the level of what you choose to eat or not eat as well as how much of certain foods to eat or avoid as well as specific training regimens most of which take very little time but they can vastly improve the health of your muscular tissue and therefore the health of your entire brain and body I'm certain that by the end of today's episode you will have a much more thorough understanding of what you can do to improve your immediate and long-term health and thereby potentially your lifespan all of which are based on the most modern understanding from basic research from clinical studies and from practical application in the real world before you begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Maui Nei venison Maui Nei venison is the most nutrient-dense and delicious red meat available I've spoken many times before on this and other podcast and with several expert guests on this podcast about the fact that most of us should be seeking to get about 1 gram of high quality protein per pound of body weight every day not only does that protein provide critical building blocks for things like muscle repair and synthesis but also for overall metabolism and health Maui Nei venison has an extremely high quality protein per calorie ratio so that you can get that one gram of protein per pound of body weight easily and without ingesting in excess of calories also mauii venison is absolutely delicious I love their venison steaks their ground venison I love their bone broths and I love their jerky which is extremely convenient when you're traveling those Maui Nei venison jerky sticks have 10 G of high quality protein per stick at just 55 calories while Maui Nei offers the highest quality meat available their supplies are limited responsible management of the access deer population on the island of Maui means that they will not go beyond Harvest capacity so signing up for a membership is the best way to ensure access to their highquality meat if you'd like to try Maui Nei venison you can go to mauii venison docomond to get 20% off your membership or first order again that's Maui venison / huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by levels levels is a program that lets you see how different foods and activities affect your health by giving you real-time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor one of the most important factors in both your short and long-term health is your body's ability to manage glucose or what's sometimes called blood sugar to maintain energy and focus throughout the day you want to keep your blood glucose steady without big spikes or crashes I started using levels about 3 years ago as a way to understand how different foods and activities impacted my blood glucose levels and it's proven incredibly informative for me in determining what food choices I make when to eat and when to time eating relative to workouts sleep Etc indeed using levels has made it very easy for me to optimize my entire schedule and to understand where the flexibility in that schedule exists so that if I need to move a meal or I need to fast a little bit longer or if I need to work out fasted or not fasted all of that can be adjusted while maintaining energy and focus and great sleep at night if you're interested in learning more about levels and trying a CGM yourself you can go to levels l/ huberman levels just launched a new CGM sensor that is smaller and has even better tracking than the previous version right now they're also offering an additional two free months of membership again that's levels link l nk/ huberman to try the new sensor and two free months of membership today's episode is also brought To Us by Helix sleep Helix sleep makes mattresses in pillows that are customized to your unique sleep needs now I've spoken many times before on this other podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation for mental health physical health and performance now one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is to make sure that you sleep on a mattress designed specifically for your sleep needs and that's what Helix sleep mattresses are designed to accomplish if you go to the Helix website and take a brief two-minute quiz it asks you questions such as do you sleep on your back your side or your stomach do you tend to run hot or cold during the night maybe you know maybe you don't know the anwers to those questions in any case they'll match you to the ideal mattress for your unique sleep needs for me that turned out to be the dusk Helix mattress I started sleeping on a dusk mattress about three and a half years ago and it's been Far and Away the best sleep that I've ever had because it's customized to my unique sleep needs if you'd like to try Helix you can go to helixsleep.com huberman take that two-minute sleep quiz and Helix will match you to a mattress that's ideal for your unique sleep needs right now Helix is giving up to 30% off mattresses and two free pillows again that's helixsleep.com huberman to get 30% off and two free pillows and now for my discussion with Dr Gabrielle lion Dr Gabrielle lion welcome thank you so much so great to have you here you have a tremendous range and depth of expertise you treat men you treat women you know a ton about exercise physiology nutrition you've done work in Psychiatry you've done work in geriatrics you know so very much about how to get healthy and stay healthy and today we're going to talk about all of that to kick things off I would love to dive into your take on this unique aspect of our physiology that most people when they hear about think about weight training or maybe bodybuilding or have some immediate reaction to to but you have a different stance on this incredible organ that we call muscle so if you would just tell us how you look at this thing that we call muscle in Men in women in kids and old people young people how should we think about muscle well first of all muscle is the organ of longevity and we've always thought about muscle just as you said when it comes to exercise performance mobility and strength which by the way all of those things are are important and critical for life but there's something very unique and special to skeletal muscle first of all it's an organ system it's an endocrine organ it is responsible for a large component of glucose disposal roughly 80% of glucose disposal and we all hear about these things like cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes obesity largely many of these metabolic diseases begin in skeletal muscle decades before interesting skeletal muscle is also an amino acid Reservoir it is the place that your body pulls from amino acids and that is um something that changes as we age this idea of protein turnover and we require healthy skeletal muscle of course it's the body armor that we all know and it is really responsible for how we age and by the way I came to this understanding through um an experience I'd love to share with you I did my fellowship in geriatrics and nut sciences and at the time we were looking at you know every fellow has to have a project lucky for us and we were looking at body composition brain function and there was one patient who I just adored she was a mom of three kids and she had always yo-yo dieted we imaged her brain and her brain looked like the beginning of an Alzheimer's brain and I thought to myself and I felt very responsible thinking why was this woman who was doing everything that we told her to do she was exercising she was eating a low-fat High carbohydrate diet why was she so metabolically unhealthy and I realized that at the end of the day it wasn't that she was overfat it was that she was under muscled and we spend decades and have spent decades trying to treat obesity when really what we need to be looking at is skeletal muscle super interesting we know that the brain is among the most metabolically active organs in the body and muscle too one of the most metabolically active organs in the body you'll probably tell me that one is more active than the other which one is it muscle is actually quite frankly not very metabolically active at rest interesting for every pound of skeletal muscle it might at rest burn 10 calories primarily Burns fatty acids at rest okay I learned something new and I imagine many other people did as well so this woman that was overweight yeah um you looked at the problem through a different lens that she's under muscled how does one go from being underused to properly muscled and what is that and as I say this I realize that many of our listeners probably don't resistance train or if they do they may not want to carry a lot of muscle thinking that that would make them have to buy a new wardrobe you know certainly some of our listenership probably wants to gain more muscle but is or a new wardrobe or new wardrobe is there a way to view increasing muscle mass in a way that is compatible with kind of um I don't know we call like traditional Aesthetics or um with overall health in a way that's sort of distinct from quote unquote bodybuilding I mean again as soon as we talk about muscle we think about slabs of meat added to different parts of our body and surely certain people probably want to add muscle to certain parts of their body for aesthetic reasons but how should we think about muscle in the context of some of the todos um in terms of nutrition and exercise and we'll segue into that again how should we conceptualize this business of being under muscled and getting to I guess what we call appropriately muscled uh I think that that's a it's a really good point this idea of being appropriately muscled so the truth is I can't tell you how much skeletal muscle mass you should have for Optimal Health I don't know how much skeletal muscle mass I should have for Optimal Health we haven't done a good job in the literature and just as a population being able to track skeletal muscle and know what is optimal we are really good at looking at body fat and we're really looking good at looking a bone but when it comes to skeletal muscle dexa is an extrapolation so for example we use dexa as the gold standard and I'm going to come back to what we need to do to gain healthy skeletal muscle but I think that there it's really important to put things into perspective and a framework for how we think about things we traditionally use dexa dexa looks at bone and it looks at lean tissue collectively part of lean tissue is skeletal muscle mass it doesn't determine the health of skeletal muscle mass it doesn't determine anything about the quality of that tissue it purely looks at lean tissue which then we determine part of that lean tissue maybe it's 40% is skeletal muscle and that's important to understand as we begin to frame up the conversation is how much skeletal muscle should I have I have no idea but what I can tell you is that if I were to look at your blood work and I saw something like elevated triglycerides or elevated insulin or elevated glucose I would begin to understand that the health of your skeletal muscle isn't where it should be and by the way the health of skeletal muscle mass begins when we're young this idea of sarcopenia which for The Listener or the viewer the definition of sarcopenia by the way became a disease it wasn't even classified as a disease till 2016 wow yes wow which is very recent for a disease it is a decrease in muscle mass and function but interestingly we don't necessarily know what one should have so I think it's important to understand that when we're talking about the health of skeletal muscle we're still pretty much in the infancy of understanding the trajectory of of where it is and where it's going so when we think about how we maintain the health of skeletal muscle one of the things that I I didn't mention is that skeletal muscle is a nutrient sensing organ it is uniquely sensitive to the quality of our diet the quality of our diet defined as the quality of the amino acids that we're gaining and that would be for the listener dietary protein skeletal muscle is sensitive to one of the amino acids lucing and depending on the quality of the diet meaning how much Lucine that you're getting in any given meal will then stimulate muscle Health not just muscle size but muscle Health Muscle health and the way that we think about muscle health is bioxy is this this concept called muscle protein synthesis which we can measure and when we get a dietary protein amount which is between 30 and 50 grams of high quality protein it stimulates skeletal muscle so I love this idea of focusing for a bit on muscle protein health because it divorces us from this conversation at least temporarily about muscle size which of I have to imagine is correlated but it's a separate thing altoe actually I should just ask the question is it possible for somebody to have a lot of muscle but their muscle health is poor yes okay conversely can somebody have a moderate to low amount of muscle but their muscle quality is high or is that less common um well the the first thing that you said is is AB absolutely something that we see is that in an individual that carries a lot a lot of muscle and say they're inactive there is a big discussion about how um heavy individuals will have more muscle mass but what we have to recognize is the health of that skeletal muscle is fat deposition can be visceral fat deposition fat around the organs and it can be also fat infiltrate into the tissue like not to gross anyone out a marbled steak and that's exactly what can happen to un healthy skeletal muscle which then affects its ability to contract which also affects there's a ton of mitochondria in skeletal muscle it affects the efficiency of skeletal muscle so yes someone can have potentially more muscle but more unhealthy muscle interesting when you say um a marbled steak I think at the extreme like a wagu m um a raw wagu looks like there's as much white fat in it as there is red meat in it um and it's a very different taste and texture so that's what we're talk talking about my understanding is those cows uh don't move around much um they're somewhat sedentary compared to say a free range grass eating cow is that right yeah that's that's absolutely correct okay so we want we want quality healthy muscle and then we can talk about muscle amount and then the other thing that I'll say about it is part of what defines muscle health is that flux that movement so if you were to think about skeletal muscle like a suitcase and an individual was say going on a trip for 4 days but chooses to eat or pack for 30 days we know these people yes I know I'm maybe one of them I have my suitcase here I was only coming in for a day but I may have packed for four days not sure what I was doing but uh that's besides the point when an individual is overeating calories overeating carbohydrates I had mentioned earlier that skeletal muscle one of its primary roles is glucose disposal and I'm sure we're going to get in the mechanisms of glucose disposal whether it's uh insulin dependent or insulin independent depending on if someone is moving or Contracting that muscle when an individual is eating food carbohydrates it gets stored in skeletal muscle as glycogen because as we know glucose at a high level is toxic to the body so the body must move glucose out of the bloodstream into the the cells now what happens is is there becomes this stasis so if an individual is inactive and not exercising then that skeletal muscle becomes overpacked uh skeletal muscle at rest Burns primarily free fatty acids which is interesting most people think about skeletal muscle as burning carbohydrates but actually at rest skeletal muscle Burns fatty acids as you can imagine when that muscle is full and you are not exercising it then the substrates have nowhere to go and it remains in the bloodstream and that would be a sign of unhealthy skeletal muscle which then Loops back to what you see in blood work elevated insulin elevated blood glucose elevated free fatty acids elevated Branch chain amino acids all of these things which again as skeletal muscle as the metabolic sink have nowhere to go so I'm starting to get a picture where in order to have healthy muscle we need to think about the feeding of that muscle the providing of nutrients to that muscle that is as well as the use of that muscle maybe let's start with the feeding or the providing of nutrients to that muscle you mentioned that muscle at rest mainly Burns fatty acids it can store glycogen how do we know when a muscle is full of glycogen I mean there's the the visual uh representation of the muscle seems Fuller as opposed to flatter um you know but these are um not specific um or these are not um precise terms you know how much carbohydrate does it take to fill all the muscle of the body with glycogen and then what sorts of things perhaps deplete that I think it's a great question we know that when we're talking about glycogen the the liver stores glycogen maybe 100 grams and then skeletal muscle depending on your size for example um you might store much more muscle glycogen whether it's four 500 grams compared to someone who is my size and can we do the the standard conversion of four calories per gram so if the liver is 400 gr you know we just say okay there's about 1,600 calories worth of yes of energy there so if I if I go out and I uh do some exercise and burn 1600 calories over time does that mean that the the liver is then completely depleted so well the liver will deplete in through an overnight fast so the liver's main the liver maintains blood glucose so skeletal muscle doesn't maintain blood glucose directly the way that you would leverage uh muscle glycogen would be through exercise the way in which you would deplete muscle glycogen would be through more um intensive exercise and when you think about the foods and the way in which you know your original question is how would we know how much muscle glycogen or how much we need to refuel I typically think about it as overall activity levels so if someone is sedentary then the current recommendation for carbohydrates would be 130 grams a day per day per day at four calories per gram at four calories per gram and is that um both simple and complex carbohydrates fibrous carbohydrates yes it would just be overall if they're completely sary so just a little bit of walking getting up going to the computer to the bathroom to the car Etc but basically sedentary and the average American takes in 300 grams of carbohydrates a day so more than double and as you can imagine this can distort metabolism when we think about glucose disposal the way in which I think about glucose disposal if an individual is sedentary is thinking about how many carbohydrates an individual can ingest at one time that would mitigate uh insulin response and would be able to be disposed of safely and that number is between 40 and 50 grams of carbohydrates at a meal outside of exercise the rest of carbohydrates would be earned through exercise and through every hour of exercise depending on the intensity that could be between 40 to 70 gram depending on how intense an individual ual exercises and that would be safely disposed of in a 2-hour period I mean when you think about an oral glucose tolerance test that's a 75 gram load you assume within two hours that that blood sugar regulation should come back to a normal range so at 40 to 50 grams of carbohydrate every two hours does that mean that if somebody were to eat 40 to 50 grams of carbohydrates every two hours which they shouldn't which they shouldn't but you're going to quickly exceed that 130 G per day and even if exercising with resistance training say hard for an hour um which you know can afford somebody maybe what another couple hundred 300 grams of carbohydrates probably not that much okay uh you know I I think that if people care about body composition which um I would say everyone should because you want to have an appropriate level of body fat and healthy skeletal muscle then you wouldn't NE necessarily unless you're doing some kind of cardiovascular activity you're not using a ton of of muscle glycogen depending on how much you're training and how much glycogen is the brain using so that is a that is a good question um the brain uses um a lot of carbohydrates that would be the a primary source when they come up with the numbers of 130 it's really based on brain and then the rest of the the body can we safely say that for somebody that's thinking a lot they need more carbohydrates um you could say that then your brain yes your brain is very metabolically active interesting so we're going of drawing rough estimates not knowing people's body weight not knowing their body composition but what I'm arriving at here is you know if somebody does a little bit of cardiovascular training maybe a little bit of light resistance training I'm describing the activities of many people out there maybe 250 gram of carbohydrates you're kind of at the threshold that's a lot that's that's a lot four four calories per gram um of those carbohydrates and so let's say 200 gram of carbohydrates per day um but that's not a ton of calories overall so what should the remainder of the calories be made up of so you know I think what we're really talking about here is how do we design a nutrition plan for people to have healthy skeleton muscle right and you know if I were to say okay what are we thinking about for the listener or for the people out there they're thinking you know I really want to have a healthy body composition and healthy skeletal muscle mass the way in which they would do that is number one you have to prioritize dietary protein so we're we're talking about carbohydrates here but carbohydrates shouldn't be the primary focus nobody has challenges getting carbohydrates in 130 grams would be a safe recommendation if it someone is overweight or struggles with type 2 diabetes or any of these other metabolic conditions there is evidence to support a lower carbohydrate intake I mean 130 G is you know one little micro packet of pretzels on an airplane ride you know so that that actually has probably closer to 37 grams of carbohydrates okay good not that I had a pretzel packet before or threw one at Rob on the way in but no right okay so I'm way off there um uh so they have a one of those a bagel in the morning and um they shouldn't but they uh but they do and then they have some you know pasta at dinner and so most people are probably exceeding that 130 gram by a huge margin yes they are and um there's a couple things there that it's really important that you said is that individuals when we're thinking about designing a plan for skeletal muscle Health that first meal is most important that first meal of the day having dietary protein will set you up metabolically for the rest of the day and when you say first meal and we'll talk a little bit later about intermittent fasting and you know I for instance eat my first meal at usually 11: a.m it's just kind of how I'm wired I've never wanted to eat breakfast first thing I've forced myself to eat some eggs first thing in the morning from time to time and it felt fine but do you recommend that people eat a true breakfast like within a certain number of hours of waking up for sake of muscle Health that and and metabolic Health when we think about um that first meal I frankly don't care when you have it one also has to understand that you're coming out of an overnight fast if you are young and healthy then the timing of that first meal likely doesn't matter because you're robust your body is very efficient and capable to withstand um protein deg degradation it's able to withstand protein degradation and protein turnover which is ultimately why we're eating so that's one reason why we're eating and we'll talk a little bit more about that that first meal of the day if you are young and healthy the timing doesn't really matter matter and I would say when it begins to matter is when you're older when you are in your 60s fat continuing to fast may be a negative negative for muscle muscle Health that first meal of the day is important because we know that when you get between 40 and 50 grams of protein that first meal of the day you stimulate muscle protein synthesis muscle protein synthesis is by proxy what we use to measure um as a marker for overall muscle Health now there's a lot of history here when we think about designing a a meal plan that first meal has between we'll say give it between 30 to 50 grams of dietary protein that will do a number of things number one it will stimulate skeletal muscle what we would consider the health of skeletal muscle it also will affect the brain it'll improve satiation you and I were talking previously it releases um a handful of uh gut peptides like gluc gone like peptide one which later we'll talk abouto C py things that will affect appetite uh for that second meal and this there's some very interesting research out out of Heather Li's lab and basically when she put individuals younger uh adolescents on a meal of 30 to 40 grams of protein they were much less likely to choose say Donuts or something uh outside of what we consider a healthy nutrition plan later in the day or in the same meal later in the day so um is essentially augmenting their willpower okay so it sounds like for young people they can delay breakfast if they want for older people probably not but that the first meal of the day should include what you're calling dietary protein 30 to 50 grams yes and maybe we should talk about the quality of that protein because I think a lot of people understand that there are meat proteins there are plant proteins how important is the quality of that protein this tends to be a Hot Topic and somewhat very controversial great when great for you I know great for everybody I mean controversy on this podcast is um is embraced uh in the following way we State what we know we State what we don't know and we are always happy to return to the conversation in a future time to adjust any uh uh stances based on the data and how we evolve as people so okay well I love that yeah um dietary protein we speak about it as if it's one thing but actually it's 20 different amino acids nine of which are essential the rest we can generate in our body and when we think about skeletal muscle we think about the essential amino acids and the essential amino acids primarily for skeletal muscle Health are the branch chain amino acids Lucine being one of those so Lucine is uniquely stimulating to skeletal muscle and when you have enough Lucine it triggers muscle protein synthesis and when you say stimulating and muscle protein synthesis I think a lot of people get a picture in their mind of a muscle growing but no you're not necessarily talking about that you're talking about the organ that is muscle um that it's Health it's metabolism being cultivated so that it can do all the hormone endocrine related things and the glucose disposal related things that we'll get into in a bit more detail later is that right yeah and so when you have a breakfast of 30 to 50 grams you appropriately stimulate muscle protein synthesis and one has to recognize that if you eat below that threshold you do not stimulate the health of that skeletal muscle you do not stimulate muscle in a a way that would be necessary for outcomes that matter and outcomes that matter are sarcopenia outcomes that matter are body composition prevention of obesity you must get this nutrition right it's the thing that 100% of people do is eat as many of you know I've been taking ag1 for more than 10 years now so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast to be clear I don't take ag1 because they're a sponsor rather they are a sponsor because I take ag1 in fact I take ag1 once and often twice every single day and I've done that since starting way back in 2012 there is so much conflicting information out there nowadays about what proper nutrition is but here's what there seems to be a general consensus on whether you're an omnivore a carnivore a vegetarian or a vegan I think it's generally agreed that you should get most of your food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources which allows you to eat enough but not over eat get plenty of vitamins and minerals probiotics and micronutrients that we all need for physical and mental health now I personally am an omnivore and I strive to get most of my food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources but the reason I still take ag1 once and often twice every day is that it ensures I get all of those vitamins minerals probiotics Etc but it also has a adaptogens to help me cope with stress it's basically a nutritional insurance policy meant to augment not replace quality food so by drinking a serving of ag1 in the morning and again in the afternoon or evening I cover all of my foundational nutritional needs and I like so many other people that take ag1 report feeling much better in a number of important ways such as energy levels digestion sleep and more so while many supplements out there are really directed towards obtaining one specific outcome ag1 is foundational nutrition designed to support all aspects of well-being related to mental health and physical health if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs with your order plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman it's great that we're focusing on muscle and then referring to obesity because I think so many people virtually everybody thinks okay reduce body fat how do you do that you get the calories in calories out equation in a certain direction and by the way I believe in the law of thermodynamics and um calories in calories out but by focusing on muscle protein synthesis and muscle Health through the ingestion of quality protein early in the day I see that you're entering this all through through a different Channel but at the end points of reduced body fat Etc as we'll get into later um one can still arrive there so just for practical purposes what are some excellent sources of quality protein for that first meal um well now the quality of protein is defined by the amino acid composition and typically animal-based proteins have higher quality these are hard fast biological numbers the dietary protein in say um a steak is very similar to the protein amino acid in skeletal muscle so the quality of the proteins like eggs like whey protein like beef like poultry Those comp compositions are similar to the human body composition so they contain the amino acids in the appropriate ratios for skeletal muscle Health now plant-based proteins have a different composition and they have a composition obviously similar to plants and one can get enough of the essential amino acids if the total caloric load of that protein is high enough and I think that that's important to recognize because right now the American diet is 70% plant-based and we are we seem to be moving more towards a plant-based diet right I mean I know there's sort of a movement toward that you hear about plant-based but so most people are not eating steak and eggs for breakfast we know that well most people when I say a 70% plant-based diet I'm talking about uh refined carbohydrates sugars ref oils and when we think about it so that 70% of um our diet comes from that where 30% comes from animal-based proteins which contain a ton of nutrients like bioavailable zinc and selenium B12 but when it comes to muscle Health one could as long as they are thinking about making sure that the overall protein load is high enough in that plant-based protein for example um one would not choose quinoa as a protein source so quinoa would six cups of quinoa would equal the same as one small chicken breast when it comes to an amino acid profile so I think one has to be aware that plant-based proteins typically have carbohydrates that ride along with them and and that just becomes important for overall metabolic control when we think about total caloric load and total carbohydrates someone could use a rice pea blend of protein for that first meal uh that would certainly be sufficient certainly if someone is um geared towards a more plant-based Di and doesn't want to consume animal proteins that's what I would use is there any evidence that combining a highquality protein with carbohydrate in that first meal is more or less beneficial than having the protein alone that's a good question I would say that we don't have evidence for that that it would be more beneficial because the question would be what what is the benefit that we're looking for if the benefit that one is looking for is diversity then certainly because we know carboh hydrates can have fiber phytonutrients if you're going to combine it with berries that could certainly be advantageous but not necessary what becomes interesting is when we think about designing a diet does that second meal matter and not to get too technical but maybe I'll we could get a little technical here is that when you stimulate muscle protein synthesis that will last about 2 to three hours now the next thing one would think is well I know that I need a certain amount of protein for overall muscle Health the amount of protein for overall muscle Health could be anywhere from 1 gram per pound ideal body weight to lower and when we think about how we are designing a diet we have to recognize that the current recommendations are the minimum to prevent a deficiency the way in which diets are designed now according to the RDA is 8 grams per kg8 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight which comes out toal body weight yes which comes out to be 37 G per pound so if someone was 115 PB female that current RDA would be 45 grams of protein way below what we talked about earlier and this is these are very important Concepts to understand the foundations of how we think about dietary protein the current RDA which is a minimum to prevent a deficiency is based on nitrogen balance nitrogen balance and by the way the recommendations for protein that were set in the 80s have not changed which means one of two things we haven't had new science come out or we just haven't recognized the importance of protein and I think that it's more likely the latter that we have not yet recognized even though there's a plethora of data and I worked on some of these earlier studies which you know I'll share I even brought the numbers to make sure that I said them right because uh you know this is the human Lab podcast well I've I've made I've made uh numerical errors before on the podcast uh but great that you brought the numbers we always try and correct any errors but great to be precise the first time so thank you you know when we think about how we design a diet for optimal muscle health is very different than how we design a diet for um again just life and the two are very different the RDA for Lucine which is that essential amino acid meaning we cannot make it we must get it from the diet is set at 2.7 gram per day that's a trivial amount that is a trivial amount and 2.7 gram 2 total per day per day and one must understand that this came from nitrogen balance studies and typically those are young men 18-year-old men that does not support healthy aging or anyone that is struggling with obesity or any kind of chronic illness or anything and so then when we begin to think well what do we actually need the evidence would support two to three times that amount closer to 9 n gam of Lucine per day and just to calibrate us n gram of Lucine again is essential amino acid we can only get from food per day what does that equate to in terms of the total amount of let's say egg or steak protein that one would need to eat in order to ensure that just rough roughly yes wonderful question so there's a meal threshold for skeletal muscle health and that meal threshold is a minimum of 30 gr now that would equal a four 4 and A2 ounce steak um dare I say six eggs which is a lot of eggs at one time or a scoop of whey protein scoop of whey protein might have 18 grams of protein and two and a half grams of Lucine maybe you do a 25 gram whey protein shake and that becomes important to understand because it is a meal threshold amount you know we are talking about you know the reason why I was so excited to come on this podcast is because I think that if we can correct our new nutrition and we gear it towards skeletal muscle Health then we can change the trajectory of aging and we can stop focusing on Obesity and really focus on skeletal muscle Health but the only way that we're going to do that is if we get this nutrition right because skeletal muscle requires dietary protein there's only two main ways that we can stimulate skeletal muscle and that is through exercise primarily resistance training and dietary protein and so when we think about how we design a diet if you look back at the history we have to recognize a handful of things number one that these essential amino acids primarily Lucine is necessary to trigger muscle protein synthesis number one number two that aging impairs the efficiency of muscle protein synthesis I see so it's a runaway train if you start getting sarcopenia if there's obesity and other markers of Aging I realize obesity can occur at Young ages too but muscle loss then basically you're Al you're losing muscle quality AK protein synthesis and other things and as a consequence it makes it harder to increase muscle quality so you have to Short Circuit this pretty early um yes and I would even say that we talk about sarcopenia as a disease of Aging but I think that there is a youthful phenotype of sarcopenia if we Define sarcopenia as decreased muscle mass and strength that can easily affect our youth you know we talk about health span we talk about lifespan there's also muscle span and muscle span is this concept that um is really about the skeletal muscle Health as we age and there's three primary components to that that's understanding that skeletal muscle Health begins very early on and we're going to talk about um because I know that there's parents I have two little kids so I I want to talk about the amount of protein necessary for children of course and then as we think about this muscle span there is early on early age where you're laying down the foundation where you're hopefully training doing exercise just doing movement being sedentary is a disease state in and of itself period end of story being sedentary is not the opposite of activity being sedentary is in in and of itself a diseasome of inactivity then midlife we have to maintain the tissue we get a peak muscle mass in our 30s we get a peak bone mass around the same time and then that later half of life we have to do everything that we can to maintain that tissue because of this decrease in efficiency of skeletal muscle so skeletal muscle as a nutrient sensing organ can respond like youthful tissue and the way that it responds like youthful tissue from an amino acid perspective just thinking about how we eat to maintain that is that when we increase our dietary protein so older individuals or individual as they age require more protein to then stimulate mtor so does that mean instead of eating 30 grams of protein per meal minimum that people older than say 50 60 should eat 40 or 50 grams of prot I say that that's true interesting and by the way skeletal muscle will mount a youthful response there's um you know this was uh the initial work was out of uh Bob Wolf's lab he's an icon in the industry of protein he's one of the can I say grandfathers now I mean that's pretty embarrassing when I think about Bob wolf and Don Layman and these guys you know I trained with Dr Donald Layman you know these initial studies that we think about and we take for granted dietary protein we think okay well the Bros have always known this but we have not and when you are younger there is a somewhat of a linear response let's say um a younger individual still growing we'll just call them 10 12 years old or or my children I have a three and a four and a halfy old they will respond with 5 gr of dietary protein 10 gam of dietary protein 15 gram of dietary protein versus an older individual will not respond at all to that however that response can be augmented by increasing the dietary protein at that meal so an older individual will respond like an a younger individual by 30 grams of protein 30 to to 50 later we're going to talk about supplements but I'm very curious is there a place for supplementing Lucine and other Branch chain amino acids specifically you know I always assumed that supplementing with Branch chain amino acids was kind of the unique domain of people you know post exercise trying to build more muscle but as you're telling me all this it seems that adding Lucine in powder form to a meal seems like it would be great for muscle health is that true um I would say that we do not add Lucine alone okay because Lucine isol leucine and veine go hand in hand it would not be advisable to add a single amino acid the amino acid levels are maintained in the blood by adding more of one would have effects on the other the way in which I would think about supplementing essential amino acids and or Branch Chains would be if an IND idual is choosing to have a lower protein meal I remember when I was in residency the food choices were not very good and maybe I had 2 ounces of fish which wasn't enough to bring me up to a threshold that would be a place that I would add in Branch chain amino acids or essential amino acids that would bring someone's amino acid threshold up but we have to understand everything that we're doing we should be doing with a purpose the idea of just sipping on Branch chain amino acids or just adding Amino acids would be the equivalent of putting a key into a car and trying to turn the car on but not having any additional substrate so you need the full spectrum of all the amino acids to affect skeletal muscle Health yeah well that's um reassuring to hear because I love the taste of scrambled eggs and steaks and I also like tuna and I also like chicken and I I love all those all those things um and I have to imagine that as you mentioned before there are other things in these quality and animal proteins like you mentioned um selenium you mentioned other perhaps essential fatty acids and other vitamins that perhaps have something to do with what the animal ingested during its life that also benefit muscle is that true it it is and the the big standout to me is creatine we know that creatine at five grams of creatine will affect skeletal muscle but 12 grams of creatine affects brain health and there's a lot of interesting research coming out on um creatine and brain health C can you remind me the rough um amounts of creatine and say you mentioned a let's just I mean I must say a 4 and a half ounce steak feels um rather poultry to me um that's probably the size of which is a huge meal to me right um right so let's say a 6 oun let's be generous a 6 oun steak or um four scrambled eggs I mean how much creatine are we talking eggs don't have much creatine right not much and um and I I was just recently looking at this the amount of creatine in a pound of steak you're going to cringe is is something like two grams so it's not very much it's not very much but when we think about eating Foods as in a food Matrix what you're saying is absolutely true that it's interesting we don't eat single nutrients while we think about dietary protein as um a single nutrient and we think about carbohydrates but what we really do is we eat mixed meals and when we think about that the the quality of the protein Matters from a protein perspective could you get plant-based proteins and animal-based proteins and could it be equal yes it could so I want to be very clear to say and have a very balanced perspective that we could get all of our dietary protein from plants from plant-based sources uh a few caveats there is that that RDA that I gave you earlier is based only on high quality proteins and that being the minimum to prevent a deficiency if an indiv ual was plant-based they would require closer to 1.6 gram per kg a higher amount of total protein if it's coming from plants and that that becomes important to understand speaking of an Ideal World if you had a magic wand I do what would be the um my kids think I do I bet you do um what would be the amount of protein that you would have everybody eat what in terms of a number of grams per pound or kilogram of body weight that's actually an easy question one gram per pound ideal body weight total body weight not ideal body weight actually where you want to be if an individual is 200 lb but but would prefer to be 150 lbs then I would have them eat towards their ideal body weight there's no evidence that a higher protein diet is detrimental to Kidney Health to bone health and we use these terms Loosely like a high protein diet when we have to recognize that 8 gr per kg is a low protein diet so where did the idea come from that if you eat say 1 gram of quality protein per pound of ideal body weight that you're going to get gout you're going to have liver issues you're going to have all sorts of issues where did that idea come from uh frankly I'm not I'm not sure but the conversation around dietary protein has probably been the most controversial what why do you think that is I mean we don't we're not trying to get political here I'm just so curious some ideas but uh I I won't them but I I do feel as if um nutrition is not just Science Nutrition is complicated because it's something that people tie emotion to they tie religion to they there's um a lot that goes into dietary protein and food recommendations in general but it sounds like we can safely say that if you eat 1 gram of protein per pound of ideal body weight that you're not going to cause liver damage get gout or increase your risk of cancer right my understanding is that even if it comes from red meat there's no increase in risk of cancer is that right well um here's what I would say to that I would say that this idea about red meat and cancer number one we would have to even Define what kind of cancers that we're talking about there's many different types of cancers and there's many different causes it would be important to understand what risk factors are and a primary risk factor to many cancers is obesity the the question then becomes how do we design a diet that mitigates obesity the evidence is also very clear that a more protein forward diet optimizes body composition and you combine that with resistance training and you will see a tremendous amount of change I worked on some of these early studies and I I'll share with you some of the um early studies and this came out of Don Layman's lab with University of Illinois both you and L Norton both work there did you overlap there we did while he what was he like no just came so let's just say he sat in the back of the class and I sat in the front okay all right there you heard it shots fired and all kidding s Side Lane is a very he's like my brother we've known each other for 20 some years and he's a very popular guest former guest on this podcast and a very spirited guy and I I just like to say I don't know why his skin looks that good but um whatever so I love you Lane I worked on yes we do I worked on some of these early studies and this was these studies were some of the first studies to come out about dietary protein nutrition and resistance training in in fact to my knowledge and to I think the knowledge of many of my colleagues this was the first study and what it was it was um a it was a 12-month study 130 overweight men and women so it was robust and basically what they did is they had um two groups one group was a food guide pyramid diet so it was 55 G of carbohydrates a RDA of protein which was 8 G per kg and 30% fat 30% fat was in both groups the second group was 40% carbohydrates this is remember the Zone diet 40 3030 yeah I liked that diet okay I mean there's EV is I mean I don't follow it anymore but you know I tried it for a little while and and it works great and there's some evidence to support that that is a great ratio for people coming off the lowfat era of the '90s the Zone diet felt like um the best thing ever because it was like oh you know you can enjoy some fats and wow your satiety is improved and um you get stronger you just feel better when you're ingesting some ideally quality fats that's my experience anyway and also we know that it influences hormonal status you don't want to push uh fats too low so the second group had a 40330 split so it was 40 gr of carbohydrates 30 gram of protein 30 gr or 30 % fat so these are all percentages yeah 40 30 40% now we didn't talk so much about the distribution but what is really important to understand is they were isocaloric so they both had the same calories the difference was the percentage of where the calories came from and how they were given um and there was actually four different arms to this so there was individuals that exercised and individuals that didn't okay so either zone diet or let's call it I hate to say this but more stand that's how it was designed standard American versus Zone diet so it was designed that way and then exercising or non- exercising for for each of the for this 12 month study um and by the way I had to to pack a bunch of meals it was not pretty and I had to do urine analysis it was terrible um but anyway this besides the point so the first group had um a protein distribution of 10 grams in the morning 15 at lunch and 45 at dinner kind of standard American Ste for some cereal for breakfast with a little bit of milk and then for lunch like a sandwich exactly and so this mirrors what people do the other group had 45 grams of protein at that first meal six five six eggs five six eggs um 35 grams of protein at lunch and 35 grams of protein chicken breast and a salad at lunch with a little piece of toast and then at dinner how much um it was it was 35 gam all right a piece of fish and some rice and a vegetable but it was an even distribution so what you're seeing here is now these meals are meeting a loosing threshold of muscle protein synthesis now it's 100 this is collectively 130 individuals and they were they were older um I think that they were all in their 40s or Beyond if we just compare first the groups that did not exercise two different diets what what did they see what did you see you participated in this yeah un yes I did and almost said un unforunately no I I won't um but what was so interesting is that those individuals everybody lost weight so the average weight loss um gosh I wish I had better handwriting but I'm a doctor and so it's pretty bad um the average weight loss was 24% greater in the high protein group so they lost 24% and you said it was isocaloric between the two groups but was it subc caloric overall I mean people were five that's a very smart yes it was 500 calories less than what they needed to maintain body weight correct okay got it so 24% more weight loss total total in the group that distributed their protein evenly in and followed the So-Cal zone diet 40330 and they lost more fat than the high carbohydrate group so the high protein group lost uh a total of 16 pounds versus the calorie controlled group lost 11 pounds of fat of fat which is great everyone's at home thinking this is wonderful isocaloric isocaloric but the the thing here is the lean body mass change so again this was done using dexa and we know dexa only looks at lean body mass you mentioned dexa earlier just very briefly is dexa how does dexa work not not not at a mechanistic level what what does it look like I go into the clinic am I floating in water am I holding I'm holding the the paddles you might be because you're Andrew hubin no no no but um you hold the paddles and it um and you're standing on something it's what's it so DEA you just lay on depending on the machine you can just lay on this machine and it's a a dual X-ray and it it um measures bone fat and then lean body mass okay that's sufficient for this conversation great so the lean body mass um lost and again this is everything other than bone and body fat so that was 34% in which group uh in the standard American diet group okay versus 26% in the high protein group now where it gets fascinating so what the big takeaway is is understanding that protein had a sparing effect protein protected muscle more body fat loss at the same caloric amounts yes same amount of deficit relative to body weight right in this group exercise was not introduced so this was purely the food guide pyramid um changing protein in the morning versus having it at um two small meals and then having it at dinner and did they emphasize what we're calling high quality protein they did okay that is also very important fish eggs chicken ET yes they did so then this led to another study so then the second study was a 2 by two design and this is oh sorry sorry to interrupt in that previous study what was the effect of exercise between so we didn't they didn't do exercise sorry that was my fault we they did not do exercise they were just doing whatever that it was that they were doing um but what was so important to understand was that this set the stage for this idea that protein had a sparing effect and then following that the other studies so then there was a series of a few other studies um the second study looked at diet and exercise so this combined effect so this was one of the first studies and this was 48 women with a BMI of 33 46 years old so this is your post Perry postmenopausal woman who um was either in one of four treatment groups a low protein group low protein with exercise high protein high protein with exercise the low protein group was defined as the RDA 8 gr the high protein group was defined as 1.6 gram kg so starting to approach that one gram per pound it's about seven gram yeah so starting to get there but not quite there yeah so this was um a 16 weeks study and what they found overall was that the high protein group lost 18% more body fat and 25% less lean mass overall and 12% more total body weight and so now we start moving into this synergistic effect of dietary protein and resistance training and it was the type of exercise that they performed there resistance training this is the good news it didn't take much it was 5 days a week of walking 30 minutes and two days a week of resistance training with just body weight it was like yoga activity so air squats down dogs some Warrior poses maybe some handstand attempts so yeah are you doing handstand I've been to some yoga classes where I look to the sides of me and people are doing some pretty difficult things lanches and things like that definitely not me do not invite me life is better this way I'm not going to those classes but 16 weeks they did a high protein with protein and exercise those individuals so now so the the study the the group that I just mentioned this was dietary intervention alone with exercise High Protein Plus exercise very simple exercise so if someone is listening to this and they're thinking what can I do to make very practical changes to massively impact my life outside of hormone replacement outside of any super self outside of anything diet in exercise has a dramatic effect those individuals that were doing 1.6 gram per kg which is 7 gram per pound of body weight plus exercise lost 46% more body weight that's substantial 60% more fat and 40% less fat-free Mass from organs you know muscle whatever that is you know compared to the low protein group plus exercise and was it sub caloric were they below below main weight it was so they're eating to ideal body weight um but still 500 calories or so below their current caloric needs to maintain body weight so I've heard before that um when we eat protein a certain amount of energy is required to metabolize that protein can that be translated as you know um the caloric load of protein is not what it appears to be yes you know if let's say uh that 6 o steak I'm making this up I'll probably get the numbers badly wrong but if it's um you know um 6 ounces of steak and maybe that's a let's just say a 450 calories or 500 calories does that mean that only 400 of those calories are actually quote unquote utilized um what you're talking about is the thermic effect of food the thermic effect of feeding and that's the idea that certain macronutrients require a certain percentage of energy or the energy from those calories to be utilized for fat it's something like 3% for carbohydrates maybe it's 5 to 10% and then for protein it could be anywhere from 20 to I've seen even studies that are at 30% wow I know but here is the thing it's not that it's the energy that it takes so if we were going to make it simple we'll say 100 calories from straight protein the body would net 80 calories because 20% of that energy is being used for what I would say is muscle protein synthesis it's not the handling of nitrogen it's none of that and there's variations in the literature and the variations come from how an individual doses protein so the dosing depending if you've hit that minimum of 30 grams then you will see a more optimal utilization of protein and I think that that's where that number comes from it's actually the stimulation of muscle because that is such an energetic process in and of itself I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor insid tracker insid tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals now I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term Health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test now a major problem with a lot of blood tests out there is that you get information back about metabolic factors and hormones and lipids and so forth but you don't know what to do with that information with inside tracker they make it very easy to know what to do with those numbers because they have a personalized platform that allows you to see the levels of those metabolic factors lipids hormones Etc and they give you specific directives that you can follow related to nutrition behavioral modification supplementation and more that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you if you'd like to try insid tracker you can go to insid tracker.com huberman to get 10% off their new membership program insid tracker membership offers significantly reduced prices on insid tracker comprehensive blood panels again that's insid tracker.com huberman to get 10% off slightly tangential question but I think meaningful given the context of what we're talking about why is it that if I eat a plate of scrambled eggs or a steak or a chicken breast and some vegetables I feel very saded um and unless I did some hard resistance training I'm kind of good with that but that if I eat any of those same foods and one piece of a baguette or one fork full of pasta that then I want a lot more pasta and I want half the loaf of bread why is that is it the blood glucose response is there something about carbohydrate at the level of the mouth I mean what is it you know former guest on this podcast Dr Diego borquez who studies gut brain sensing explained to us and this is separate from the microbiome that we have receptors all along the length of our gut from our mouth out to the rectum that are sensing the amino acids and are looking for those essential amino acids but also sensing sugar and things like that and signaling to the brain about how much more we should eat of a given food or forage for a given food and I just have to say at a psychological level subjective level there's something so fundamentally different about eating protein and veget vegetables or protein fruits and vegetables in the absence of starchy carbohydrates and one adds starchy carbohydrates or eat starchy carbohydrates alone and it's like it's not a runaway train but it's almost as if like it's never quite enough until there's a physical volume in the gut that is like at threshold and I don't think I'm alone in this you look at the way people eat chips you look at the way people eat pasta you look at the way people eat risoto and it's just different I mean there are a few you know freaks out there that probably to ribeye Stakes but for most people a ribeye steak is like enough one ribey is enough what is going on there and and feel free to speculate but is it amino acid sensing and because I think this is really important because I think as you're suggesting if I may that people prioritize protein from the first meal of the day and throughout the day you know I think people are imagining well gosh what happens to my pasta what happens to the bread what happens to all these things and you know they're perhaps overlooking the fact that eating protein vegetables and maybe fruit maybe a little bit of starch is just a a completely different experience than eating starch alone or starch in in larger volumes there now I'm going to speculate here the foods that we have access to are highly palatable and potentially we weren't necessarily designed to have access to those kinds of foods um and this kind of moves into this idea of something called the protein leverage hypothesis and the leverage hypothesis is that individuals will continue to eat and this is one way people explain obesity is that individuals will eat to satisfy an amino acid need now your original question was when we eat um carbohydrates or risoto uh there is a component of blood sugar regulation that happens so as you go beyond that 50 gram threshold you tend to release more insulin so there's an insulinogenic effect of dietary carbohydrates which some people will experience as lower blood sugar we've all had that experience where you're I mean not all but you know e eating your kids macaroni and cheese and then you just can't stop and then you probably feel very tired there's an eban flow of blood sugar the interesting thing about dietary protein is you will hear people say I'm going to reduce my dietary protein because it's insulinogenic as well so dietary protein does does cause a phase one insulin release and that's pre-formed insulin in the pancreas it is a component uh for muscle protein synthesis but it is roughly 20% of the insulin response than the same amount of carbohydrates and when you eat a pro a a meal that is robust and dietary protein your body will be able to then generate its own glucose roughly for every 100 grams of protein your body will generate 60 grams of glucose over a period of time through the process called glucon Genesis and that is one of the benefits of a higher protein diet you generate the glucose that you need and can that be converted into glycogen can repack muscle that you've that is a good question the process is very slow so it's a it's a much slower process than if you were to have your bread or risotto so you told us about essential amino acids are there any essential carbohydrates no there are essential fatty acids yeah there are and you know it's interesting we're talking about protein and as as I mentioned before we simplified in the way that we talk about it is it's one thing but it's 20 different amino acids these amino acids each have unique metabolic roles in the body it's not interchangeable for example the essential amino acid will'll just pick a brain one uh tryptophan for serotonin production or thine for mucin production in the gut which helps the gut lining or you know take your pick phenyalanine these all of these essential amino acids do various things in the body for skeletal muscle the primary essential amino acid is Lucine and while again it is very complex in the way that we would think about how do we eat enough lysine or how do we eat enough methionine it's not a great way to think about because then Things become very complex and someone is like well what do I do but if you eat for the needs of skeletal muscle Health everything else falls into place my mom is 79 years old she's relatively lean um by my read I haven't um seen her dexa results but she's probably had some muscular atrophy she does yoga she walks she Gardens um and seems to be in good health thank thank goodness my guess is she's lost some muscle in the last decades if she were to increase the amount of protein quality protein that she eats especially in that first meal of the day um would the health of her muscle and her muscle mass change even if she does no resistance exercise I I suppose she gets a little bit of resistance training from the yoga but I haven't been to a yoga class with my mom ever you guys aren't doing headstands definitely not doing headstands she's actually you know she's she's very mobile and very sharp and um I'm very vivacious um but I don't think she's doing the the more you know Advanced inversion things at yoga so let's assume that um she's doing some moderate exercise three three four times a week but not training with weights if somebody like her or a you know a younger male that has a similar pattern of behavior you know desk worker for the most part uh jogs a little bit gets on the on the Recumbent Bike or whatever it is but is not um doing resistance training increases is their quality protein intake um throughout the day and especially at that first meal ensuring at least 30 and up to 50 grams of intake what changes are likely to happen even without resistance exercise um well the first thing is that if she is eating a sub amount of protein let's say she's eating the Rd of protein and the average woman eats around 68 grams of protein a day 40% of women over the age of 60 are deficient in protein they're eating below the RDA and what's happening to their body is their body robbing their existing skeletal muscle of amino acids in order to supply what the brain and other organs need in part in part one of the things that happens with aging is the body the whole body protein turnover becomes um less efficient so the body is turning over roughly 300 grams of protein a day that's a lot of turnover a lot it is a lot of turnover 300 g of protein turnover yes and muscle only accounts for maybe 25% of turnover an individual might eat an average female like your mom is eating probably around 68 grams of protein a day yeah if I'm lucky she's she's not big on on um beef or chicken and listen mostly eggs and a little bit of fish and lots of vegetables and fruits but maintains again a like a healthy lean body weight and and that is wonderful so she's balancing her lower protein intake with physical activity remember there are two main ways to stimulate skeletal muscle and that's through resistance training which one would argue she is doing and or dietary protein but when we think about muscle protein synthesis there's really four inputs there's resistance training there's energy there's insulin growth hormones and then there's Lucine when you are younger your body is driven by more of the anabolic hormones which is one reason why we believe that a younger individual can get way with five to 10 gr to 15 gram of dietary protein because their um levels of testosterone Andor estrogen are driving protein synthesis in a way that lets them offset any dietary deficiencies well that their body is just highly anabolic they're growing they're growing up they're growing when an individual like your mom who's now stopped growing the body becomes much more reliant on loosing and resistance training because the main pathway that these things go towards is is something called mtor mamalian Target of rapamycin the influence on those Pathways changes as we age so the lever in which you pull changes and the importance of that lever changes so that the best thing that your mom could do to maintain skeletal muscle so why and what happens to skeletal muscle as we age skeletal muscle if it is not contracted and utilized gets this fat infiltration mitochondria changes protein turnover changes it becomes less efficient at sensing amino acids there's a decrease in capillary profusion which is why one reason why exercise is so important in order for her skeletal muscle to respond like a younger muscle what she should do is do some kind of resistance training and then add in some kind of dietary protein because when we think about the protein hierarchy the amount of protein in a 24-hour period matters the most protein hierarchy um um again closer to one gram per pound ideal body weight the evidence would say 1.6 gram per kg I'll never forget out when the protage study came out I can't believe I've been out of Fellowship that long but the protage study was a position paper and it talked about how the current recommendation for dietary protein is too low and that to support healthy aging you need 2.5 grams of Lucine or roughly 30 gram of protein and um you know an increase in total overall dietary protein and this was really the first position statement and that came out gosh I think 2010 yet we haven't changed any of the recommendations for the general population yet so in order for your mom's muscle to respond if you compound those two things then she will maintain with activity the health of her skeletal muscle you mentioned something else an individual shouldn't just load protein loading extra protein and not moving is not a good idea because of proteins effect on mtor throughout the body so we talked about mtor which is mechanistic Target of rapamycin in skeletal muscle in the brain and the pancreas this is a um a protein complex that you just don't want stimulated all day long yeah for sake of um cancer risk yes my understanding is that mtor is very highly expressed in all cells of the body early in development and throughout growth in fact it's expressed in the cells I spent my career working on the retinal cells and then over time it drops off and it's remarkable how studies where emor is replaced into cells allows them to essentially look like and behave like young cells again even replacing some regenerative capacity this is work of a guy named xigang he at Harvard uh Children's Hospital at Harvard Medical School but what one always observes and we've done these experiments in my lab is that when you increase mtor by any number of different you know um ways you know molecular CH canery and things like that that the cells grow enormous and the concern is always that if you increase mtor that you are going to bias any pre-existing tumors to proliferate as well is that right um I think that that yes compon yes um it is and we have to recognize that mtor stimulation is different in different parts of the body just as you mentioned and so um skeletal muscle is uniquely sensitive to contraction and it's through this biochemical process called red one and when you contract skeletal muscle it inhibits red one which then again there is this uh fast foration of mtor and muscle protein synthesis happens that is unique to skeletal muscle and when individuals will say this is will be a common discussion that you hear in the space is that well I don't want to increase my dietary protein because some how that is going to cause cancer and that is not true that is a very myopic thought process that would be the same as saying resistance training which also stimulates mtor is going to cause cancer right I completely agree with you I think um it's interesting the mtor which in mice is mamalian Target of rapy um that word rapy might you know um prick up some people's ears there are some people out there and by the way I'm not recommending this that take rap Amy as a way to inhibit mtor in hopes of extending their lifespan uh there's some animal studies that support this there's um growing interest in this and um so much so that some people are willing to take rap ayin um by that logic rap ayin would perhaps inhibit muscle growth muscle Health that's a whole other discussion we'd have to get a TIA and a few Matt cine and a few other folks here um and maybe we will with you to to discuss that but the point being that I agree completely that we can't just say something that increases mtor in muscle is also going to increase cancer that these molecules like mtor have distinct roles in distinct tissues at distinct time points throughout the lifespan and as you mentioned ingesting quality protein can increase muscle protein synthesis by way of mtor and other Pathways right as well as resistance training and I don't think anyone in the longevity space would suggest that resistance training is a bad thing and yet we know it's increasing mtor so there's a little bit of a of a contradiction in that field just if one stands back from it and says well wait you want to take rapid M to block mtor but you also want to do resistance training to stimulate mtor which one is it yeah and we have to recognize that the efficiency of the stimulation declines as we age and the way that we overcome that is again this idea of muscle span how do we continue to go through life and design a diet that we know will be more dependent on dietary protein and movement as we age because the balance between the two changes when you're young you could eat the twinky diet probably look at a weight and grow age is the great equalizer you I trained in geriatrics and I am telling you age is the great equalizer and creating protocols and habits put into place to allow you to age well is everything and there is so much confusion in the nutrition space that if we can pull back and recognize well number one science is a is a evolving field and it's the you know is a science of uncertainty but there are foundational principles that we can put into place and one of those foundational principles is skeletal muscle Health Muscle as the organ of longevity must be supported and there are very few ways in which we can do that you know when you think about the metabolic implications of skeletal muscle as glucose disposal unit these diseases of Aging really begin skeletal muscle before you see any outward signs of obesity before you see any outward signs of um anything that would indicate you are unhealthy it's kind of like osteoporosis as the silent disease skeletal muscle health is also that way and in fact there's some very uh pivotal work out of Yale and they looked at young healthy college students you know as a college student you'll do anything for a couple bucks right and they pay them um and these individuals were sedentary and what they but they were healthy lean and what they saw was skeletal muscle insulin resistance just by being inactive can you imagine as you continue and how do we Define inactivity now what is it less than 5,000 steps per day per day W there multiple way I mean think about it we were designed as humans to be very mobile and so now we live in a world that what we think about as sedentary Behavior as something innocuous and and not a big deal it is in it is a disease state so I feel like you've made an excellent case for the ingestion of sufficient amounts of quality protein each day especially starting with that first meal of the day um and just to underscore the suggestion that I heard it was aim for one gram of quality protein per pound of Target body weight so if somebody weighs 200 lb in the like to weigh 180 lbs try and get 180 gram of quality protein per day divided up into meals that include somewhere between 30 to 50 grams of protein per meal yes and that first and last meal are the most important there's a lot of information going around that an even distribution has to happen and partially this is my mentor's fault he'll laugh um this 30 grams of protein three times a day I'm sure you've heard about it yeah or that you can't assimilate more than 30 grams of protein per meal let's let's um you assimilate you you assimilate all the protein that you ingest even if it's either correct 100 grams correct even if it is 100 grams skeletal muscle protein synthesis will max out probably at 55 grams again this is maybe it's 50 maybe it's 55 the rest is oxidized you can only incorporate so many proteins so much protein and the rest is then used as fuel or oxidized what if I do hard resistance training in the hours before a meal and then that that meal includes 100 gram of quality proteins let's say whey protein do I put all of that 100 grams into muscle protein synthesis I would say I don't know if you put all 100 grams but I would guess that it would cap out at a at a certain number and really the totality of evidence would suggest it's probably around 55 grams so regardless of whether or not somebody does resistance training you can ingest about 50 gram of protein again four calories per gram um typically um into muscle protein synthesis the rest is oxidized yes um maybe just touch on that process of oxidation what that looks like yeah it's basically just utilizing those proteins it's utilizing them for energy it's not storing them it whether it goes back for glucano Genesis or wherever it goes it is then oxidized okay and if that meal with let's say 50 grams of quality protein is combined with 50 grams of carbohydrate fruit some oatmeal pasta rice Etc does that change the utilization of the protein at all I know I asked this question earlier but one could imagine that the body wants to use different fuel sources differently um is there any selective use of one um macronutrient versus the other question that that's an excellent question um the body that amount it will be seen as a mixed meal but the body will always choose to get rid of glucose first glucose dominates metabolism because again it can be toxic to the body so it must be utilized now what is also very interesting is that now you're talking about the speed of absorption one of the things that we should mention is typically you need a substantial rise in loosing and that will be again uh that will probably take and last around 2 to 2 and a half hours so when you have a mixed meal that slows down absorption digestion this is where the quality of the protein comes in that becomes very important because you have to reach a threshold in the blood to stimulate tissue and there was a very interesting study it's the first study of its kind and this came out of Luke Van loon's lab and basically they looked at a a vegan diet with I think it had 40 grams of protein and then it had a omnivorous diet so it had both sources of protein um and what they found was that the individuals that had the for the 40 G meal that was a mixed meal with animal-based proteins actually stimulated muscle protein synthesis whereas the mixed meal of just the vegetables did not interesting even though it was plant-based proteins High you know um enough protein in that meal and that likely might be because of the rate of absorption because of the fiber content and it becomes important to recognize that a higher protein meal seemed especially with the quality of the protein that if you're picking the range between 30 and 50 depending on the mixed meal amount um I would certainly go towards that higher end what is the case for fiber either supplementing fiber or um in my case I get fiber from fruits and vegetables mainly fiber is extremely valuable it's extremely valuable for the gut microbiome it's extremely valuable for satiation um fiber if I were to design a diet the first thing that I would pick would be dietary protein then I would think about how I'm going to parse out the rest of the carbohydrates because you earn carbohydrates through exercise I usually choose berries um high fiber sources of berries and then whatever fat blueberri strawberries blackberries them I'm a big fan of berries I'm like a grizzly bear when it comes to berries I'm a driveby blueberry eater when they're there I can't help but swipe them off the the bowl or the plate um but there was something else that you mentioned that I wanted to highlight and this was if I did resistance training then could I eat 100 grams of protein and then 100 grams of carbohydrates the amazing part about exercise is you know what we really care about is glucose disposal and insulin sensitivity this idea of insulin resistance is killing our world young people too yes yes we've seen double to Triple the rates of childhood obesity that's wild I don't think people younger than um um 25 recognize that like when I was growing up in school we there was junk food Lord knows there was junk food there was also good food and different kids from different homes ate different amounts of junk food but it was the rare individual in school who was overweight who was obese right um and you had some kids that seemed to be just kind of like born lean and and um with more muscle you had said wor were thinner with less muscle less it but it was very rare that there was uh an obese kid you just didn't see it much and I don't recall there being a lot of restrictive eating or even discussion about nutrition right and people were eating cereals people were eating candy bars they were also eating eggs and sandwiches and chicken dinners and um all sorts of stuff um so what's happened yeah like really what's happened because something is fundamentally different we we had PE class that was required we had to run we had to play volleyball um we had to do those things but it's not like we were all athletes and we'd walk to class I skateboard I played some soccer but I wasn't an athlete per se so like what in the world is going on yeah I will say that also two-thirds of Americans are either overweight or obese yeah it's wild I mean again one has to have been born in the 70s as I was or early ' 80s to really appreciate this tremendous shift in kind of like what you see and sure people are on phones more more sedentary it's got to be a combination of things but they're it's cultural we have a disease on of inactivity and sedentary behavior um that is frankly killing our population almost 50% of people have hypertension we have a a an what 40 million people on statins I'm sure that number has changed and skeletal muscle is medicine skeletal muscle again helps with triglycerides helps with insulin glucose disposal so where this came from you just mentioned if I exercise then can I eat whatever you're eating yes but we're not talking about being irresponsible but skeletal muscle now has sensitized within TW you know there's a 24-hour period 72-hour period where that muscle is still sensitized meaning it it consumes more nutrients it consumes more nutrients but also when you think about insulin resistance insulin moves gluc ose out of the bloodstream into cells and through the muscle there's the insulin dependent pathway through um obviously insulin and that's whatever pi3k if you care if anyone cares and then there is insulin independent which is through exercise and how glucose moves from the bloodstream into the cells is through glute four receptors when you exercise you increase the density of glute 4 receptors to the surface just by doing activity it doesn't require insulin you are able to then move glucose out of the bloodstream into cells and again insulin resistance is at the heart of so many of the problems that we're seeing do you think that most people including the um I'll just say it the public health officials in charge understand that the points that you just made I mean clearly one doesn't have to even have a degree in medic or science of any sort to look around and say okay there are a lot of people um suffering from obesity and we are hearing more and more about the negative effects on brain on other aspects of mental health and physical health and the interrelatedness of mental health and obesity I mean um Dr Chris Palmer from medical school yeah wonderful person former guest on this podcast very popular episode I mean it's really been championing this issue um as of a few Folks at Stanford and elsewhere this new field of so-called metabolic Psychiatry the link between brain health mental health and and U metabolic Health um but putting all that aside do you think that most public health officials understand that muscle contraction increases glute four expression at the level muscle which then um uh grabs more nutrients from the bloodstream which then lends itself to all sorts of positive health benefits and diverts from these negative health benefits I mean like why isn't that on every billboard why I mean it's such a simple um Concept in principle yeah like why aren't we hearing this I mean do they even require PE in school anymore um no I am not sure but this is a this is a problem I don't know but I would say if two-thirds of our population is either overweight or obese um the health officials may fall into that category or at least two-thirds of them potentially yeah and I'm not blaming them I'm just wondering I mean I don't think um well I I don't think we hear this message enough that muscle contraction is medicine we've heard that from Dr Casey means we're hearing about it from you that muscle and muscle Health in particular and again I'm so grateful that we're talking about muscle health and muscle quality and muscle as a tissue that utilizes nutrients and can divert things towards health and away from disease as opposed to just muscle size because I think most people hear muscle and they think eat from muscle and they just think muscle size and frankly most people don't want increased muscle size but if you train for hypertrophy which is muscle size very difficult to get especially as you age by the way it becomes much more difficult but you will also get strength and power if an individual struggles you know if they fall they break a hip they have to be able to get off up off the floor you have to be able to travel on an airplane and put your stuff overhead or pick up your toddler mine weighs 40 pounds or go downstairs what um Dr Peter AA has really been emphasizing that a lot of life-ending injuries life-ending injuries occur by virtue of people failing to do the Ecentric movements of that are essentially look like going down stepping down off something I've had to have this discussion with both my parents it was a little bit uncomfortable frankly because no one wants to be told Hey listen here are the things that can can potentially kill you it's don't worry so much about going upstairs make sure you hold the the railing both of my parents being able-bodied I'm grateful again for that but be careful as you walk downstairs I mean one fracture at age 79 80 the age of my parents you I think I'm going to get these numbers a bit wrong I'm sure but I think um Peter mentions that that leads to death in a large percentage of people that break that hip or break that leg or break that wrist even yes and the other thing that not because of the break itself but because the inactivity that results and that's absolutely right the skeletal muscle inactivity causes a derangement of metabolism the derangement of metabolism will then go on to get fatty acid infiltration fatty acids that infiltrate into skeletal muscle once that happens you now have a decreased flux you're not moving muscle glycogen you're not getting rid of these ceramides or these diog glycerols that build up that potentially lead to an compound insulin resistance skeletal muscle insulin resistance you then generate a low grade inflammation that is constantly going on if 40% of your body weight is skeletal muscle and you are not maintaining the health of skeletal muscle you are walking around with an inflammatory bag on you this decline in aging people think that we go through a linear decline in aging we don't we go through a series of catabolic crisis and a catabolic crisis would be something like someone Falls breaks a hip and never regains full functioning or someone gets pneumonia is on bed rest for 5 days or a period of time this compounds upon itself these catabolic crises compound upon themselves and individuals never return to full function the thing that becomes interesting and very important is that when you maintain the health of skeletal muscle low muscle mass would be early indication of osteoporosis bone attaches to muscle muscle pulls bone creates a um a load a stimulation that is required for for building I mean imagine the astronauts or an individual who again is on bed rest when you are training and you are putting force and load on your body then you're able to maintain the entirety of the architecture of the body and this all makes useful sense um but it is underappreciated as an organ system and the other thing about skeletal muscle and depression and mood is that skeletal muscle and inflammation as you contract it the duration and intensity of contraction releases myokines uh so myocin have you heard of myokines uh I have but please educate us yes so amines are peptide hormones again skeletal muscles and endocrine organ that travel throughout the body the most famous one is interlan 6 you have interlan 15 interlukin 6 these affect um lipolysis they affect the utilization of glucose there's this idea of training in low glycogen state that might increase a more robust amounts of these inter lucans these myocin which great CU I love training fast which is interesting and we always think about exercise as this way to improve metabolism um it doesn't so much do that at rest but what it does is when you exercise you improve again glucose utilization but also you release these myocin it's not just the physical activity but it's also the subsequent effects and the subsequent um molecules that skeletal muscle releases I I just want to say realizing I'm interrupting Amen to that so often people look at how many calories were burned in a given bout of resistance training and while that is perhaps interesting the wavefront of other endocrine and molecular factors that set in motion by proper resistance training to me is the most interesting and important aspect meaning in the hours afterwards sure you're going to continue to burn calories at an elevated rate but it's all the the effects of the hormones and as you're pointing out the Incans that last hours and hours and even days that at least to my mind or my reader the literature are the most interesting the most benal fascinating and actually the science is relatively new it came out of uh Peterson's lab bente Pon in Copenhagen um extraordinary work she's an she is in part an immunologist and exercise physiologist when you train and you release these myokines they which are based on the intensity and duration of your activity release something called capspin B and irisin these myocin then stimulate bdnf release in the brain brain deriv neut trophy exactly which is a component of neurogenesis when we think about the plethora of activity of what skeletal muscle does it is no surprise that number one it's free to move can I just um mention something about bdnf if I may um I spent much of my earlier career working on neuroplastic brain development and bdnf brain derived neutrophic Factor gets mentioned from time to time and um as you mentioned it's involved in different neurogenesis Pathways and um but I think one of its most interesting effects is its role in consolidating existing connections what we call synaptic Connections in the brain and I'm so glad you mentioned this because what you're effectively saying is that doing resistance training properly sets in motion a molecular Cascade that feeds back to a molecular Cascade within the brain that rein en forces the neural circuits that exist and one of the Hallmarks of Aging is a essentially a a degradation of neural circuitry right sometimes in extreme cases like Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia Parkinson's Etc but we know that the volume of gray matter of of of NE neurons within the brain declines with age we know that the neural circuitry suffers the speed of of neuronal transmission suffers and it's long been observed but only now um objectively substantiated that exercise can not just maintain but even improve brain function over time and so um thank you for allowing me to kind of uh expand on on what you just said I just think that um if ever there was a potent medicine for improving brain health its exercise and in particular resistance exercise I think that the case for cardiovascular exercise is probably that it maintains the the components of blood flow that are also critical for the yes and certainly no one is arguing the importance of cardiovascular activity and V2 Max we can appreciate that on the flip side of that skeletal muscle has not had its moment yet and in particular resistance training you're not going to be able to be effective at maintaining a V2 max if you do not have healthy skeletal muscle you are not going to be able to be effective at nearly doing anything or surviving any kind of illness the higher the amount of skeletal muscle mass you have the healthy skeletal muscle mass the greater your survivability against nearly any kind of disease remarkable for example can cancer CIA which is the wasting that comes with cancer kills 20% of individuals survivability comes from the health of skeletal muscle also on that same note Contracting skeletal muscle releasing myocin interfaces with cells of the immune system we've all heard of macras and the cytokine storm in Lucan 15 uh tnf tnf Alpha as being uh pro-inflammatory when the myocin which are also in Lucan 6 and interlan 15 are released from skeletal muscle they interplay and they somewhat dampen the inflammatory effect and have a different effect on the entirety of the system when these quote cyto kindes come from skeletal muscle incredible so as long as we are now on the topic of exercise let's make it concrete for people we talked earlier about nutrition and specific gram amounts and calorie amounts and distribution and that's just wonderful and thanks also for explaining the mechanism and the incentive for doing this let's talk about resistance training um and let's do this in a slightly different way than we did earlier what is your program for resistance training and then we'll talk about what other people might consider for them and maybe the same thing so if you could just actually walk us through your week what does it look like um it could be uh Sunday Monday Tuesday Etc or could be you know how many days a week do you resistance train of course you didn't know I don't I don't do any kind of training yeah well I know based on your Instagram what you do and um and now we we know why so I have a wonderful train uh trainer Carlos M shout out to him every Monday I decide I don't want to train and I know that of course you don't enjoy it um I do but it's usually suffering um at least Monday every morning I I know Monday morning's going to come up and I'm going to think about all the ways in which I can get out of it I never get out of it I always show up I train consistently three days a week and I can train I train pretty heavy for my size so I'm maybe 110 pounds um what I do is I do some kind of push pull hinge squat on all three of those days I do so you train your whole body I do three days a week separated by a day in between I do I do because uh essentially I'm working hard enough where I'm pretty exhausted so I came here and you asked me if I trained this morning Friday I'm off today okay but what I do is when I start I think about well actually Carlos things about this but I'll do some kind of sled push sled push uh it will be loaded it will be pretty heavy it gets my full body moving and then we'll pick some kind of compound movement whether it's a multi-joint movement that's exactly right a multi-joint movement through full range of motion so for instance a squat or a deadlift that's right um if somebody isn't skilled in squats or deadlifts um could they maybe hold on to a a kettle bell of appropriate weight for them and do like a kettle bell squat I'm going to give them an even better solution and this is this concept that I learned from um a PhD named Pat Davidson and he talks a lot about High Ground low ground movements and a high ground movement would be something where you have contact contact like a hack squat so ground you have back support leg support you are able to move in a way that fully contracts the muscle that you are focused on we see a lot of people that go to the gym and kind of just do whatever and that might be okay to maintain but the goal should always be ladies you're not going to get bulky should be Hy hypertrophy which is hard to achieve as you hard to achieve but you must Focus because maintaining and growing skeletal muscle mass as you age it becomes much more challenging and so choosing High Ground movements I would not have someone who is an unskilled lifter go in and do a front-loaded um goblet squat or free weight squat or deadlift right I wouldn't I would have them do High Ground movements and this is where machines are really really wonderful people kind of will say well but you have to train for functional movement and functional well what is that we're training for life right we training for Life durability and uh if I may um you know anytime people say you know what's the best form of exercise how do you work out Etc I always say rule number one definitely train but don't get hurt or avoid getting hurt I mean the moment somebody approaches exercise and gets hurt they're in trouble one of the best ways to get in shape for your entire life is to avoid getting injured but still train or train your entire life if there are parents listening thinking about your kids there was a a whole push where kids shouldn't do resistance training and shouldn't move load I look at my kids they might not be doing one rep Maxes but they're picking up kettle bells they have oh yeah yeah I was told growing up to not touch the weights until I was at least 18 at 16 I started doing you know pull-ups push-ups sit-ups um and then uh pretty quickly moved into all the leg press leg extension you all that stuff couldn't help myself but I would argue that outside normal play someone is never too young to start and frankly never too old and body weight resistance is in many cases sufficient right I mean as a kid I would do um at night I would do sit-ups and handstand push-ups against my door you know I couldn't do a proper handstand unassisted but I'd you know flip over and then do the handstand push-ups until my mom would yell at me about the marks on the on the door but you know that's that's was pretty tough right getting 10 repetitions of that was pretty tough um but you're saying resistance training what you said um High Ground High ground contact high contact so um when you are choosing motions that an individual is unskilled to do I think Le let's frame this is that most most people think about exercise for optimization of performance but if we take that back a notch and you know I think about um my audience and they are individuals that are um aside from the special operators and aside from the CEOs they are 40-year-old women that are like hey all of a sudden I noticed that my body composition has changed you know I work with an amazing PhD her name is Victoria flear and she has helped me bring into these pieces of how do we design and think about training protocols and training programs for the more mature individual and when you think about these High Ground movements if someone has not trained and they're thinking well I don't want to fall so I'm going to do box jumps that plyometric movement there's a high probability of injury yeah I don't like box jumps or I don't like them because I the Ecentric loading that you know it ends up being a lot of soreness and it just takes a lot of them to to generate what I'm trying to generate so that is exactly the point is an individual going to be able to generate enough Force to make it meaningful and someone would argue yes well for them that would be you know when I was a a practicing geriatrician and I was going through my fellowship we did the a number of metrics to look at strength and one of those was a sit and um stand out of a chair so sit to stand and that would have for some people have been considered a high-intensity interval the question becomes is that enough to mount a response over time and I would argue no what do people need to do and that is when you train for hypertrophy which is muscle growth and let's say that is five to 10 reps three you know four to five sets you pick there's many different ways that it where the final repetitions are challenging where the final and the load is enough and there's wonderful data out of mcmas University that it doesn't have to be heavyweight as long as the stimulus is enough and then we take it back to what is the stimulus and the stimulus the goal should be are you moving the muscles that you are supposed to be doing and are you generating enough activity to create adaptation and change and so a high ground movement for someone who's listening to this and and is thinking I need skeletal muscle health I walk Walking is wonderful but is walking enough to maintain those type two fibers it's not you will see a transition and we've all seen our aging parents I mean my dad is in his 70s he's very fit but he used to be a Collegiate wrestler he went to warten he was Captain of his wrestling team Dad you're a lot smaller and part of the reason is the fail the failure to focus on hypertrophy and those are those type two fibers those type two fibers that transition with age to more type one fibers those long lean fibers you go from bigger to Bulky to less choosing activities to maintain those fibers also these fibers are bigger this is where glucose disposal goals choosing things like leg extension it's not a bad thing if you get stronger and you have stronger muscles then you will have more power you'll be able to generate more Force you will be much less likely to fall and you'll be healthier overall because of muscle health so maybe we could just list off some of the movements that um people could think about in terms of these High Ground movements you mentioned hack squats uh leg presses come to mind leg extension leg curls leg curls lat pull Downs with a supported back any kind of RS rows a supported row again these are mostly machine exercises that you're describing they are they are which is UN machines so cables would be considered low ground because you're kind of in space and if you think about it what takes someone out in their 40s what takes someone out of the game it's a tendon injury tendonopathy whether it's a shoulder whether it's a hamstring whether it's a hip and part of the reason is there's muscular strength we focus on muscular strength but there's also tendon strength which takes time and when you get tendinopathies you get the thickening of these tissues you know people will say that tendon lays down much slower that the collagen turnover is much slower but actually muscle turns over 1 to 2% per day 10 pendens uh turn over maybe 0.5 to 1.5% per day it's not that substantially slow these it's highly active tissue you need blood flow you have to treat your body with respect that if you think you can always train the way that you did when you were younger and just hit those heavy weights if you get injured and you are not allowing your tendons to keep up then overall injury over time again this is what we would call maybe not a catabol crises but close what is the total duration of a resistance training workout that the typical person uh could use I I make it a point to try and warm up over the course of about 10 to 15 minutes and then do 50 to 60 Minutes of hard work um but I always leave some gas in the tank it's it's the rare I would say 5% of my total resistance training workouts and I also train three times a week although I divide my body up into different um you splits um that's uh my case and I run well you are much much larger than me well it's it's um it's the case now that I try and hit each muscle group directly once per week and then in directly another day per week so if legs are on Monday the in that's direct and then but the indirect leg training is actually the hit workout on Friday sprinting as I love that that's wonderful I think that the um three days per week whole body workout I think would work for a lot of people just to take the complexity out of it um so is it the case that the entire workout could be um constrained to 40 to 60 Minutes absolutely and for a new lifter they're going to get the most gains what we find is that an if an individual is what we would consider a beginner you will see um you know after they go through a neural um a neurological adaptation is that they will get more um growth and potentially progress a new lifter could progress weekly whereas a more advanced lifter I would say we would be considered more advanced we've been lifting our whole lives that for us to make changes um it's it's much more challenging for us to put on size or uh even get stronger I mean yes there is a particular Cadence but our improvements might be minute and when you're thinking about designing a program the current recommendations uh for physical activity which by the way do you know 75 roughly 70 maybe it's 78% of individuals do not meet physical activity guidelines and what are those again 5,000 steps per day 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity with two days a week of resistance training per week yeah so 150 minutes total and two days a week of resistance plus two days a week of resistance training um so that is what 30 minutes 7 days a week of activity just to put that into perspective that is how sedentary we are 50% of Americans are not even training is that true in other countries as well um well I don't know the statistics in other countries but far and away we have arguably the biggest Health crisis with our population people always point to the blue zones they say well in the blue zones they have like a shot of vodka every night and they're socially connected and they have a Mediterranean diet and they're not lifting weights but is it the case that they are um piling wood um are they walking more um are they caring active okay highly active and the blue zones are a funny thing because um you know some will say well are the the records kept appropriately and and Etc there is um a lot though despite that that we can learn from the blue zones and I think again uh connection social socialization but also movement you know part of the reason why we are requiring this higher protein load is because we are physically less active again there's only two main ways to stimulate skeletal muscle resistance training and dietary protein arguably the resistance training piece the physical activity piece is more influential is much more impactful to full body homeostasis than diet will ever be if you just eat protein and don't exercise you will likely still lose muscle interesting my observation of family friend friends um that include people who are very fit into their 80s and '90s and even Beyond in a few cases are that and here these are uh generalizations based on observation I want to be clear that the people I know who are still skiing in their 80s who are sprinting in their 80s you know not as fast as they used to who are still playing tennis um in their 80s so what I'm referring to here are people that are playing sports that involve Dynamic movement that involve a lot of coordination and no doubt some resistance um at least of some sort like skiing is you know there's some resistance involved depending on the complexity of the slope ET yeah and trees so um what do you think is going on there I mean there's a rich literature to support the fact that most of our brain volume is there to support vision and movement and that when we move less there's brain atrophy um John Rady at Harvard talked a lot about this even some species of animals that will spend part of their life swimming around and then they'll Nest on a rock and then the brain will actually eat itself due to the lack of movement will just metabolize uh portions of itself so the relationship between movement and brain health um seems Seems obvious but um yeah how many folks do you see out there in their 60s 7s 80s and 90s that are now doing resistance training do we know the percentages on that um I don't and I was just recently looking at the ACSM guidelines which which is the American College of sports medicine um for activity and older individuals I am not sure the percentage of individuals that are actually doing resistance training and partially um I'd have to believe that it's less so again I trained as a geriatrician and one of the things that we always saw not for everybody but for the majority of people is it wasn't the duration of the training they were still if they were active they were still active it was the intensity that they were able to Mount and so because you know there's this interesting thing is as we age well I mean some of us are less intense in our training and it's the actual intensity piece that seems to go down that when this can be addressed and what do I mean by intensity um there's a million ways in which I suppose one could Define intensity but it is pushing themselves again are we going to say is it how many reps how heavy but the focus and the intensity of the training goes down I guess we could Define intensity somewhat Loosely but still fairly by saying you know repetitions in the what you know 5 to 10 maybe 12 repetition range where the final two or three repetitions are challenging um in good form right maybe even to failure in good form does that does that seem like Fair yeah and and I would think of the intensity component because the Aging literature it really doesn't seem to matter if people are lifting heavier light I used to believe that in order to maintain skeletal muscle mass especially as hormonal status changes decrease in testosterone decrease in estrogen decrease in progesterone that the heaviness of the load has to increase I can't the data doesn't necessarily support that I would love for that to be the case surprising to me I would think think people would have to push themselves with not extremely heavy loads but moderately heavy for them so was surprising to me as well and especially when we worked on some of those earlier studies in layman's lab there's this change in body composition that seems to happen midlife there's an increase in visceral body fat um or Central adiposity and one would think that you require a lot of extra uh supplements Etc to influence that but when training and nutrition are accounted for in a very controlled way body composition changes to the positive you can lose body fat and increase muscle mass it'll be very interesting to see as the literature around hormone replacement continues to evolve especially as it relates to women because we know that testosterone improves skeletal muscle mass um but that isn't going to be enough if you don't have the foundation the foundation in place and I think that the other big concern is how we're measuring skeletal muscle mass we mentioned a little bit about dexa the more effective way is really MRI which doesn't seem to be achievable for many people it's expensive and and CT would be the other way to actually look at muscle quality muscle quality right now is defined purely on functional movement measurements but that's clearly not it when we Define if you look in the literature muscle quality is really about the load and the weight and the performance not about the architecture and the infrastructure of the skeletal muscle and the reason I say this let let me take a step back is that in the literature and you will often hear people say that only strength matters Size Doesn't Matter I don't believe that to be true I believe that we haven't been able to test muscle size appropriately and when we begin to test it there's a a way and this is I I think this is being done it it came from a a gentleman named uh Dr uh William Evans and he utilizes something called a D3 creatine and it's a deuterated tagged creatine and an individual will ingest a pill creatine is largely in skeletal muscle there may be a small amount in brain but for the majority of skeletal muscle is that's where creatine goes and so this is a direct way first time ever it's it's been validated I think it started its utilization in maybe 2019 but when individuals are directly measuring skeletal muscle mass they find that skeletal muscle mass and strength are both important interesting so is there a synergistic effect of ingesting quality protein in sufficient amounts distributed throughout the day and as you mentioned especially at the first and last meal of the day and resistance training exercise on muscle health and other metrics of longevity and current health status this is a bit of a nuanced answer if you are young and you are eating close to 1 gram per pound ideal body weight then any time that you ingest your protein would be adequate however if you're older and you want to take advantage of resistance training plus dietary protein than consuming within an hour or so and again that number is the the way in which I think about it is really about that blood flow is how long that blood flow is still getting to the skeletal muscle because you're delivering nutrients if you are older or have a chronic condition then there would be no downside and there is evidence in the literature if you consume dietary protein around resistance training due to that synergistic effect if you are eating a lower protein diet and or older got it so would it be actionable to try and I don't know drink a away protein drink within an hour of resistance training or eating a meal that include a chicken breast or some eggs or or steak is that is that basically what we're talking about um it is is if you are eating a lower protein diet I would take advantage of that because you increase the efficiency you lower that anabolic resistance load um yes one could do that and I say this in a way that if you are young and healthy and you are training I don't really care when you ingest your protein but if you are a um a group or in a group of individuals that potentially is at risk then doing resistance training and adding in dietary protein I would say a shake is a great way to go because the absorption is quicker a meal will have a slower absorption and again we need to get those amino acids into the bloodstream at a certain level at a certain time what about cardiovascular training V2 Max I make it a point to try and do a long hike or jog once a week for me that 60 to 90 minutes I'm not obsessive about it in the sense that sometimes I'll go out and I make it social with a weight vet or maybe just walk or hike sometimes I'll jog on my own one shorter run of 30 minutes or so in the middle of the week at a faster clip and then one high-intensity interval training session that lasts about 12 minutes and total and thank goodness it's only that cuz I'm basically sucking for air at the end that's it for me plus a bunch of walking if I can I try to walk as much as possible throughout the day I don't I don't even consider that exercise I just consider that movement that's wonderful now you're talking about um non- exercise activity um that is extremely valuable I try to Pace while I take phone calls and things of that sort as much movement as possible what is the value of getting the heart rate elevated for some period of time longer you know longer than a few minutes yeah I mean when you're talking about increasing V2 Max I think that there's a multitude of ways to do it one could do slow steady state activity but I will say as individuals age that becomes more challenging on joints we are thinking about how are we able to m maintain our physicality throughout life if you have got a ton of time and uh you can do slow steady state it's wonderful alternatively there's a lot of evidence that high-intensity interval training um Martin gabala would be a wonderful guest he is really the expert in high-intensity interval training and its changes in um insulin sensitivity influence on V2 Max and this is really going all out in a matter of 20 seconds there's moderate intensity interval training high intensity interval training Sprint interval training that will increase V2 Max in a substantially less amount of time and could be safer for an individual um the other way is improving skeletal muscle mass if you improve strength and hypertrophy you will improve your V2 Max albeit not exactly in the same way but both are beneficial and both will improve V2 Max and blood pressure and triglycerides and clinical outcomes that we care about it's wonderful to think about things um kind of nebulously and then it all comes back to what do we care about as we age we care about having an appropriate blood pressure let's call it 120 over 80 we care about having a triglyceride level of 100 or less lower we care about maintaining fasting insulin levels fasting glucose levels anywhere the the cut off they will say is between 70 to 100 these are clinical outcomes that we care about and that is what we ultimately want however the influence is to pull those levers to get there can be varied It ultimately comes with how are we going to do it and how are is it going to be something that we maintain you know there's a certain aspects about dietary protein that are interesting one of the things that I've seen clinically is that those individuals that are on our higher protein diet will seem to have um higher blood glucose I don't know exactly why this is It's thought that maybe because the red blood cells live longer it maybe also higher blood creatinine levels we do see higher blood creatinine levels when individuals have higher muscle mass that is uh typically a call that I get U many of my patients are uh large and buff as I would say and they almost all have higher levels of creatinin that doesn't mean that your kidney function is suffering uh one thing that one would do clinically would uh get a cattin C to correct and get a corrected GFR to see if it's within the normal range is it true that if you do a hard resistance training session and then get your blood drawn the next day that you might see higher blood creatinine levels um potentially but what I have seen are higher alt and liver enzymes and we see that very frequently in individuals that train intensely and it concerns you or doesn't concern it doesn't concern me right because it's just a consequence of the training and presumably it's transient it is transient typically um and we may see changes in creatinin with uh I have a one patient she runs 100 miles oh goodness she's in her 60s she's an ultra Runner yeah in her 60s and she's strong I mean she's stronger than me it's extraordinary and you think about what are the things that she needs to do to maintain the health of her muscle mass so that she can continue for long periods of time so while we both agree that nutrition is one of the foundations of muscle health and health generally supplements often can have their place we talked a little bit about creatine I and many other people supplement with 5 to 10 gram of creatine monohydrate per day I do that because it has benefits for muscle strength there's some brain benefits that I'm aware of and I realize and now you've reinforced the idea that it's difficult to get enough creatine even if one is ingesting the threshold amount of one gram of protein per ideal body weight what are your thoughts on creatine monohydrate and what other supplements do you recommend for your typical client excuse me patient yeah certainly so creatine monohydrate is wonderful and particularly we're seeing a lot of benefits in women uh postmenopausal women and older populations creatine for sure uh the other supplement is uthan a uthan a is a postbiotic made from the gut microbiome and there's a percentage of people that can make it and the majority of individuals cannot make it interesting urethan a is the this connection which I find fascinating it's a gut muscle connection individuals that take urethan a I happen to be one of them there are many papers out there that improves mitophagy which is the health of mitochondria the turnover of mitochondria helps with the renewal of mitochondria but what's so fascinating is there are trials in human individuals that it increases strength and endurance interesting what um milligram doses do you recommend so I take between 500 and a th000 of uthan a really I I wish that I had actually created this or found this out truly if I could make one supplement I know I would probably make a mix of urethan a with creatine and some whey protein and maybe uh 25 milligrams of collagen and I would have my perfect supplement is it taken with food or without food it doesn't matter interesting morning or night it also doesn't matter what's so interesting about urethan a is that it comes from again it's made in the gut from the gut microbiome from things like pomegranate or walnut it's made from something called an elianin and it is really again what I think of as this gut muscle connection which I do believe is going to be the next Frontier so interesting I recall a few studies that Dr Andy Galpin put on his social media these were in mice um mind you but looking at how disruption of the gut microbiome could offset some of the strength and hypertrophy increases of resistance training pointing to the fact that having a healthy gut microbiome is critical for translating resistance training into actual improvements in muscle Health yes and one of the things that we do see is that as individuals increase their activity talking about more endurance type running there's this very interesting inflection point there's this idea of Optimal Performance and then there is this kind of moment where Optimal Performance depending on the training load starts to take a toll on health and wellness I think that we see that and with that one of the things that we always see is impaired gut lining impaired gut Integrity the Gap Junctions seem to open whether it's the training volume and the physiological stress that can easily be measured with zulin or Cal protectin sto samples do this but doing things that actually help the gut not just the gut microbiome but the gut Integrity is extremely important very interesting what other supplements and maybe we should put whey protein in here as well yes whey protein it's interesting whey protein and whey protein concentrate has alphal albumin and lact aerin and these immunoglobulins that can be very beneficial whey protein it's interesting we talk a lot about how processed foods are negative but the reality is is that processed foods aren't positive or negative the highly palatable processed foods that are full of sugar we can all agree Maybe those are not ideal but whey protein concentrate or whey protein isolate those are both processed however it is a great way to get your essential amino acids which are amino acids that you must get from the diet your body cannot make them there's been a lot of research with whey protein has very little downside and it's easily tolerated those that have challenges with lactose can use the Whey Protein Isolate versus the concentrate and it's very portable if one is traveling and things of that sort and if one has a child please make sure that you use a lid of uh very tight for the powder otherwise you will be wearing it your child will be wearing it is a bit of a disaster but yes noted uh what about other supplements including fish oil omega-3 fatty acids there's a lot of research around that and I think that it's a it's a positive it's not only a positive for brain function but it seems to have a unique anabolic effect maybe it is in you know potentially from on the ribosomes we're not sure at least I'm not sure at this time but there seems to be even more emerging evidence that it may even impact women differently um again I I can't say that in all certainty but nearly all of my patients are on some form of fish oil is there a threshold amount that is a wonderful question um there is not the general recommendation is around four grams but some individuals four to 10 grams which would be definitely on the higher end certainly can uh potentially thin your blood if an individual is going for surgery two weeks prior would uh suggest not taking it but where it becomes very interesting it's really the combination of Omega-3 to Omega 6 and understanding there's ways in which you can test in your blood we run this bloodwork all the time looking at whether it's an Omega Quant or an Omega an Omega index can be very valuable but it is a very easy supplement to take and it seems to be very beneficial for brain health and even muscle health I find it to be most affordable to take it in liquid form just take a tablespoon of the lemon flavored fish oil put it in a protein drink or something then you don't taste the fishiness and then capsules for um convenience when traveling and things of that sort but the liquid forms are so much more affordable in order to hit that two grams a day or you know in this case two to four yeah two to four grams um again this also depends on the absorption for the individual that's why it's really important to do blood work I have some patients that require closer to six grams to be able to improve their Omega 3 to six ratio and it certainly is there's that Precision Nutrition where the amount for one person is not necessarily the amount for another interesting what other supplements do you take I think let me think about what other supplements that I personally take collagen I love collagen mhm collagen in my coffee collagen coffee strong I love strong coffee if you've never had it it's amazing collagen it's called strong coffee it's called strong coffee it has collagen it has eleanine in it really helps with the Jitters there's some good evidence with alanine to help with anxiety but collagen is interesting collagen is a I say protein it's not really it has a protein score of zero it does nothing to affect skeletal muscle mass it is devoid in tryptophan and it is very low in the branch chain amino acids but it is high in glycine Proline and hydroxyproline which makes it very unique in structure it is also very difficult to test the effect on tendons uh collagen protein on tendons because as you can imagine one would not want a tendon biopsy right sounds painful sounds painful also biopsies are painful um yes I you know I used to do a lot of those when I was in my fellowship it was it was probably less painful for me than it was for the subjects imagine yeah it's like taking a small Quirk of tissue out of the muscle um so collagen protein I think can be very beneficial for skin hair and nails I feel as if we just haven't gotten sensitive enough to determine its effect on tissue yet I anticipate that higher doses above 15 grams maybe of some benefit I'm just speculating but I'm guessing that it's probably closer to 25 grams and I know that that seems a bit robust so in one scoop might have 15 grams but I think there's no negative to increasing collagen and quite frankly we don't get a lot of collagen in our diet the places in which you would find collagen or the gristle and meats or broth yeah yeah that's another great way to increase it so you take it once a day I do particular time of day in the coffee in in the morning so my coffee has collagen in it before I train yes I do and I typically train fasted aside from that and then I'll add in an additional scoop you mentioned fasted Maybe we should touch on fasting for a moment um I inadvertently have been doing intermittent fasting for years meaning I was never hungry for breakfast so my first meal lands at 11:00 a.m or so plus or minus an hour on most days there are exceptions to that last meal typically I don't know 8:00 p.m 700 p.m sometimes 9:00 p.m i'm not super strict about that and it basically boils down to anywhere from 2 to four quote unquote meals per day um a lunch a dinner and then some eating in between could you first comment on that architecture of eating um but maybe first on fasting specifically I mean what are the benefits or detriments to um having a feeding window of about 8 or nine hours um regardless of where it lands in the day and then let's talk about how that might slide around or if people should ensure getting um more food coverage throughout the day two benefit that I find from fasting number one calorie restriction number two bowel rest many individuals have gastrointestinal challenges when they are in a Tim restricted window they are not feeding all day long great point and those are the two benefits that I often see an individual who is older or struggling to put on muscle fasting would not be my primary go-to I think that as individuals age there's a a bit of a a negative because you have to balance this muscle protein synthesis they're always going through a synthesis and a catabolism so an an anabolic process and a catabolic process as you age it becomes more difficult to regulate that process and if you add in additional fasting go through long periods of time where let's say you're not training you're not protecting skeletal tissue that would be a place where I don't necessarily recommend fasting some people might find it difficult to hit the 30 to 50 g gram of protein per meal frequency across the day in order to reach that one gram of protein per pound of ideal body weight if they were going to add a meal or let's just say add 30 to 50 grams of protein how much time separation do they need from the other meals so for instance if I were to take a step back and say okay you know I I need an additional 30 to 50 gram protein intake per day in order to maintain the muscle I have as I age and I am aging as uh we all are I suppose is 2 hours before my 11:00 a.m meal enough does it have to be 3 hours could it be 1 hour I mean you can only assimilate and then oxidize a certain amount of protein I mean how much time window does one need between these protein feedings I appreciate that question and here's my answer to that the first meal of the day is the meal that has been studied the remainder meals to my knowledge there is no study that shows anything about the second or the third meal and perhaps that's because of the difficulty but the literature suggests that that first meal of the day whenever you're going to have it let's say for you it's 11: eating 30 to 50 grams of protein the muscle protein synthetic response will last 2 hours however when we talked about mtor there's other initiation factors like eif4 that will maintain itself for another four to 5 hours I see therefore the second meal is really not necess necessarily a muscle protein synthetic response I can't say that that's supported in the literature but where the benefit of that is is that we know that more than one meal of that robust amount of protein will likely have better outcomes on this 24-hour um protein response 24-hour nitrogen balance but that second meal would be just about getting your protein in it doesn't matter if it's you know if you have to hit your need of say 200 gram of protein then that middle meal the real goal for that metabolically is to get enough protein to meet that 1 gram per pound ideal body weight I see and then that final meal before you go into a fast would be what we would say would support overnight protein synthesis I mean not necessarily support overnight protein synthesis but in the fasted State your body pulls from muscle it has to maintain the energy balance for all other systems in the body um all other tissues again 25% of protein turnover goes to skeletal muscle and the rest goes to other organ systems for you or for hypertrophy adding an additional meal would again let's say four meals I think would be uh if I were to design a diet in the perfect world to support hypertrophy I would add another a fourth meal well I love to eat so that's not a problem uh in principle this is probably getting a bit more toward the afficianados but I've heard that certain forms of animal protein and other proteins are more beneficial at certain times of day for instance meat and eggs early in the day maybe chicken and fish in the middle of the day and that casine and milk proteins might be more advantageous for muscle Health in the final meal of the day or closer to bedtime I realize this is getting into the details but I'm sure a percentage of our listeners would be curious to do that and of course um milk proteins always make me sleep so uh kind of fits you know it's really interesting I I will say that milk protein casine seems to be slower absorbing and that's because of the impact with the the gut obviously but is there anything special about casine or milk protein the answer to that would actually be no but the the length of time that it takes for digestion absorption maybe where the benefit comes in that being said there's some data to support High saturated fat Dairy believe it or not actually can be good for Health and Longevity I know there's uh people will say high saturated fat or or high fat Dairy would be negative but I would say that there is evidence to support it being Health promoting well nothing like a piece of terrific cheese like a Parmesan or a um or a shot of uh full fat cream and I will mention the which I love every once in a while that's a guilty pleasure a shot of full fat cream with equal part espresso I'll take it I'll take it I will mention that the Lucine content in milk protein is a little bit lower okay or um say Greek yogurt are there any sort of um cryptic Champion proteins you know I I think most of us think okay steak and ground beef and maybe Venison and elk and eggs and all the obvious things chicken fish Etc but are there any kind of um cryptic proteins out there that are particularly good for us in terms of their amino acid content that people don't think of you hear these days about Li I frankly don't like the taste I don't like liver but um liver has a lot of other benefits to it so it's high in fat soluble vitamins and iron very bioavailable but I'm not it's very difficult to eat yeah I think people either love it or hate it um I'm on the second category so no no proteins come to mind is you know is salmon you know quality protein salmon is a quality protein is higher in fat again calorie balance does matter fish is interesting fish has 5 gram of protein per 1 ounce versus me meat has on average seven gram seven or eight red meat has seven or eight grams of protein per 1 ounce so interesting you know that this idea that you know eating muscle can support the health of muscle it makes sense though doesn't it it makes perfect sense and and You' explained very clearly as to why that why that is um okay we set aside liver um for this conversation some people are into cricket and maybe there is sorry I apologize to the well not to the Crickets The Crickets probably thank me for for my response but I'm not judging it's just my my personal visceral response um my other people may like insect proteins but what about other organ Meats heart um I know I mean around the world you see the consumption of of lots of different organ Meats is there any evidence that that heart um is a good protein or are we I'm generally looking at skeletal muscle as the the best source of of amino acids uh Heart is also a good source of protein it's also high in CoQ10 which is is good for muscle Health but many people again we don't seem to eat that however other places eat the full animal but they are all they are all good sources of protein aside from collagen which would be that protein score of zero and if somebody insists on being vegan or vegetarian um let's just say Vegan what are their best options there are rice pea blends of protein which are absolutely suitable there are a lot of now fermented types of protein powders out there that seem to have the same profile as we the one thing that I would say as individual's age a a vegan diet can be very challenging need to make sure that you are getting enough B12 zinc iron things uh nutrients of concern that seem to be going down in general and we're seeing decreases of that um in the general population what are your thoughts on magnesium we sometimes hear that excellent people are magnesium deficient based on depletion of the soil o you hear this stuff but um what's the story with magnesium that is true there seems to be um less magnesium in the diet very easy to supplement whether the the form that you use whether you use a magnesium glycinate or there's a whole host of magnesium citrate for gastrointestinal Health whatever it is but yes magnesium supplementation can be very beneficial uh for muscle for brain do you support the idea of supplementing with zinc or is that something that is kind of you know sometimes yes sometimes no I think if you're eating a Whole Foods diet you're going to be unlikely to be deficient in zinc zinc is interesting because you don't want to supplement zinc without copper there is a zinc copper ratio that is well-maintained in the body supplementation with one or the other will typically deplete the other and you know as a geriatrician there's a a zinc copper ratio things that we think of as kind of proxies for overall brain health not saying that the zinc copper ratio is the only thing but certainly supplementing with one or the other one would be careful what are some things that people might be doing or taking that inadvertently disrupt muscle health and perhaps even hypertrophy one thing that people often use is ibuprofen and ibuprofen while not inherently bad there's some evidence to suggest that higher doses of ibuprofen can impact muscle Health whether it's hypertrophy or strength I often think about those together but uh ibuprofen use it's also not good for the gastric lining again you have to be able to absorb your nutrients to be able to become strong and healthy the other thing is obviously Statin use some people do need statins I'm not saying that we shouldn't but that can certainly affect muscle Health the side effect can be uh muscle pain myalgia muscle soreness it can deplete CoQ10 um is occasional use of these things okay yeah of course and you know obviously check with your doctor but things that suppress inflammation like aspirin potentially or other nids can well aspirin is in a category of its own but nids in particular seem to suppress skeletal muscle at certain doses hypertrophy potentially and strength the other thing is um fluo quinolones they are antibiotics that can affect collagen and tendon turnover if an individual is on a Flor quinolone there's a risk for you hear a lot about these Achilles injuries yeah which sorts of antibiotics I think um is it like cypro and things like that people can injure themselves badly you should be uh certainly careful about the activity that you're doing at the time the other thing is the proton pump inhibitors people use that for stomach acid or reflux that can affect uh absorption of vitamins and minerals that do have long-lasting effects what are your thought thoughts on the glp1 analoges OIC monjaro real quick anecdote I was in New York City I was walking up the U side on a Sunday recently and there was a sign outside a store I saw that that said we carry OIC and monjaro and I thought the sign would say like we have you know Ginger Lattes or something and so and I thought wellow that's guy I snapped a photo of it I didn't think much of it at the time and then I decided to post it to my Instagram thinking that there' be a few opinions and frankly I was just curious what people would think so I said what do you think and it was one of the largest responses in terms of comment volume and contentiousness that I had ever observed and I thought whoa there's really something here my understanding is that these compounds um which are becoming incredibly popular can help people lose weight but that there's some loss of muscle maybe even some bone mass correct me if I'm wrong on that but I would also ma imagine excuse me that some of the muscle loss can be offset by resistance training maybe even protein intake and resistance training so what is your thought about these compounds last thing I'll just give a little bit of my stance I know a number of people that had extreme struggles losing weight I don't know the extent to which um they were doing things correctly or incorrectly with nutrition it's not my place to probe into that but that they got on these compounds one or the other and seem to love them because it got them kind of out the gate you know 20 30 lb weight loss very quickly without um intense Cravings their appetite is suppressed and many of them are now also exercising and doing other things so I don't think we want to look at this or talk about this as an either or OIC monjaro or exercise and and proper nutrition I would imagine there's a place for both but I'd love your take on these I would love to share it uh these medications are they're it's complex the issue of obesity the challenge with glp WS and dual Agnes like mongero glp1 and gips it is a complex conversation so the opinion that I'm going to give is going to be uh while I give my opinion I recognize that this is certainly like you said very heated there's a couple of ways to look at it first of all nothing has worked more effectively other than bariatric surgery than these medications to affect obesity so gp1 Agonist L OIC will an individual might get a 13% weight loss and how long it a couple month that's good question yeah it's a it's a a titration it's a monthly titration but over a period of 24 weeks um wow it it certainly depends significant um yeah it certainly depends on the individual but it's utilized and increased month by month a four weeks SP B the other aspect is the Dual agones like maero tritide and that will potentially cause a 22% weight loss the challenge with obesity is real now I have taken care of patients that have deeply suffered with this whether it is a component of food addiction or whether it is a component of whatever the reason we have used these in clinic and it has trans formed their lives I would never take that away from somebody certainly it is personal choice now the other aspects of these the comment about skeletal muscle loss I have seen that and again we use these medications in our practice and with a proper nutrition plan and proper resistance training I do not see a loss of skeletal muscle mass you have to work with a provider that can help titrate it but I think that these drugs can be used in a very safe Manner and you know we see improvements in alcohol consumption that's in in other addictions very interesting there are a whole host of benefits from these medications now I think where people get upset is they say well is this a shortcut can you go off of them do you have to regain that weight and again we have many patients that go off of them and have implemented great strategies for training and nutrition and we we don't see weight gain interesting it all depends on a comprehensive holistic View and that becomes important to recognize there are many benefits and people will say the negatives would be slowing down uh gastric emptying well I would say yes and that's exactly what the medication is designed to do there maybe some risk with pancreatitis there is some discussion about thyroid um cancer in rodent models have a different thyroid and volume of thyroid receptors in humans I think that potentially that is incidental I'm sure that we'll be hearing more and more about it these medications also are not new they have been used for over a decade and those are all important points to recognize that now it is very popular but these medications have been around for quite some time it is interesting that some of the peptides like lp1 analoges that have existed in somewhat Niche communities for a while um so including things like in the melanite stimulating hormone community that are now sold under FDA approval um for things like low libido um things like VII um and Addie we were mentioning Addie for for women for hyposexual desire disorder right the I don't know the history of Addie but um certainly the um Alpha mocy stimulating hormone related peptides the gp1 peptides things like celin which are in the growth hormone secretagogues all were viewed for a long time as kind of Niche Community Fitness Community but now at least the glp1 analoges have made their way into I mean massive scale use which speaks to kind of a general theme of what I've observed over the last well I'm 48 now but let's just say 35 years which is that many of the things that exist in Niche communities become um mainstream it just takes some time and they become mainstream through the standard channels of FDA approval um which as is the case with OIC and W so it's great to hear that you Embrace sort of both sides like a lot of what you've talked about today I think one wouldn't necessarily find in the kind of standard tables or what's on a a a poster in the doctor's office but some of it is and you really um are at the intersection of both those um those Landscapes thank you and and this idea of OIC and um tripti these gp1s that you know we talked a lot about protein and one way that it has a satiating effect is this gp1 um stimulation and one has to recognize that these glp Agonist these G Agonist last for a week the dietary protein effect is meal to meal so eating protein increases gp1 as does in drinking yerbamate te but probably to a lesser degree and more transiently more transiently and I I think that that is just an important an interesting fact and the other fact is that the amount necessary to stimulate muscle protein synthesis the amount for muscle health is also seen in the amount of gp1 released interesting it seems as if that that 30 to 40 or so gram amount of high quality protein is the same amount that has a meaningful impact on the release of gp1 very interesting I did not know that so so if we were to just back away from everything we've talked about what are the top level benefits of having healthy muscle everything okay muscle muscle is the organ of longevity and when we think about lifespan we think about health span and then we finally think about muscle span I would argue that that is right after lifespan the benefits of healthy muscle cannot be denied this is better metabolic Health better blood pressure better survivability better strength better Mobility better body armor should someone fall should someone get sick your survivability will be related to the health of skeletal muscle and especially as we think about aging if we want to have good skin or we think about wanting to have a a good-look body even though I can appreciate it's only a small amount aesthetic but leveraging the aesthetic to have healthy brain function there's this idea that Alzheimers or certain types of dementia are type three diabetes of the brain skeletal muscle is the only organ system we have voluntary control over it is the only endocrine organ system we have voluntary control over it which means we have a responsibility to leverage it we've talked about these in a lot of detail today meaning you've Ed ated us about these in detail today and thank you but perhaps you could summarize what you view as the top nutrition-based tools for improving muscle Health number one dietary protein and that would be in terms of a protein hierarchy roughly one gram per pound ideal body weight an individual could certainly go to7 grams per pound ideal body weight the higher the protein the less it matters the quality whether it is a high quality protein or a lower quality protein the total protein amount matters that is at the base of the pyramid the next would be the I would say the quality understanding the quality of the protein so that you know exactly how much and then certainly the distribution of how you are ingesting this protein the dietary protein habits of someone who is eating a more protein forward diet distribution will matter less the higher it is but there is certainly some great importance depending on if you are older who you know challenging for any kind of Health and Wellness challenges this is what I would say and I realize it will vary depending on activity but assuming that somebody gets the one gram of quality protein per pound of ideal body weight how should they make up the rest of their caloric needs the next I would say would be your choice you choose carbohydrates are that there's evidence that carbohydrates are helpful from a fiber perspective phytonutrients other vitamins and minerals I certainly would go there that would be my preference the amount of activity that you do certainly could use carbohydrates and then fat it is very easy to get essential fatty acids your diet doesn't have to be too high in fat to get that but at the end of the day prioritize dietary protein the next level would be understanding your carbohydrate threshold could start at 130 gr titrate up or down depending on your metabolic health and or activity understanding that outside of activity 50 gam or less of carbohydrates would be a threshold to mitigate substantial insulin response finally that fat you can choose however you would like to get that fat typically comes within a meal and that would be the remainders of your caloric intake and what are your Topline tools with respect to exercise as it it relates to muscle Health resistance training is non-negotiable it doesn't matter if you need to start with body weight absolutely okay move to bands definitely moving load is valuable and non-negotiable start with two days a week you will likely progress to three days a week if you're doing three days a week again it all depends on the volume and intensity in which you are working under depending on whether it's five to 10 sets how many um reps you're doing I think that there's many weight in which one could do it right the only way in which someone could do it wrong is to not do it quite frankly that would be what I would say for that and then adding in high-intensity interval training I would choose high-intensity interval training over slow steady state cardio because the high-intensity intervals seem to have a a very impactful effect with the low amount of time that it takes let's talk about something that might seem somewhat distant from everything else we've talked about but I actually believe is Central to all of this which is mindset the psychology around health and self-directed health which of course includes communication and cooperation from licens trained Physicians like yourself you know what's your mindset and recommended mindset around muscle health and just General Health in terms of health span and lifespan what you're talking about here is muscle span and the way in which the cognitive processes and the way that we think about our life how does that influence what we actually do and I could give someone the perfect plan and it doesn't matter if I give an individual a perfect plan if they're not willing to execute on it I've been a physician for 20 years believe it or not that is a long period of time and I would say a good physician is a physician that identifies patterns of diseases patterns of illness but an effective physician is someone who identifies patterns of people because once you identify the pattern of the person you're able to leverage that so that they can get the best out of themselves and there's a few core fundamental principles that people have to recognize if they want to be well and that is you set standards and you don't set goals people will set a weight loss goal or a muscle hypertrophy goal but if you set a standard for how you operate and how you execute you know that regardless of how you feel you're going to get up and train you know that this is going to be your nutrition plan you get up and you do it you set a standard and that standard provides a framework for execution I love that um I sometimes think of the non-negotiables of the week um that unless I'm suffering from a really bad cold or flu which fortunately for me is pretty rare um that I'm going to get those three resistance training sessions in I'm going to try and get as much quality sleep as I can and I'll get those card vascular training sessions and when you talk about setting standards is that what you're referring to um are you talking about blood work standards are you talking about um aggressively trying to maintain um blood values in a particular range are you mainly talking about behaviors I'm talking about both uh yes should there be a standard for your blood work that you're getting yes we have a very strict standard that we have in place for all our patients however the framework for which they execute is all about the standards that they place for themselves the you know because ultimately what we want Here Andrew is we want people to get results and the only way they're going to get results is if they stop chasing these goals and that might be counterintuitive to people because people will say well I'm going to set a weight loss goal goals come and go standards remain and if you fail to do the Practical in your life the Practical becom impossible and that's why we said standards the other aspect is an individual has to understand where they fail I take care of a lot of very successful entrepreneurs and just individuals they all know where they fail they all know their points of weakness over time it's not understanding where you Excel because quite frankly that's the easy part the part that becomes very valuable is you know where you fail you know where your points of vulnerability are you know where you fall off track I'll give you an example typically when someone is about to do something amazing they have this but you would you know this better than anyone this dopamine high at that Pinnacle seems to be a place of vulnerability whether they will skip a training session or buy another car or do whatever it is that they do eat more cake they have an experience in their environment where they're almost at they're at the Pinnacle of what they are doing that is a place of vulnerability where people will fall off health track on the same token at the moment after the big successful moment um I have a a patient who puts on a massive event in Vegas and every year I wait for the call that he's feeling depressed because his dopamine didn't go back to baseline or fall to Baseline it went below Baseline what becomes important to recognize is that this is another point of vulnerability at this point of of vulnerability is where people seem to go off track and never regain their footing if they do not recognize that and so I I can appreciate that we're talking about mindset here because there's a level of neutrality that is necessary for overall success again this is what I've seen time and time again that those that are the healthiest are able to maintain this level of neutrality tell me more about level of neutrality I'm right there with you on setting standards instead of goals and I'll say I've never thought about it in this way but I absolutely love that um and for the record you said it and I'm going to blast it out credit to you as much as possible because I think it's so critical for persistent um engagement in the kinds of behaviors and mindsets that lead to success over time so love this standards over goals uh principle um knowing where one fails points of vulnerability um beautiful concept painful to hear because of the uh realistic nature of it and that's exactly why it's pot so thank you for that as predict and predictable human beings are predictable in their behaviors and it's for example on Friday night when everyone tells themselves they're not going to have that drink and that pizza and that cookie and then Friday Night comes around and they are surprised by their own humanness and again what we're looking for are long-term strategies for overall health because that wave of Youth does close and while we can all continue to get better as that window compresses it becomes much more important to be very diligent on the responsibilities to our health our nervous system so that we can continue on for Success it's just the way that it is tell me about the neutrality component this is fascinating and I have a very good friend his name is Ben Newman and he really highlighted this for me and he works with a lot of these sports teams and he was the first patient that helped me put together this idea of neutrality I'll give you an example he was flying to work with one NFL team I think that they were going to the Super Bowl something major and I said to him you know how are you doing you just came off of your book launch and just before this you were at another NFL team and he say to me he goes Gabrielle it's just another Tuesday it's just another Tuesday and so this idea of neutrality is that when you can manage and mitigate your emotional es and for when things are at their High the excitement this isn't to celebrate or not to celebrate but when you begin to mitigate these es and flows it's almost as if there's this level of neutrality when that happens these big moments because life is full of big moments yes it's full of small moments but it certainly is full of these big moments and it's these big moments that once we enter into if one is not neutral then being able to pick themselves up from an experience or a moment become much more challenging my most successful patients I'm not talking about financially I talking about the ones that are able to maintain and contain their health are the ones that are neutral in terms of tone and affect um no in terms of experience as they go through life they celebrate some wins they don't celebrate others very consistent with some of the um theories that I and a few others in the science Community have expounded around dopamine regulation it makes a lot of sense and where where I care about this is as a physician who takes care of people and when they cannot manage this emotional highs and lows because as you think about it if you walk around and you feel that everything is stressful I mean you've got your cortisol going then you're not sleeping and it becomes this cycle and then that cycle becomes a habit and if one can teach themselves to Be steady for example going into a big workout maybe they mitigate the anticipation of that workout they're much more likely to continue on that way and it's what is so important about it is a trainable skill it's sounds like it's a lot about energy conservation yes mental energy not just caloric energy yes very interesting and so then you can do the things that matter and then you don't fall off the bandwagon because it just seems that each time a person does it they become better at doing that it is hard to hear I think probably for many people but it's very predictable and if you can leverage that predictable nature for example that Friday night that comes along and you've told yourself that this is going to be your last beer or your last pizza then you know how to engage in it you come up with a game plan where you've set a standard where this is the thing that you do Friday night you set the rule and the foundation for your actions while hearing about your stance on mindset standards goals knowing where one fails points of vulnerability and neutrality I have one more oh please this one is a big one and this is a person will only ever be as healthy as they feel worthy of tell me more that when individuals do not feel worthy of having health and wellness they will sabotage themselves over and over and over again and it is something really important when you sit down with a patient or you reflect on yourself the question becomes do you feel worthy of being healthy do you truly feel worthy of having the body that you desire of having that overall sense of Vitality because if someone doesn't they will use that as a distraction they will sabotage themselves and they will focus on the not feeling well the feeling tired all of the other physical as aspects that go along with ill health and that will allow them a distraction I want read something about a person who was obese who then got in shape um and they were reporting that in their family growing up they had a narrative around exercise that for them translated to exercise being a form of extreme selfishness and that surprised me I thought you know you know what better thing to uh do in terms of helping one's health and helping therefore the relationships in your life by you know segmenting out a small not you know a huge portion of one's day but you know an hour a day to take great care of oneself and ensure health so that you don't have to be you know dependent on others in a way that would be burdensome to them perhaps earlier in life than it would be in any other case so this seems to fit very well with what you're saying this person obviously felt that exercise was selfish and they weren't worthy somehow of being healthy and in shape that fortunately they flipped the script on this and and I should say that was over goodness that was 2016 so it's been a long while and they have maintained um good health and staying in shape they they set a standard for themselves isn't that amazing it's awesome it's awesome to see it's also been awesome to see their transformation in their psychology and the different aspects of their life but um is that something that you see a lot that people just feel like um get in shape or paying attention to what they eat is is somehow selfish I think that some people do not feel worthy of feeling good and they will sabotage themselves until they uncover that number one that is the message that they're sending themselves and once they do that there is a bit of friction and we know in order to be successful in any game plan that friction is required and on the other side of friction is quite frankly freedom but those individuals have to understand that they are worthy and really do that work but yes time and time again it is one of the first questions that I asked do you feel worthy of feeling good well Dr Gabrielle lion you have given us an incredible tour of muscle and in fact an entirely New Perspective even for me on how muscle impacts our health as we talked about at the beginning so often when people hear about the importance of muscle they think just building muscle and that tends to separate people into those who want to build muscle in those who don't or think that they can't or don't really understand what it's about but you've made Oho clear the fact that muscle is a critical perhaps the most critical aspect of maintaining Health and Longevity of the body of the brain of Health span lifespan what you call muscle span really seems to Wick out into everything in terms of our well-being and you've given us a ton of actionable tools at the level of nutrition at the level of exercise at the level of supplementation and thankfully also at the level of mindset I think the tools that you shared along the lines of mindset are absolutely spectacular as are all these other recommendations so I want to say on behalf of myself and everyone listening and or watching thank you for sharing all of this information with us in such clear and and actionable detail thank you also for the work you do for being such a Pioneer in both maintaining an active clinical life seeing patience men women people of different ages different backgrounds Etc I know you also do some work I'll just mention this um because it is important you don't just work with people who um can afford the work you also do a lot of work with people in the military Community who perhaps who cannot afford the work so you make it um a point to support communities that um perhaps couldn't afford the kind of support that they absolutely deserve so thank you for that thank you also for being a public educator and such an avid one and really out there on Instagram on YouTube with your own podcast with your book we'll provide links to all of those in the show note captions of course and I just love love love what you're doing and I know as great as it's been that there's still much more to come so thank you for taking the time to come here today especially with the busy Clinic the businesses and of course your family people might not realize this but Dr Gabrielle line does all this while maintaining a family with uh two children a happy healthy marriage and a husband in residency a husband in residency and she's Stills that's right shout out to Baylor um and still pursuing Advanced Training in yet additional fields of medicine so um you are a Phenom and I have both tremendous admiration and respect and gratitude for you so thank you so much thank you so much thank you for joining me for today's discussion with Dr Gabrielle lion to learn more about her work and to find links to her book Forever Strong as well as a link to her excellent

Title: Dr. Zachary Knight: The Science of Hunger & Medications to Combat Obesity
Published: 2024-06-17 12:00:09 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. Zachary Knight, Ph.D., a professor of physiology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator. We discuss how the brain controls our sense of hunger, satiety, and thirst. He explains how dopamine levels impact our cravings and eating behavior (amount, food choices, etc) and how we develop and can change our food preferences and adjust how much we need to eat to feel satisfied. 
 
We discuss factors that have led to the recent rise in obesity, such as interactions between our genes and the environment and the role of processed foods and food combinations. We also discuss the new class of medications developed for the treatment of obesity and diabetes, including the GLP-1 agonists semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro). We discuss how these medications work to promote weight loss, the source of their side effects, and the newer compounds soon to overcome some of those side effects, such as muscle loss. 
 
Dr. Knight provides an exceptionally clear explanation for our sense of hunger, thirst, and food cravings that translates to practical knowledge to help listeners better understand their relationship to food, food choices, and meal size to improve their diet and overall health.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Zachary Knight Dr Zachary Knight is a professor of physiology at the University of California San Francisco and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute for those of you that don't know Howard Hughes medical investigators are selected from an extremely competitive pool of applicants and have to renew in order to maintain their investigatorship with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute every 5 years or so placing him in the most elite of categories with respect to research scientists his laboratory focuses on homeostasis in particular what drives our sense of hunger what drives our sense of thirst and what controls therm regulation which is the ability to maintain body temperature within a specific safe range today we mainly focus on Hunger Dr Zachary Knight explains the biological mechanisms for craving food for consuming food and believe it or not you have brain circuits that actually determine how much you're likely to eat even before you take your very first bite and he explains the biological mechanisms for satiety that is the sense that one has had enough of a particular food or food group Dr Knight also explains the role of dopamine in food craving and consumption which I think every everybody will find very surprising because it runs countercurrent to most people's understanding of what dopamine does in the context of eating and other Cravings today's discussion also includes a deep dive into glp1 glucagonlike peptide and the novel class of drugs such as OIC and monjaro and other related compounds that are now widespread in use for the reduction in body weight Dr Knight explains how glp1 was first discovered and how these drugs were developed how they work and importantly why they work and how that is leading to the next generation of so-called diet drugs or drugs to treat obesity diabetes and related syndromes we also discussed thirst and the intimate relationship between water consumption and food consumption and we also talk about the relationship between sodium intake water intake and food intake by the end of today's conversation you will have learned a tremendous amount about the modern understanding of hunger thirst and salt intake as well as this modern class of drugs such as OIC and related compounds all from a truly world-class investigator in the subjects of researching hunger thirst and thermal regulation before you begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is better help better help offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years initially I didn't have a choice it was a condition of being allowed to stay in high school but quickly I realized that therapy is an extremely important component to our overall health in fact I consider doing regular therapy as important as getting regular cardiovascular exercise and resistance training which of course I also do every week now there are essentially three things that great therapy provides first of all it requires that you have a really good rapport with the therapist somebody that you can trust and talk to about what's really going on in your life and of course an excellent therapist will provide you support in moving towards the things that are going to grow your life in the best ways and third and this is the one that people often Overlook an expert therapist is somebody who can really provide you useful insights that would not otherwise be obvious to you with better help they make it very easy to find the therapist with whom you can have those three essential and highly effective components if you'd like to try better help you can go to betterhelp.com huberman to get 10% off your first month again that's betterhelp.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity now I've spoken many times before in this podcast about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts of quality sleep each night one of the best ways to ensure a great night sleep is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3° and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3° eight sleep makes it incredibly easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment by allowing you to program the temperature of your mattress cover at the beginning middle and end of the night I've been sleeping on an eight- Sleep mattress cover for well over 3 years now and it has completely transformed my sleep for the better eight sleep recently launched their newest generation pod cover the Pod 4 Ultra the Pod 4 ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity higher Fidelity sleep tracking technology and it also has snoring detection that remarkably will automatically lift your head a few degrees to improve your air flow and stop your snoring if you'd like to try an eight Sleep mattress cover you can go to 8sleep.com huberman to save $350 off their pod 4 ultra eight sleep currently ships to the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com Huber today's episode is also brought To Us by waking up waking up is a meditation app that offers hundreds of guided meditation programs mindfulness trainings yoga NRA sessions and more I started practicing meditation when I was about 15 years old and it made a profound impact on my life and by now there are thousands of quality peer reviewed studies that emphasize how useful mindfulness meditation can be for improving our Focus managing stress and anxiety improving our mood and much more in recent years I started using the we waking up app for my meditations because I find it to be a terrific resource for allowing me to really be consistent with my meditation practice many people start a meditation practice and experience some benefits but many people also have challenges keeping up with that practice what I and so many other people love about the waking up app is that it has a lot of different meditations to choose from and those meditations are of different durations so it makes it very easy to keep up with your meditation practice both from the perspective of novelty you never get tired of those meditations there's always something new to EXP explore and to learn about yourself and about the effectiveness of meditation and you can always fit meditation into your schedule even if you only have two or 3 minutes per day in which to meditate I also really like doing Yoga Nidra or what is sometimes called non-sleep deep rest for about 10 or 20 minutes because it is a great way to restore mental and physical Vigor without the tiredness that some people experience when they wake up from a conventional nap if you'd like to try the waking up app please go to waking up.com huberman where you can access a free 30-day trial again that's waking up.com huberman to access a free 30-day trial and now for my discussion with Dr Zachary Knight Dr Zachary Knight welcome great to be here today we're going to talk about Hunger appetite thirst other motivated behaviors the role of dopamine the vagus nerve these are terms and topics that a lot of people hear nowadays and for which there's a ton of interest but just to March Us in sequentially could you describe some of what's happening in the brain and our body as we get hungry decide what to eat and and decide that we've had enough to eat you I think most people just assume that okay that my stomach's full is what we say I've had enough um or we self-regulate it for some other reason you know caloric restriction or or monitoring in some cases what's happening in the brain in terms of the circuitry um and what have you discovered about what that process looks like in terms of its um kind of universality across people and then maybe how it sometimes differs between people okay there's a lot in that that I'll try to unpack and I can remind of some of the Nuance but just in other words as a biologist as a neuroscientist how do you think about this thing that we call hunger and Fe absolutely absolutely so I think a very high level a good way to think about the regulation of food intake by the brain is that there's two systems uh short-term system and a long-term system that are primarily localized to different parts of the brain operate on different time scales one on the time scale of a meal so 10 20 minutes uh and the other on the time scale of sort of weeks to months to years and tracks levels of body fat and these two systems sort of interact so that so that these short-term behaviors we do eating are matched to our long-term need for energy and so um uh uh I think one of the uh uh one of the initial experiments that really led to this idea is this great experiment by Harvey Grill um about 50 years ago uh it's called the desate rat and so essentially what he did was he made a a cut in the rat brain so he took these rats in the lab made a cut so that he separated the brain stem so the most posterior part of the brain from the entire forbrain basically got rid of you know 80% of the rat's brain so this basically creating these zombie rats right all they have is a brain stem and asked you know what can these rats still do you might imagine they can't do a lot of things right because they basically have lost most of their brain um but he discovered that one thing they can still do is regulate the size of a meal and so um so very informative experiment and so um and and you have to be careful how we talk about this because the way this meal works is you have to actually put food into their mouth and then they'll swallow it as you put food into their mouth um but eventually at some point they'll start spitting it out and that basically is an indication that in some sense they're becoming saded uh and and they're uh they're just using the brain stem that they have left they're able to sense those signals from the gut and uh Drive the termination of a meal and he did other experiments showing that many of these signals that come from the gut gastric stretch hormones that come from your intestine in response to food intake like cck these desate rats that just have a brain stem um if you inject those or manipulate the gut in in those ways it can in an appropriate way change how much the rat eats now what can't the rat do when it doesn't have a forebrain and the thing it can't do is it can't respond to longer term changes in energy need meaning if you fast the rat for a couple days this desate rat then start putting food in its mouth the amount that it eats doesn't change so basically it doesn't eat a larger meal the way you would if you were fasted for several days and then re refed and that experiment along with other Evans has led to the idea that in the brain stem and in the most posterior part of your brain there are neural circuits that control sort of a meal and then the time scale of 10 minutes or 20 minutes deciding when a meal should end and in the forbrain primarily in the hypothalamus there are neural circuits that then track what is my overall level of energy reserves what is my level of body fat things that would fluctuate on time scale of say days when you're fasting and those forbrain centers feedback to talk to the brain stem and modulate those brain stem circuit that are controlling the size of a meal to sort of match these two time scales so that's at the highest level how I think about the neural circuitry that controls feeding um there's obviously a lot more going on underneath that but f ating you mentioned body fat and that somehow the brain is tracking the amount of body fat um that caught my ear uh because while it makes total sense I'd like to know how that happens if we happen to know the mechanism and the second question is why body fat and not body fat and muscular mass or body fat and overall body weight what is being signaled between body fat and the Brain that allows the brain to track body fat and why do you think body fat is the critical signal I realize it represents an energy Reserve but certainly there are other things about the bodily state that are important yeah well there are certainly other things about the bodily state that are important and there are other things about physiology definitely that are regulated other than body fat um but body fat is is unique because it represents this energy Reserve so the neural circuitry that regulates eating behavior is in some ways very unique because it has this reserve of energy so if you we also study thirst in my lab and drinking and you don't have a reserve of water in your body right um and that's true for basically everything else but for fat we have this this this reserve of energy and so it's very important that uh the brain know uh how much remains and then adjust Behavior Uh uh uh in coordinance with that so that so that you know you know how urgent it is to get the next meal um and so the thought is that the major signal of the level of body fat that we have is leptin it's this hormone uh it was discovered it was cloned in 1994 actually by my post-doctoral adviser a scientist named Jeff Friedman at Rockefeller University although its history goes back way before 1994 so the story behind leptin is that um there's a a facility called Jackson Labs that you I'm sure familiar with in Maine that um since the 1920s has been raising mice and selling them to academics basically who study physiology and behavior and so they breed thousands of mice they sort of nonprofit organization distributes mice to the scientific community and at some point in the 1950s um they spontaneously just because they were breeding so many mice they came across some spontaneous mutations um mutant mice that were extremely fat like the fattest mice they had ever seen these mice just eat constantly they're just enormous three times the size of of a normal Mouse and um it's all body fats they're just justu these huge uh uh uh uh fat mice and they came across several different um mut Mutant strains that um all had the phenotype in the sense that they were all extremely fat all extremely hyperphagic but they could tell even in the 1950s that these mutations were on different chromosomes they didn't know anything about how to identify the genes at that point that was just science fiction but they knew they were chromosomes and they were on different chromosomes and so they labeled one obese one of these mous trains obese and the other one diabetes but they're basically the same and so people wonder for a long time what what what's going on in these mice then there was a scientist at Jackson Labs Doug Coleman who had the idea what if we do an experiment where we connect the circulations of these two different strains of obese mice and test the hypothesis that maybe there's a circulating factor a hormone that is produced by one of these strains and that controls appetite because at that point insulin was known glucagon was known there were some hormones that were known that were involved in metabolism so it was logical that there could be a hormone that uh perhaps regulates body fat levels and what they found which was was remarkable when you attach the OB strain to the DB strain so you basically connect their circulation so hormones are are are transmitted between the two um the OB mouse that strain dramatically loses weight in fact within a couple weeks it looks like a normal Mouse it just stops eating it loses almost all of its body fat and it essentially in all respects becomes a normal Mouse the DB Mouse nothing really happens it Still Remains obese and Still Remains hyperphagic and based on just that piece of data Doug Coleman hypothesized that what was going on is these two mutations were mutations in a hormone and a receptor the OB Mouse had a mutation in the recept in the hormone that comes from fat so it couldn't produce this hormone that comes from fat and signals to the brain how much fat you have and the DB Mouse has a mutation in the receptor so it can't sense the hormone um and that was just an idea it was hypothesis um but you know in the 1980s as technology advanced as it became you know there's molecular biology had been invented it became possible to clone genes um a number of people tried to identify what are the genetic mutation that are occurring in these mice that make them so obese and Jeff Bally cloned leptin and showed that in fact Doug was exactly right the the OB mutation is a mutation in this hormone leptin uh and later uh Millennium Pharmaceuticals showed that the the DB mutation is in fact a receptor and it was an important Discovery for a couple ways for a couple reasons one because this OB Gene is just expressed in fat it's exclusively impressed expressed in adapost tissue and uh how much it's expressed is directly proportional to how much body fat you have so as you gain weight the expression of this hormone increases in a linear manner and then it's secreted into the blood so the level of leptin in your blood is a direct readout of your body fat reserves this receptor for leptin leptin receptor the the functional form of it is expressed almost exclusively in the brain and it's expressed in all of the brain regions that we knew from previous work were important for appetite so basically the expression of this receptor gives you a map in the brain of the neurons that control hunger and so what happens is basically when you lose weight uh the levels of leptin in your blood fall because basically you've lost adapost tissue the absence of that hormone sends a signal to all these neurons that have leap in receptors in the brain they're not getting that signal that uh I'm starving and it basically that initiates this entire homeostatic response to starvation so a big part of that is um obviously increased hunger but it's also decreased energy expenditure decreased body temperature um even decreased fertility um because you don't want to reproduce if you're starving less spontaneous movement less spontaneous movement all of this um and so um and so the thought is which I think is absolutely correct is that this this hormone leptin is is part of this negative feedback loop from the fat to the brain that basically tells you about your level of body fat reserves and how urgent it is to find the next meal fascinating as I recall um Amin Pharmaceuticals own the patent for leptin in hopes that it would become the Blockbuster diet drug the logic being that if you were to take this hormone somehow or activate this pathway that the brain would be tricked into thinking that there was more body fat more energy reserves than there was and then people would uh basically be less hungry eat less and lose body fat yes what happened with that do we know why it did not work yeah so that's a great question so um there was a lot of excitement when leptin was Clon because it was thought basically we've cured obesity um there was an auction for the patent amen one I think it was something like $20 million upfront Payment Plus royalties which at the time was I mean still is a lot of money but even more money nowadays it would it would be um a drop in the ocean compared to what companies will invest into potential diet drugs ex exactly so but but you know at the time um and still a lot of money today um and uh they did a clinical trial gave obese people leptin subcutaneous injections of this hormone and they didn't lose a lot of weight um and the question was why and so what was subsequently field is that the challenge with leptin is that individuals who are obese um do not have low levels of leptin for the most part they actually have high levels of leptin and so what they have is a state of leptin resistance so it's analogous to someone who has type two diabetes it's not because they lack insulin it's because they actually have over time a high level of insulin and so Target tissues stop responding to insulin and the thought is that it's the same way in obesity and leptin now subsequently they went back and did um an reanalysis of that clinical trial and ask what if you take all of these people and stratify them according to their starting leptin level so some people have relatively low levels of leptin some have higher some have really high levels of leptin and then ask if we reanalyze the data um how uh how effective is leptin and as you might expect the people with the lowest levels of leptin they lost the most weight when you gave them this drug and the peop with the highest levels of leptin lost the least weight so there is a rationale there for why um for for a scenario in which leptin could work either among the subset of people who just have for some reason lower levels of leptin these aren't people with mutations like the OB Mouse they have some leptin they just don't have unusually high levels or alternatively after weight loss so after you've lost a lot of weight your leptin levels plummet they become very low and that part of the reason it's a big part of the reason it's so difficult to keep weight off is because those leptin levels are so low and so it's been thought for a long time that that that is a scenario where treat treating people with leptin uh uh could be really useful to help them keep the weight off why it never made it as a drug for that application I really don't understand it has something to do I think with the pharmaceutical industry with the economics with a bunch of other issues that aren't necessarily scientific um but I think there's still in the future is a possibility that it could come back for that indication especially now that we have these gp1 drugs and now there's just millions of people losing so much weight and perhaps they want to transition to a different kind of drug uh to keep the weight off well we are definitely going to talk about glp1 OIC and um some of the related compounds in a in a few minutes but before we do that I'd love to get to this issue of what's happening in the brain as we get hungry approach a meal decide what to eat and decide when we've had enough are there separate circuitries or at least separate neurons for each of those steps and um if you would uh could you walk us through what that process looks like since we do it every day most people do it every day unless they're fasting multiple times per day what's going on in our brain and body as we think about and approach a meal consume a meal and decide enough sure so um there are different neurons that are preferentially involved in different aspects of those processes so so I think people we often divide feeding behavior and many other kinds of motivated behaviors into repetitive and consummatory phases so appetitive is the phase of the behavior where you're for example searching for food it's foraging it's all the actions that lead up to the actual Behavior itself which then we call the consum at Phase that's actually putting the food in your mouth and eating it and the general thought is that these four brain circuits in the hypothalamus are more important particularly in hypothalamus but other parts of the forebrain as well are more important for the repetitive phase and the brain stem circuits are more important for the consummatory phase the actual putting it in your mouth and licking chewing swallowing and all that within the hypothalamus there's a population of neurons called agrp neurons so it's just an acronym agrp and stands for a gy related p but it doesn't really matter um they're absolutely critical for that repetitive phase for the searching for food for the desire to find food and consume it when you're hungry um May sorry just to um touch on the agrp neurons and this repetitive phase are they known to connect to areas of the brain and body that stimulate the desire to move because I think about um when I get hungry if I'm at my desk or something um I need to get up and find food need to walk to lunch or go to the refrigerator are they somehow linked to the circuits that um promote Locomotion well they have to promote those things um but they're not directly linked to any of those circuits they're linked directly to other forbrain circuits involved in motivation so the way we think we think about you know what these kinds of neurons like adrp are doing they're not directly talking to the motor circuits to tell you to move your legs or arms to pick up the sandwich or whatever they're rather creating this General problem that the animal has to solve which is that I'm hungry I need to get food it would be really if I could have a sandwich and then the animal uses all of its mental capacities right to solve that problem so they're just there to set the goal not so much to direct the solution and so uh but these hrp neurons there are a few thousand neurons at the base of the hypothalamus so basically the the the most ventral the most bottom part of the forbrain um so tiny population of cells but outsized importance for the control of feeding Behavior so if you stimulate these cells in a mouse or a rat that's not hungry um the animal will voraciously eat like get starving uh if you silence these cells U animals will starve to death so you can basically give them food they just won't eat it voluntarily until basically they you have to euthanize them because they're uh they've lost so much weight um and the activity of these these agrp neurons uh um is thought to track the body's need for energy one reason that's thought is that um uh they express these receptors for leptin this hormone that I was just talking about that that comes from fat and signals the level of body fat Reserves and leptin inhibits agrp neurons so as you might expect if you have lots of body fat um then uh a neuron that expresses that controls hunger should be less active than if you have very little body fat so that's one mechanism by which leptin controls hunger um we my lab have investigated the role of these agrp neurons um uh from a slightly different perspective which is and this relates to your question about what happens when we approach food when we start a meal and to ask what are their activity patterns what is the natural sort of firing of this population of neurons when an animal eats a meal it's a very basic question uh something I think we wanted to know for a long time um was not really addressable until about 10 years ago because just the technology didn't exist because these are such a tiny population of cells so deep in the brain um so one of the very first experiments we did in my lab was to investigate that to ask for the first time what happens to these arrp neurons when an animal eats and so uh one of my first graduate students yuming Chen he uh he used a technology called fiber fetometry which allows us to put a fiber optic into the mouse's brain so then then we could record fluoresence from these agrp neurons which we could use as a readout of their activity it's basically using a calcium sensor so calcium is a surrogate for neural activity and very one of the very first experiments he did we said let's make the animal hungry these ARR pons will be very active because the animal's hungry and then let's give it some food and see what happens during a meal and our expectation was that these arrp Neons would gradually decline in activity as the animal eats and levels of hormones and the Blood start changing uh feeding back to inhibit these neurons what he found was really surprising I remember that when he made this discovery basically him running into my office and saying Zack I I I gave the mouse the piece of food but the weirdest thing happened the neurons shut off almost immediately and I said you man you've made a mistake it's okay you're just starting off in graduate school this happens go back and repeat the experiment and then we'll discuss it but he did it several times he said you know is that every single time I do this happens I give a Hungry Mouse food and the ARR panun within just a few seconds uh their activity has uh greatly diminished back to the level it would be in a Fed Mouse even before they take the first bite of food and so yuming then went to do a series of experiments to try to understand what was going on and what he basically showed by changing the kind of food he gave them or the accessibility of the food or how hungry the mouse was and measuring the response of these arrp neurons was that what the neurons were doing was predicting the mouse looks at at the at the food it looks at how palatable it is imagines how hungry the mouse is how accessible it is and then within a few seconds these neurons predict how much food the mouse is going to eat in the forthcoming meal and so essentially these neurons know how much the mouse is going to eat before the mouse even takes the first bite and uh you can show this in very simple by very simple analysis in which you you give the mouse different foods and you look at how much these arrp neurons drop when the mouse sees and smells the food and then you plot that again so this this drop happens in 3 seconds 4 seconds something like that then you look at how much does the mouse go on to eat in the next 30 minutes and you can just draw a straight line this was one of the first results from my lab and it was really surprising to all of us and I think everyone um but it Illustrated a theme that we've now seen again and again which is that these circuits that control internal State control things like hunger and thirst what they're constantly doing is predicting the future they can sense these signals from the body that tell you about what's happened but those signals are slow and and you don't want to wait 20 minutes from the food that you ingested to reach your stomach and then slowly start entering your intestine to figure out what was the nutrient content of the meal you want to try to figure that out as soon as you can right and so the animals learn presumably through just experience that okay something that smells like this and looks like this that has about this many calories and I know I'm this hungry so I'm going to eat about this much and then that information is all transmitted to these circuits to start the process of satiation before the meal begins is it satiation or it's um ceasing of foraging so that the animal or if I translate to a person decides okay now I'm going to consume this sandwich this package of food yeah that's a great question so um we don't fully know the answer so one interpretation of the data I just showed you is what you exactly what you said is that what these neurons do is they control foraging alone they don't control eating and so this is perfect you see the food you know it's got enough calories the neurons shut off and then you stay there and eat it you transition from this repetitive to this consummatory phase but that doesn't seem to be the whole explanation because if you artificially stimulate these neurons so prevent that drop from ever happening just stimulate them continually the muscle just sit there and eat so you can't fully separate although we like to make this distinction between repetitive and consummatory and we know that that that in different parts of the brain there's more important for one versus the other the reality is the entire behavior is linked and you can't fully separate them so there's a number of ideas about what what this means so one idea that I just mentioned is that starting the process of satiety before the meal begins another idea which which you mentioned which could have could be part of the answer is that it is reducing this repetitive drive and allowing the transition to consummatory behavior um another idea is that and I call these ideas because we don't really fully know the answer yet for exactly what the the purpose in biology it's always hard to answer why something happens you can figure out what this happens but then you can the reason why it evolved that way is challenging um another idea is is it's involved in these what we call spol phase responses that are necessary to prepare you for a meal right so this the famous example of this is Pavlov right basically uh trains the dog to associate the Ring of the bell with the uh uh uh presentation of food and then eventually The Ring Of The Bell alone causes the dog to salivate in the absence of any food and salivation is one example of a stolic phas response the purpose of that is to have enzymes in your mouth that basically are going to digest the food and get them there right before you need them but there's all sorts of other things like basically the secretion of insulin occurs in response to food cues changes in gastric acid gut motility all these things are getting ready for the for the meal to happen and so another idea is is it could be part of that but probably it's doing all of these things as many of you know I've been taking age G1 for more than 10 years now so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast to be clear I don't take ag1 because they're a sponsor rather they are a sponsor because I take ag1 in fact I take ag1 once and often twice every single day and I've done that since starting way back in 2012 there is so much conflicting information out there nowadays about what proper nutrition is but here's what there seems to be a general consensus on whether you're an omnivore a carnivore a vegetarian or a vegan I think it's generally agreed that you should get most of your food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources which allows you to eat enough but not overeat get plenty of vitamins and minerals probiotics and micronutrients that we all need for physical and mental health now I personally am an omnivore and I strive to get most of my food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources but the reason I still take ag1 once and often twice every day is that it ensures I get all of those vitamins minerals probiotics Etc but it also has adaptogens to help me cope with with stress it's basically a nutritional insurance policy meant to augment not replace quality food so by drinking a serving of ag1 in the morning and again in the afternoon or evening I cover all of my foundational nutritional needs and I like so many other people that take ag1 report feeling much better in a number of important ways such as energy levels digestion sleep and more so while many supplements out there are really directed towards obtaining one specific outcome ag1 is foundational nutrition designed to support all aspects of wellbeing related to mental health and physical health if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs with your order plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman it's so interesting I have a number of questions but I think the one that I'll uh put at the top of the list is the other night we were out to dinner in New York and um I was very hungry I hadn't eaten much that day and I was looking forward to a nice steak uh they brought out bread french bread it was French restaurant I took one bite I realized it was absolutely delicious French bread the butter was fantastic and so I had some bread and butter which I love yes then they brought more and then they started bringing out I don't know who ordered them cuz I didn't appetizers and I realized that this was going to be a much more extensive calorically dense meal and suddenly my appetite for the appetizers I it sort of went down because I I knew knew there was more food coming right yes had I not known that there was more food coming I think I would have consumed more of the appetizers which also looked great so clearly there's something going on with these agrp neurons the moment you're sort of um integrating based on new information exactly um on the other end of the spectrum um I did a solo episode about eating disorders in anorexia nervosa in particular and one of the things that I learned from experts in that field the psychiatrist who work on this and the scientists who work on this is that um people with anorexia are unbelievably tuned to the caloric content of food huh that their visual system and presumably other systems um have become like almost um uh hyper accurate calculators of the amount of calories in food they've devoted a lot of cognition to it it sometimes can you know border on or or be placed within the obsessive realm but that they see food and they they they can tell you a tremendous amount about the caloric amounts with these Foods even food combinations to uh you know with a in a very small margin of error okay um so and and that drives in in that condition obviously uh food avoidance yeah um so I have to assume that these agrp neurons are involved in this kind of thing one represents a regulation in the case of the example I gave and in the other case a let's just call it what it is because anorexia nervosa is the most deadly of the psychiatric conditions sadly a pathologic disregulation a maladaptive disregulation so what is known about these AGP neurons in humans meaning do they exist in humans um presumably they express the leptin receptor um sounds like they are able to integrate information both cognitive um based on immediate experience visual or factory but also a lot of Prior experience um you know a hamburger patty I don't can't tell you how many calories it has all know that it's mostly protein and some fat um you know what are these neurons doing what do they have access to they sound like you know when anytime I hear about hypothalamus I think very basic drives but you're talking about a pretty sophisticated analysis of a real-time event yeah that is driving fairly nuanced behavioral decisions and updating that which is which is a big deal you know we're both neuroscientists but for everyone listening and watching this is a big deal this is as nuances deciding whether or not somebody is Friend or Foe or deciding whether or not you you you like a movie or you don't I mean this is this is some um some pretty sophisticated processing this isn't eat don't eat or eat less eat more these aren't switches exactly um these are dials exactly yeah so there's there's a lot there I'll try to unpack that um so the first thing I'd say is they are present in humans and humans uh do humans have hrp neurons human arrp neurons Express the leptin receptor and we think the functions are very similar um so one of the nice things actually about studying these kinds of things like basic mechanisms of hunger thirst because these things are so important for survival they've been under really strong selection right and so many of the components of these systems are genetically hardwired meaning these are cell types that have a single purpose in this case to control hunger they're labeled by specific genes and those are conserved through Evolution um we also know that this pathway this AGR Pam pathway um is important in humans due to human genetics so uh just to add a little bit more information here there's a companion set of neurons called palc neurons that promote satiety so there sort of the yin and yangang of hunger arrp neurons promote hunger pomc neurons promote satiety they're intermingled in the same part of the hypothalamus they they're axons that project to the exact same Downstream brain regions then it's thought that these two neurons compete with each other uh to control appetite and that competition occurs through neuropeptides that they release one of which is a an Agonist for a downstream receptor and the other one of which is an antagonist um we know from Human genetics that the these um that among severely obese people mutations in this pathway agrp palc neurons and their direct Downstream targets are quite common so so and so is it fair to say that that some amount of obesity is genetic in in nature at the level of neuronal firing or circuitry I think a lot of body weight regulation is genetic it's highly heritable um there's a question of how much of it is due to single genes and the number of people quote and this is among people who are severely obese so not just people who you've seen someone who's overweight but people have sort of syndromes where they're very obese from a very young age um among those people something on the order of 10% have mutations in this pathway and it can either be this this hormone palc um or an enzyme within those cells that processes pomy into the right form or in the down this is the most common mutation in the downstream receptor for pomy it's called the melanocortin 4 receptor and so um so among the severely obese people have sort of genetically inherited severe obesity from childhood uh something on the earth 10% have mutations in this pathway so it's very clear that this uh that this this pathway is involved in body weight regulation in humans most obesity although there is a very strong genetic component um uh is not associated with single gene mutations like this Associated effects of many mutations um but we know that even in in that sort of polygenic obesity that has many different uh genetic causes um that uh uh the brain is important and one of the reasons we know that is if you look at the genes through genetic Association studies that have been associated with body weight and there's been lots of genetic Association studies try to find mutations that are associated with whether you're lean or obese something on the order of a thousand genes have been linked to body weight regulation um and the vast majority of those are expressed in the brain and they're highly enriched for brain processes which makes sense because body weight is controlled by food intake right and the brain controls behavior and also the brain controls energy expenditure so so maybe it's not so surprising but it's clear that um that that mutations in in in genes in the brain uh are important for body weight and which is consistent with the results of you know twin studies so if you look at monozygotic versus diotic twins the estimates for the heritability of body weight is something on the order of 80% we should explain monozygotic dizygotic which I've talked about before on the podcast just to brush people just identical versus fraternal twins basically and so um uh and by comparing their uh basically their um their body weight when they become adults you can get a sense for how much of this is genetic versus environmental and um something on the order of uh 80% is thought to the variation between individuals is thought to be have a genetic component wow um so I I don't think most people appreciate that and a lot of the debate we hear nowadays is um because there are things that people can do to lose body fat exercise eat differently Etc maybe Embrace pharmacology if if that's um appropriate um there seems to be this to me silly debate as to whether or not people should be eating better and exercising or um assuming that all of the Obesity they might have um arises through genetic causes um and therefore take a prescription drug I mean why wouldn't it be a combination of things yeah like to me it just seems like why wouldn't people um Embrace some are all of the tools that they could afford and that are safe for them so I just want to get that out there because the moment this comes up people start thinking oh well uh the moment we assign a genetic source to something we're removing um personal responsibility but of course there are people I know people who have struggled with their weight their entire lives for whom some of these new Pharmaceuticals like OIC have provided them the opport to finally be able to uh lose weight and feel better and exercise safely yeah for instance I I completely agree with that um I think there is a misconception out there about this about what it means for something to be genetically heritable and I think this gets to the root of why so many people find this sort of hard to believe that there's such a strong genetic component of body weight that's the idea that you know if you look at people say 75 years ago right they were much leaner right and you look at people today and there's been this starting sometime around you know the 1970s there's this explosion in body an increase in obesity is that when that's when it started mid 7s sort of 1970s is a lot start snacking so there's lots of there's lots of explanation oil snack by the way I don't think that's the reason folks I I think there are a lot of reasons but the theories that that abound right now on social media are I have a list of the theories as to why the OB obesity is increased you get everything from seed oils to snacking to uh smartphones to uh conspiracies to it's wild it's wild the range of of hypothesis is wild yeah I mean the the challenges I mean some of them could be true but it's just very hard to test those things experimentally because they're happening in the whole population right but so I think the thing that people find hard to wrap their heads around because it is a little bit of a confusing idea is that how can it be that in say 50 or 75 years there's been this explosion in obesity which is the environment has changed but human genetics has not changed in that amount of time it's just not fast enough for people to evolve so it can't be due to mutations in humans what about devolve my understanding is that within a species um evolving new traits is very slow yes but mutations arise like the Obi Obi mutation and then you can get very fat versions of a of an animal very quickly right all you need is a you know if if it's a um if it's a recessive alal you need two copies and then next thing you know you've got a mouse that's four times larger than a typical Mouse and and it's all explained by increased body weight so that happen can happen very quickly within a species what's rare to find uh is an entire new branch of a species that has a a very uh a new adaptive function that seems more rare so so that's true so definitely there's some things that take longer to evolve than others but with humans we're talking about just two generations there just isn't enough time for any evolution of any signific baby baby boomers right that's me right and then whatever is YZ Millennial I lose track after exactly so so I think the thing that people find hard to WRA their heads around is how can it be that this is how this is that that that increase in body weight is clearly environmental right because that's all that's changed the environment it's nothing has changed genetically yet it's also true what I said that body weight is extremely heritable it's one of the most heritable features and something on the order of 80% the only thing one of the only things we know about that's actually more heritable than body weight is height right most diseases are not as heritable as body weight how can you explain that the idea is this there's a distribution of body weights among people so in any given so Society at any point in time some people are going to be leaner some people are going to be more obese that distribution where you lie on that distribution is determined primar by genetics so you may be the person who has the Thrifty genes so that basically cause you to save energy and so you would be more on the obese side or you may be may be a person who has different genes that cause you to be a little bit less hungry so you would be on the leaner side what environment does is then it shifts that whole distribution so that basically the mean shifts so that everyone becomes or most people become heavier and so sort of phrase that people sometimes use is that is that um genetics loads the gun and environment pulls the trigger so basically genetics s your sets your propensity and then environment can can basically unmask that and so as we've had this change in environment where there's all of this and we don't know exactly what the things are that have changed they're important but there's all this Ultra processed food highly palatable food uh just various other things that you mentioned seed oils who knows if that's important um uh uh certain people had these latent mutations that made them say very sens sensitive to to palatable food and in an earlier time they may have been lean but now because they have that latent capacity to be sensitive to to ultr processed food they now gain tons of weight in in the environment that we're in it's still because of genetics but it also requires the environmental component I mean you just take a step back right you can make anyone lean but just putting them putting them you know in prison and just only feeding them 1500 calories I mean we've done those kinds of experiment this this famous experiment the Minnesota starvation experiment right they basically this is didn't put people in prison but this is in World War II they took a bunch of healthy volunteers fed them 1600 calories a day just asked what would happen if you basically semi- starved people and unsurprisingly they lose an incredible amount of weight all they think about is food they basically their body temperature goes down their heart rate goes down they just become obsessed with food and you you could always do that for anyone right but but um in a given environment where you're not in that kind of situation then your propensity to gain weight will be determined by genetics so that's the idea I very much appreciate that description and I know great number of other people will as well because the explanation for the increase in obesity um has not been described with that level of accuracy in detail with respect to the interactions between genetics and the environment is it fair to say that what's changed in our environment is the free availability of food you know I was walking through an airport yesterday and every 20 meters or so there's a vending machine or a restaurant um the cost of calories yeah is fairly low right getting high quality nutritious food that tastes great is expensive yeah I would argue but getting calories is fairly inexpensive yeah I think that's a plausible hypothesis um it's one of several plausible hypothesis and it would be surprising to me if it didn't contribute but the reality is these population level questions it's just so hard to actually know because you can't do an experiment right we can't create a parallel so Society where we manipulate one of these variables and see if the people become obese so I think probably the availability of food of the free availability the low cost is one part of it another part of it is probably although again it's it's it's it's not proven is that these ultr processed foods have a number of features that um make them make people prone to gain weight and this's really beautiful work I if you know about this from Kevin Hall at the NIH who's investigated this he's really in my opinion the best person doing this kind of human obesity research today and he does these experiments where he takes people into the NH into the hospital hospitalizes them for several weeks so he can exactly control what they eat and he did this this beautiful experiment where basically he had chef prepare two kinds of food one Ultra processed and the other not ultr processed sort of more Whole Foods more healthier foods but had them take a lot of care so that when they gave the foods to Independent Raiders to people to test they would say this is about equally palatable so I like the this Ultra processed Dish as much as as this non Ultra processed dish what's an example of an ultra processed dish like a outof package macaroni and cheese exactly that kind of stuff with bacon kind of thing exact versus um some pasta sitting next to a vegetable and some exactly a nice piece of salmon or something exactly exactly um and uh um took people into the into the hospital basically allowed them to eat just as much as they would like first of the ultr processed meals so they had the selection of ultra processed meals for a couple weeks and then switch them to the to the non-ultra processed meals and then also did it in the reverse order so the other half of the people they got the regular food first then they got the ultra processed food and what he found is that even though um uh uh people rated the foods as equally palatable they ate more of the ultr processed food and they actually gained weight when during that two we period when they were being given the ultra processed foods and then when you switch them they lost weight so the idea being that you can have two sets of food that you sort of equal pref equal preferences for but something about the ultra processed food is making you eat more of it when you actually consume it and there's a number of ideas about why that could be so one idea is that these Ultra processed foods have been optimized to have the right percentage of fat and sugar and protein to sort of promote more consumption once you start eating it so could be part of it another idea is that you know a big thing about Whole Foods is that they take more energy to digest and they have more volume so one of the Striking things from that study is if you just look at the pictures of the meals they're the same number of calories but there's so much more food seemingly on the nonprocessed food versus the ultr processed food and that's just because Whole Foods are bigger because they're not so energy dense so and we know that for example volume is a major signal on the short term for regulating food intake so if you just eat more volume that could be valuable and there's lots of things like that so so I think that that's another H plausible hypothesis but the truth is we don't really know I have a hypothesis and I don't want to force you into speculation but given that you've studied and discovered that the neurons and circuits involved in appetitive and consummatory behaviors can learn based on experience and expectation I think it's fair game to at least ask your thoughts on this so I've been paying a lot of attention to the landscape of what the general public think about um let's call them elimination diets where people will just eat meat yes or will go onto a vegan diet or do some time restricted feeding or do any number of different things that have been shown to promote weight loss provided people obey the laws of thermodynamics and consume fewer calories than they um than they burn yeah right I do believe in calories in calories out and there are a number of different routes to get there and some are more painful some are less painful and it depends on the individual lifestyle exercise and on and on but let's just suppose for a moment based on Kevin's work on highly processed foods versus Whole Foods that there's a learning that takes place when we eat yes and that this learning takes place over time such that our brain and appetite start to link the variables of taste macronutrients proteins fats and carbohydrates sort of knowledge about macronutrients a piece of fish is mostly protein has some fat a bowl of rice is mostly carbohydrate has some protein yeah put a pat of butter on it has some fat also right it's sort of obvious but taste macronutrient content calories which we already know people with anorexia are exquisitely good at counting with their eyes so it's possible they represent again a pathologic stream of this and micronutrient content maybe even amino acid content like how much Lucine is there now most people aren't thinking about how much Lucine is in a meal but we know that Lucine is important for certain aspects of muscle metabolism it's um present in certain proteins and not others you're going to find less of it in a vegetable typically than you would in a piece of chicken and and so on and that when people eat mostly nonprocessed or minimally processed foods and not in combination so we're not talking about stewing all this together or blending all of it together which G sounds disgusting right broccoli rice and a chicken breast blend together just sounds horrible but eating them separately if there's some olive oil and a little Pat of butter involved like that sounds pretty good but a highly processed food in some ways is a blending together of macronutrients micronutrients if there are any um and other features of the food that neurons in the brain seem to pay attention to and then giving it a unified taste a Dorito right um a candy bar that we attach to the product we attached to the name of the processed food to the packaging but I could imagine and here's the hypothesis that that is quote unquote confusing to our neural circuits in a way that doesn't match up well with our thermodynamic requirements of how much we're burning versus how much we need to eat whereas when I eat a piece of steak and a vegetable I actually want less carbohydrate afterwards if I eat the carbohydrate first for me it's difficult because I love the taste of carbohydrates especially when they're combined with fat but there's seems to be an easier time regulating food intake when people step back and say I'm going to consume minimally processed Whole Foods and I'm guessing it's not just because um they're trying to be healthier that might be what stimulates the the shift but that the brain starts to learn the relationship between food volume smell taste um what these things look like and satiation at the level of oh that's enough amino acids because I had a piece of fish so maybe I don't need to consume as much of some other things or the vegetables provide volume and fiber and often vegetables can taste really delicious too so that there's a there's a linking of nutrients calories and taste in a way that's more appropriately matched to the energetic demands of the organism this case us humans that highly processed foods bypass yeah okay now I realized that was long-winded and forgive me but my audience is used to that whenever I'm trying to table something for no pun intended for a discussion that I would like to think can at least stimulate some additional thinking about a landscape in this case nutrition and and feeding behavior that for a lot of people is just really confusing and here's why and this is the last thing I'll say I have several friends who have been very overweight their entire lives for whom the following diet has worked exceptionally well I'm not a diet coach I'm not a nutritionist I don't pretend to be one I say eat proteins like meat fish eggs vegetables and fruit and do that for a couple of months and then add back in starches as you um see fit based on your food intake and without fail they all lose a ton of weight they're very happy with that they add back in a minimum of starches they keep the weight off and they they're also exercising but not more than they were before in most cases and I don't think that it's meat or fish or vegetables per se I think it's that they finally develop an appreciation for what different foods have in in terms of what they actually need and without fail they all say oh you know on I went to this party and I had a piece of cake and it didn't taste good to me after three or four bites so that's interesting too so I just would like your thoughts on this we're not defining any new diets I don't sell any diets I don't do any of that but I find it amazing that when people start eating minimally processed Whole Foods I have to assume that their brain changes as it relates to appetite craving and just kind of a an unconscious understanding about what food is providing them or not and that highly processed foods basically bypass all of this and just get you to consume more perhaps in hopes of getting something that you probably aren't getting at all or that you need to consume a lot of this food in order to get yeah there's several interesting ideas there so there's two that come to mind just thinking about what you just said so the one is the idea of what's going on when these people uh consume simpler diets more of of Whole Foods and and one one thing I think that's very likely going on is this phenomenon of sensory specific satiety is being engaged and so um uh sensory specific satiety is just the idea that as you expose yourself repeatedly to a certain flavor or taste you um you basically lose appetite for that you get specific loss of appetite for that flavor or taste this is why as you said basically if you start off eating the protein after a while I don't want any more salmon but I would like some carbohydrates now because you have the sensory specific satiety and so um it's well known actually that if you simplify your diet make your diet really simple so there's just a few things then sensory specific satiety alone can cause you to eat less basically because there's just less Variety in your diet and you don't want to eat more of that same thing and so and so I think a lot of diets actually it's not about the specific macronutrient or the specific food it's just that they're reducing the variable the the variety in the diet eventually you just get sick of eating the same thing and you know this is the thought behind that idea is that it's it's important evolutionarily so that you eat a diverse diet it's the reason probably that you want sweets after you've eaten a Savory meal and so on a second idea though that comes to mind is just as you mentioned this idea of learning and and so much about our our preferences for food are they're not an a they're driven by learning right and so so you know there are some things that are a so if you put sugar on a baby's T tongue you know it'll smile indicating that it likes it and if you uh put something bitter it'll frown and a rat will do the same thing a neonate rat but most of flavor and the perception of food is not just sweet or bitter it's this much more complex Sensation that involves smells it involves tastes and then it involves how those tastes and smells interact with the post-ingestive effects of the nutrients so the sensing of those nutrients in your stomach and in your intestine primarily in your intestine are thought to then feed back and then change your preference for these foods and so you know there's lots of examples of this that you can just imagine from everyday experience most people the first time they had a beer or the first time they had a glass of coffee found it repulsive right because it's extremely bitter but then we come to Crave these things because we know what they do to our body we like what they do to our body and that doesn't just make us take them like they're medicine we actually somehow change our very perception of how that flavor is we actually come to savor that flavor we previously found disgusting and it's because our sensation of what is what is whether something's good or bad depends on an internal State and so it's an interesting idea you know perhaps if these Ultra processed foods that have so many different ingredients and such an unnatural combination perhaps this process of learning about the nutrient content of different foods and flavors becomes impaired because it's just the brain is not used the brain's used to saying you know this is a piece of chicken and this is primarily protein and so I can gauge you know from this Flav I can connect this flavor to an amino acid content but something that's so diverse it might be harder to do and isn't it the case that the neurons in the gut and the hormones that are produced by the gut as we digest food and that the neurons in the brain that can control appetite and feeding have to be tuned to macronutrient content because those are the U primary colors of of nutrients and nutrients are uh the way in which we can persist um on a day-to-day basis right I mean I'm not trying to sound more sophisticated where simpler terms would suffice what basically saying is that the neurons in our brains that control these behaviors both eating and cessation of of eating an ingredient or an entire meal can't be tuned to a particular food product or to chicken or to an egg or to a steak uh or to lentils um but rather to amino acid content essential amino acid content in particular essential fatty acids and in the case of carbohydrate whatever is going to replace whatever glycogen we might have depleted right I mean like if we really break it down into biology eating is for a purpose and my understanding is that the purpose of eating is to uh replace those things as needed um rather than to uh you know taste Savory or taste um absolutely absolutely absolutely those are just those those things those sensory cues are just markers that tell the brain what might be in that substance I think if you if you look at broadly at this difference between calories and macronutrients and micronutrients I would say what you see is that most of the circuits that are controlling hunger are primarily calorie specific so they they can like for example an arrp neuron I can put sugar fat or protein into the stomach of a mouse and to an equal extent inhibit an agrp as long as they have equal calories really yeah so a little drop of olive oil into the belly that has of an animal that has um let's drop let's say a little bit more let's say um 120 calories of olive oil is equipotent to 120 calories of chicken breast at the level of these agrp neurons it is so we they don't care about they don't care about no they're really concerned about they're really concerned about energy um there are circuitries that are more concerned with macronutrients individually although I don't think we know nearly as much about how that works and I think the evidence is clear that the the strongest offended Mac macronutrient by far is protein so protein um you know I don't think really sugar and fat intake are strong strongly defended in the sense that you can you you're fine if you go without eating sugar right basically you can synthesize sugar from other from amino acids for example um and you don't develop an a specific sugar appetite in the same way you do for example if you deprive yourself of hunger you develop a protein hunger or essential I think the difference is that you know proteins consist of essential amino acids there's this I forget if it's nine I think amino acids that um uh your body cannot synthesize you absolutely need them or you will die and so um whereas sugar and fat can be interchanged with other macronutrients so um and then there's other things also that you absolutely need to ingest like sodium chloride right so sodium so uh uh there's very if you deprive an animal of of sodium they will develop this salt appetite that's incredible basically and that's completely innate um uh but that's I think salt appetite and and and protein appetite are the things that are probably the most strongly regulated at the level of the macro micronutrients I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge one of our sponsors element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need that means the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium in the correct amounts and ratios and nothing you don't which means no sugar now I and others on this podcast have talked about the critical importance of hydration for proper brain and body functioning even a slight degree of dehydration can diminish cognitive and physical performance it's also important that you get adequate electrolytes the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium are critical for the functioning of all the cells in your body especially your neurons your nerve cells drinking element dissolved in water makes it very easy to ensure that you're getting adequate hydration and adequate electrolytes to make sure I'm getting proper amounts of hydration and electrolytes I dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning and I drink that basically first thing in the morning I'll also drink element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing especially in hot days when I'm sweating a lot losing water and electrolytes they have a bunch of different great tasting flavors of element my favorite is the watermelon although I confess I also like the raspberry and the Citrus basically I like all the flavors and element has also just released a new line of canned sparkling element so these aren't the packets you dissolve in water these are cans of element that you crack open like any other canned drink like a soda but you're getting your hydration and your electrolytes with no sugar if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element spelled l mn.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with the purchase of any element drink mix again that's drink element.com / huberman to claim a free sample pack if we could talk about body weight homeostasis for a moment that I think that would be useful so let's say somebody decides they want to lose some weight they caloric restricts slightly either by exercising more or eating less or both their body weight drops by a bit let's say they lose 10 pounds eight of which are body fat they lose a little bit of lean mass also they're now at a new lower body weight are the arrp neurons motivated to have them seek out more food in other words are they hungrier and more motivated to find and eat food or do these agrp neurons learn hey body weight is lower and I don't need to push to find so much food so often no I mean the idea is that the hrp neurons are more active when you lose weight and that that chronic activation of those neurons in part because leptin levels are lower in the blood because you've lost weight is that drive that that that counterregulatory drive that drives you to then consume more food but then how do people ever keep weight off well so part of the answer is they don't I mean so so there's so really I I I I would argue like I have these friends who were very heavy most of the excess weight was body body fat for a long time they seem to be doing great yeah uh eating the way that I described before and by the way I'm not a proponent of any one particular diet I have vegan friends carnivore friends Etc but but that pattern of eating I described before has been enormously successful for them I haven't run a you know a randomized control trial that's not my job to do that in the realm of nutrition but they're doing great they claim to be sad they are so happy with the way things are going and um I I don't hear that they're constantly hungry I hear that they're constantly saded well so I would say that that you know there have been efforts for a long time to develop diets that would help people consistently lose weight and it has been very unsuccessful um there are some people who for various reasons can't can successfully lose weight and keep it off and I don't know that I have a good answer for what's going on in those individual cases how they are the exceptions to the rule what about them is different that makes sense some also quit drinking alcohol yeah so there's other things so you know I think so behavioral regulation is better when you're sober as opposed to environment but you know so what this is sort of getting at is what is the counterregulatory response to weight loss and so this has been studied um it was first studied um uh in the context of energy expenditure and um because energy expenditure is actually surprisingly easier to measure in humans than food intake because people don't tell you accurately what food they eat if they're free living humans they have to fill out a questionaire but um and the idea is that um for every uh kilogram of weight you lose so it's about 2.2 pounds I think um your energy expenditure decreases by about 30 kilo calories a day now so not a ton but that is significant right 30 calories and then if you lose as you said 10 lb then that's 100 50 calories and that adds up over time one interesting thing about that is that if you take people who were obese and then they've lost a ton of weight so there's a study by Rudy liell about 25 years ago that did this um take people lost like 100 pounds and then take a control group that has the same height weight basically the same body composition as those people who've now lost 100 pounds compare their energy expenditure the energy expenditure in the in the people that lost all the way is about 25% lower than the people people who never were obese and so those people who lost the weight we call them the reduced obese or that's what they were called in those studies and the idea is that that there's this now this chronic deficit they have to eat 25% less than someone who looks the same as them is the same height as them the same weight as them in order to maintain that body weight what's unclear is whether that's because those people simply always had a solow metabolism they were always destined to be obese and then you just basically you're comparing two different groups or whether something about the process of gaining weight and being in a higher weight for a longer period of time changes the brain so that then once you lose the weight it's irreversible um but there have been studies looking at at least a year and it doesn't seem to come back within a year that difference in energy expenditure now the question is is that really the big effect is that why it's so hard to lose weight energy expenditure or is it because you're hungrier and that's actually much harder to measure um but there was another really nice study Again by Kevin Hall investigating this um used a really clever approach this drug so basically what he wanted to do was is um he reasoned that um you can meure people's body weight and you can measure people's energy expenditure and because calories in calories out if we can measure body weight and energy expenditure accurately we can then back calculate how much that person was actually eating um so let's see what happens when you have people lose weight how does their food intake change but the trick to this is you need to do it in such a way that you don't just tell them to go run on a treadmill because if you tell someone to go around a treadmill and lose way then basically there's all these they're thinking about the fact that they're doing this you need to do it in some way overtly so you increase their energy expenditure cause them to lose weight but without them realizing that's what's happening so they gave them these uh drugs these sglt2 Inhibitors and it's a pill you can take they're used for diabetes they block this this this protein sglt2 in the kidney that is necessary for glucose to be reabsorbed into the blood and so basically what happens you pee out about like 90 grams of glucose a day but you don't know that you're doing that and that causes you to lose energy and these people would lose some weight and then measure how their food intake changes and what that showed is that for every two pounds or so of weight you lose your hunger goes up by 100 calories per day so basically you've got a 30 kilo calorie decrease in energy expenditure 100 kilo calorie decrease in appetite for every two pounds you lose on average some people will be exceptions right they won't experience that at all for aspects of their physiology we don't understand um and so increased hunger seems to be the main reason people find it so difficult to keep weight off that seems the perfect segue to talk about gp1 glucagon like pep TI one OIC monjaro and similar drugs um my understanding of the back history on these is that a biologist obsessed with hila Monsters uh a reptile that doesn't need to eat very often discovered a peptide within their bloodstream called extendin yeah that um allowed them to eat very seldom a curbed appetite in the hila monster of all things and and it has a analog homologue you know we don't know uh I don't know the sequence homology exactly but there's a similar peptide made in mice and in humans that suppresses appetite um if you would could you tell us uh what is known about how glp1 Works to suppress appetite where in the body indor brain sure and uh your sort of read of um these drugs and what's happening there um good bad exciting sure ugly sure be happy to anything else so um the story of glp1 so the he monster is an important turn and I'll talk about that it actually goes back before that quite a ways so so I should take a step back and say you know these were developed as drugs for diabetes right and so and know diabetes is a condition where basically have elevated blood glucose either because you don't produce enough insulin or because your insulin is is not effective and so back in in sort of the 1920s right around the time insulin was discovered um there was this phenomenon discovered known as the incretin effect um and uh what it was intin intin not the effect not the effect you can observe the effect in numerous places in daily life and online just kidding so it's it's called the incretin effect you can think of it as increase insulin because that's what the effect is um and the idea was that if you take glucose by mouth if you consume glucose orally um versus if you have the same amount of glucose injected intravenously more insulin is produced when you take the glucose orally versus if it's delivered intravenously suggesting something about the process of ingesting uh the glucose causes more insulin to be released and causes you to to lower your body sugar more accurately more more more strongly interesting um which is a little bit counterintuitive because in the pancreas right so insulin is released from the pancreas from the beta cell the pancreas senses the glucose concentration in the blood directly and so it suggest that that insulin is being released not just in response to changes in blood glucose but in response to a second factor and so they call that an incretin and through various experiments it was it was uh shown that this incretin effect comes from the intestine that there's some substance being produced by the intestine that when you eat a meal uh sugar goes through your intestine that boosts this insulin response to glucose in the blood and people immediately realize this could potentially be very valuable and the reason is that you know you can treat diabetes with insulin injections but insulin is dangerous right because if you inject too much insulin you can kill yourself by making yourself hypoglycemic right so this have to be very careful but the thing about the incretin effect is it's not causing insulin release directly but it's rather boosting the natural insulin release that comes when glucose is higher in your blood so it's sort of an amplifier on the natural insul insulin release so basically in the years that followed whenever someone would find a new hormone they would test it is it this incretin and there's lots of failures they weren't the incretin um but then so there's this other hormone that comes from from the the um pancreas called glucagon right and so glucagon which also discovered in the 1920s glucagon is kind of the anti-insulin so um when blood sugar goes low glucagon is released in order to cause your liver to release glucose into the blood so glucose glucagon and insulins are these two opposing hormones glucagon was known for a long time but but people discovered in s of the 1980s that the glucagon Gene is expressed in other tissues other than the pancreas and it's differentially processed the protein is differentially processed to produce different hormones hormones other than glucagon and they discovered there was one in the intestine and so they called it glucagon like peptide because it came from the same gene but it's just slightly different it's cut up slightly differently and this hormone was an in creedon so basically if you uh put it on beta cells um you get this increased response of insulin in response to glucose and so there was the idea okay this could be a great diabetes drug right and there I should say there was one other increte that's that's been found it's it's called jip Gip and that will be important talking about some of these other drugs also a hormone that comes from the intestine and so um the challenge with making glp1 into a drug is that it has an extremely short halflife so it has a half life about 2 minutes in the blood um and so even if you inject people with glp1 it won't really be useful for anything you don't decrease appetite you don't affect blood sugar because just degraded too fast and the reason it's degrade is because there's an enzyme dpp4 is what it's called that degrades gp1 so the first thing people tried was let's make Inhibitors of that enzyme so we can boost this natural gp1 signal and those are improved uh uh uh diabetes drugs they're called gpon you've probably heard about them Genovia is the most common one and those boost the level of gp1 the natural glp1 in the in the produced from the intestine by about three-fold and they're effective in treating diabetes not people lose weight people do not lose weight and that's one of the key reasons that we know that the natural function of gp1 is not really to control body weight because you can boost the level three-fold with these dpp4 drugs millions of people have taken them they do not lose weight that's a great question so but you know a three-fold is great but like you'd like to increase it even more right and to do that you can't block this enzyme you have to actually produce a glp1 that uh uh is more stable in the blood and that's where this this lizard that you're talk you mentioned comes into play it produces a stabilized form of glp1 and its venom no one knows why one hypothesis is that it's something to do with the lizard uh as you said basically having this long time period between meals and it needs to regulate its blood glucose who knows if that is true but it turned out to be fortuitous because then this glp1 from this lizard it has a half life of like 2 hours and so the first glp1 drug that was approved was just this molecule from this lizard basically and it um it's called exenatide and it's approved in 2005 for works well for diabetes um has a half life of two hours you inject it and um uh doesn't cause a ton of weight loss but two hours is good but it's not so great so then pharmaceutical industry tries to can we you know basically improve this even further and so they start engineering this hormone making mutations attaching lipid tails to make it binds to proteins in the blood that would stabilize it chemistry jockey stuff yeah exactly and I think the next big Advance was this Compound L glutide um and L glutide was approv for diabetes in 2010 and for and then for weight loss in 2014 and so lug glutide has a half life of about 13 hours in the blood no now you're getting up to something serious we've gone from 2 minutes 2 hours 1 hours and you get better effects on on on aspects of blood glucose and diabetes control and they started to see that some people were losing weight very variable responses not everyone loses weight on L glutide and one of the things they noticed that I think is just is fascinating to sort of example of how drug Discovery works in the real world um you know a lot of these people who take log glutide now it has this longer halflife they start to get nauseous and that would limit how much of the LI glutide they could take and it's a known side effect of these gp1 drugs it causes nausea and sort of this gastrointestinal distress but they noticed that over time the nausea would just sort of go away and so they would start dose escalating sort of raising the dose that the person would take so you would go you know a month at this dose and then a month at a slightly higher dose and then a month at a slightly higher dose and you could work your way up and these side effects would reappear but then they go away and then once you got up to the highest doses then people really started losing weight and so there's a couple things that are pharmaceutical industry realized wow these are potentially really effective weight loss drugs and also this nausea which we thought was a was you know a killer people are able to just get used to it and then it just goes away it under goes the word is Tac aaxis so the idea is that the receptor uh that's affecting the the in the gut that's causing this these effects undergo some sort of down regulation with with chronic chronic exposure so L glutide you know was it's been around it's been on the market for 14 years now um was used but still you're only getting sort of like 7 to 10% weight loss which is good but not like you know amazing Rive um but then semaglutide came along um and that that was approved for diabetes in 2017 and semaglutide is OIC or also Al also uh marketed as uh wig oie for weight loss and semaglutide now has a half life of seven days so now we've gone from two 2 minutes 2 hours 13 hours 7 days and you can really jack up the concentration with a 7-Day uh uh halflife and then they saw people started really losing weight and so and some of those trials people lost you know 16% of their body weight which previously had been unattainable with in what time frame uh typically takes about a year okay and most of the loss and body weights from body fat or from other other compartments the typical number is that if you um if you lose weight either through dieting or through taking one of these drugs and you don't do anything like eat a high protein diet or do resistance training somewhere between 25 and 33% of what you lose is going to be muscle the rest is going to be fat but as you said some of that could be be offset by resistance training Andor consuming a higher protein diet yeah you can almost completely eliminate that if you eat enough protein and do serious weightlifting um obviously not the whole population is interested in doing that and there's been a lot of discussion of how serious a side effect this is um you among elderly people you don't want to be losing muscle mass because you're already losing so much muscle mass on the other hand the counterargument that has been made which I think is also kind of convincing is that true you're losing some muscle but you're also losing all this fat and you no longer need as much muscle when you're not carrying around as much body fat so people who are heavier naturally have more muscle because they need to to move their body right and so yeah the the calves on very um obese people are often enormous exactly and then they lose weight and exactly the and I mentioned the calves in particular because um they're carrying a lot of the body load exactly exactly so it's still an open question as to whether as to how serious a problem this this musan muscle mass loss is although the pharmaceutical industry is all in now on making drugs that basically are going to prevent that so that's that's something that will be will be happening probably in the future is it a sorry to interrupt it is the um weight loss on these drugs the consequence of reduced appetite um or some other aspect of metabolism and if it's the consequence of reduced appetite um is that occurring at the level of the brain and gut um or culmination so it's almost entirely reduced appetite and it's almost entirely incurring at the level of the the brain which neurons it's thought that the key targets of of uh these drugs are neurons in these two regions one's called the nucleus of the solitary tract and the other one's called the area Posta so where back in the brain stem back in the brain stem so these are actually the neurons in that desate rat story I was telling earlier these are the brain regions that are preserved in the deser rat the deser rat still has these very coddle brain stem structures um they're two very special brain regions because they get direct input from the vagus nerve so the vagus nerve is the nerve that inates your stomach and intestines and heart and lungs and it's sort of the major pathway from gut to brain and provides most of the sensor of the neural input from gut the brain telling you about things like this your stomach distension how many nutrients are in your intestine breathing all that stuff and almost all of those vagal nerves terminate on these two structures in the brain stem when I hear Posta I think about nausea because I was taught that Posta contains neurons that can stimulate vomiting um and this seems to link up well at least in The Logical sense with the idea that stimulating activating receptors in these neurons within postma might explain part of the transient nausea side effect do of OIC and and related drugs yeah so the current thought is that a lot of the nausea is coming from activating the neurons in the area Posta and that a lot of the sort of physiologic satiety is coming from activating the neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract now the whole brain is connected to each other and so if you really turn on these neurons in the NTS and the AP they're going to talk to the hypothalamus and all these other brain regions that's going to change the whole brain so it's not just those regions but you know these drugs don't have great access to the brain they can penetrate a little bit into the brain but they don't penetrate into the whole brain and it's thought that if you take fluorescently labeled versions of these drugs and see where do they so you can visualize where do they actually go they're enriched in these structures in the brain stem so that's why people think that this is probably where they're acting and is that because they're um there's an abundance of The receptors for the these compounds in Posta and um NTS or is it because the bloodb brain barrier is somehow weaker at that location uh it's because the blood brain barrier is weaker so basically it's a region uh so what's known as a circumventricular organ meaning it's a one of these rare places in the brain where the blood brain barrier is weakened and so substances can come from the outside into the brain um and that's important for these big peptides because these are not small molecules these are Big peptides with lipid chains on them and other things and so they can really get only get into areas of the brain where the blood brain barrier is weakened I really appreciate that you mentioned the half-life issue with glp1 and the fact that these um dpp4 antagonist did not lead to weight loss despite increasing circulating glp by three-fold um this is relevant um to a number of different claims that people make that a given food or a given drink um increases glp one um I've actually said before you know I'm a big consumer of Y brate my uh father's side is Argentine and it's a known appetite suppressant but it contains caffeine and other stimulants that might explain some of that and it's not a robust appetite suppressant to the point where most people would you know rely on it as a weight loss compound it's but anyway it's my preferred source of caffeine but I've um said before um you know there's some evidence that it can increase glp1 but based on what you've said the increases in glp1 that it creates are very unlikely to produce the kind of appetite suppressive effect that would lead to any significant weight loss in somebody that's obese presumably that are separate from any caffeine stimulatory effect right so you can't separate because it's it's a complex compound this year thing it's got lots of things in it but also um you know I've uh observed you being vocal on social media uh when people have said hey this thing increases uh gop1 um you quite appropriately I think um said wait you know OIC and drugs like that increase glp 1,000 fold when you talk about a food or drink or maybe a supplement increasing gp1 it's very unlikely to increases gp1 to that level meaning unless you're getting into the hundredfold OR thousandfold increases um probably uh not right to talk about glp1 being the source of any appetite suppressive effect yeah that's that's all correct so I mean I think it's important sometimes to distinguish between pharmacologic and physiologic effects so physiologic is what the hormone naturally does in your body and what can be modulated by natural things like eating a different food and you might get a twofold change in your glp1 by eating a different food you know one food versus the other but as we know from those dpp4 Inhibitors it's not going to really change your appetite because the drugs increase it three-fold um these These gp1 agonists are really a pharmacologic effect effect that only happens with drugs so you get a thousand to 10,000 fold higher concentrations of these drugs in your blood than uh the natural hormone and so it's just there's no diet is ever going to give you that and there's no precedent for it either so should we be at all concerned about that I mean they run clinical trials and address safety but when you're talking about a thousandfold increase in a essentially a peptide hormone yeah um if we were talking about different peptide hormone you know pick one um you know oxytocin or uh estrogen testosterone they're not really you know broadly speaking um most people would be concerned about thousandfold dosing of something like that and obviously there are clinical indications where that's important however my observation of the ever expanding literature on gp1 agonis um is that there seems to be improvements in like reduction in um alcohol consumption um and by the way why would uh increasing gop1 reduce um uh craving for alcohol that it seems like there's an ever expanding list of things that glp1 agonism is good for yeah um but we are talking about Su I would say super physiological levels when one takes it and again I'm not um against it nor for it I'm just paying attention to the literature so I would say that that's absolutely right when you're increasing the level of hormone a thousandfold you need to be careful see what's happening um but at the end it's an empirical question what what what does it actually do to a person and it can only be answered through experiments and I think the nice thing about these gp1 drugs that a lot of people don't realize is they've been around approved since 2005 the earliest ones and even something like OIC which maybe only entered the public Consciousness in the last year or two right it's been around for sevenish years I think so so and big clinical trials with these drugs and so um and the evidence so far is that they seem to be incredibly safe and as you said not just incredibly safe but um they seem to have all these unexpected health benefits that that were seems to be in some cases even unrelated to weight loss and so so you know because of the reasons you mentioned one of the things the FDA requires from these pharmaceutical companies for diabetes drugs is um these large cardiac uh outcome trials so basically where you measure stroke and where you measure uh uh heart attacks and and death from from any cardiac cause um big trials like 20,000 people four years cost like a billion dollars to run and the data from the semaglutide the OIC trial came out last year and as expected reduced the rate of heart attacks Strokes all cause mortality according to cardiac uh uh for for cardiac reasons but was really surprising was a lot of that seemed to happen before the people even lose weight lost weight so there was already a difference between the placebo group and the semag glte group before the people on the drug had lost a significant amount of weight and there was no correlation between the amount of weight they lost and how well they were protected from heart disease and that's led many people to think that some of these effects actually could be due to other things the gp1s are doing that we didn't expect and so one thing is there's an idea emerging that that they are anti-inflammatory so um these brain regions the area postre and the NTS are also really important for this this reflex known as the inflammatory reflex that basically acts starts with the vagus nerve goes to these brain regions of the brain stem and then goes back down to the body to basically suppress to prevent outof control inflammation and so it's thought that these drugs perhaps have an anti-inflammatory effect that explains some of that um sounds like the patent on these drugs just got extended by another hundred years that's a that's a that's a bio uh Pharma joke I mean just to put context on it um drugs can be patented and sold as a commercial version and not as generic versions until the patent runs out unless companies are able to find another um approved clinical use in which case it can be remarketed only as a um brand name not generic version so a lot of companies once they do the uh safety testing and uh and all given everything they put into the R&D into the research and development there's a very big incentive to not necessarily find new drugs but finding new uses for the same drugs and not allowing generic versions into uh into the picture and that's why it's likely to be based on these um uh what sounds like additional uses of um OIC related compounds a long time before there's generic OIC available I I think it will be a while I don't know the exact status of the patents but I'm guessing it's going to be a while before there are generic versions but there's a lot of competition coming so every major pharmaceutical company almost every major pharmaceutical company now has a gp1 program really and uh some of them are really exciting actually um so so I mean the general Trend in this area is what people call glp1 plus which means you take The glp1 Agonist which is already giving you 15% weight loss or so and then you add additional things to that to give it additional properties so one compound is from Eli Lily which makes this other so there's this other drug on the market that we haven't talked about but tepati which is know as mojarro for diabetes and zap Bound for obesity which is even better really in almost every respect a better drug than than OIC um so people lose more weight so it's about 21% weight loss at a year um fewer side effects um at least at comparable doses that seems to be because this this other drug uh tepati um it has two Targets not one so so whereas whereas OIC is just um gp1 receptor Agonist tepati is a dual Agonist of glp1 and this other in that we talked about Gip Gip and it seems like having that Gip agonism actually EXs as an anti nausea effect that sort of counteracts some of the nausea caused by the gop1 in the area Posta there are Gip receptor neurons in the area Posta this nausea Center to sort of allows you to crank up the dose of the gp1 agonism even further while you're suppressing the nausea and just get even more weight loss so now talking about the future things that aren't available yet but will be in the next couple years so Eli Lily the company that makes this drug chatid muaro um they have a triple Agonist that's in phase three clinical trials now so this is now three hormones in one it's the glp1 which all these drugs have the Gip which is the anti-nausea component and then glucagon itself and so these these three hormones all combined in one pill and what the glucagon does is it increases energy expenditure this is a well-known effect of glucagon and um so you're basically eating less your nausea is as bad and now you're just burning more calories at Baseline the results from this strug are incredible so basically um there's been one phase 2 trial published and people lost 25% of their body weight at the end of the of the uh uh uh I think it was 48 we period and they were still losing weight so we don't know where the end point we don't know what the what the maximum is so there are bigger Longer trials going on now to figure that out but but at that point when you get Beyond 25% body weight you're talking about basically bariatric surgery right which is currently the best thing we have you know like these these surgeries people people do qu stomach staple removing a portion of the stomach removing a portion of the gut so really it's a pharmacologic version of bariatric surgery the other one that I think is really exciting there's this compound from Amgen it's called just right now it's just a code it's like AMG 133 but um it's like tepati in the sense that targets both glp1 and Gip so it's a dual dual dual uh targeted but unlike tepati which activates the Gip receptor this amen compound inhibits it and for reasons that people don't understand either activating or inhibiting this receptor causes you to lose weight so still a mystery lot of debate about what's going on there but the way this Amgen compound activates um the uh Gip receptor or inhibits the Gip receptor rather is that uh it's an antibody so all these other things were peptides but this is a much bigger sexual protein this is an antibody and because it's an antibody it has a much longer lifetime even than something like semaglutide which is 7 days so it last a month in the blood or something and so you can give people monthly injections of this and they lose dramatic amounts of weight and then at least in this initial trial um at the end of this they stopped and people maintained the weight loss for 6 months that's impressive potentially because of the long-lasting effects of this antibody or potentially because of other things that we don't understand so and those are just two there's all sorts of other crazy things happening so really I think it's just it's just created this explosion of of interest in Pharma um once basically it's one of these things you know it's you know once you see that something can be done all of a sudden that changes everyone's perspective and so now obesity drug Discovery has gone from something that 10 years ago everyone wanted to stay away from because there were so many nightmare stories about drugs that turn out to be not safe till now everybody's sort of Allin on this yeah I remember in college the fenfen debacle where a diet drug was released and people had cardiac issues start dying so it was pulled from market and then it was essentially a quiet field for a long time in part to bring us back into the brain and in part because it's directly relev to what we've been discussing um about OIC and glp1 um there are other neurons in the brain that regulate feeding um and there are other peptides involved in appetite control for which I would say Niche communities have started to indulge in um and by the way people were taking glp1 analoges long before they were FDA approved in kind of Niche communities these aren't communities I'm a part of but every once in a while I'll stick an ear into one of these communities and hear what people taking and a big thing right now um in these communities is the use of other peptides um that are in the melanocyte simulating hormone pathway and you mentioned melanocortin um receptor containing neurons um could you tell us a little bit about what these neurons do um in the absence of any pharmacologic stimulation and then why it would be that uh people would uh perhaps um stimulate these Pathways um with these drugs not that we're recommending that but I do think that um given that some of these neurons are also involved in sexual behavior and FDA approved for the treatment of um hyposexual function in women um things like that you know there is FDA approval for for some of these compounds that they're interesting hypothalamic neurons that are starting to gain more attention and that I predict based on their potential involvement in uh feeding appetite and weight control are likely to enter the picture uh with more prominence um in the not too distant future so Alpha msh as scientists call it the hormone you were just referring to is um is a product of uh Palm the Palm C Gene so in the same way that we just talked about glucagon can be processed into different things in some Gene in some in some cells it's made into the glucagon hormone and other cells is made into gp1 pal C that that Gene can be processed to produce different hormones and one is Alpha msh which is very important for feeding control and so these these Palm C neurons they're in the aru nucleus of the hypothalamus same region where these agrp neurons I talked about earlier are located and there's sort of these these these two uh uh uh these two sets of neurons that have opposing effects on body weight regulation and so Alpha msh inhibits food intake and arrp neurons promote food intake um and where they converge is is at this receptor the melanocortin 4 receptor um which is uh uh important for body weight regulation and so Alpha msh is an Agonist it turns on that receptor and the arrp peptide is an antagonist it turns it off um and so you know there's a lot of human genetics as I as I mentioned earlier implicating this pathway in uh body weight regulation there have been a lot of efforts um over many years to turn Alpha msh into a drug um and it's been very difficult um there is one drug that's now approved it's called I think I'm going to get the name wrong it's like set MTI or something like this um it's an mc4 receptor Agonist um it's mainly used relatively small populations of people that for example have mutations in this pathway it's not used as a widespread as as as a drug and the challenge has been um really side effects so um there's an increase in blood pressure that happens sometimes with these medicines partly because the this pathway controls not only appetite but also autonomic tone and sympathetic nervous system activation um uh so you know it's just taking a step back from everything we've talked about today um I talked about this the short-term system and the long-term system that controls energy balance and body weight the long short-term system in the brain stem the long-term system in the hypothalamus the long-term system being leptin and Alpha msh and agrp when I was coming up learning about this stuff 15 years ago 20 years ago um you know it was uh the Dogma was you could only affect body weight through the long-term system by manipulating the long-term system because any manipulation you did of the short-term system in the brain stem the animal would would just compensate and there were these famous experiments where they would take cck which is a hormone just like gp1 inject it into rats inject it several times a day and cck is known to decrease the size of meals and it would decrease the size of meals but the rats would never lose any weight because they just eat more meals to compensate and they would just perfectly compensate by eating more meals and so the lore was it's just impossible the animal will always compensate unless you hit this body weight set point regulating area which is the hypothalamus the long-term system um but then what the pharmaceutical industry discovered which I guess maybe shouldn't be so surprising but I guess it was to some people is that if you just hit that receptor that short-term system 24 hours a day 7 days a week and never let it stop then you will lose weight right and so the short-term system alone is enough to cause body weight regulation on the other hand the long-term system with Alpha msh and and arrp neurons and pomy and all this stuff has been a challenge to pharmaceutically Target um because you know leptin we discussed didn't really work um and so I think there's going to be as as you mentioned a reemergence of interest in considering this other pathway now that we've seen the the the success of the of the gp1s and I think one area where it may emerge is um in considering their combination perhaps at different stages of weight loss so perhaps you know what would make a lot of sense scientifically I don't know if it'll work in practice is that you would take a gp1 drug to lose the weight and then at some point you might stop that drug and switch to a a more hypothalamus Center leptin based drug to keep the weight off so basically use the gp1 drug to force yourself to lose the weight and then use the leptin hypothalamus based drug to sort of say okay this is our new body weight set point let's not resist this weight loss that's happened whether that will actually make sense practically it's hard to say because you know the gp1 drugs have just a lot of benefits even Beyond weight loss so people might not want to stop taking them um but that's one idea very interesting I'd love to talk about dopamine sure we hear so much about dopamine being involved in pleasure I like to think I've had at least a small level of impact act in convincing people that it's also involved in perhaps mostly involved in things like motivation different forms of learning and lots of other things too folks dopamine does lots of things it's even expressed in the eye and controls adaptation to light so does lots of things but it certainly is believed that dopamine is involved in our either craving for food or pleasure from food what's the real story on dopamine as it relates to food and eating Behavior you had a beautiful paper publish in nature entitled and we'll put a link to this in the show note captions uh dopamine subsystems that track internal States um and I love this paper for a variety of reasons but if you could give us the high points of of your discoveries on dopamine as it relates to feeding I think um I know in fact that people would find it very Illuminating sure fantastic um so uh yeah the question of what dopamine does with respect to feeding is a great question and a difficult question I think to answer there's a lot of miscon conceptions I think um the evidence is dopamine probably isn't so much involved in the pleasure of food that taste that's some The honic Experience um one reason we think this is because you can make mice the Richard paler did this decades ago that don't have any dopamine and they still show the same sort of effective responses to food so you put something sweet in their mouth they kind of they like it right um what dopamine seems to be important for with respect to food is two things um one is the motivation to engage in work to get food particularly when it's high levels of effort so um if you ask a mouse to press a lever to get a pallet of food uh if it doesn't have any dopamine it won't do it and if it has low levels of dopamine it'll just work a little bit so you dopamine is important for sort of energizing action and and motivating you to engage in hard tasks the other thing that dopamine is really important for is learning and it's important for learning about which cues predict something useful for the body and feeding is a Central example of that and and what that paper of ours is about is the idea that this learning actually happens on two different time scales for two different kinds of cues so what we almost always talk about with dopamine and learning which is important is learning about how external qes in the environment predict something like food availability right so you see a McDonald's sign and you know that uh that means there's some tasty food in in in there and so dopamine is is is involved in that process of sort of learning what what that external Q means and that's a very fast time scale process so in the laboratory um for example we will play a tone and then give an animal a sip of a of a solution that has calories in it for example and and it can learn the association between that tone and that food is going to be available if they're separated by a few seconds but that's all and that that's a dopamine dependent process um but there's a second sort of much slower time scale learning about food which isn't about where I go to get a hamburger but rather about what the experience of eating the food the Oro sensory experience its taste its flavor its texture how that relates to the post-ingestive effects and I should say that this seems extremely relevant to the McDonald's example because um in your experimental situation the tone is analogous to the golden arches of the McDonald's sign but in my experience uh and forgive me but most of the food that I've consumed from McDonald's does not taste good um relative to other like really delicious hamburgers or french fries or something like that I mean it's um so you're saying dopamine is required to link the signal the golden arches or the tone to the presence of food at a particular location exactly but not to the experience of pleasure from that food exactly which squares very well with my experience of McDonald's and I probably haven't had a bite of McDonald's in 20 plus years I would have to be pretty hungry I haven't either and I it's funny the Golden Archers thing is just something that people in Neuroscience talks about dopamine use and so now I've started subconsciously just talking about golden arches even though I also haven't eaten McDonald's in decades in and out burger better tasting uh from what I understand probably better sourcing we're not going to get into all this in detail but everyone has their preferences but um but I do think it's interesting because what we're talking about here is related I think to this notion of Highly processed food packaging the commodation of food just the idea that we are drawn to food for things other than the taste that we expect for there's all this context that's right so I think an an important distinction that people make is the distinction between wanting and liking I don't know if you've talked about this previously on the podcast an lmy my colleague at Stanford came on the podcast talked about dopamine is about wanting as opposed to enjoying exactly so in most cases yeah so liking is this the subjective honic pleasure in the moment of eating it but wanting is just it's what you want and these can be uncoupled all the time you could want things that at the end of the day you don't actually enjoy it when you get it I feel like a lot of life is like that indeed and and so uh and so um and so dopamine is very powerful at making you want something but not necessarily like it so that's one element but then there's this other element that that that is important but very much less studied but I find much more interesting which is how you connect this this the sensory cues associated with food its taste its flavor um its smell uh with the consequences for the body and this is so important because um so much of whether we like or dislike a particular food or drink is related to its post-ingestive effects you come to like things for example that have calories so this is one of the reasons that adults will eat vegetables and other Savory Foods that children find disgusting even though they're a little bit bitter you learn through experience this makes me feel good to eat this and even maybe at a completely subconscious level there's also a level of learning that occurs um and this of course happens with other things like coffee and beer and other things like that and so there's been an idea that this this other much slower learning occurs and the reason I say it's slower is because because the time between when you taste the food and when it actually gets into your intestine and releases the the hormones that might drive this is quite slow separated by tens of minutes um but how that works hasn't been clear there's been an idea that dopamine might be involved um but it hadn't really received a lot of attention and so we set out to investigate what is the role of dopamine in these post-ingestive responses and sort of map out for the dopamine system how does the dopamine system respond not when you see the golden arches which is usually the kinds of experiments that have been performed but rather when you deliver nutrients directly to your stomach or when you deliver water directly to your stomach if you're thirsty and so on and what we saw was that there are these different populations of dopamine neurons that are tuned to respond to signals from inside the body and so there are some that respond when nutrients are in the stomach and intestine um there are others that respond when in a thirsty Mouse when the blood is rehydrated when you basically satiate your thirst and we showed that the um the purpose or at least at least a purpose of that activation is to cause you to learn about the effects of what you just ate basically to create this connection between the flavor of something and its post-ingestive effects so that sort of that that delayed dopamine signal uh after ingested food and fluids is sort of reinforcing this connection between the flavor of what I just ate and that it was something good for me one of the sort of interesting things about that paper that was not the direction we initially expected to go in is that um for food I think it's kind of intuitive there are lots of flavors to food you have to learn you know what all these different flavors mean for thirst people find it a little less obvious because thirst is just water aren't you just born knowing what water is like how do you have to learn anything to do with drinking a glass of water but it actually is a learning a learning question in part because for many animals probably most animals thirst is something that's associated with eating not drinking there's this study I love um of rabbits in New Zealand so so you there's not a lot of people studying what animals how they get their fluids in the wild cuz who cares but it's kind of interesting and so in New Zealand uh uh this huge rabbit problem because they're invasive P species that that that was introduced in 1800s and they're just eating all the all the land and so there's lots of money to study rabbits just understand their ecology and so um group of researchers did this experiment where they made this big pen outside where they put a bunch of rabbits in the rabbits couldn't escape but they had all their natural food it was like an outdoor area and they also put a trough of water so the rabits always had access to water just like clean water then they could measure how much water the rabbits drank and what they basically found is that nine months out of a year rabbits drink Zero Water they drink absolutely zero because they get all of their water from food the only time they drink is during the winter when all of the greenery has sort of become shriveled and then they can't get water from that anymore and so it's just kind of interesting aspect of of how many animals are very different from the way we think about ingestive Behavior but but that fact that animals have to get water from food raises this question how do they know which foods are rehydrating that's presumably they have to learn that because you can't just look at a food and say if you've never had any experience oh yeah this is something that's very water rich and this will rehydrate me when I'm thirsty and this one is not and so James the graduate student who led this project uh basically investigated this by uh giving mice different fluids and then measuring how the dopamine response and he showed there was this delayed dopamine response after the mice had drank the fluids uh uh that correlated with rehydration of the blood so a whole bunch of dopam neurons get strongly activated when the blood is rehydrated and he hypothesized this might be a signal this delayed this delayed activation of dopam neurons that allows animals in the wild to learn uh uh uh that food I just ate is is is rehydrating and so he did an experiment where he basically gave them two different flavors mimicking sort of the flavors of two different foods one of which was hydrating and one of which was not and the Animals couldn't tell because he infused the water directly into their stomach and uh he showed that basically uh uh these dopamine neurons are critical for them learning that Association so so that's the story of that I love it and I'll tell you why um when I was in college for reasons that I don't recall I decided to run an experiment on myself where I would eat one meal that was fairly low water content like a piece of meat or something with some cheese you know what some people call a keto meal but I wasn't ketogenic I don't even think I knew what a ketogenic diet was at that point and then the next meal I would have like a salad and some fruits and then I would back and forth and I generally would only eat two or three times a day you know anyway there's only so many hours in the day um and I found it to be incredibly satiating um and I found that I felt great and I can imagine any number of different reasons for that and there are these theories that you probably recall that the the diet that was being um promoted in the 90s where people would either eat carbohydrates or proteins separately like there was some wackiness out there and as I say that I'm sure I'll get assaulted in the comments probably not wacky I'm sure there's some enzymatic basis for why that would be useful if you enjoy it go for it um you know um I I don't have a feeling about it one way or the other but one thing I noticed was that um low water content containing meals um either by virtue of the foods that they include or by virtue of the fact that they're not diluted so to speak um it's a different taste experience to eat those Foods than it is to eat like a big salad or something of that sort um in any event I don't do that any longer I just sort of stopped but it was a fun experiment um and I think it was efficient because at the time I had very low money as a student so you know generally fruits and vegetables were less costly than meats and things of that sort but um in all seriousness um to what extent do you think humans uh overeat or undereat depending on the water content of the food it's an interesting question so you know there is this advice that you should um if you're hungry first drink something drink some water and see if you're still hungry and the idea is that um perhaps uh uh humans can't always I mean we our our interceptive sense our ability to sense what our body needs is not perfect and sometimes we could be confused and we could really be thirsty when we're hungry and hungry when we're thirsty and there's some evidence that that could help um I would say it's probably not a huge effect in most of modern day life but but uh it's an interesting idea mhm yeah um this brings us to the topic of thirst something that your laboratory has worked on extensively and the topic of osmolarity yeah of um salt consumption and things of that sort um in Broad terms how do these things link up meaning are there instances in which what we really need is salt and we end up eating a bunch of Parmesan cheese I got teased Yesterday by my team because occasionally when I'm on the road I I don't like most of the foods available in most airports and stuff so I'll bring a a chunk of really nice parmesan cheese I just break off a piece and eat it I'll have half a cucumber and I'll have a can of um not a can of tuna but they're these wonderful a Jarred filet of Tunas that are available that are in olive oil they taste really good this is not canned tuna it's really good um and I'd rather eat that in most cases until I can get to a decent um meal than like what's put in front of me on an airplane most of the time um so I get teased about this but I notice that for instance sometimes I'll eat the cheese and I think oh actually what I really just want is the salt yeah really want the salt I've been drinking a lot of coffee today i' had a couple extra glasses of water maybe I'm just craving salt and I'm confused and I'm over consuming this cheese yes when in fact what I'm going for is the salt as you point out um our understanding of exactly what we need is fairly crude and oftentimes we overshoot the margin especially when foods are in combination so um salt water and let's just say calories how how do we um accurately or inaccurately um pursue those at the level of biology okay so I was drawing tough questions I but you're your feels like my qualifying exam so um so uh well there are separate system this thought to be separate systems that control salt appetite thirst for water and hunger for calories and so they involve different brain regions for the most part different neurons different signals from the body um in general hunger and thirst are pretty separable the I would say the the the instance where they interact is in phenomenon such as dehydration anorexia this is the idea that if I give you some dry food but I don't give you any water um you're going to eat less food because basically you're going to get dehydrated and you're going to decide I need to preserve my my fluid balance even if I eat less calories um so we prioritize hydration yes you will at some point you will prioritize uh hydration that's related also to the concept of prandial drinking so many animals including humans drink most of their water during meals because you basically want to counteract the osmolites that are in your food um salt balance though and and thirst so the The Thirst for water and the desire for salt are much more tightly linked because um the purpose of both systems is to maintain the composition of the blood At Its Right concentration so you you want to have the right osmolality the blood which you can just think of in simple terms as sort of the the total concentration of all the salts um uh it's a little more complicated than that but it doesn't really matter and uh uh uh you also specifically need to maintain the sodium concentration at the right level and so um uh and there are really powerful innate mechanisms that drive both I think thirst is very intuitive to people you get dehydrated uh you lose water you become thirsty um and uh we know now that that that there are very small set of neurons in a few brain regions that control that um and uh they they the way they they're thought to work is they contain Osmos sensors so they contain same basically these neurons are sensors for the osmolality of the blood and they're activated when the blood osmolality gets too high and it's incredibly sensitive system so so you can perceive an increase in your blood osmolality of 1% as the sensation of thirst so remarkable wow um yeah that's how critical it is to maintain salt balance exactly exactly and so you know you get to 10% increase in Blood osmolality and you're in extreme discomfort and 20% you're like in the hospital so if I took a let's just say a um half an ounce sip of sea water inadvertently yes it's extremely aversive it is it's like like you just you you want to drink some nons salty water some nice clean water yes exactly immediately yeah so I should I should emphasize that there's two components to the fluid homeostasis system to the water homeostasis system one is this desire to drink but the other is of course the kidney and so the reason that drinking the salt water won't put you in a really bad situation is your kidney would then filter out a lot of that salt and cause you just to pee it out and then you'll be fine um and so those two work in Balance the kidney is controlling how much of the salt gets reabsorbed into the blood and then this desire for thirst this desire to drink uh allowing you to replenish the blood with water at various intervals um and so um yeah I mean the experiments led to the discovery of this third circuitry are amazing it was this guy B Anderson working in the 1950s and he just had this hypothesis that there was an Osmos sensor in the brain right which is very I think you know there was some evidence to suggested but it was not really really a strongly supported at the time by the data and so he took these goats and he just started um infusing small amounts of salt into various places in their brain reasoning that if there was an Osmos sensor sorry to I was wild I mean I I wasn't chuckling at ingest like it like I you know I feel for the goats I I feel for everyone involved in that experiment but what a wild experiment just to put salt directly into the brain concentrated saline solution yeah good and he found this tiny region in and around the hypothalamus that if you um if you infuse salt in this region the goats will they'll drink like eight liters of water in five minutes just crazy right and then he and so he read okay this must be the osmo sensor and then he went back and uh stimulated those neurons and just same thing go just drinks like crazy and so now we know there's this couple small regions in around the hypothalamus one's called the sub fornical organ another one's called well it doesn't really matter what they called but basically uh uh uh that have these Osmos sensors one of the interesting things about the regulation of fluid balance is you face some of the same challenges we just talked about with the regulation of food consumption which is that you have this Behavior this ingestive behavior that uh uh leads to replenishment of the body but there are these delays right so if you're thirsty and you drink a glass of water it can take on the order of sort of 20 to 30 minutes for the water to be absorbed absorbed into your blood for the blood to be rehydrated and then for these Osmos sensors that Bank Anderson discovered in your brain to be uh uh to be sort of sense that and return to normal activity but of course if you had the experience of drinking a glass of water you know that you can quench your thirst within minutes right and so how does that work within seconds even so one of the other sort of experiments we did early in my lab was to to ask that question um by basically recording for the first time the activity of these neurons that bank had discovered by putting the salt in the ghost we went back to them now in mice mice have the same neurons you have the same neurons and recording their activity when a thirsty mice drinks and asks what happens and um what we saw was that the neurons don't wait until the blood is is rehydrated um they also don't do what the arrp neurons do is meaning they don't look at the water and predict how much water they're going to drink but instead they get a signal from the mouth which every time the mouse takes a lick of water their activity goes down a little bit and basically they track in that way the volume of water that's passed through the mouth um they also get the signal from the blood relaying the osmolarity of the blood and they compare these two and basically when the mouse is drank enough in order to in order for the animal to predict that the blood osmolality is going to return to normal then the animal stops drinking beautiful yes just beautiful right like the brain is essentially predicting with it sounds like a high degree of accuracy how much water one needs to drink linking it to the the pleasure and uh of ingesting good clean water under conditions where we're thirsty in anticip PA of adjusting blood osmolarity in 20 minutes exactly I mean it's um yeah I mean this is the kind of thing that just it Delights me because it just means the brain as a predictive organ is just is so accurate it also explains some uh some sort of funny aspects of thirst that you may have noticed from everyday experience so so you know one one idea is that just cooling your mouth can sort of quench your thirst right so if you're in the hospital and you're not allowed to drink any fluids they'll give you ice chips to suck on to sort of quench your thirst so why is that and so one idea is that perhaps because water is usually cooler than your body that sensation of water pass it always cools your mouth and so you learn or maybe it's a Nate that just cooling of my mouth means that basically I'm going to be rehydrated so Chris this was experiment done by grum Chris Zimmerman Chris um did the same thing where he was recording these thirst neurons just put a cold piece of metal on the mouse's tongue and you can see when you do that these thir go down in activity and then you remove the cold piece of metal and they go back up amazing so a lot of these these sort of oddities of everyday experience have to do with how the system is evolved to make the prediction uh about what's going to happen to the body I mean few things are as rewarding as the sensation of drinking really nice clean cold water when one is very thirsty when my lab was in San Diego I used to take my dog um hiking in Palomar Mountain and one day you know I really screwed up he was a Bulldog Mastiff they overheat easily and it was a lot warmer than we thought we ran out of water it was a actually dangerous situation for him we got down to the bottom of the hill thankfully with him still alive and there's this pump that pumps what is I was told with spring water and it came out you know really cold and you could just see him fill back up with life yes I filled back up with life knowing he was filling back up with life and it was it was unlike the the kind of reward that one experiences with food when you're hungry absolutely it's like that that basic critical need for water absolutely um under conditions where you're clearly hydrated is like nothing else it's it's delicious in a way that no food is delicious I would like to actually say something about this so so that distinction you made is really interesting between hunger and thirst so when you stimulate these neurons that make an animal thirsty the mice hate it they will do anything to avoid something that artificially makes them thirsty so we can artificially stimulate these thirst neurons create a state of virtual thirst um they'll lever press hundreds of times to make it stop the same neurons that the neurons I talked about that control hunger the arrp neurons they actually don't so much um they won't really do much of anything to shut them off that raises the question why do the animals eat then when you stimulate the hunger neurons and we think the primary thing that the hunger neuron stimulation does is it make food itself more attractive it makes the food more delicious more of an attractive motivational magnet it makes the experience of eating more pleasurable but it is not itself the most unpleasant State at least the mice aren't willing to do that much whereas for thirst I think you know dehydration and thirst is really just unpleasant and animals just want to avoid that and so I think that distinction is is is very real I think there are two different motivational mechanisms for hunger and thirst hunger is mostly about the reward of food thirst is mostly about this is just really unpleasant and removing that unpleasant exactly and you had a paper which I was going to ask you about so I will entitled The forbrain Thirst circuit drives drinking through negative reinforcement yes um and I'm guessing that paper illustrates exactly the point you just made so it's a forbrain circuit um so does that mean that there's some elements of learning and cognition around this or are we broadly speaking about the for brain for instance the hypothalamus being in the in the for brain so yeah it's interesting um so so The Thirst circuit for whatever reason is mostly in the forbrain so um the neurons that so we talked about the NTS and the area Posta being important for hunger and sign signals from the gut those are the a arosta is a circumventricular organ meaning it's outside the blood brain barrier there's only a couple of these in the brain the neurons that control thirst are located in the two circumventricular organs in the forbrain one is called the sub fornical organ the other one is called the ovlt but they're just acronyms but um so why it evolved to have The Thirst neurons more in the forbrain and the the neurons that sense nutrients more in the hind brain is a little bit unclear and so there is definitely an element of learning but um a lot of this is those neurons are also just directly sensing the blood and sensing changes in in both the concentration of salt in the blood and then also hormones like Angiotensin the drive thirst I was going to ask you this earlier but it seems appropriate to ask now a colleague of mine at Stanford in the psych ology Department uh Dr Ali crumb who studies mindsets um has done some interesting experiments where people are told that a given milkshake is calorically dense other people are told that a milkshake is calorically sparse um both groups independently consume the milkshake um and then they measure things like um hormone responses in the bloodstream that are associated with satiety and and what she finds is that um even hormone responses um to the same Shake meaning the same amount of calories fat sugar Etc can be significantly modulated based on what we're told mhm um and it extends into some other perhaps even more interesting areas in my opinion whereby if people are told that let's say a given meal that has a small piece of fish uh serving a vegetables and a a carbohydrate is yes perhaps a little bit calorically sparse compared to what one would normally eat at a given meal but they're told this is a highly nutritious meal this is good for you yes then just that mere knowledge can drive more satiety better feelings about the meal even I believe I have to double check on this but as I recall a heightened sense of of it tasting really good so humans are very um susceptible to the in this case the either inaccurate in the case of the milkshake experiment or accurate descriptions of food meaning they shape our our perception of whether or not something is good for us tastes good or not and whether or not it leads to more or less satiety um and I think this is important given the Obesity crisis you know to say nothing of these drugs that are coming out uh whereby people often associate dieting with deprivation and pain but if they understand that certain foods are nutritious that can at least partially offset some of the um pain of caloric restriction what are your thoughts on on that yeah um well I one thing I've been talking about is how a lot of these circuits are anticipatory they're making predictions they're trying to estimate what's happening in the future and I talked about how these arrp hunger neurons how they can sort of see the food or get input about the sight smell of food and in that way predict how many calories the mouse is going to eat but I mean this is a mouse right this is all based on a mouse and a mouse has you know a thousand times fewer n than you do as a person right so the computational capacity that the human brain has to make these predictions um is just vast compared to these and these mice are already doing amazing things right so when you think about then what is the human brain able to do in terms of anticipating changes in nutritional State and how information that you're given can change uh uh uh the expected physiologic outcomes I mean you're right I mean there's there's there's just this whole other element that it's very hard to study because it's happening in the brains of humans and we can't do these kinds of experiments um but I'm sure that's very important I mean so I talked a little bit about about these flavor nutrient conditioning experiments these are the experiments where essentially an animal learns to uh uh uh consume a certain flavor because it learns it's going to be associated with nutrients later sort of the Paradigm for how you learn to consume bitter vegetables because they're good for you and you get nutrients so people have also done those experiments in humans and that does work but what they've discovered is it's very sensitive to what you tell the humans about the thing that they're going to consume so if you put nutritional labels where you show the different numbers of calories then basically they sort of adjust their expectations and nothing happens so it really has to be that sort of it's very sensitive to to what what information you give them before the the experiment happens so uh uh I think that's an example of that kind of thing without any pressure for it to be prescriptive um how do you approach eating um given the knowledge that you have about food I like to assume that you can sit down to a meal and not think about your agrp neurons too much or any of that but given that you have deep knowledge in this um has it shaped um kind of how you think about food cravings your own you don't have to reveal what those are even if they exist um how you uh observe the eating behavior of others um and yeah what how has knowledge uh shaped your your feeding Behavior well I try not to think too much about my agrp neurons when I'm eating because I would hope I would hope I think it gets it gets um I think you know the circuitry is so complex and we're just beginning to see what's happening so I wouldn't I wouldn't use that kind of information at this stage in we're just beginning too prescriptively but I think I think there is a set of you know basic recommendations from physiology and Neuroscience very simple things you've probably talked about with people on your podcast before um for sort of shaping your diet to be healthier to limit food intake so um one we've already talked about is limiting consumption of ultra processed food eating more Whole Foods for lots of different reasons um because it's they're more satiating because they're don't have this sort of engineered palatability that causes you to overeat another big one which I'm sure you've talked about with some of your guests is is protein consumption making sure you get adequate protein consumption both because there's this concept of protein leveraging so if you don't eat a minimum amount of protein that's going to cause you to eat more calories just to try to achieve that minimum amount of protein also just because protein's more satiating and also because there's this idea ofer effect of food and so you basically burn more calories metabolizing protein than sugar or fat how about consumption of fluids um during meals you know you I've heard it said before that um you know we're not supposed to consume too many fluids because it's going to dilute the enzymes that that allow us to digest our food I've heard other people say that's complete um I think that's I've never that's a myth I think I mean I think um drinking water I mean so humans don't have a perfect capacity to determine whether they're hungry or thirsty and so drinking water will ensure your you're not eating because you're hung uh because you're thirsty um and uh so and there's there's no idea of diluting it I don't think that and you distension itself even even though water provides a very limited distension signal the expansion of your stomach and intestines is one important way that you that you uh terminate feeding and so um and so there is some component of that where you can get distension just from drinking water I say sorry I blur it out interesting because I didn't realize that a fluid consumption um only provides a limited signal for dis it's not fluids it's water and so the idea is that that you can fill your stomach up with fluids but the rate at which fluids empty out of your stomach depends on their calorie content so basically if you drink water it empties very rapidly into your intestine and then goes through your intestine is gradually absorbed if you drink something like a glass of orange juice it will empty much more slowly and if you drinking something that's really high in fat really high in calories it'll empty extremely slowly over hours and that's because there's a negative feedback loop from the intestine that controls gastric emptying so as those first nutrients leave your um uh stomach and enter your intestine that produces hormones that go back and then slow down the rate of gastric emptying and the purpose for this is that you don't want nutrients entering the intestine too fast that's really unsafe it feels very unpleasant and uh it's just your your intestine can only metabolize nutrients so fast and so if there's calories then it slows down gas scamping a lot but water just kind of goes through what a beautiful system like there's regulation at at every point right hypothalamus brain stem got a rate of emptying based on the difference between water and orange juice it's just awesome yeah and that's part of the reason I think it's so hard to outsmart the system right because you know these you know these neurons are making predictions based on the sight and smell of food but then the gut is doing its own thing it's calculating it separately and relaying that information so at every step there are these checks basically they are just confirming that what you thought happened the first time is actually what's really going on and so and it's which makes sense because it's so important for survival these homeostatic systems are the product of you know so much natural selection which I think at least partially explains why thousandfold increases in peptide hormones like glp1 are required to see significant long- lasting changes in weight exactly um because the system is so strongly regulated exactly exactly it's hard to beat homeostasis and hard to beat it safely but it sounds like you're more or less optimistic about where that whole field of of um let's call it anti-obesity drugs is headed I'm very optimistic I mean I think look I me I think that it's you couldn't have asked for more so far at this stage with these with these glp1 drugs um incredible uh weight loss unexpected health benefits really safe as far as we can tell I mean there it's always possible that some new uh some new side effect will emerge but these drugs are millions of people and they've been in a lot of people for a long time now and nothing seems to have shown up so um I'm very optimistic and I think even beyond that just now that the pharmaceutical industry is reinvigorated to investigate this question there's so many different people are going in five years people have so many different options it won't just be OIC or mro there will be five different 10 different drugs that they can choose from um that have slightly different side effect profile slightly different efficacy perhaps used for people with slightly different metabolic conditions um and so it'll really be a whole pallet of of medicines you can take that will adjust your physiology and hunger and it's amazing how well it um squares with the understanding of the basic biology you know and um and that's a perfect opportunity for me to uh really just say what uh is in my mind and clearly in the minds of everyone listening and and watching which is thank you so much for this absolutely encyclopedic and exceptionally clear explanation of feeding and thirst and salt regulation and these new drugs that are you know in everyone's minds and everyone's hearing about um I've learned so much today I know everyone else has uh you run a incredible laboratory I've tracked your career for a very long time every paper is is spectacular and you're in a very competitive field and you've contributed in enormous ways to our understanding of these important processes and I don't just say that as a formality I I know that to be true given that we you know um are from the same field and uh have known each other for a long time and I'm familiar with your work at at a at a deep level um today is just been an absolute uh privilege and and a gift to learn from you and um I know everyone feels the same way so thank you for taking time out of your busy research schedule and the other important areas of your life to come here and educate us all I learned so much basic and practical knowledge and I know uh everyone else did as well thank you so much thank you this has been really fun I'm really glad we had a chance to do this we talked about some of my favorite topics so it's always a pleasure and talk with another neuroscientist about these things is fantastic so well please come back again um meanwhile thanks for everything you do all right thanks thank you for

Don't make it like, "We're going to take away all this stuff from you. Ha ha ha, now you have nothing to do." Make it more like, "I'm not trying to hurt you here. I want you to have fun the way I did and the way your grandparents did. We all had human childhoods full of adventure. I want that for you." And I think most Gen Z will embrace that. They just don't want to do it alone. So the key is, if you're listening to this podcast and if you have kids that are in elementary and middle school, be sure to talk with the parents of your kids' friends. So if you want to make some changes in your phone policies, if four families do it together, now your kid's not going to feel left out or deprived and be sure to give them something. Give them, say, "Here, you know what every, how about every Friday? Let's call it Free Play Friday. No piano lessons on Friday. No nothing on Friday." Fridays, you all get together. You can start at anyone's house. Go out, do what you want. We'll give you, you know, we'll give you more allowance or we'll give you money to spend, but go have experiences. Then it's fun. It's not deprivation.

Title: Dr. Jonathan Haidt: How Smartphones & Social Media Impact Mental Health & the Realistic Solutions
Published: 2024-06-10 12:00:38 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. Jonathan Haidt, Ph.D., professor of social psychology at New York University and bestselling author on how technology and culture impact the psychology and health of kids, teens, and adults. We discuss the dramatic rise of suicide, depression, and anxiety as a result of replacing a play-based childhood with smartphones, social media, and video games.
 
He explains how a screen-filled childhood leads to challenges in psychological development that negatively impact learning, resilience, identity, cooperation, and conflict resolution — all of which are crucial skills for future adult relationships and career success. We also discuss how phones and social media impact boys and girls differently and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of how smartphones alter basic brain plasticity and function. 
 
Dr. Haidt explains his four recommendations for healthier smartphone use in kids, and we discuss how to restore childhood independence and play in the current generation. 

This is an important topic for everyone, young or old, parents and teachers, students and families, to be aware of in order to understand the potential mental health toll of smartphone use and to apply tools to foster skill-building and reestablish healthy norms for our kids.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Jonathan height Dr Jonathan height is a social psychologist and professor at New York University he is also the author of several important bestselling books including the codling of the American mind and more recently the anxious generation how the Great reor IR iring of childhood is causing an epidemic of mental illness and today we talk mainly about the anxious generation however it is not a purely pessimistic conversation indeed Dr height offers several Clear Solutions to the Mental Health crisis that now exists and that we have all created through the use of smartphones in particular in kids entering and transitioning through puberty during today's episode we discussed so-called critical or sensitive periods for Social Development for the development of an understanding about competition and violence about sex and how boys and girls are impacted differently by smartphone use and the specific solutions that do exist and that Dr height has created that can place boys and girls as well as young adults back on the trajectory of mental health so today's discussion is really one that brings together an understanding of neurobiology psychology social psychology and technology in ways that are designed to serve the most critical members of our species meaning Our Youth and for those that have already gone through youth today's discussion is also relevant to you because as many of you know and perhaps have experienced most everybody nowadays is challenged in some way by smartphones both for the utility and the ways in which they can diminish our social and family interactions academic performance and more so thanks to Dr height today's discussion really is a solution-based one and it's one that is sure to educate inform and Inspire specific positive action before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Helix sleep Helix sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are customized to your unique sleep needs now I've spoken many times before on this other podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation

the incredible impact that light can have in our biology now in addition to sunlight red light and near infrared light have been shown to have positive effects on improving numerous aspects of Cellar and organ Health including faster Muscle Recovery improv skin health and wound healing even improvements in acne reducing pain and inflammation improving mitochondrial function and even improving Vision itself what sets juv lights apart and why they're my preferred red light therapy devices is that they use clinically proven wavelengths meaning it uses specific wavelengths of red light and near infrared light in combination to trigger the optimal seller adaptations personally I use the ju handheld light both at home and when I travel it's only about the size of a sandwich so it's super portable and convenient to use I also have a ju whole body panel and I use that about three or four times per week if you'd like to try ju you can go to juv SP jv.com huberman ju is offering an exclusive discount to all huberman lab listeners with up to $400 off select ju products again that's ju jv.com huberman to get $400 off select ju products and now for my discussion with Dr Jonathan height Dr Jonathan height welcome thank you Andrew I'm a longtime listener i' I've develop many good habits because of you thank you thank you you look very healthy and um delighted to have you here I'm a longtime fan of your work I've read the cuddling of the American mind it's an incredibly important book The anxious generation incredibly important book I'll just start off with an easy question which is how are we doing as a species ah how are we doing as a species well as a species as one of my friends said you know we're going to be pretty hard to kill off we'll be like cockroaches and you know we're pretty inventive in that way uh but as a civilization I think we might well be at a point of there are Peaks and valys and there are some Cycles in history and we uh may be at one of those turning points and uh it's going to be pretty unclear what happens over the next five or 10 years um it's a very interesting time to be a social scientist I'll just leave it at that I suppose we can't point to any one factor but we wouldn't be sitting here today you wouldn't have written in the anxious generation and it wouldn't be having the incredible impact that it's having were it not for the fact that smartphones have dramatically profoundly changed the way that we interact as a species in fact a colleague of mine at Harvard Jeff lickman who's world famous for neuroplasticity said a few years back you know this is probably the first time in human history that humans have written with their thumbs implying that the brain representation of the thumbs is probably very different in all of us um than it was uh prior to that because the brain is an Adaptive map of of our experience in many ways that's a somewhat innocuous example of the changes that have occurred the use of the digits uh the thumbs uh to write but there's so much more going on now as a consequence of smartphone so if you were to say the day the date the year in which everything changed would it be the day that most everyone had and has a smartphone um somewhere around 2010 2011 2012 or did all this start prior right yeah well actually if it's okay with you I'll answer that by giving sort of the the history because the short answer would be 2010 to 2015 but it'll make more sense if I just sort of go through how we got there so changes in technology when you connect people more you get roads you get telephones these things are all great um they lead to massive gains in knowledge productivity yes sometimes they're disruptions but in the history of humanity they've been great um the internet was that when you know you and I are old enough to remember do you remember the first time you saw a web browser I do and it was like you mean I just like I type in a question and I get the answer I don't have to go to the library it was I mean it was miraculous um and and I can talk to people for free and we had that by email which was free so in general Connecting People is good and we were all very optimistic about the internet in the 1990s it was amazing and in our conversation today I want to make it very clear the internet is absolutely amazing this is not about how the internet is bad um smartphones or the iPhone you know is absolutely amazing although there are some things about it that are problematic it's really especially social media which has changed things and so um if we if we look at a kid let's take a teenager in 2010 and let's say January 2010 at that point there's no Instagram there's no front-facing camera um they all have mostly they have flip phones the iPhone came out in 2007 uh but they don't mostly have them so in 2010 most teenagers are using the flip phone as a tool to call each other call each other text each other meet up so when technology helps us achieve our goals that's good by 2015 everything's different by 2015 the great majority of Americans certainly teens have a smartphone with a front-facing camera the girls are mostly on Instagram which was the first social media platform that you had to be on a smartphone for everything else was web based um they have High-Speed Internet unlimited texting and now it's possible to spend 10 15 hours a day on your phone you nobody could do that with a flip phone so I I point to that it's that five-year period 2010 to 2015 which I've called the Great rewiring of childhood because it affects everything everything about what children and teenagers are doing I can recall in 2010 I was actually in New York City visiting friends I got my first smartphone and I recall I was up at 1:30 in the morning m scrolling on this thing and thinking this is unbelievably addicting yeah nowadays I think of it less as addicting but almost um like an an OCD of sorts and here I'm not talking about clinically diagnosed OCD but the interesting thing about OCD is that the compulsions the behaviors don't serve to reduce the obsessions rather they exacerbate them or reinforce them and in many ways I feel like smartphone use and social media use in particular is a OCD of sorts it's not just habit it's not just an addiction it's an obsessive compulsive Loop so it's already a struggle to pay attention and you know ancient Traditions have have taught techniques to improve your focus your attention we're easily distracted and um you know so I don't work on my phone very much because I I hate to type on the phone and and I'm always at a computer but even for me sitting at my computer as soon as the thinking gets hard as soon as if I'm writing if I'm doing something that requires concentration some little part of my brain says I wonder what the weather's going to be and I go check the weather or you know oh did I get any email I go check my I might check my email you know probably 40 50 times a day and I know that's terrible so the question is is it a compulsion where I feel pulled I have to check it or something bad will happen no it's more like imagine trying to do your work imagine trying to be a kid in school and you have on your desk in front of you you have your television set your record player a walkie talk to talk to your friends a guitar a painting set all array in front of you and your teacher is telling you about you know geometry what are you going to do probably one of these things and so I think the smartphone where a flip phone it's it's a tool you pull it out if you want to talk to someone then you put it away but the smartphone there's no reason to ever put it away talk to us about the scary statistics there's just no way around this yeah and we will talk about Solutions you offer some incredible Solutions in the book actually solutions that everyone listening and watching can participate in not just by restriction and we'll talk about what that means uh going forward but where are we at now and when did we start to see the trend toward diminish mental health in particular in girls yeah so feel free to hit us with the with the scary truth okay sure so let's imagine so in the US we have really good statistics based on annual or biannual surveys there's three or four big ones that allow us to see what's happened since the 70s and so what I'd like listeners to imagine is imagine a bunch of lines maybe a line for boys maybe a line a line for boys line for girls showing the percentage that suffer from anxiety depression or that have self harm those three really go together and imagine these lines they move around a little bit but they're actually pretty stable from the 1990s all the way through 2010 even 2011 there's no sign of a problem on some measures they're getting actually a little bit better because stable and low stable well low you know if it's if they're around say 12 15 % of girls qualify as having had a major depression you know that's much higher than we would like um that's a problem but it's nothing compared to what it is today so the lines are pretty flat until around 2012 and then all of a sudden the lines for girls go up like a hockey stick it's not a subtle thing it really is there's an elbow it's like somebody turned on a light switch in 2012 um now that's for the American data um internationally you see very similar things it's not necessarily 2012 in other countries but the girls graphs are very sharp the boys are also up on depression anxiety they're also way up depending on the measure it's usually everything is in the ballpark of 50 to 150% almost all the numbers are in that range um we're not talking 10 or 20% increases here for most things we're talking close to a doubling especially for the younger girls the boys curves interestingly are smoother that is the boys are more depressed and anxious it's but it's not 2012 it it actually often begins begins more like 2009 2010 and then it just keeps going up gradually so that that's a real clue um which we'll come back when we talk about the the boy story um a lot of people say oh you know it's just self-report um you know just gen Z they're really they're really um positive about mental health and they're willing to talk about it's a good thing but the fact that we see the exact same curves the very sharp uptick for girls um in Hospital admissions for self harm psychiatric emergency Department visits and we see this in the US Canada Australia New Zealand uh the UK um the Scandinavian countries so something happened across the developed World um around 2012 and I keep you know Jee twangy was the first to really raise the alarm she and I keep saying well you know we can't find another candidate nothing else fits the pattern oh and there's actually not just correlational data there's experiment experimental data too so we think you know of course look everything's complicated mental health is complicated if you want to understand why one person is depressed there are going to be many stories but if you want to understand why depression rates Rose for girls faster than boys all over the developed World unless someone can find like some hormone disrupting chemical that was suddenly sprayed over northern Europe and and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012 there is no there is no alternative explanation so we break down smartphone use in these uh young girls that correlates with and maybe is causal for this diminishment in mental health there are a number of different variables right there's the time spent on the phone there's the specific content that they're viewing and that's a vast discussion that we'll get into there are the social dynamics associated with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions and then there's and I can't help myself myself but as a neuroscientist who trained in the biology the visual system there's the effect of looking at something at about 8 in to 12 in away from you for much of the day as opposed to navigating an environment the way that we had for hundreds of thousands of years prior so there are a lot of features within this thing that we call smartphone use right there's also the disruption in sleep yep there's additional blue light exposure there's just so much to it exactly so if we pull all that together for the time being and put it in a basket of smart phone use and maybe we'll we'll pull out each of those variables one by one as we go forward what are the numbers in 2012 in terms of how much time girls maybe you can give us an age range are spending with the smartphone was it they got the smartphone and immediately we're spending six to eight hours a day on the thing or has it been gradual so let's let's start with the time the time variable sure okay so first the way you put it is actually very helpful um what I want listeners to imagine let's say like imagine on the left side of a slide I haven't made this slide I'm formulating in my head imagine on the left side of the slide a whole bunch of harmful changes if you're getting less sleep that's bad if you're having blue light at night that's bad if you're not going out in nature that's bad if you are sedentary if you so so imagine about you know 15 different things oh if you're being contacted by strange men around the world who want to have sex with you like that's not good for 11 12 year old girls so it's all these different potential harms and then imagine all these different potential effects S one of which is depression and another is anxiety another is self harm but there's doing worse in school there's becoming more shallow there's uh conflicts with your so there's a whole bunch and then we want to look at the causal connections and what I'm trying to draw out is suppose you we suppose we could quantify the degree to which sheer time just spending five hours a day does that make you more anxious automatically well maybe a little um but that's probably not the main effect so there's a gigantic multicausal network of effects now um I have good numbers for how much the how much teenss are using these devices and these platforms today um Pew in particular did has done a great job of of tracking changes in this since the ear since the 2000s what we know today from both Pew and Gallup is that young people in America are now spending about five hours a day just on social media just social media most Instagram so it the the huge time suck is the videos so it's actually Tik Tok and YouTube are counted in this analysis they're counted as social media YouTube is marginally social media it's more of an general information Source but the point is especially the short videos the short videos are really really addictive because the time between action and reinforcement is so quick that that as you know in behaviorism like that's the key it's the quick reinforcement um so 5 hours a day uh it's a little bit more than that for girls a little less for boys just on social media 35 hours a week of strange stuff coming in from random weirdos on the internet 35 imagine letting your kid in Port 35 hours um then you add in everything else video games um everything else you do on a smartphone so now we're up to 7 to 10 hours in that range a day and this is not counting school now of course in school six hours a day for a lot of kids two or three hours of of that is screen time as well so that's why I say kids used to have a play based child Hood plays the basic thing mammals do um and since 2010 or 2012 our kids have a phone-based childhood and I don't think that is it's just incompatible with healthy human development maybe we can back up even before 2010 and talk a bit more about the play-based childhood I heard you say last night at a terrific lecture that you gave that when we don't trust our neighbors we are far less likely to let our kids out to play without observ ation or oversight um and that leads to a whole host of negative consequences so if we were to dial back to the the history clock even further and talk about let's say the 1950s 60s and 7s I was born in 75 I basically was kicked out of the house every day to go play my mom would say get out of the house I now realize she wanted space yeah but we would go down the end the street to the culdesac and we would just play and do all sorts of things DED some of were were good um and there were a lot of dynamics that got worked out in that process my sister would go hang out with the basically the older sisters of those boys that's kind of how our neighborhood happened to be arranged that was fortunate um and they would do their thing MH so 1950s and 60s what did social dynamics look like among kids yeah um so you know I think what we you need to do is tell this story of what happened as a as a a tragedy in three acts and the First Act is the loss of of community the loss of trust in each other so if we go back to the the 50s and 60s um but we can even go back my my parents grew up in New York City in the in the 30s and 40s um people spontaneously organize themselves into Villages Village Life is a is seems to be sort of the default way of living that humans have preferred for tens you know you know several thousand years um and it's where you know your neighbors the kids run around the all the adults take part in supervising all the kids uh but nobody has to helicopter because the kids are playing they're doing their thing if there's a real thread if there's a lion or Invaders then they all come running home whatever but um but kids need to be out playing with each other especially Outdoors we evolved in savanas we evolved in different parts of the world we're attracted to Nature um so that's the way it it always was now uh especially if we in the 1950s and 60s America just been through a World War and the greatest way to make people trust each other the greatest way to boost social capital is a foreign attack and of course Pearl Harbor did more for American Co coherence than anything else in history in modern history 911 did that too but only for a little while and then we we lost it um so for a a lot of reasons people trusted their neighbors kids were out playing you know my parents grew up in the depression in New York City the kids were all out playing stickball on the street or in a parking lot in the 1970s there is a real crime wave um crime goes through the roof actually and it goes through the 80s that goes all the way to the early 90s even still you were kicked out of the house to go play um even in New York City all kids went out to play that's just the way it was but we begin to lose trust in each other for a lot of reasons Robert putam wrote about this in Bowling alone the the the the loss of Social Capital many reasons for that the changing media environment air conditioning and television people are not hanging out on their porch in the summertime to get away from the Heat they Clos the door and they put on the AC and they watch TV family sizes are shrinking there not that many kids around so for a lot of reasons by the the '90s is the key decade where act two of the tragedy happens and that's the loss of the play-based childhood so in America and Britain we freaked out about child abduction and child sexual abuse um some of the scandals were real the Boy Scouts the Catholic Church there were cases where trusted organizations were covering up abuse and I recall the abduction thing the carton y thing right and there was a show I think my name is Brian you know about the kid who was abducted and then all he remembered I think it's a true story was that his name was Brian he would just remind himself every night about his real name you know I think they found him eventually in Berkeley mhm not calling out Berkeley I lived in Berkeley for a long time but um seemed to be the discovery of of Abu of abducted kid excuse me in Berkeley uh there are a few other cases there I don't know what that's about um in any of I grew up thinking that you could get kidnapped right yeah which yeah which is so it's I mean it's the most terrifying possibility for any parent um but when I was doing the research for the codling the American mind I found according to FBI statistics there's only about 100 to 150 true kidnappings a year in our whole country because if a child like who would take a child like it's a really difficult crime and you're going to you know who would steal a child from a store you know parents are afraid if your kid goes to the next D on the grocery store they going to be how are you going to take a kicking and screaming kid out of a store um it's and yet sorry to interrupt but the show America's Most Wanted I believe was hosted by a guy whose kid was abducted and eventually found dead exactly Adam that's right right so so there was this propagation of this fear like that one of the deepest fears of any parent I can to imagine is is is that that's right but the point is that these crimes are extraordinarily rare it's almost always the non-custodial parent who takes a kid it's a family member because there's a fight within the family um so we fear the wrong things we're terrified of kidnapping um but locking our kids up overprotecting them has spiked the suicide rate so much that the death toll is vastly higher from the extra suicides than it would be if we could completely wipe out kidnapping which again doesn't but you know you know the availability heuristic we say in Psychology if it's visible if it comes to mind easily then people will freak out about that and that's why people sometimes are afraid to fly in a plane they think a car is safer so so um for a lot of reasons we freak out in the 9s we stop letting our kids out we think they must always be supervised so that's act two of the tragedy and as that act is happening we're keeping our kids inside and guess what these computer things that we started getting in the 80s they're getting interesting because now we hook them up to the internet in the 80s what we can do word star and some primitive video games like but in the 90s you get the internet and now the kids especially the boys the earlier internet was much more of to Boys Boys would take computers apart they could build computers they would learn to program uh so the boys in particular they're okay with losing out on the outdoor play because the the internet is so amazing and nerdom started to become cool revenge of the nerd Steve Jobs and Steve con and I know because I grew up in pal Alto see Steve downtown he had this wasn't really like Rockstar persona but he kind of you know weeded back and forth he was he was an icon kind of like a you know counterculture guy but then he was into design and comp right but it was still really geeky M like the fonts were lame he brought beautiful fonts to it he started bringing the aesthetic forward and then of course girls and women got involved in computers more yes although that really it only really evens out once you get social media um boys are more interested in things and mechanics and and systems girls have a more evolved and and elaborate mental map of social space they're more interested in Social relationships so once you get social media that attracts the girls more and then it comes pretty even that all you know all boys and girls they're just incredibly attracted to the internet and things on the internet um but that sets us up for ACT three which is the great rewiring that's the arrival of the phone based childhood that we just talked about between 2010 and 2015 that's when everything changes as many of you know I've been taking ag1 for more than 10 years now so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast to be clear I don't take ag1 because they're a sponsor rather they are a sponsor because I take ag1 in fact I take ag1 once and often twice every single day and I've done that since starting way back in 2012 there is so much conflicting information out there nowadays about what proper nutrition is but here's what there seems to be a general consensus on whether you're an omnivore a carnivore a vegetarian or a vegan I think it's generally agreed that you should get most of your food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources which allows you to eat enough but not over eat get plenty of vitamins and minerals probiotics and micronutrients that we all need for physical and mental health now I personally am an omnivore and I strive to get most of my food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources but the reason I still take ag1 once and often twice every day is that it ensures I get all of those vitamins minerals probiotics Etc but it also has adaptogens to help me cope with stress it's basically a nutritional insurance policy meant to augment not replace quality food so by drinking a serving of ag1 in the morning and again in the afternoon or evening I cover all of my foundational nutritional needs and I like so many other people that take ag1 report feeling much better in a number of important ways such as energy levels digestion sleep and more so while many supplements out there are really directed towards obtaining one specific outcome ag1 is foundational nutrition designed to support all aspects of well-being related to mental health and physical health if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs with your order plus a year supply of vitamin D3 3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman Okay so we've got three acts all of which are tragedies loss of community right so community and trust is down that's right which then makes us not then act two is we take away the play-based childh because we're so afraid because we no longer trust our neighbors and then act three is as long the kids are are inside and and on on computers already oh well now just a smartphone and a tablet these are just cooler computers nothing wrong with that right and that's what we thought early on in the early 2010s we thought these things were miraculous oh you know if my kids use them maybe they'll be the next Steve Jobs maybe they'll you know they'll be really technically sophisticated we thought and it's not true and now we're in this third Act of the tragedy you touched on some of the male female differences um maybe you could uh talk about those a little bit more so you said girls tend to focus more on social dynamics boys more on systems um I've heard you say that the Boys in general Veer toward more for lack of a better way to put it more on the Spectrum type behaviors could you elaborate on that and how it impacts online um use and the particular sites that they tend to gravitate towards and then on the on the other side uh for girls yeah the the the one of the psychological traits that is the biggest differentiator between boys and girls and between men and women it's it's let me State clearly the sex differences in ability are generally pretty small small and they're few and far between sex differences in interest are all over the place and they're often very large and they're true across cultures and some are true across species um it's it's what do you enjoy and so um and here I'm drawing on the work of of Simon Baron Cohen who's the cousin of Sasha Baron Cohen um in the UK and Baron Cohen's work on autism shows that um um you know because of prenatal effects prenatal testosterone changing the body changing the brain we all start off as girls in utero after conception but then the 10th week of gestation if there's a y chromosome it triggers a little bit of uh a testosterone which then makes the testes develop and then that creates testosterone and all of this the effect on the brain appears to be a shift away a little bit away from empathizing in Baron Cohen's terms there's you can either be a high empathizer or you can be a high systemizer systemizers are people who love Subway men apps and they pick them up quickly and they like programming and they like to see how systems are related it's possible to be high on both but most people are more one way than the other so once you see that now you can understand why this amazing new internet Drew everybody but it drew the boys and the girls to different parts of it uh and so you know metaphor that i' I've started using these days uh I actually did get this from Yasha monk has a a great book called the identity trap and Yasha points out that a trap has to have bait in it that's attractive there has to be something that makes the creature want to go into the Trap and then once they get the bait there has to be something that prevents them from leaving that's what a trap is and uh in this case if you want to catch a girl don't show her like the operating system of a computer don't show her war games show her what Maria just said about Julia uh or what Julia just said about her do you want to know of course you want to know um and everybody does but girls more than boys they want to understand the social dynamics so the girls go rushing into Instagram where everyone's posting photos of themselves of other people of the party they were at the girls go rushing into well social media in general Instagram U Pinterest and um Tumblr were the three big ones the girls went into in the 20 early 2010s and then once they take the bait they can't escape because now that everyone is talking on Instagram let's say if you leave you're alone no you're not going to talk to anyone so that's how you trap girls and that's what happened to girls how do you trap boys what are the things that boys most want to do if you let them do whatever they want what are the two things that really attract them one is War and the other is sex so um if you say do you want to watch you know a movie that has violence in it or you know do you want to watch sports which is play War boys are more likely to say yes or play a first-person shooter game exactly that's right so it's so it's hunting and it's War um and if you can simulate that you know when I was a kid there was the beginning I mean I remember playing Seawolf like you shoot missile you shoot you know Torpedoes at a boat in the distance and it was very primitive technology Battleship yeah oh that's right even Battleship that's right that's right a big deal yeah that's right little plastic boats that's right yeah sinking somebody else's Battleship by by ining where the location of their ships were behind a wall it was so satisfying to sing somebody's Battleship so boys really want to play at War and I really learned this when I was 30 and my I have a group of buddies from college and we get together once a year and one year I hosted in Charlottesville and we we played paintball we went to a paintball place and there were you know about five or seven other other guys and we divided up into teams and we were divided among ourselves on the teams and it was unbelievably thrilling to work with other guys to hunt and shoot my friends and and we came out afterwards all of us and it you know it hurts when you get with the it hurts which is which is important it's actually very important because then you really take it seriously you really don't want to get shot um but it was absolutely thrilling it really felt like like there was a room in my heart um you know as a man there's a room in my heart for war that had never been opened so boys want to play at that and then the multiplayer video games the firstperson shooter games all these things let them do that the other thing of course that boys want to do is look at naked women and so you know it used to be Playboy magazine now it's super hardcore sex with anal sex and gang bangs and and uh you know choking and all sorts of things um so the boys really get that's how trap a boy show them War you know let them play war games and and give and give them sex and once they do that they can't escape so interesting we did an episode long ago on uh sexual development meaning how hormones influence brain development which I spent a little bit of time on for my masters and by the way you got the biology exactly right um and it's fascinating the way that these hormones organize the brain and some people enjoy learning that it's testost testosterone from the testes it's the Y chromosome then the testes and then testosterone that's converted to estrogen that then actually has the organizing effects of mizing the brain there all these flips in biology counterintuitive flips but I like to mention the flips because they normalize the idea that um it testosterone creates maleness and estrogen creates femaleness that's actually not true it's but you got the biology exactly right um but there I was going to add one more thing besides um War violence and sex there seems to be a um an interest by Boys in remote control things absolutely remote action at a distance action at a distance so remote control cars I never had a remote control helicopter would died to get one but remote control car that we built my my dad and I built together that was thrilling absolutely and then when we talk about girls um and and some of the the preferences for certain activities um uh maybe we we'll get into some others but yeah something about remote control um and vehicles generally that's right so there's there's an important psychological word called effectance uh made up by white in the 1950s effectance is the desire to be a cause I had this effect on the world and you know a a 9-month-old infant in the crib when he discovers if I pull this if I hit this a sound happens it's thrilling you did that and this stays with us for life you want to see that the things you do have an effect and especially boys are more in the in the physical world you know mechanical world and so shooting a gun I remember when I was a kid you know I had a BB gun that I bought at a church Bazaar I I hid it from my mother kept it in the closet but my best friend and I you know we set up cans on a row and you shoot them and boom it you know you knock it it's amazing it's thrilling um that does seem to be a sex difference now girls I think now here I'm speculating but girls seem to be more interested in having an effect in the social World um so everybody wants to have an effect but boys are more focused on mechanics girls a bit more on on relationships in the social world and I'm sure um Freud had a field day with this but um what is the apparent I don't have the numbers on this Obsession of of girls and horses and caretaking of animals and and yet there are also a lot of wonderful stories about boys taking care of dogs like I read where the red friend grows maybe 50 times and I love dogs I love taking care of raising my dog but there's there seems to be something about um The Stereotype is girls and horses that's right yeah um well the simple part is uh girls on average are a little bit more compassionate they feel the pain of creatures more boys are more into animal cruelty uh as a fun thing to do an interesting thing to do effective um so girls are are more compassionate girls tend more to want to be a veterinarian than boys do because girls love animals um my daughter was desperate for a pet and we we got her um a leopard gecko when she was about eight or nine they're really cool but she she know she was crying one day cuz she could tell it it's never going to love me you know and she desperately wanted you don't know maybe it'ss no it's a no it's a reptile no they're not they're not mammals they don't have the bond and she was desperate for a dog and she begged for years for a puppy we finally got one she she needed an animal with a she need an animal yeah that's that's well she needed a mammal she needed anamal um now the horse thing that's different I'm not going to speculate on that I have heard some speculation that it's because the the the musculature it's something about you know it it has a feeling of masculinity but I don't know that's veryan I was wondering whether or not I don't want to get I don't even got near that yeah I was wondering um whether or not it was something about the um the healthy requirement for caretaking the brushing the cleaning the the the caretaking of the animal is is pretty elaborate when it comes to a horse my first had a horse she spent more time with that horse than with me and um and the amount of care like if the horse was cing she would literally go sleep with it in the barn you know and it seemed like she um loved the amount of love that was available to give to the animal um yeah anyway I I would put that in a in a giant bucket called biophilia a term that I love from eio Wilson um just that our species you know we evolved in nature we evolved with relationships with animals um and we we cre we seek it out we can fall in love with animals we have relationships um so I think it's a healthy part of life and again it's another area where a phone-based childhood just takes you away from all of that yeah it's interesting this difference between um systems and relationships I was obsessed with Aquaria still am I love I love Aquaria I love freshwater tanks aquascaping is something I plan to get back into um at some point soon but um the most interesting part about it was which fish could go with which MH who would eat who how many plants what the density of fish needed to be in order to maintain the ecosystem as a and how to not get a system crash it wasn't so much about the relationship between the fish or or to the fish that's right so it'd be interesting to see if there's a sex difference on on aquariums whether it's more a boy thing because of the interesting complex you know systems um but you know what I what I'd really like to do with you now as long as we're talking about sort of you know these Developmental Pathways um I'm hoping that we can talk about oh oh Let's do let's stay on sexual development uh because this is something I just have a little section in the book uh in the chapter on boys I have a section where where I review the research on pornography and you know huge amounts of study of pornography over the years um uh but the hardcore pornography high resolution video um boys watching it for you know many boys well a large number of boys um um are are you know go every day to pornography sites often more than once a day um so I'd love to hear your thoughts on how that would you know how is that going to change sexual development during puberty a boy who starts at say at age 12 13 and does it for 10 years could we expect that that boy will be different with when he's 22 his dating life will be different his tell me what you you think is happening there in the brain and socially and hormonally sure absolutely and I'm not going to demonize pornography nor am I going to celebrate it all I'll say is that my understanding of the dopamine reinforcement system and I like to call it a reinforcement system as opposed to a reward system because people generally think that dopamine and dopamine hits relate to pleasure but dopamine is more of a motivator as a neurom modulator it creates a kind of an agitation State want that puts us in a state of focus and foraging to resolve some gap between how we feel and how we'd like to feel by seeking things like sex like food when we're hungry like warmth when we're cold like cool when we're too warm it's a universal currency of pursuit okay of craving and wanting as opposed to having okay dopamine does a lot more than that um and other neuromodulators are involved in wanting and craving but dopamine is Central to that so I think it's not just fair to say but it's a ground truth that whether or not it's a drug like methamphetamine cocaine crack cocaine in particular or some other drug that hits the system fast and creates a big big inflection in dopamine that the more rapid the rise in dopamine the bigger the crash in dopamine afterwards and the more miserable you feel afterwards and the more repeat of the behavior that initiated the peak will occur AKA addiction okay or at least extreme habit formation depending how one defines those when it comes to dopamine the other key thing to know is that dopamine in particular High inflections in dopamine big peaks in dopamine that occur without much effort in particular the kinds of effort that evolved to bring about the the the dopamine release such as courting dating learning your preferences learning the other person's preferences working out issues of discussion consent negotiation Etc when dopamine arrives quickly without effort such as with amphetamine crack cocain or pornography mhm the whole reinforcement Loop becomes wired to these short time scales you want something you want it now and you get it but over time you get less and less of the dopamine Peak and you get more of the dopamine trough that occurs you drop below Baseline afterwards so all of that is a bunch of neurobiological is nerd speak for absolutely the ready availability of pornography at a you know few Taps on the on the phone um no doubt triggers big dopamine the first time requires more and more investment in that behavior to get less and less of the dopamine you never get back to the initial value and you're driven further and further down the pathway of addiction and there's the loss of all the learning right that the brain and and has evolved to learn how to evoke dopamine from I don't want to say just mate Pursuit but it's courtship and eventually sex so and we know that after after ejaculation after orgasm there's a dramatic decrease in dopamine and a huge increase in prolactin what does that do prolactin and dopamine are essentially antagonistic to one another it creates states of quiessence calm it's thought to facilitate pair bonding by keeping mates near one another smelling one another sharing pheromones in fact there's something called the coolage effect we could talk about the sort of classic coolage effect there these you know effects that um have to do with the inverse relationship between dopamine and prolactin but with pornography assuming that boys are masturbating to the pornography and they are doing that to the point of ejaculation then they're getting this kind of quiessence of the system um they're feeling lethargic relaxed maybe depending on their age or their motivation they're doing it again and again but neither the dopamine nor the prolactin are being devoted to anything about courtship and pursuit nor is it in the case of prolactin related to anything Rel related to pair bonding they're just sitting there with their computer in their room and of course this occurred with pornography as you mentioned before classic pornography but when I was growing up if somebody had a penthouse or a Playboy magazine they would often stash it for whatever reason behind a business or something so no one would get caught with it and then you go there like a library it was like a thing you go and it was in places where this is getting a little weird but where people didn't use the pornography there I think they remembered it perhaps um but but they weren't spending a ton of time with it and they weren't taking in fact there was an unspoken rule you didn't take it with you and this is kind of our most kids first exposure to pornography where their dad had a Playboy magazine or something like that so I hope I I described the landscape of the biology well enough but that the short answer is absolutely creates major problems in the dopamine reinforcement system it's training the dopamine reinforcement system for fast reinforcement and diminished reinforcement over time and none of it translates to the real world yes it's not just the content so I guess what we're getting out here here is it's not just what they're seeing as so extreme and that's an issue clearly it's also that the whole process takes you know minutes yeah that's right and it can be repeated over and over depending on the refractory period of um young as opposed to real world dating and relationships which takes effort and it takes learning there's hardly any learning in the use of a drug like methamphetamine or cocaine about how your dopamine system works unconscious learning there's and there's hardly any if any learning about sex and courtship m in pornography and it's also training the dopamine system the whole motivational system around sex to be observational as opposed to participatory and I hear a lot because I'm in the Wellness Health space and I'm a man guys Reach Out by direct message Hey listen I they'll reach out that they're having real issues with erectile dysfunction with anxiety yes and these things always existed but there was a kind of a a learning a communication hopefully some you know slow your breathing down and communicate and kind of get back to a place where you're more comfortable they're not able to translate anything about their experience of sex and pleasure to the real world and as a consequence they're retreating into a world where they view if if they're heterosexual the opposite sex or if they're homosexual the same potential Partners as like these distant foreign objects that they don't understand right wow Andrew thank you that was a really powerful and clear description of what I was trying to say in the book coming just from the psycholog logical side which is um to turn from a boy into a man there's a certain amount of toughening and skill building there's skills that have to be developed and I'm so glad to use the word courtship I use that word a lot with my students I almost I hear almost nobody else using that word it's such an important word uh because we did evolve the ability to parir bond at least temporarily and we do have courtship and it has to start slowly if you jump into bed and have sex right away there's no chance of courtship it's that part is over and um so you know as you were talking I was really trying to I was thinking and I want the you know listeners to imagine imagine one 13-year-old boy um who you know really wants sex would like to have a girlfriend but he has he has a laptop he has a phone he has PornHub um he masturbates two or three times a day uh he'd still like to have a girlfriend but he's sexually satisfied because he has all this amazing pornography um and he does this every day for 10 years until he's 23 let's say and then we have another boy who you know maybe he has a Playboy magazine or maybe he has nothing maybe he just has his imagination he masturbates occasionally as boys do um but he doesn't have the hardcore porn he doesn't have the fast dopamine and then this second boy he puts more effort to actually having a girlfriend and he learns how to talk to girls and he and he he's flirting and one is interested in him um and then they have their first kiss and you know because I'm remembering back when I was you know a teenager in my 20s the most beautiful golden days I mean the most memorable days of my life it was those days when you have that first kiss and you know like oh this this is going to turn into something everything Sparkles after that everything Sparkles but the point is it's slow and it's hard work and then when you finally do have sex you know it's not like oh dopamine crash you know get out of here it's it's as you said it's like ah you know prolactin rise you know you hug you hold you hold the girl um and you know at some point you start thinking about marriage like you start think like is this the one I mean you know crazy thoughts like that you can't help but think that when you're falling in love and I at myu I teach an undergrad course and I also teach an MBA course now the NBAs are all on the dating apps they're in their late 20s they're all on the dating apps the undergrads some of them are on dating apps but they're you know they're 19 they're mostly dating and they in their circles and for the mbas I really have to work with them to see that that the dating apps are cutting off courtship in a lot of ways I mean yes you're texting but it's not the same so um so I'm so glad you explained a lot about that one is the fast it's the fast satisfaction that prevents you from learning where slow hard work towards a biological goal like sex or dating or marriage or love is what builds you up into a competent man who would want to hire or who would want to date let's put it that way who would want to date the kid who'd been masturbating three times a day to porn since he was 13 so yeah yeah yeah and and there's all sorts of things I mean my father's Argentine move moved to the states in in the late 60s and so I was raised in a fairly traditional home the from the perspective of masculine feminine roles um there were all these things around chivalry like I remember going to my first Junior High School dance my dad gave me this whole tutorial about holding the door and how what you know it's interesting that nowadays um guys are often judged in terms of their latency to respond to text messages you know um something I'm terrible at um and it's interesting that that sort of replaced chivalry like how responsive somebody is so there's a kind of a bleeding for it as long as we're we're just being very open about the past present and and perhaps future of this stuff I remember growing up and hearing stories this wasn't how my childhood went but I remember my dad telling me you know in Argentina the young boys when they would hit puberty used to be taken to prostitutes so they would learn how to have sex I that's how I mean that wasn't that long ago that wasn't my childhood and I remember thinking like what's you know is this is this what's going to happen next and but he was explaining that's kind of how it went that doesn't tend to happen anymore as I understand I haven't heard of it happening right but in terms of learning courtship learning chivalry learning um you know who pays and a lot of that's changed with the you know the changing milu of um sex and gender Dynamics but it's all iterative it's slow and iterative and everything about online use as you mentioned is it's fast you can find anything with a keyword search right no work that's right the technology makes everything easier and if we if we end up talking about AI at all which every conversation goes to at some point that's my big fear that AI is makes everything easy now that's great for us adults when we have 50 things we want to do if I can give 30 of them to AI that would be great but you know how many servants do I want my you know my son is now 17 when he was 10 11 12 how many servants would I want him to have to take care of his needs like probably zero like zero is probably the best number um but you know with with porn for the sexual drive with multiplayer video games for sports or or competition um that's right our kids are they're not they're not learn learning or developing and this is why you know I work in a business school I talk to a lot of people in in the corporate world and I always ask them how how's it going with your gen Z employees I've never heard a good word I've never heard oh they're great um it's they're often people just surprised at how they don't take initi ative if if you know if if something is broken they don't fix it they want to be told what to do they don't have the confidence they're very anxious um so you know I'm not I'm not ragging on gen Z I'm saying we blocked their development we prevented them from having a thousand 10 that millions of experiences of social interaction of challenge of failure of fear of thrill and then when they reach their early 20s and they're employed employers find there's something lacking so it sounds to me like boys on smartphones or so from this 2010 period forward um are getting this kind of hyper stereotypical male experience first person shooter games pornography girls are getting this um hyper stereotypical female experience relational highly relational but there are certain dynamics that are missing or certain components that are missing um yesterday I heard you mention something very very interesting to me which is that in both groups it seems conflict and any kind of friction is not being resolved among the participants but there's the sort of looking outward for some rule or policy law or oversight to come in and intervene um could you talk a little bit about this this relates in an interesting way to cancel culture yeah that's right um I would love to to learn more about this sure so aggression uh is a part of human nature as is cooperation and they kind they kind of have to go together you know to make it in this world you have to be able to play politics you have to have friends and allies you have to stand up for yourself um you have to push back sometimes but you have to learn to bury the hatchet and you know if you grow up with siblings you know you're fighting every day and you're cooperating every day it's and it's very important practice and if you're playing if you're playing sports outside with a bunch of kids in the neighborhood you're making the rules every day and then part of the import part of what's important when kids are playing is the infractions it's it's it's every the play stops people come together you know that was out of bounds no it wasn't you pushed me no I didn't and then every you know everybody gets practice playing judge and jury uh because everyone wants the game to go on so they're very motivated to to work it out uh you have to accept the Judgment what are you going to do storm off and go home to protest then you look like a loser and you don't get to play anymore so natural play with no adult forces the kids to learn social skills that are essential for democracy how do we make rules together just us how do we decide how we're going to govern ourselves what do we do when it looks like someone violated a rule well we're not just going to kill them we're not going to expel them we have to have a way of going on with the play so these are such crucial skills for Social Development for boys and for girls and um and kids always learn to work that out but what happens when the boys are growing up on video games there are no disputes there can't be a dispute because the game the the software basically manages everything there's no out of bounds or anything um so the play is missing a lot of the the of the key skills now um how are conflicts resolved well on social media instead of like a conflict that two girls might have had just the two of them or with like a group before which could get worked out very very quickly it's somebody posts something indirect maybe it's an indirect criticism and someone takes it in a way maybe it was intended that way maybe it wasn't but before you know it it's accelerated people are taking sides it it could blow up you don't know how big it could get it could be the whole school now gets drawn in this is terrifying so a really important idea about play is what's called low stakes mistakes so if you make a mistake while playing soccer with your friends uh no big deal like you know it's a foul redo whatever it is um but if you make a mistake on social media it could blow up to the point where you are now a laughing stock and when a kid when a especially in middle school when a kid is a laughing stock when everyone's laughing at them that is likely to trigger thoughts even of suicide shame makes us want to disappear and we're putting our kids our kids need to be immersed in small groups small groups of other kids that are stable somewhat stable over years that's the healthiest environment but instead we're mixing them in with POS potentially gigantic groups including strangers and people who are not engaging their normal empathy skills but are being performative judgmental judging in order to be liked by others so it's just an inhumane it's a it's it's an inhuman World in which to raise kids and this is part of my point about the great rewiring in 2010 American kids still had a recognizably human childhood with a lot of time together with other friends but that plunges in the 2010s to the point where now childhood is largely happening alone on a screen I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge one of our sponsors element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need that means the electrolyt so sodium magnesium and potassium in the correct amounts and ratios and nothing you don't which means no sugar now I and others on this podcast have talked about the critical importance of hydration for proper brain and body functioning even a slight degree of dehydration can diminish cognitive and physical performance it's also important that you get adequate electrolytes the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium are critical for the functioning of all the cells in your body especially your neurons your nerve cells drinking element dissolved in water makes it very easy to ensure that you're getting adequate hydration and adequate electrolytes to make sure I'm getting proper amounts of hydration and electrolytes I dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning and I drink that basically first thing in the morning I'll also drink element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing especially in hot days when I'm sweating a lot losing water and electrolytes they have a bunch of different great tasting flavors of element my favorite is the watermelon although I confess I also like the raspberry and the Citrus basically I like all the flavors and element has also just released a new line of canned sparkling element so these aren't the packets you dissolve in water these are cans of element that you crack open like any other canned drink like a soda but you're getting your hydration and your electrolytes with no sugar if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element spelled LM nt.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with the purchase of any element drink mix again that's drink element.com huberman to claim a free sample pack I'll never forget in middle school being at some assembly and um a kid had got down on all fours behind me and someone pushed me yeah oh yeah that game I stood up and Kevin gasman was just sitting there just cackling with his face right in front so I hit him it turns out it wasn't Kevin that did it and he hit me back and it was a disaster and I don't remember how it panned out but we ended up being friends it kind of how things got worked out well that's right conflict and cooperation you need the two together incredibly embarrassing both for getting pushed over and for hitting the wrong kid but credit for hitting somebody that's how boys work things out I'm not suggesting people do this not not suggesting violence and then both of us feeling silly and then ultimately yeah well I don't know I made it to the eth grade somehow right that's right um and the hierarchy among I mostly had male friends um but the hierarchy was something that was um very Dynamic yeah uh I have a good friend who was a he was a COO commanding officer in one of the East Coast Seal Team squadrons to one Seal Seal Team squadrons he said the reason they're so effective in those those groups is because they um Embrace Dynamic subordination where people take over as different skill sets are required and and they are relentlessly hard on each other this is something they like relentlessly hard at the level of humor but also I mean because it's so high cons high risk and high consequence they're just extremely hard on one another but it's all about this Dynamic subordination that sure they are leaders by virtue of who's appointed leader um and certain amount of authority but there's this constant Dynamic subordination and it exists in every group of males I've ever been a part of and it's wonderful and very reassuring to me because it means that you both get to potentially step up but you also get to rest when you and trust somebody else's skills I don't know how it operates with with girls I've only been um you know born with a Y chromosome this is all I know but um I imagine it exists there too in different but in different ways um so if online everything is fear-based where one is fearing a dog pile like if you say the wrong thing you're going to get dog piled you kind of wonder why anyone participates at all but it seems like people are in there are they are they in there and timid or are is boldness rewarded is it only boldness of um I guess they call you know slamming down what do they call dunking on other people I mean and here as I'm describing kids I want to acknowledge if you look on Twitter X We Now call it in the academic Tech and finance community in particular this is how the men behave this is how the women behave but it's especially apparent that the adults are kind of acting like kids and the kids are kind of acting like adults so what's going on are We Are we drawn into this as well as adults and are we modeling this or is this just um social media pulling on these strings of of you know deep evolutionarily conserved wiring yeah well so first um you know let's let's let's not be too sort of monochromatic about social media there is a lot of humor there's a lot of jokes there are a lot of funny cartoons videos and learning so there is there is good stuff mixed in and even the bad stuff is entertaining in the way that looking at a car crash or a dead body is entertaining people it draws the eye um so so young people are very interested and us adults too are very interested um it it it you know it draws Us in um but then yes it certainly changes our Behavior now actually um there's some research on on trolls uh is it is it that whenever you go on Twitter you become a jerk and um um uh and actually um no it seems more that what happens is there's a small number of men always men um who have a personality disorder um they um they like to be jerks they like to get a reaction from people they get blocked a lot they get kicked off platforms and this small number you know in a real Community probably when you were growing up there were one or two kids who were like this and they got in trouble a lot and they probably ended up dead or in jail um but online this you know suppose it's 1% of 1% of men are psychopaths so suppose it's this 2% of men let's say who are jerks like this um well online that's who we all see so so um uh so in part it's that the online World Super empowers extremists and jerks it's also that in the online World everyone is feeling performative everyone is you know you might even even if you're making a joke you have to think three steps ahead how will it be misinterpreted so a metaphor that I have in my head whenever I'm online is it's really just like being on thin ice like you can have fun on thin ice it's not all bad but you're kind of always aware that you're in danger whereas when you're hanging out with your buddies you know your good friends there's you feel totally safe and if you accidentally insult one of them you know it's like oh you know sorry you know yep you're right I'm sorry um and as followership increases the ice gets thinner yeah that's right that's right the right the higher they go the harder they fall and then a lot of people want to see want to see your fall um just want to make one point you that was interesting concept that what something in sub subordination Dynamic sub Dynamic subordination kind of like a flock of birds but is how it was described to me but you know I always thought in in the you know tier one uh Special Operations community that you know people would spend more years there Advance further and further and that's true too but but this idea that it's just understood that the hierarchy evolves in real time and the and the more um people Embrace that the better performing the group is as a pack yeah now the word hierarchy certainly takes on a bad name especially like in our academic circles hierarchy you know is bad and power is bad bad and then subordination all these things are bad power you know inequality but I think part of what's going on there so you know I teach in a business school and there's a huge amount of writing on leadership and and I haven't read much of it but um but a key idea that I that I got I'm trying to remember the author um is that the the key puzzle is not why people want to be leaders it's why do they want to be followers we really need to study followership and so people are willing to follow because part of our amazing human ability is to work together groups to overcome obstacles we don't have sharp teeth we're not very well we're fast in long distance but not in Sprints um but we're able to work together um and when we Face a common threat we very willingly seed leadership to a leader but we have to trust him and if the leader shows that he's a narcissist that he's putting himself first that he's benefiting at our expense we don't we don't trust him so what you need to do and I think this is more clear males are more hierarchical this is true in chimpanzees as well males are they take to hierarchy more readily um males benefit from having practice I don't think of it as dominance and submission I think what you said is actually more more effective it's like they need practice like being the leader of this project and then being a follower because you grant like yeah you lead us on this you take the lead on this and then something else will reverse and if you have a young man who has a lot of that experience that's going to be a young man that you will want to employ when he's in his mid-20s whereas one who never had that it's just going to be much more difficult to work with in a in a in a business setting yeah the groups of boys I grew up with and men that I've worked with and been friends with it's always been understood like this guy's really terrific for finding stuff and this guy's great with vehicles and this guy's great with gorals and this guy's that people have different skill sets and and that the group together can really mesh um but there isn't an attempt to be something that you're not and you quickly find out who you are by who you're not and you find your unique skill set yeah and um and you you know uh you evolve in that way by not trying to be everything to everybody whereas I noticed with my sister and her groups of friends it's changed over time of course but that there tended to be one girl that was really dominant in the play session like the whole time the bossy one right you know um and even though some stories you know kids books with that that mainly feature boys have that um I don't recall that being such a big part of my reading experience or childhood experience like in the Encyclopedia Brown books like there was like the mean kid and the like but people would slot in where they were most Adept so it sort of like natural tendencies to excel were complimentary and I don't know what it is for girls but online it seems um all of that's erased um so you've got these social dynamics that are very um heightened being played out on social media with with girls but boys and men are on there as well and most of what's on social media is social it's relational so are boys and men being drawn more toward those sorts of interactions and how well are they navigating those interactions is it common for boys to make big mistakes online and um and then be shunned as a consequence or is this more common in um females yeah that that's a good question um life online is performative for girls a much bigger element of the performance is perfectionism about the image so girls spend a lot more time choosing a photograph editing a photograph making sure everything's perfect whereas guys you know like I literally don't notice if my socks don't match my wife has to tell me your socks don't match um you know guys just don't notice those things as much so you're a professor after all yeah AB mind Professor suppose yeah but my point is that is that life online it does affect all kids so fear of missing out is something that affects everybody you know Snapchat you see all your friends over there and you didn't even know that there was something going on so you know boys and again boys and girls they'll have similar insecurities it's more a question of degree so the the the perfectionism the the playing out the social dynamics to three steps like girls are playing three-dimensional chess about social relationships well but why did he say that if he also wanted this when she he knows that she knows that you know and guys's like what what do you I don't even know what you're saying they're barely playing checkers that's right that's right and again it's that it's that um uh you know it's that the early the organizing effects of prenatal hormones this is not culturally taught this is what kids enjoy doing based on I believe and Simon Baron Cohen I believe believes um is the organizing pren the prenatal organizing effects of hormones on the on the developing brain but on YouTube where it's my understanding primarily male yes there's a lot of clapback type comments um I know this because I have a YouTube channel um and in the old days it seems it wasn't that long ago when Rogan was had full length episodes on YouTube then he didn't now he does again the the jokes the comment section on YouTube were like their own show it was outrageous it was so good and um some of that's coming back now that was it men showing off their cleverness right I mean like for instance you might be familiar with jao willink the right you know this s if you had to draw an Navy se you draw Joo kind of looks like modern General uh General p modern day General Patton right and there's this whole category of jokes based on Joo who I think actually has risen to prominence in the online culture because he's sort of like the football coach that most young males never had he's the guy that's going to tell you what to do when to do it and do it even though you don't want to and just do it and he and you trust him he's a very trustworthy guy as it were and he's a warrior and he has all the credentials Etc but there's this whole category of jokes like um you know when joaco was born um the doctor looked at his mother and said it's a man you know or or when jao left for college he looked at his father and said you're the man of the house now you know jokes like that you know there are tons and tons of these right so there's this whole so that's very YouTube male type humor it's it's one hit it's done it gets a ton of likes and it propagates yeah none of this two or three chess moves down the down the road um so it's very clapback sometimes in or in that case building up Joo who doesn't need any more building up but people do it anyway so things of that sort so interested in the in these um in the Nuance here because um you're telling me that girls are killing themselves more they're depressed their increase in suicide is larger boys have a much higher suicide rate so boy many more boys die from suicide more violent means that's that that's one of the major reasons and that's especially true in America where we have so many guns boys tend to use a gun or a tall building or a bridge whereas girls tend to use pills or cutting their wrists and they and the great majority of girl suicide attempts don't lead to death yeah so are most of the issues with girls and online use social media it's sort of um uh it's despair it's at home anxious sad about self self- critiquing this kind of thing I mean you're telling me there's a a huge and I believe you that there's a tremendous increase I mean he said hockey stick like function um when we're looking at essentially capturing the tip of the pyramid in terms of like extreme social interaction so take let me I'm not being very very clear here we have these neural circuits that evolved for social interactions that are more heightened in girls they're getting much more of it faster yeah and the consequences are no less and probably even more severe than they used to be but it's still shunning shaming um self attack and and anxiety depression Etc in boys the neural circuits that we're talking about are are related to sex and violence those evolved over hundreds of thousands not millions of years and those are heightened so we're s capturing the the extremes of these neural circuit functions I'm looking at this through the lens of a neurobiologist is great and this is where it seems we're running into trouble because the the iceberg below all of that the portion of the iceberg below those those peaks of behavior and interactions like none of that's happening there isn't the um it's all happening faster it's more potent and the consequences are are more severe that's right that's right I think there's a good analogy here to junk food where I've heard junk food or the H you know a cheeseburger described as a super stimulus um and you know ice cream is a super duper stimulus you know it's got fat it's got sugar right and a and a cheeseburger with a milkshake and the milkshake has candy in it yeah ice cream and then you get a toy and they're playing music I mean that's a dopamine bath that's right so if we think about if we think about about life in the presence of junk food if you raise your kids with junk food you're going to have all kinds of you know metabolic problems developmental problems obesity all sort of diabetes all sorts of terrible things um now if you have a normal development and then as an adult you you indulge in more junk food you know it's you know it's probably it's not good for you but it's very different than being raised on it the the developing brain the developing body are much more sensitive and so the way you just put it before it's like the it's like these evolved motives you super satisfy them with the these overwhelming quick easy hits um it may not be so bad for an adult we can choose to have you know we can choose to uh you know pay for sex we can choose to uh you know eat it you know eat a cheeseburger and a and a milkshake um but it's very important for kids we have to see the genes don't have that much information in them but they start the brain developing and then the brain has to sort of find its way the neurons have to find their way Guided by local signals how to develop and then the child has to kind of find its way through its culture getting a sense of how do I behave here and and who am I and how do I relate to people and it's all a very delicate process that has to be drawn out over many many years we we everything about us develops slowly especially compared to other animals and if you intervene in the developmental process and say Hey kid you want the Endo without the journey here you go take it you're cutting off development and that's I think what life that's what the phone based childhood is doing well here's my concern um um there is a reality to these things we call critical or sensitive periods yes let's talk about that um critical periods implies that it's open and shut and they're actually sensitive periods for language learning for brain plasticity and the the general Contour of this is passive experience up until about age 25 dramatically shapes the maps in the brain that we have of social relationships of the visual world the auditory world I mean there's just so much data to support this in animals and humans then after about age 25 you can pry openen the underlying neurobiological mechanisms for neuroplasticity and you can rewire your brain but it takes a hell of a lot of effort Andor pharmacology to assist which is part of what the excitement about some of the Psychedelic therapies are about because um and I'm not suggesting people just run out and take psychedelics but but they can foster change they can foster change and they're either neuromodulators or they stimulate the massive release of neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin mostly serotonin and dopamine when we talk about psilocybin and MDMA LSD Etc but that plasticity needs to be directed so just taking the drug doesn't do it on its own okay so leaving that aside uh what do we know for sure we know that as the brain progresses from age three four five six seven there are Milestones that have to be met and in general if a kid makes it to high school age or college age regardless of whether or not they go to to hopefully they do and graduate high school or college there's a set of Milestones that they have to reach the circuits are going to develop one way or another the question is what are the what are the thresholds under which dopamine is released well you I would argue and I'll go on record saying that if a kid watches a lot of intense High potency violent porn and that becomes his dopamine stimulus well then other stuff probably won't do it for him whereas if there's a variety of experience or more let's just say subtle dare I even say healthier right um stimula then the system is the dopamine system around cording and sex is more varied it's it's more of a at least more of a buffet and hopefully a healthier Buffet right um again no judgment here of different proclivities but here we're talking about the wiring of neural circuit same thing with food if one grows up on highly processed very very tasty food for a while fruits and vegetables in their pure form Meat and Fish in their plain form are boring it does not evoke the same reinforcing property and earlier I I I forgot to to mention why I prefer the word reinforcing as opposed to reward because reward evokes this idea of the thing being the reward but the reinforcement is reinforcement is a verb and so as a verb it it brings the mind to the fact that these circuits are are like they're churning in the background there it's not just about getting the thing it's the um it's the underlying bi biology that that gets you there and so I think that where I'm very concerned is that we've now got what millions and millions of kids boys and girls whose neural circuits were wired up wrong and now there needs to be it seems a very active process in unwiring that or at least shifting those neural circuits towards something that's more adaptive yeah so before before we talk about what to do if you're older because I have the the great Good Fortune to be sitting here with you right now I'd like to ask you um to help me expand what I say in the book so you you gave a description of of critical periods where there's a hard beginning and end and of sensitive periods are periods in which it's just a lot easier to learn something and if you don't learn so for example phology is one of the clearest cases you accent you know if you you know when a family moves to America from somewhere else if you've got two kids in the family one of my advisers at at Penn in grad school um Henry GL had a very very heavy German accent and his younger brother two years younger had no ACC whatsoever because Henry was 14 and his brother was 12 when they came to America from fleeing Nazi Germany um and so there's a sensitive period that kind of closes at puberty for language so I talk about that in the book and then I talk about more speculative sensitive period um that I've read about you know a few people think this exists and and I I cite a Japanese study um of of Japanese businessmen who moved to California in the 70s as Japanese business were thriving and they looked at when did the when did the kids come to feel American and the answer was if they came and left before age n nothing they went back to Japan they were totally Japanese if they came uh when the kid was 15 nothing the kid was already Japanese but wasn't going to ever feel American if they came and spent a few years between about 9 and 15 then they go back to Japan now especially if the kid's now 15 or 16 the kid now feels American and has trouble fitting back in puberty well that's right there's a period it's it's early puberty it's you know like just before puberty to sort of Midway through PU Liberty seems to be a sensitive period for culture learning and for identity your very deep sense of who you are and how you relate to people so this is speculative but it does seem to fit a lot of interesting data and and the reason why I I focus on this in the book I decided like late in the process uh you know I knew I had to talk about puberty I was going to have like a section on I was my God this is so important I need a whole chapter on puberty and I talk about initiation rights all over the world adults think kids don't just turn into men and women they need help they need to be given the special knowledge for boys there's usually orals more so than for girls um and so I think what's going on is we do have this sensitive period for cultureal learning how do you learn to become a person in your culture and you know I was I was in the Boy Scouts and boy scouts was created around World War I as like paramilitary training like learn Virtues Of You know self-denial and oh you know Brave clean loyal trustworthy rever iot the order all messed up but it was a set of Virtues um so would you agree or what would you say about sensitive periods for this really high level stuff we're not talking Vision or phology which are fairly low-level cognitive things we're talking like your sense of who you are what would you think about a sensitive period for that oh first of all puberty is just fascinating and underd discussed in my opinion as a critical developmental milestone it's also the the fastest rate of Aging that we ever undergo aging meaning in our you know in terms of change of the brain in terms of um rate of uh I mean there are some theories that that the that the rate of puberty and the timing of onset of puberty actually might predict something about longevity oh which way early puberty is B early puberty might be bad but I want to be very careful and saying that some people including myself have a very protracted puberty so I hit puberty around 14 but I didn't get facial hair until I was out of college wow so some people develop the so-called secondary sexual characteristics slowly but I always had this voice since was a little kid so 5 years old they call me froggy now that's me um and everyone goes through these things differently um but puberty is the most profound brain change that one can undergo tell me more about it because I just keep saying like well it starts in the back of the brain and then is but be be specific what is happening to the brain during puberty that would be relevant here to a sensitive period okay so this goes back to the biology that you accurately described earlier which is that while we're in utero if there's a y chromosome then a bunch of genes are made like mulian an inhibiting hormone the malarian ducts become inhibited um the testes grow then testosterone is secreted and testosterone and some of its derivatives like dihydro testosterone organize the brain quote unquote male this is dangerous language nowadays but it's less dangerous now than it was two years ago okay well we're not talking about gender we're talking about biological sex here and we're not talking about the verb sex we were talking about that earlier we're talking about biological sex so what I'm describing here is is not uh disputed the so there these organizing effects of hormones early on and then there're the activating effects of hormones that happen during puberty so then puberty hits the test starts secreting testosterone um if they fat stores on the body they secrete estrogen again testosterone and estrogen working in parallel and in males a number of different brain areas in particular the hypothalamus but also the forebrain and Associated areas undergo massive plasticity in growth relating the with the for brain the frontal lobe right the frontal lobe oh so one of the most profound changes in puberty that happens especially in males but also in females is that well we can describe the the major function of the prefrontal cortex this neural real estate right behind the the forra has many different subdomains involved in things but one of its main functions this was beautifully described by the the guy who's now the head uh neurosurgeon at neurolink Matt McDougall is to say sh to the impulse driving actions of the hypothalamus in particular hypothalamus houses neurons for temperature regulation sexual drive hunger aggression I mean so much so that you can go in and stimulate certain neurons and the ventromedial hypothalamus with an electrode and you would go into a rage wow stimulate neurons also within the ventromedial hypothalamus just nearby and uh you'd want to go spend some time with your wife alone let's just put it that way I mean a remarkable specificity of the neuronal outputs to behavioral change and state change so all of that gets set up essentially during puberty because the neurons of the hypothalamus are responsive to these hormones that are coming from the gonads and in females it's yes mainly secretion of estrogen but also testosterone okay so the brain is changing in dramatic ways not the least of which is the forbrain is learning how to suppress impulse okay and some of that gets feedback from behaviors from parenting how topress learning how to supress from social reward or punishment if it doesn't get daily practice in suppressing if you're able to give into all your urges cuz like I'm finding like when I sit at my computer my Rule now I have to say to myself out loud finish what you start finish what you start no don't go check until you've done you only have two more pages to read read those two pages but I I can't do it right well this is the gradual creep of sort of a we don't want to make it clinical but an adult like ADHD like symptoms that we all are suffering from right there's just it's just we're at a buffet right and delicious that's a good example so um that's one of the main things this uh forbrain to hypothalamic wiring the other is and is this not trivial and you mentioned in the context of language learning and Dr Eddie changen who's a neurosurgeon uh actually chair of neuros surgery at UCSF knows a lot about this and critical periods is that their hormone effects on say like thickening of the vocal cords which is why on average boys have um deeper voices than girls and so forth after puberty and there's a lot of feedback from those signals in terms of the social world because now a young boy whose voice deepens who's also acquiring more knowledge is talking to other people about that knowledge and he's being treated differently and there's feedback in terms of his self-concept and that's where it gets kind of high level abstract in girls there's feedback of sometimes it's bodily changes positive or negative feedback from peers other girls Andor boys but also knowledge she's out there talking about well you know like she's brilliant in math or you know brilliant in literature and getting the feedback and then self- knowledge starts to accumulate and the the location of identity in the brain is unclear it's probably distributed Network it's probably an emergent property of a lot of different things so we can't really point to one area but it's learning impulse control reinforcement contingencies on what time scale can I get what I want to meet certain drives and to what extent should I suppress those drives and you know traditionally it was I think through religion and parenting and um social cues that you will learn well if I want something is it okay to do it that there are consequences to eating more or less consequences to be okay so it's super complex but but that all happens sometimes in a summer this is what's so amazing to about puberty to me you know or the acquisition of facial hair in in a boy you know suddenly he's looked at differently people will start projecting all sorts of Futures on him you know um but we do this I notice I'm not a child psychologist obviously but as soon as my niece started drawing she's going to be an artist as soon as a boy starts building or a girl starts you know gets a math problem right is going to be a a mathematician I mean we project all this stuff and and there's no question that that feeds back on identity but in terms of online use I can't even imagine how much of this is diminished by only showing a specific part of ourselves and I can't even imagine how much of it is exacerbated in terms of what we are rewarded for during puberty so here's what we know in both animals and humans which is that neuroplasticity while it responds to punishment is exquisitely sensitive become sort of a runaway train for more plasticity under conditions of dopamine reinforcement and reward so you can imagine that the girl using the filter the Instagram filter for who gets rewarded for looking a certain way maybe excessively thin or something or what leads to excessively thin um there's no question that rewards Drive neuroplasticity faster than punishment make sure I understand this you're saying suppose a girl gets uh a girl gets onto Instagram and she's now consuming stuff about being thin and for some reason she finds this rewarding are you saying that the the the quick dopamine circuits or she posts something and she gets likes for it are you saying that that actually will extend neuroplasticity the fact that she's getting more dopamine s rapid dopamine that will make her more neuroplastic and her brain will change more yes it will it will accelerate learning for the whatever contingency led to that whatever led to that so we know this in animals and humans even though they're exquisitly sensitive plasticity is exquisitely sensitive to punishment you know it only takes one shock learning in one corner of a cage or getting sick at one particular restaurant that you don't want to go back again but when it comes to social dynamics we know that reward leads to almost what I would call runaway plasticity in the circuits that generated the behaviors that led to that particular reward I mean it's um and there are a number of experiments that that explain this the work of Mike merenik at UCSF who largely worked on adult plasticity but showed that when you when you activate dopamine release in the brain fortunately both during development but also in adulthood you essentially create a window of super plasticity okay that's dopamine reward that neuromodulator is a window for super plasticity and evolutionarily it makes sense like oh my goodness there's there's abundance here of something oh time to learn something new that's right we've we've overemphasized the extent to which plasticity is driven by punishment but the the neuromodulators that allow for plasticity in particular in puberty and as adults are largely dopamine dependent and acetylcholine dependent um the acetylcholine generally increases Focus um broadly speaking I mean does a bunch of other things controls muscular contraction Etc but so what we're basically saying here is that if a kid gets a strongly reinforcing experience I I'd be willing to bet both arms that the neural circuits that help generate whatever behaviors led to that experience are going to be strengthened in one trial to the extent that it will be very easy to generate those those behaviors again okay so this okay thank you this is exactly what I wanted to know to to deepen my the theorizing that I do in the book um so now this is actually the perfect time for us to switch over to the four recommendation the four main recommendations because they build exactly on what you just said they help me explain why this is so important so um so you know I think one one reason why the book seems to be doing very well and people seem to like and pass it on is that it's not just Doom and Gloom it's not just oh we've messed up our kids oh these terrible devices um rather it's about a vision of childhood which is actually beautiful it's the one that that most of us older people had it's with play outdoors and all um and and so the um my analysis in the book is that the reason why I got this far is because it's a set of collective action traps everyone every 10-year-old needs a smartphone now because every other 10-year-old has one and you don't want to make your kid be alone so the four recommendations I have are four ways of breaking out on the Trap but the first two are really about delaying and getting past this period of plasticity and you really help me see why it's so urgent to delay until late puberty at least so here are the four Norms that I think can break us out of this trap Norm number one uh no smartphone before high school you can give your kid a flip phone flip the Millennials had flip phones they came out fine no access or no smartphone of their own your own you can't have your own and that would even go for an iPad if you give your kid an iPad and say here Billy this is your iPad you can keep it in your room and use it any you know anywhere in the house and you can take it outside even although maybe no W Wi-Fi whatever the point is um the internet is an amazing thing and you know you can have a computer in your living room or kitchen when you have young kids and they can do things on the computer but you do not want to give your child the entire internet in his or her pocket and you do not want the entire world to be able to reach your child whenever they want to so it's just insane that we're giving children even before puberty a smartphone let them have a flip phone or a simple phone watch something like that that's rule number one rule number two is the most relevant for what we're just talking about and that is no social media until 16 there is I believe no way to make social media safe for children that is if they're going to be entering a domain in which Prestige is gained by having posts that get the most likes and followers you're making them be brand managers you're making them be performative this is not playful they're going to be exposed to horrible horrible things I now ask young people is there something that you saw when you were young that you really regret seeing and a lot of them have an answer uh my 21-year-old Dorman just told me about the gauntlet uh running the gauntlet it's a series of 20 videos it's a challenge can you watch these 20 videos which end with you know a Mexican drug gang dismembering a person who's alive things like that like yes I'm tough enough I can do that really at what age should you do you want your kids watching people being dismembered 10 11 is that and those images are forever for that's right that's right I didn't even watch the video I you know what I'm sorry I said that I we provide a link no I'll say that you know trauma is defined as a adverse event that forever changes the way the brain responds in ways that make people less effective in life so don't do it to yourself like I wouldn't watch the Dalmer movie everyone was talking about the Dalmer movie all I had to see was 10 seconds of the trailer to know I'll pay money not to see that not because I couldn't through it I'm sure I could force myself to but I don't want that in my neural real estate right it's just they're for right for obvious reasons so so let's go back to what you said about neuroplasticity so because if if it's true that puberty is a sensitive period for many higher level uh uh aspects of our Humanity such as identity relationship skills all that stuff then you should be extra careful when your kids are 9 to 15 years old you should be extra careful about what's going into their eyes and ears and instead that's when we give up all control you know when our kids are little they pay attention to us we read to them we have a lot of control about what our kids consume when they're toddlers And when they're very young but as they reach middle school and high school they're moving away they're seeking out other stuff and that's exactly what we say here here's your own device you want to go down a rabbit hole of eating disorder stuff you want to go down a rabbit hole of of you know of you know Tourette Syndrome um you're going to copy people who have these symptoms so the last thing we should be doing is exposing our children in this sensitive period to socializing information from random weirdos on the internet who were selected by an algorithm for the extremity of their behavior and the degree to which that extremity earned them likes which makes them extra prestigious um so yeah I laws that raise the age to 16 or 18 I think that's what we need um this is just not appropriate for minors even if there's some good stuff on it I think it's vastly outweighed by the bad so that's and that's the second Norm no smart no social media till 16 uh the third Norm is phone free schools and again you know if we expect kids to learn and learning is brain change if you're learning something you're developing a skill something about your brain has changed uh how about instead of learning math or reading or litter or anything else how about if you just do more phone stuff you just spend more time in school on Tik Tok there was just an article in the Washington in the Wall Street Journal about a teacher who fought against the phones and finally gave up and quit and one of the students in his classes quoted um that she used to she'd come into class and she would just go on Tik Tok and that's what she would do all class long is just watch Tik Tok in her desk um you know and like no you should be learning not doing more Tik Tok in school so it's just insane that we let kids take the greatest distraction devices ever invented into the classroom with them I would argue that they are learning but what they're learning are these rapidly reinforced dopamine Loops that lead to diminished amounts of dopamine not just in short periods of time but very quickly and that inhibit other forms of learning yeah that's right and the ability to pay attention right to to a teacher which is not as stimulating as what you're seeing on Tik Tok there's tons of learning it's but it's learning of all the wrong things that's right that's right so that's the third Norm is uh no uh is phonefree schools you have to lock up the phone in the morning either a lock in a phone lock or Yonder pouch um if the policy is you keep in your pocket that's not a policy that's just a recipe for constant conflict with the kids because they can't help it they have to text if anyone's texting they have to be texting and the fourth Norm is the hardest the fourth Norm is uh far more Independence free playay and responsibility in the real world because what we need to do is not just roll back the phone based childhood and make them just sit and do nothing we have to do is restore a really fun adventurous childhood like you know what you were saying you know you go out on your bicycle you're hanging out with your friends friends sometimes something happens and boy you have memories I mean exciting things happen scary things happen you have memories and you know I worry about like what you know what boys today you know I have a group of Buddy my group of friends that I you know we we still talk about things that happened you know things that amazing things that happened when we were in college or after college and I wonder what boys young boys today are going to say you know you remember fortnite game 27363 where you were trapped in that Elevator Shaft and I had to shoot you out no I don't remember that one you know like uh the the virtual Adventures are just not going to cut it our kids need Adventure they need Independence and Adventure uh where they work out the conflicts themselves so if we do those four things I think we can restore childhood in the real world no smartphone before high school no social media till 16 phone- free schools more Independence free play and responsibility in the real world those four things and these are things that we can all do if we work together if we do them at the same time if you're the only family that's keeping your kid off a Smartphone till high school and off of social media till 16 you're imposing a cost on your child and she may be lonely and she'll say Mom I'm left out now she might still thank you as we saw last night some one of the women said her daughter thanked her for keeping her off but at the time it was painful for her and so my hope is by spreading these Norms no parent will ever be in that position again where their kid is the only one in the class who doesn't have a smartphone at age 10 to have this fantastic list I say fantastic because it Jes with all of the neurobiology that I'm aware of and because it offers solutions that it's really based on knowing what's happened and is happening with with smartphone use there are a bunch of don'ts but then there's some dos which I you know I'm not again I'm not a um an expert in behavioral change but I spent a fair amount of my time talking to people about what they can do for their health and well-being and not just the don'ts um and I I think it's important as I understand to have replacement behaviors and also I think people of all ages want want to do something that feels good the first time and every time and that's good for them and then you create that reinforcement Loop in a different direction um you're offering all of that in the book and here and it's fabulous what I wonder about and um would love to help in any way that I can uh with is you know if you recall years ago there there was this understanding about the first six years of life being critical it was the first six years and so parents kind of overstepped it a bit and were playing their kids Mozart all the time and things like that waste of time but what was interesting is that they were thinking about critical periods in brain plasticity and so as a neurobiologist who say brain development I I was delighted um it seems to me that if there was an understanding that the biology and psychology and sociology points to the fact that there is a critical period maybe not even a sensitive period but a critical period in which excessive smartphone use of a particular type is actually leading to more suicides depression anxiety and less learning and um adaptive behavior in life it seems to me that it should be a almost like a law it should be implemented at the level certainly at the national level what what sorts of barriers do you think exist to that um you know obviously I'm enthusiastic in joining your effort and and um I know many people listening will be as well to try and Implement these four things but what do you think it would really take to get people to take their children's brains and lives seriously because children can't be left to their own self-care to that degree it's just unfair right I mean it's like telling a kid in a candy shop like Hey listen you know figure it out you know there's nutritious food down the stre like it's unfair right it's like a puppy trying to trying to do the you know Westminster Championship it's like it's not going to happen um you know but this is serious stuff I mean we're talking about the future not just of the United States but of the entire species so um what about laws what about legislature how does that work I don't know anything about that sure well first so you know let's let's note you know I could be wrong about this um it might be that the phones aren't doing this now I think the evidence is pretty good that it is but let's suppose there's a 70% chance that I'm right let's Suppose there was only a 30% chance I was right the the consequences are so severe we should be taking action now what action to take I was over in the UK for the book about three weeks ago and in the UK you know and the rest of Europe the first thought of everyone is Ban it ban it ban it government law ban and there are times when we need that you know cigarette smoking underage just ban it like you should not have kids smoking now in Britain there was a lot of consideration of should we ban the sale of smartphones to kids under 14 and and I met with with the the policy unit at at number 10 Downing Street and I said now wait a second guys um you know as an American it never even occurred to me to suggest that um you need to get Norms first if you pass laws that are out of phase with people's Norms they're going to really hate you and they're going to resent it so let's start with a norm change first um and so uh so I think I think that's really happening so in Britain parents are up in arms they really are changing rapidly over there they're a couple months ahead of us in America I think it's happening right now um and so if we just develop a consensus we need to see smartphones in the hands of kids as being like cigarettes in the hands of kids like you know you just don't do that you don't do that of course they can be on a laptop they can be on a computer they can do some things on your iPhone sometimes it's not poison um but you don't want that it to be habit forming so um so I think that for keeping smartphones out of the hands of kids there's no law I don't want a law Banning that but we just need a norm now for for raising the age to 16 we can struggle to do that I'm doing that with my kids I'm saying no for my daughter no Snapchat till you're 16 16 um and she's the only one who doesn't have it it's painful for her and she's 14 um but my hope is that no parent again will be in that situation that in every school a lot of the parents are going to say no no social media till 16 now of course the laws currently state that you have to be 13 in order to sign a contract give away your data and make a deal with a company without your parents knowledge or permission but Congress passed this terrible law in 1998 um uh the Copa child online privacy protection act it was supposed to set the age to 16 which is not which is I think pretty reasonable but it got pushed down to 13 with no enforcement it's the law is written such that as long as the company doesn't absolutely know that you're underage they're fine they're not responsible 13 they're motivated the companies are now the law motivates the companies to not know how old children are there's barely any forbrain at 13 that's right that's right and since all you have to do you just have to be old enough to lie about your age if you're old enough to lie about your age you can go anywhere on the internet because there's no enforcement so I'm saying let's take the age of 13 which is not enforced let's require age verification which is complicated but they're working on that in Britain they've they're mandating that it's going to happen in Britain we'll work out the technical details um so mandate age verification then raise the age to 16 that's the one place where I think we really do need law uh because social media is a social trap and if half the kids are on it there's going to be a lot of pressure on the other half to join so we need to get that down to like only know if 5% sneak around they find a way on that's fine um um so that's where we definitely need law um and then the play stuff there we could use some laws so I I co-founded an organization called let grow if you go to let grow.org um with Lenor skazi we advocate for returning play to children and one of the things we've done is we've gotten laws passed in eight states that say that if you let your child out to play that cannot be taken as evidence of child neglect whereas at present laws are ambiguous so if you send your 8-year-old out to a store and and this has happened to friends of mine and some nosy neighbor says where's your mother does she know you're out here and then they call 911 and the police the police come because no one has seen an 8-year-old un a companied since the 90s so the police come and once the police come they're very likely to refer it to child protective services and once your family is in the grip of Child Protective Services you've got custody battles you've got supervision you're not allowed alone with ch I mean it's crazy what happens so eight states have now said no no more of that this is insane um so we so law could help to put to to stop incentivizing helicopter parenting to provide uh uh more spaces that are safe for kids to play in not car zones um so the book has the ex generation the whole fourth part of it is suggestions for governments for tech companies for schools and for parents there's a lot we can do to restore a play-based childhood in the real world I realize that some of this is dependent on income for a household Etc but is there any protective effect of say a summer camp Oh yes um or protective effect of even just after school sport where both the kids and the parents agree no phones on the field you know we're not we're not taping for every goal I mean I love seeing the my friends kids you know getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that you know I Delight in that on Instagram and it's wild that my friends given who I know them to be growing up um have these kids um and the stories I could tell but but in all seriousness it's wonderful and yet I'm thinking they're taking a video of their kid playing the game um you know wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no phones at after school sports events so it's a couple of hours three times a week or once a week even where at least these young brains are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement burning that's right that's right um the British have a saying don't put your daughter on the stage Mrs Worthington uh which is a line from an old nol coward song and it acknowledges that especially for girls for girls to grow up being looked at and admired and commented on about their looks is just really really bad for them uh but to grow up always being photographed uh everything you do and posted online is really bad for them um so yes in response to your question first summer camps are magic never send your child to a summer camp that doesn't ban phones because this is the best chance you have for a detox and I hear the story over and over again you know my I get my my girl got a an iPhone when she was was 11 she suddenly became sirly no longer the sweet funny child she was I sent her to summer camp the next summer and lo and behold the girl that comes back is my wonderful sweet 11-year-old you know she her personality is back and then she gets back on her phone and she becomes cly again so summer camps are the most powerful technique known um for a detox because the kid isn't being deprived they are in a bunk with other kids with no phones and they're joking and talking and laughing and fighting and doing all those healthy things so summer camp is amazing the other thing that the evidence shows is that team sports and religion those two things are very very protective so I would strongly urge people um to encourage their kids to play team sports my kids run trap which is great but team sports Force more cooperation so there's some evidence that team sports are even better for their mental health um than than individual sports um you don't want super duper over supervised you know high pressure sports leagues I mean that's better than nothing but ideally the more they play games that are you know more intramural in normal the kids are enforcing the rules you know all of that would be better our kids are not rooted in communities anymore but Sports and religion are two things that do that what about music I did an episode on music in the brain and one of the um more thrilling and um interesting parts to me was and I'm I have no musical Talent whatsoever singing or instrumental or otherwise I love listening to music however was that kids that grow up playing an instrument especially cooperatively with other people in a band you know duet or you know quartet you know a band um or orchestra or marching band um there's some very impressive data in terms of potential for additional neuroplasticity in fact the brainwide networks the the patterns of connectivity are much more Broad in kids that learned an instrument and played it cooperatively than um those that try and learn an instrument later in life although they're still advantages that so I wonder if that's could be added to the list yes playing in a band or in a choir I think definitely should be um for a while I was really interested in synchrony and synchrony has all these really powerful effects um there's a wonderful book called keeping together in time by William mcneel uh he was either he signed up or he was drafted into World War II train training at a camp in Texas they're marching up and down with wooden guns because they don't have real guns and at first it seemed stupid to him but after a few days his unit gets it and when they can they they're like they're like a unit they're like like a they're imperfect you know and it was it was like a loss of self it was ecstatic and so he goes off to World War II he writes comes back and writes about you know men in battle he writes that's a different book different book title but but these the but those sorts of being in sync those experiences they we are an ultrasocial species much we're much more social than dogs or chimpanzees we have this ability to keep together in time and do things synchronously and all around the world that's what rituals used to do it's thrilling and so um um these self-transcendent experiences that you get from singing in a choir from playing in a band I don't have much talent either but I did play in a informal rock band when I was at UVA we called ourselves Pavlov's dogs we were all in the psych Department um but the first time we got it and we were all really in sync it was totally thrilling um so yeah the more you give your kids I have whole section actually in Chapter 2 of the book on synchrony and and Attunement um we you know we need to be in sync and that's why face tof face interaction is so important whereas when you're communicating on on Instagram or any social media it's asynchronous you don't have the the automatic Attunement can I get a little new Agy speculative all right let's go I have a question so um I've heard you and others say that you know kids and probably adults nowadays are not familiar with what it is to be bored there's always an input movie um on social media YouTube there's always words streaming at us in audio or written um there's this concept that I love from the world of mindfulness which used to be considered new Agy but now I think every academic campus has at least a few grants focused on meditation and its benefits and respiration breath work and its benefits so we' come a long way but there's this concept of wordlessness of The Importance of Being in states of wordlessness where we're not reading we're not thinking in complete sentences we're not um taking in sensory information and we under those conditions are able to actually register how we feel about things like we become better tuned to um sense our environment and input when it comes and I wonder because my experience of social media has been whether or not kids are on Instagram Snapchat Etc and they're doing it out of whatever compulsion have addiction whatever you want to call it but I'm not sure it feels good to them I'm not sure it does I'm not sure it's like the ice cream that tastes delicious I think it might start that way and occasionally you know they're jackpots right but that in large part adults but since we're talking about kids let's talk about kids in this very critical sensitive period of Life are not feeling good and they might not even know they're not feeling good they're just compulsively there I'm using the term loosely not clinically compulsively engaging and so I wonder whether or not there's some benefit to kids not just being bored for experiencing boredom sake but learning to actually be a better sensor of what they like and don't like because when I talk to my niece or I talk to other young people now they they seem to be like becoming increasingly aware of how much some of the online stuff sucks that's the language they're not like oh it's awesome don't take it away from me they're like I don't want to miss out but it's also painful to them it's I mean it's like they're drinking from a fire hose of nails and then every once in a while there's something that tastes good it's it's not like they're like this is so cool and that's so cool but of course if you give them a really cool video of a animal thing or a social dynamics thing or a war game or whatever they'll get excited but I don't get the impression that they're like this is awesome it's more like this has me by the short hairs it's got me scruffed and I'm just doing it and I don't know how to stop that's that's and that's certainly the way sorry the certainly the way that boys reach out guys young guys typically reach out about their porn addictions I hear about this thousands of messages help me get over this so I refer them to our episode on addiction by Dr Anna lmy from Stanford yeah she's amazing yeah that episode yeah she's she's spectacular or um it's just they're desperate they're desperate so I don't see it as all pleasure I see it as mostly pain that's right so there's a lot going on going on here um for some for some of them they are addicted and they feel bad for the reasons you were talking about dopamine overshoot or they feel bad when they're not doing the addictive activity so they are compulsively using it just like a a gambler if you're addicted to slot machines your life sucks you've spent all your family's money you're ashamed of what happened you feel terrible oh but if I just get back into the Zone on the slot machine I feel good for that two or three hours that's the most dangerous addiction cuz as it's been described to me I'm fortunately not a gambling addict addict excuse me the Gambler really does believe that the next one could change everything right it's going to it's going to cause motivated reasoning it's going to cause hopefulness that is dashed um so for some of them it is a kind of self-medication as soon as the boys move their social lives onto video games and porn and the girls move their social Liv on social media both sexes got really lonely um it's you know they're getting lots of cheap and easy stimulation but it's not satisfying so what do they do now that they're lonely and anxious well sometimes they do more of it um so some of it is driven by that feedback cycle that they're now uncomfortable so they need more of it but the other part is the compulsion to consume because everyone else is and they have to keep up and so my students at myyu I asked them you know okay you know some of you are spending four or five six hours a day on social media why don't you quit oh why I can't because you know I have to know what what everyone's talking about I have to see the latest video I have to keep up with it um and since you know like I can't deal with my email and my text like those two combin that's more than I can handle in a day I can't stand it I can't imagine having five Platforms in addition and most I don't know the exact number but very few of my students are on a single platform most of them are two on two or three regularly plus email and and texting and you know Snapchat um so it is kind of like like imagine you know food is great but imagine always having to eat you have to always be eating like our system can't handle that you know imagine a plant always in a shower like the you know it's always like no you need you need times of taking in and Times of digesting or processing um one of the most valuable uh I'll I'll tell you two of the most valuable exercises that we do in my flourishing class at myu the first is uh a prerequisite to everything else is they have to regain control of their attention and once they understand that they've given away almost all of their attention any moment that isn't taken up by you know a teacher or something is it's it's the phone for a lot of them because there's so much to process they have so many direct messages so many group texts they have to always be processing or they they feel like they you know they're they're being left behind they're not participating so I make them see you've got to regain control of your attention you've got to shut off almost all notifications you leave on Uber because you want Uber to interrupt you to say the car is 3 minutes away that's good but how many other companies is it that important that they interrupt you very very few so shut off almost all your notifications get social media off your phone if you need to use it you can use it on your computer but don't always have it so in every like you know at at NYU in any elevator as students students get on the elevator the phone comes out because that's like 30 seconds and it's awkward take the phone out scroll I would argue the professors too yeah that's true we do not you I'm spend time with you in an elevator yet but no we do we do but it's it's it's less it's yeah yeah um and then the other one that I did um that I is really memorable and I talk about this in the book um is an a walk and um I got this idea my friend daker Kelner he and I did research on a long ago and he really continued he wrote this amazing book called a um and there was great episode if you just Google uh Kelner and uh tippet so with Christa tippet he did this great discussion he talks about um how he used all walks to help him process his brother's early death from cancer and just walking in a beautiful environment walk a little more slowly than usual don't have anything in your ears don't be listening to music don't even bring your phone and just notice and it's magical it's amazing what happens when you do that um and for a lot of my students they've never done that because they have to take in so much stuff if I'm going from point A to point B of course I'm going to be listening to a podcast or or or you know scrolling on my phone while I'm walking and a lot of them they really had these transformative experiences you know we're right on Washington Square Park at myu where around Washington Square Park which is a gorgeous gorgeous Park it's really one of the most beautiful in America certainly one of the most beautiful Urban Parks I'd say um and the students who did their all walk through the park a lot of them have these just amazing experiences it's almost like like a like their heart is opening they feel more love for people they their anxiety goes down and so ever since they and so I did that myself and when I signed it I did it too and I had that sort of experience so now you know I I love my airpods they're amazingly convenient but I listen listen to them a lot less now like when when I'm walking in New York City I often just just nothing just nothing just look process think so yes I think young people are taking in way too much stuff total quantity of btes is just you know 10 times what it should be and they don't have time to process they don't have time they to develop an interior life to to think things through so we just got to cut it cut it way back if I step back from everything that you've said thus far and it's in your book it seems as if until 2012 or so what was rewarded in youth set us up for a more adaptive adulthood but now everything that's being rewarded in youth except from schools and teachers and parents but what's you know being rewarded on a momentto moment basis for Mo the majority of the Waking Life of these young people is maladaptive yeah that's right I mean it's it's so Stark that's right think about it this way um and imagine that your children are having a life out in the real world they're having Adventures they're doing things they're building forts in the forest they're doing all sorts of things and then one day you know a casino opens up nearby and it welcomes all the kids and that's where they spent all their time is in a casino and they're in the care of a company that is trying to extract as much money as it can from them and that's what they do eight or 10 hours a day it's an Abomination to think that a casino could own our children's childhood what if it wasn't a casino what if it was a brothel for the for the boys would be more of Interest let's say like again inconceivable that we would let that happen but what we've done is we've said well what if it's Snapchat what if it's Instagram what if it's Facebook well not so much Facebook what if it's Tik Tok these companies these are the some of the largest and most powerful companies in the world they essentially own our children's childhood this is where childhood is taking place on a few giant PL for-profit platforms who that use an Advertising based business model so they are motivated like the Cino to keep them in don't have a clock don't let them see what time it is keep them in don't let them click over to a link to another site keep them in um we somehow have seeded our children's childhood to Giant companies that have shown that they don't really care about our kids welfare they care much more about profitability and and they care about their customers who are the advertisers and these companies have been granted a special RIT from the King Congress said in in in the in section 230 of the communications decency act in 1996 I think it was Congress said oh and nobody sue you nobody can sue you for what you show to their kids uh there was a reason for that that you don't want AOL to be responsible for everything anyone posts but it's been so broadly interpreted that so far any attempt to regulate social media or any attempt to sue them is seen as like no no so you know it's just we somehow slipped into this and once you see it that way that it's as though our kids are being raised in hara's Casino you know like like no we've got to stop this last year I had the opportunity to speak to to some of the groups at these companies that are assigned to controlling the well-being of the young people that use their platforms and the major emphasis was on the type of content so protecting them against child Predators protecting them against pornography um but as you recall at the beginning of the conversation we broke things down into variables of time specific content Dynamics and maybe the visual interface itself I think for sake of today's discussion the visual interface is probably the least interesting but I can just tell you looking things up close uh a lot not good the eyeball lengthens you become nearsighted which is why spending two hours outside um even if on a tablet has been shown to offset myopia and oh wow thousands of people children anyway there's that piece but the time piece is interesting right maybe limiting the total amount of time on social media obviously the content issue is it only takes one exposure to a video of the sort that you described The Gauntlet I never want to see it whatever has to be done to my phone so that I never see it please uh let me know um but it just seems as if this has been allowed to it's like it's almost like an IV drip of glucose or something happening in the background we're saying okay just stay rigged up to um the glucose trip and then we wonder why we're end up with let's just say cognitively uh obese children yeah that's right the whenever there's New Media um The public's emphasis is always on the content and and so with television the emphasis was well violence on TV is this going to make them violent and it turns out not really watching violent on violence on TV doesn't really make you violent and video games these violent video games these firstperson shooter games are these going to make our kids into killers and there was a lot of research on that it looks like no it doesn't really it doesn't really do that and so many researchers then say see it's just a moral Panic it's okay but that is but that's focusing on the content and this was the great lesson from Marshall mclan and Neil Postman and all these great media theaters in the 20th Century um mcluen said the medium is the message don't Focus so much on the content of Television focus on the transformation of human life when the television becomes the family Hearth and people sit around watching it now from our vantage point today that's pretty darn social they're sitting with their family members together ex having an experience but mcl's point was that's the transformative thing the the what the technology does it's not the content and so in the same way a life on social media in some ways it's like television you're watching stuff but it's much more behaviorist with television you didn't have the constant I do something I'm rewarded I do something I'm rewarded so so social media is much much more addictive than television ever was that's one aspect of the uh television is not performative it doesn't make you live your life in front of a camera you're not in front of a camera you're a passive recipient whereas social media puts our kids in front of a camera um so in all these ways we we get distracted and and this is the the way you know in those Senate hearings uh it was all focused on content you know can't we can't we reduce the you know the number of beheading videos and the child pornography suppose we you know can't we reduce that by 90% wouldn't that be great you know Senator we have the you know World leading technology and doing this um yes that would be nice to for our kids to see less hardcore porn and and less violent videos that would be nice but if if we could make Instagram just be happy girls living beautiful lives and our daughters were to watch 8 hours a day of this is that good for them hell no so you know it is important to clean up the content but for kids going through puberty I think the only real answer is just delay just don't let them do that how much of the issue here is modeling of what adults are doing and um you know and how terrible are or good are adults at modulating their behavior I say modulating because you know I see a lot of parents um videotaping everything that they're you know on the phone all the time in line at the store while their kids are around you know and one of the reasons I think parents like divices so much is that it's a terrific uh lowc cost zero cost um babysitter it allows them to then go be on their phones or do other things yeah so young children are sometimes copying their parents young children are looking for things to copy uh and you know and so I I've got some slides in my regular book lecture of toy iPhones that we give to Tod ERS so they can be just like Mommy and Daddy um for little kids I think it might matter for teenagers you know I'm very often asked that question because and I think it's because parents they feel a little guilty like they know that they're modeling bad behavior and they're worried like is this setting up my kid for doing that and I can't say for sure but my intuition as a social psychologist is not really not very much and the reason is because you know while your kids once looked up to you and they once copied you like by the time they're 12 13 14 you know if I pick up if I start reading you know the economist Ma magazine where if I start knitting or whatever that's not going to make my 14-year-old daughter want to do those things because I'm doing them she is completely focused on what her peer group thinks of her of course she is that's that's the nature of teenage food they're moving away from the family they're trying to make their way on their own in a pure group Lisa deur is is great on on these issues um so I don't you know it would be nice if parents could improve their phone habits and boy phones at the table that's an important place that is a very important Place get across the idea that when we're eating we're with each other we're looking at each other and we're tasting our food we're experiencing the food so actually there modeling Collective behaviors like a meal I think that is actually very very valuable but if it's just that you know you're often multitasking you're often on your phone yeah you know be nice if you didn't but that's not going to push your kid over into phone addiction so the list of four things that you provided are terrific they are somewhat enforcement focused um as I recall and maybe this is not true but as I recall one of the ways that uh media was effective in getting kids to stop smoking was to pit them against these um wealthy old white men who were in rooms filled with smoke writhing their hands together cackling about the amount of money they were making stealing um the health of young people whereas telling teenagers that smoking was bad for them did very so is there a way to create a rebellion of ss against the smartphone um because kids love to Rebel teens love to Rebel not but first of all they don't anymore um oh no really but they're just they're just much more passive I don't think they they're they're Authority focused they're not as rebellious as as they used to be that's disappointing yeah now of course now we'd have to pit them against a group of you know young white men who are owning the social media companies I suppose um but you know this is this addiction is very different from tobacco or anything else tobacco is biologically addictive um and you can't get an entire High School addicted biologically at least it's very it didn't happen um in the peak year of smoking was 1997 37% of American High School students smoked two-thirds didn't but with social media you couldn't have that you couldn't have just a third it's either none or everybody and it's everybody and it happens in middle school so the Dynamics of a social media addiction are so it's a social addiction more than a more than a like you know biochemical like nicotine or cocaine type type addiction so I think the way to break out isn't hey these people are exploiting you that might be helpful we should definitely study that I think the way to break out is okay look you guys actually you can see what this is doing to you you mostly agree that this is wasting your time it's garbage you you want to way out but you just feel like you can't there's such resignation um but look the cool kids over there they have flip phones and they're out like every day after school they're like you know they're doing stuff they're down at you know they're in the mall they're they're getting pizza they're you know building a fort uh you know whatever depending on the age um so I think the way out is to give kids an exciting childhood kids are so lonely now and and they they don't have much in the way of Adventure they don't have much in the way of Thrills um you know you know I live I live in New York City um you know I would start I would like bring my kids out to Coney Island when they were you know 9 10 years old bring them out and then I would just say I'm just going to sit here you guys run around you guys go have fun like I'm not going to be with you you know you know yeah there's a chance you'll get kidnapped or struck by lightning although lightning is more likely um so and then it you know and then it got once they were you know in more you know like like 13 now they can actually take the subway out to Coney Island with a friend so um that's cool I think that's the way to do it don't make it like we're going to take away all this stuff from you hahah now you have nothing to do make it more like I'm not trying to hurt you here I want you to have fun the way I did and the way your grandparents did we all had human F childhoods full of Adventure I want that for you and I think most gen Z will Embrace that they just don't want to do it alone so the key is if you're listening to this podcast and if you have kids that are in elementary middle school be sure to talk with the parents of your kids friends so if if you want to make some changes in your phone policies if four families do it together now your kids's not going to feel left out or deprived and be sure to give them something give them say here you know what every how about every Friday let's call it free free play Friday no piano lessons on Friday no nothing on Friday Fridays you all get together you can start at anyone's house go out do what you want we'll even you know we'll give you you know we'll give you more allowance or we'll give you money to spend but go have experiences then it's fun it's not deprivation I love the uh trust in kids to sort things out and to be safe enough um at least the statistics say that they're more likely to thrive under those conditions than to be kidnapped or have something terrible happen I I like it also because it merges uh your previous book codling of the American mind um with the current book The anxious generation I have a bunch of other questions um but I think the most important one at this stage is how optimistic or pessimistic are you about the changes that you're hoping for and then the second question is how can we all help I mean you you mentioned these four action items no smartphone before high school no social media until 16 phone free schools and to Foster this exploration and Independence um and we will propagate those four things as far and wide as we can but I think everybody parents and kids I'm sure as well want to know like what can we do so um optimism scale zero being like you you're doing this as a last Stitch effort but it it's hopeless well you wouldn't be here if you thought it was hopeless so one to 10 one being just a sliver of Hope 10 being you know we got this same way we got other stuff I'm a 10 you're a 10 10 10.0 yeah and the reason is because I've never seen a situation like this I've been involved in a lot of efforts to change attitudes I ran a gun control group uh in college when I was you know 20 and that was impossible and I've been involved in political campaigns you're trying to persuade people and you can't get their attention and how do you mess them and it's really hard that's the way anybody involved in social change has experienced that that's most things this is like you drop a spark and everything goes everything it just goes everywhere um so all over the world all over the developed World family life has become a fight over screen time almost every parent of a kid over two recognizes this we all hate it we're sick of it and we've just been confused the only real push back I've got I've gotten two guys one is I am in a normal academic debate with about seven or eight research who say there's not evidence of causality I I believe there is I you know we're we're you know marshalling evidence against each other but but by and large almost everyone seems persuaded because they already knew this they already thought it they already saw it and what I've done with the book is just given them some psychological Concepts and some clear labels and a way out and I'm so confident in part because the revolution started in Britain in February um yes they drew on some of my older articles but this was before my book came out um parents are self-organizing in Britain the government is acting they actually have a functioning legislature in Britain and the and the the government has has led efforts to pass laws as well um so I know it's working in Britain um and I see it happening here now at a massive scale um the point of the book is collective action and parents all over the country are heeding that they're forming reading groups they're going in in a group to talk with the principal the principls and teachers they all hate the phones it makes their lives impossible they want a phone-free school but they were afraid of the few parents who freak out if they can't text their child during class if the schools are overwhelmed by parents saying please lock up the phones please let my child have six hours a day when she can listen to the teacher instead of do more Tik Tok um so I am I'm very very confident that childhood is going to look very different within two years I don't mean that it won't be seven-year-olds on phones but in the same way that we flipped on smoking we used to think it was okay to smoke in an airplane uh we used to think it was okay to smoke in restaurants it was okay to smoke everywhere we thought um and now we don't we don't think that anymore that took a long time to change but it did change I think because of the public disgust with seeing children just spending their childhood looking at a screen and because the public disgust with what we've heard about meta and and Tik Tok and a few of the other companies um I think within two years it's going to be widespread it'll be a norm that you just don't give kids social media in particular I mean iPads are complicated because you know you want kids you to watch movies is okay stories are good I'm not saying the you know iPad is a terrible thing but um our attitudes about this are going to change radically um and I think the great majority of schools are going to be phone free within two years um and we're going to see we're already seeing more kids outside lot every day I get I get emails from Greatful parents saying you know because of your book me know my six-year-old he wanted to ride his bicycle down to the end of our cesac he wanted to ride down Circle and come back and I never would let him because I was afraid that what what would the neighbors say but once I read your book I decided to let him and he was so ecstatic he kept doing it and doing it and now he's going further and he rides to his friends houses so people in her neighborhood now they're seeing a kid on a bicycle and if Suppose there were 10 kids doing it well now it's normal so we can renormalize human childhood in the real world where our kids get the chance to have independent adventures and learn how to be self-supervised adults ultimately we can do this okay so you're a 10 out of 10 on the optimism scale what can we do to facilitate and accelerate this whole process so once we understand that this is a collective action problem that we're all stuck in this because everyone else is stuck and we can't leave if we're the only ones once we understand that now you see the the the key is collective action and so or talk to your friends about this talk about the book with them you don't have to buy the book just go to anxious generation.com we have all kinds of resources I have video you I have talks where I've summarized the book in in videos um talk about it with your with your friends talk about it with your family uh uh talk about with other parents at the school if you're on social media social media is great for adults who want to pursue projects I just don't think it's good for kids to be pursued by the social media companies but if you're Instagram in particular that's where a lot of parents are especially mothers um talk about these issues say you're going to let your kid have some freeer range childhood you're going to try to do these for Norms um and then if you're able I hope that you'll support the projects um if you go to anxious generation.com there's a donate button um NYU has it set up so that people can donate into a research account for me and that's what I use to hire to pay my small staff I have about 4 five people working for me and I hope to grow that to 10 um I hope people donate to to me at anxious generation.com or to let grow um this wonderful organization that that advocates for giving playback and Independence back to kids let grow.org um and if you know influential people if you know state legislators um not a lot of there is some oh and in Congress there is a very important bill kosa the kids online safety act contact your legislators about that say you support kosa it could be coming up for a vote very very soon this is the one piece that really could get through the US Congress beyond the Congress a lot of states are acting which is very very EX in so make your views known to your state legislators if you know them or the mayor or Governor if you know them um this is a collective action trap the only way out is together so if we act together we can break this terrific and we'll put links to all of those things you just mentioned in the show note captions Jonathan you're bringing the humanity back uh it's it's remarkable and you know as a fellow academic I have to say your depth of scholarship in terms of developing and researching these ideas but also the Vigor and the mission that you have around doing good and making sure that it happens soon as opposed to waiting another 10 years and seeing just how bad this this can get um is really inspiring um I feel it I know for sure that people listening and and watching feel it and so I want to thank you for doing this work uh again I loved coddling in American mind because it just woke me up to how how much things had changed and were changing and it's such an important book and the anxious generation is truly an important book and I don't say that lightly um it's Mission driven goal driven and it has actionable items that I'm certain many people listening to this are going to um partaken so on behalf of the listeners and viewers and also myself but also the positive change to come I just want to say thank you for taking the time out of your very busy schedule you're still a professor you're also public facing health science educator like you yeah so um I feel like kinship there uh for coming here and speaking with us today and we'll provide links to the books and to these other resources in the show note captions and would love to have you back again um hopefully in the not too distant future so that we can review all the progress that you've stimulated so thank you so much well thanks so much Andrew and thanks for all the work that you do to bring to make science cool and interesting um so I really appreciate

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine recently the hubman Lab podcast hosted a live event at the Great Hall in Brisbane Australia the event was called the brain body contract and featured a lecture followed by a question and answer session with the audience we wanted to make the question and answer session available to everyone regardless if you could attend I also would like to thank the sponsors for the event they are eight sleep and ag1 eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity now I've spoken many times before on this podcast about the fact that sleep is the critical foundation for mental health physical health and performance now one of the key things to getting the best possible night sleep is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually needs to drop by about 1 to 3° and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and alert your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3° eight sleep mattress covers make it extremely easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and thereby to control your core body temperature so that you fall and stay deeply asleep and wake up feeling your absolute best I've been sleeping on an eight Sleep mattress cover for about 3 years now and it has completely transformed the quality of my sleep for the better eight sleep recently launched their newest generation of pod cover the Pod 4 ultra the Pod 4 cover has improved cooling and heating capacity higher Fidelity sleep tracking technology and the Pod 4 cover has snoring detection that will automatically lift your head a few degrees to improve air flow and stop your snoring if you'd like to try an eights Sleep mattress cover you can go to 8sleep.com huberman to save $350 off their pod 4 ultra eight sleep currently ships to the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's eights sleep.com huberman the other live event sponsor ag1 is a vitamin mineral prob drink that also contains adaptogens and other critical micronutrients I've been taking ag1 daily since 2012 so I'm delighted that they decided to sponsor the live event I started taking ag1 and I still take ag1 once or twice a day because it gives me vitamins and minerals that I might not be getting enough of from Whole Foods that I eat as well as adaptogens and micronutrients those adaptogens and micronutrients are really critical because even though I strive to eat most of my foods from unprocessed or minimally processed Whole Foods it's often hard to do so especially when I'm traveling and especially when I'm busy so by drinking a packet of ag1 in the morning and often times also again in the afternoon or evening I'm ensuring that I'm getting everything I need I'm covering all of my foundational nutritional needs and I like so many other people that take ag1 regularly just report feeling better and that shouldn't be surprising because it supports gut health and of course gut health supports immune system health and brain health and it's supporting a ton of different cellular and organ processes that all interact with one another so while certain supplements are really directed towards one specific outcome like sleeping better or being more alert ag1 really is foundational nutritional support it's really designed to support all of the systems of your brain and body that relate to mental health and physical health if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs with your order plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman and now for the live event at the Great Hall in Brisbane [Music] [Applause] [Music] Australia what are my thoughts on nicotine um nicotine causes cancer when it's consumed in the form of smoking vaping dipping or snuffing so don't do that um there's a debate now about vaping is it bad is it good it's bad um is it is is it worse for you than smoking probably not is it better probably slightly um you know what's better just not doing it um but if you need to do it and you have to pick you know I suppose um you know I'm not going to tell you what to do but I think that vaping has allowed a good number of people to smoke less I'll acknowledge that um and it's also clear it's not good for you so if you're going to going to do something that's bad for you do a bunch of things to offset the thing that's bad for you that's always my advice um but now in terms of nicotine itself nicotine doesn't cause cancer the mode of consumption causes cancer that's important nicotine um binds to so-called nicotinic acetycholine receptors so these exist naturally in your body and on your muscles they're the way that actually your nerves control contraction of your muscles um so the consumption of nicotine let's just say in um in I don't know about down here but in Europe it's becoming fairly common and in the Middle East also for people that take little pouches of nicotine can be absorbed um you know sublingually or through the gum gets into the bloodstream and it is truly a cognitive enhancer it's a cognitive enhancer not going to lie to you it will raise attention focus cognitive performance this is wellestablished the problem is it also raises blood pressure and causes vasil constriction this is well established so you know you have to ask yourself is it worth it do I do sometimes do I do it often do I choose to not do it at all I I don't think the young brain should be consuming nicotine even in these non-cancer uh causing uh forms like pouches um for a variety of reasons but mostly because the brain is so plastic at a young age anyway um but I actually am familiar with the use of nicotine for offsetting certain neurologic diseases when I was visiting Columbia Medical University in New York City some years ago I was in the office of a no Prize winner um won't tell you uh who it was necessarily um and he proceeded to consume no fewer than six pieces of Nicorette gum in our half hour meeting I like whoa at the time he was in his late 70s he's now in his 80s and I was like Hey listen like what's the deal with the nicotine and he said oh well it offsets Parkinson and Alzheimer's I said really he said yeah yeah you can increase cognitive function I used to smoke but I don't want to get cancer so I just chew a lot and a lot of neck rat okay really he's like yeah yeah yeah la nicet you know it it it can increase the amount of acetylcholine activation Through The Binding of these nicotinic acetylcholine receptors might even maintain some um dopaminergic neurons which are the neurons that one tends to lose with age and uh is rampant in diseases like Parkinson's I thought whoa okay so there's something there the fact of the matter is that nicotine can enhance focus alertness and learning but it does have those other issues so you want to be considerate of those other other issues and not become dependent on it and my experience is that people who taste the nicotine Focus From A Zin patch are those people who are buying those things pretty regularly I know somebody that went from one Zin patch twice a week to a canister a morning in about a month because the effect will wear off if you keep consuming it uh every day um you have to consume more and more so take that into consideration probably best to um avoid unless you need really need the Boost and you can afford the increase in blood pressure that would be my suggestion I've never taken nicotine and I don't smoke what's the best you can do for managing ADH if not taking medication okay so we did two episodes of The hubman L podcast on ADHD the first was on behavioral nutritional and supplement based tools 50% of the comments like thank you so much this is very helpful um can't wait to try some of the stuff the other will like get your evil um um you are you're trying to persuade people to not take Pharmaceuticals which is not true I I I'm interested in all of it I just covered that stuff in the first episode and then the second one we did on H ADHD was about things like viance adderal rlin Etc most of which by the way are amphetamines are we putting our kids on speed yes yeah they're amphetamines but I don't think that we should walk away from those things in every case they do have real clinical value in many cases and their clinical value comes from the fact that one not all but one of the major effects of amphetamines is that it can increase dopaminergic and nergic meaning dopamine and norrine release in the brain which can increase attention and focus which is actually beneficial in some cases for the brain to learn to focus to get neuroplasticity of those very circuits so it's a you know you know consideration then 50% of the comments of that second episode were why don't you talk about the behavioral tools the suppl based tools and the nutrition tools and um and that everyone else said thank you for talking about the prescription drugs so the point being several fold one is that certainly a combination of Behavioral nutritional supplement based and prescription tools is viable for most every situation and it's worth thinking about all of those when considering a treatment for ADHD and think we really need to get out of these silos of thinking you know like big Pharma is evil listen there are drugs that can help people is it evil I don't know is it going away no okay is there value there sometimes is it overprescribed sometimes what about nutritional tools well in some cases it can really help in other cases it one still needs prescription drug Tools in some cases doing behavioral nutritional or supplement based tools can allow one to take lower doses of pharmaceuticals if that's your goal I think it really needs to be tailored to the individual what I would like to see is more of a tailoring to the individual than the simple write a script send people off or tell people that it's all bad if it comes out of a prescription uh drug label format now it is very clear that the original dosing schedule for things like Aderall viance Etc was during the week weekday but not the weekends that somehow has moved to uh no weekends off so there's been a lot of changing in the the dosing schedules um and the way these drugs are taken are we creating a dependency on these drugs is always a big question and the answer seems to be a sort of very few people for whom these drugs work decide to come off them there's nothing magical about turning 25 after which you don't need these these enhancements but sometimes people don't need them or need as much of them because the neural circuits can be built up one thing that I would like to see more of is attention to the behavioral tools for ADHD not the least of which is what's being carried out in many schools and Clinics in China where people are being encour children are being encouraged to teach themselves how to maintain visual focus on a Target some distance away from them which then allows them to maintain cognitive focus when they move to their work the relationship between visual Focus as we've talked about a bunch of times tonight in the case of the cuddlefish ETC and cognitive focus is a an intimate one such that if you expect yourself to focus you you can't really expect yourself to drop into Focus as an immediate State you know so it's not a square wave function as you say you don't just sit down and drop into a state of Focus right we're so attracted to these Notions of of focus and we have these Concepts like flow and by the way I'm I'm not disparaging of those Concepts I know Stephen Cotler I have respect for him and his books um about flow but from a neuros psychiatric neuros pychological standpoint you know what we can really say about flow is that backwards spells wolf we don't really know that much about it um and so I think that if you expect yourself to focus you need to give yourself some warm-up time to focus don't assume that you have attention issues if you sit down and it takes five or 10 minutes to drop into a state of focus just like you wouldn't expect yourself to go out for a hard run without some sort of warm-up jog beforehand so the behavioral tools such as focusing on a visual Target are underexplored at least in most countries but in China and elsewhere they are being explored pretty extensively so I would encourage a full exploration of all the tools in this case it says not taking medication then obviously heavier Reliance on the behavioral tools is going to be helpful while I'm getting more sleep now I neglected sleep for many years me too and at least 15 years of getting just five or so am I doomed or can I offset this past damage you can offset the past damage one of the things that's really um wonderful about the brain and body is that it can compensate you know there's certain things that I get asked a lot I don't know why I get this question a lot but people say you know I smoked meth for years and then um can I get my neurons back and I'm like well you know it's neurotoxic but the fact that you're asking the question is reassuring um you know so don't start um but if you did you know I mean you can always do better than you're doing and you certainly can do better than you did in your past or at least that's what they tell me um um so really when it comes to sleep deprivation you know I spent many all nighters um I I wouldn't talk about sleep so much if I didn't have challenges with sleep I mean for a long time I slept like a bulldog I would sleep anywhere any time by the way folks if you ever walk down the street and you see a bulldog and you stop you'll notice they always stop they always seem so friendly they always stop they always stop and they look up at you and you pet them and like the reason they seem to like you so much is because they love to stop I owned one they're all about the stopping it's all it's not you it's about the stopping anyway the the goal is not necessarily to sleep as much as a bulldog actually it's the only animal see can't help myself it's the only animal for which there's a genetically induced apnea they're bracky calic which means they have a short snout they all those folds you know you know when the folds are there the folds are there because they have a genetic mutation they bred out the pain receptors in the face because they used to like have them like they would bull bait they bite on the face of the bull they kill all the pain they bred out the pain receptors gave them a floppy face short snout English Bulldog thank you for the specificity a biologist loves the specificity the Frenchies are pretty cool the Frenchies are pretty cool they have a little more kicking them right the Bulldogs little less and costell was a bulldog master so he was s of more or less like a sea turtle you know just slow movement stopping and he's going forward and you can move aside or in fact Costello was so mellow that when he would lie down on the floor had one of those you know kind of robot vacuums things we call a Roomba in our country it would come up to his face and he would just and it would bounce off his nose and he wouldn't even take the opportunity to Blink it's the Bulldog is sort of the essence of a om of effort and actually if you look at people people resemble different dog breeds I spent a lot of time thinking about this some dogs and some people have a bit more kind of reverberation in them they've got a higher RPM all the time all the time all the time and then they're the Bulldogs right Rick Rubin right there are these people that are just more still and we look at these people that are more still and think well there probably isn't that much going on in there but now we know from the Rick thing and the Carl thing that they're thinking a lot but in the case of Costello they don't don't get much done you know I maybe Costello wanted to get things done but I he if he woke up on New Year's Day and said all right 50 rabbits this year he never actually achieved that but listen the point is some of us sleep like Bulldogs some of us tend to go to sleep and wake up in the middle of the night I'm one of those people go to sleep four hours wake up I hate it it but I figured out that non-sleep deep breast or yoga needra has taught me how to fall back asleep really quickly and I can recover some sleep I haven't gotten through non-sleep deep breast some people are waking up in the middle of the night because they don't have their sleep timing right we have a series on sleep coming out soon with the great Matt Walker we record a six episode series with Matt and he talks about something I take no credit for this this is Matt's acronym qqr T quality quantity regularity and timing you want to pay attention to to the amount of sleep some people need six some people need eight if you only got seven for years and you're reading that you need eight or else you'll get dementia please don't worry about it it is simply not the case some people need less some people need more this varies across the lifespan then there's the quality how much of that sleep is continuous did you drink caffeine in the afternoon or alcohol in the evening in which case the quality will be diminished the regularity is very interesting going to sleep more or less five nights a week at least going to sleep more or less at the same time every night plus or minus an hour it's fine on the weekends I'm not just saying that so you don't all leave at once or a third of you leave um some people do Best by going to bed at 800 or 900 p.m. and waking up at 3:00 or 4 in the morning and that's where you would feel best in fact if you're somebody that wakes up at 3:00 or 4 in the morning you might be going to sleep too late and you have this intrinsic chronotype as it's called and you can shift your clock a bit later but most people want to go to bed sometime between 10:00 p.m. and midnight wake up sometime between 6:00 a.m. and 800 a.m. am and there's great variation there too um but you know qqr T so think about the quality the quantity the regularity and the timing once you dial those in everything is much much better so much so that even if you're not getting enough sleep as long as you're going to bed more or less the same time each night you'll you'll Faire better so if you didn't do any of this stuff for years like I didn't uh in when I was in graduate school Etc I don't despair don't despair um it's very clear that the brain can recover um and I wouldn't waste a single moment thinking about what you didn't do um also my time machine's broken your time machine's broken I realize that doesn't create a lot of comfort but it's unlikely that you did substantial damage unlikely you did substantial damage unless you did that your whole life and we're talking about a conversation that's happening late late in life but even then more sleep would be better do you believe in Burnout H if so what would be your recommendation protocol relinquish burnout once it's already occurred this is a very interesting question you know we don't quite know what burnout is and it can come from a combination of things um and typically burnout comes not during the stress period but several months afterwards you know that the adrenals you know these two little nuggets above our kidneys and our lower back are capable of driving so much neural energy in us that that we can do all sorts of things for a very long time even in the absence of food as long as we have water and salt you know that the adrenals because they kick out adrenaline and cortisol and by the way are involved in salt appetite there's a reason for that because you need that the adrenals can keep us going and there is no such thing as true adrenal burnout because the adrenals don't burn out you've got enough adrenaline in your adrenals for two lifetimes but there is an adrenal insufficiency syndrome so that's a real thing it's rare but it exists but burnout seems to be in my mind more related to psychological burnout and I'm not a psychologist but I'm a fan of the poet David White and he has this beautiful poem that is either entitled or somehow includes um the word wholeheartedness I think that where we recover ourselves is by relating to and engaging with things and people that we wholeheartedly enjoy even if that is simply relaxation or gardening or drawing or maybe just doing nothing for a bit I think burnout is very real and I think burnout as pushed through the filter of what we've been talking about earlier in the evening is when we are not getting periodic experiences if you will of delight or excitement or a sense of meaning and and here we're starting to drift into kind of abstract you know not everyone gets to do a job that they Delight in um certainly there were years where I didn't Delight in the sorts of things I had to do for certain jobs but finding some areas of life that create those neural energy states that carry forward that Wick out into other aspects of what we're doing and I don't know if I made this point clear enough earlier but those moments of you know really feeling excited about something in a way that really lights you up in particular are not just about that moment and seeking out more of those moments but in the way that it lifts our nervous system the way it carries us forward and allows us to do the other things that we have to do which frankly sometimes can be um not as exciting or even drudgery so if you've burnt out um I know the feeling I I have burnt out before and I encourage a combination of rest but also exploration of things that can evoke that kind of internal excitement or sense of meaning and one has to be a bit of a forager in in order to do that try new things and that can be difficult um but burnout is real and I encourage you to take it seriously because unfortunately typically what follows burnout is depression and then um things can really uh run ashore what types of food do you try to eat every day and why oh I love to eat um I do I love to eat I even like the mere Act of chewing so much so um it just yeah um that's why I buy those Persian cucumbers you just munch on those things all the time the um I tend to eat according to how alert or asleep I want to be it violates a few kind of popular thoughts about nutrition but that's what I do uh generally for me I like water caffeine um in early in the day and eat sometime around 11:00 or noon I'm not really strict about these things if I'm hungry I'll have a plate of eggs in the morning or something or a handful of macadamias by the way the macadamias down in Australia are awesome on they're so good in the states they like Infuse them with all these Palm kernel oils and stuff and so when I first tasted the ones and they taste good but they're I'm not like going to get into the seed oil debate I think a better ways to hang myself like with this micro microphone cord it's l like you know I don't I guess I do sort of avoid the seed oils but you know I feel best um I love the oh the macadamias see told you always find my way back the macadamias down here tastes as if they've been in infused with all sorts of stuff but then you look at the packaging it's just like macadamias and salt I don't know what is so good the coffee down here is amazing I know why it tastes so good it's so good the produce I mean basically I eat like you guys gals I that's what I do that's what I do I basically eat meat and eggs and fruit and vegetables and I do like rice and oatmeal and like there are people on social media tell you like oatmeal is going to kill you and I'm like if oatmeal were going to kill me I'd be dead like I eat so much oatmeal but that's not to say that some people feel better if they don't eat oatmeal I kind of find the nutrition debates to be kind of like like funny they're so non-scientific they're funny but I also know that and here I have a theory that when you eat most of your foods from unprocessed or minimally processed sources something magical happens not only are you let's say eating healthier foods quote unquote but we should Define healthier foods that for which their macronutrients proteins fats and carbohydrates also and calories tend to be matched pretty well with high micronutrient content something that doesn't exist in highly processed foods right but probably also better for the planet but which is great I'm not being planet's important we want to keep that around the um but the other thing is that neurally when you eat Foods as their main ingredients which is not say you can't have a soup or a stew or a salad every once in a while but closer to their original form and I do cook my meat unlike other people on the internet the there's the guy eating chicken raw for like 28 days I was in the barber shop the other day they're like what about the raw chicken guy and I was like not a good idea like the so when you eat Foods in their kind of basic state the brain can associate The Taste with the macronutrient and amino acid cont content and micronutrient content and we know that the gut is sensing a lot of that unconsciously subconsciously we know this through neural Pathways beautiful work being done by people here in Australia and in the states and elsewhere about the signaling of for the gut is actually tasting the food or it's it's measuring the amount of amino acids fatty acids Etc and so when you eat Foods in their kind of more original form nonprocessed or minimally processed it's clear that the brain starts to develop a more specific Intuition or appetite for what you need you start to know oh like I need some fat or I need some protein or I'm crave you start to Crave the things according to what's actually in them and highly processed foods and Rich combinations of foods don't allow you to do that so and that hasn't really been explored there's a little bit of work that's coming out on this by Dana small at Yale and um Kevin Hall elsewhere you know but it's we sort of starting to get there so this is why I believe when people go on these elimination diets where they like I'm only eating meat like the lion DED or whatever like Costello meat only and like that they many of those people quote unquote feel better I think because they're starting to form a relationship with the nutrient content of the food the chloric content and the taste in a way that after that they like see a cracker and they're like no you know they can kind of reset the neural circuits around appetite and all of this stuff but for me because I'm an omore like a normal person and sorry no disrespect to the carnivores I just kind of like the blood drinking like liver chomping car like come on like the um I'm going to catch a bullet or like a you know someone's going to thr a bone at me so I I I fear them more than I fear the vegans they'll just be like a bunch of you know the vegans will attack you online but in person they'll just like hit you with a parsley so it's not as you know the the um I'm going to get myself in trouble the um I'm an omav War like most people and the and so for me between 11:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. is typically when to eat but sometimes eat at 9: I didn't eat before this cuz I don't like to eat right before I do this sort of thing so I'll eat a meal before I go to sleep tonight I'm not super strict about this stuff I'm not super super strict but in general it's some sort of intermittent is fasting thing and it tends to be Meat and Fish and eggs and love parmesan cheese and coffee and oranges and cucumbers and lettuce and and and food like food and pasta and um and I I suppose that having done that for so many years I do you know adjust it like if I do a hard resistance training workout I'll eat a few more starchy carbohydrates to replenish glycogen but but I tend to avoid extremes with all that stuff and I love a great slice of pizza and I've sort of lost my taste for sweets but occasionally I'll I'll do that and I love vegetables like croissants and things of that sort so but you know all kidding aside um you know I do try and eat pretty healthy every day with a ton of info out there about health and wellness Andrew I love the way uh nikil um what are your top health and fitness style recommendations for someone who has a busy lifestyle this is a great question and you know I get accused a lot I can accuse a lot of a lot of things um but you know one of them is well no one can do all this stuff but we talked about it earlier we do the best with what we have and the time we have try and get some bright sunlight even through cloud cover especially through cloud cover every day I try and dim the lights or you know get under red light not Red Light Panel necessarily but just put in like red party light I've done that this whole trip when we traveled in the evening just it's just a red light bulb there it's not fancy just a red light bulb screws in this little pedestal turn that on all the other lights go off and then makes for a nice easy taper into sleep because you know the the blue the blue and bright fluorescent lights those short wavelength light really is activating for the nervous system especially late in the day so light is a big one for me try and get a few walks in I think if you were going to exercise just two days a week it's very clear that those two days per week should be include some resistance training exercise and then maybe follow up with some easy cardiovascular training or something like that um hopefully one could get out in about maybe three days or or exercise sometimes not outside one can only exercise indoors maybe three days per week so I don't think it takes a ton of time necessarily but that might even be excessive so with busy lifestyle I think it's those little carve outs of five or 10 minute walk um when we had Andy Galpin on the podcast and did a series and by the way Andy's launching his own podcast through our podcast um Channel um which is scom uh which Rob and I started um he's got the perform podcast with Andy Galpin he talked a little bit about these exercise snacks these are actually pretty cool um in the sense that if you just take 60 seconds and do you know like an near allout you know run up the stairs but be careful or jumping jacks for a minute as fast as you can that raises heart rate in a way and adjusts your physiology in a way that really does carry over to better performance including even things like V2 Max in other endeavors so it's probably not the case that that's all you should do but even small bouts of exercise can be very very valuable um so that that's reassuring and then I am a huge fan of non-sleep deep breast AKA Yoga Nidra which means yoga sleep which is just lying there as uh we talked about before but it's slightly different than what we were talking about for creativity lying there and deliberately inducing using your mind to deeply relax the different muscles of your body stay calm long exhale breathing this kind of thing there's a 10-minute nstr with my voice on YouTube that you can simply find and at zero cost there are many with other voices female voices Etc that you can find on YouTube as well and if you don't like those we're soon to release on our human lab Clips Channel a number of different meditations and nsdr again all zero cost of 10 minute 20 minute 30 minute I would say that for limiting stress improving sleep and restoring mental and physical Vigor nsdr is perhaps the best tool out there and again I didn't create it I simply took yoga Nedra I started calling it nsdr and by the way I was aware that I was going to upset some people when I did that I was not trying to appropriate anything I promise the problem was I would talk about Yoga Nidra and studies of yoga showing that it replenishes dopamine in the basil ganglia can restore mental and physical Vigor and then people would back away from me slowly like yoga I don't want to do yoga I'm like no no this is Yoga sleep you don't actually move and they're like well that sounds pretty different and I'm like I know it sounds different I'd go on and on and then I just decid to call it non-sleep deep rest and when you call something what it is or what it can accomplish you move away from nomenclature and um I have very mixed feelings about renaming things but I figured as long as I don't call it like the huberman protocol at least I'm distancing myself from it and it's a zeroc cost protocol so non-sleep deep rest is valuable for restoring mental and physical Vigor it can potentially help offset sleep that you didn't get it can help you fall back asleep at night if you do in the middle of the night it can help you get better at falling asleep if you do do it during the day I did it for 20 minutes just prior to coming out here I always do that um prior to any event that or thing that requires a lot of focus this kind of thing otherwise the jokes I tell are really you know just not okay and um so I do think it's quite valuable and it's something to explore at what age would you consider testosterone replacement therapy wow and what are the risk versus benefits of starting it sooner rather than later we got shouts well so one of the major effects of testosterone replacement therapy is is spontaneous shouting out in crowds um just kidding um you know there've been number of studies of testosterone in males and females by the way females have more testosterone than they do estrogen you know that right per deciliter of blood higher testosterone than estrogen just on average on average they tend to have lower testosterone than men per deciliter of blood so it's important in both males and females um I think you're referring James to the use of so-called trt in males but I'll touch on it in females as well because lowd dose trt therapy oop sorry I just did that I get in trouble in in if you say like PCR reaction ATM machine is there a name for that okay T the T at the end of trt is therapy testosterone replacement therapy testosterone replacement therapy technically means that someone's levels prior to that therapy fall outside the reference range so low lower than 300 nanograms per deciliter typically or some other array of symptoms at and they replace it replacement therapy many many people nowadays in my opin opinion for far too many and Too Young take what I call testosterone augmentation therapy where their levels are within normal range and then they take it to get out of range and look there's nothing wrong with that I'm not going to tell you what to do I'm not a cop you do what you want to do um there a couple things trt or tat augmentation and here we're just setting aside high do steroid use um cuz that's just a whole other Biz and and frankly the bodybuilders will get upset but um but I'll get away from you because you'll be waddling and I'll be running um the that's just like a whole other business so um testosterone replacement therapy is um widely used nowadays I think far too young basically it will lower your sperm count dramatically if you're a male so so you'd have if you want children um you want to conceive children you will need to offset that by taking something like human chonic gonadotrope and HCG um which is available synthetically they used to sell it in the form of pregnant women's urine um there was a black market for it we could really go off into the sticks with this question um my in my opinion if you want to explore this I would say first get your behaviors right sleep exercise nutrition stress control training get that right don't train too hard or too long get that right then there are certain supplements and we've talked about this on the podcast some are debated a little bit more than others things like zinc Tong Ali Etc that can probably provide a boost Beyond normal without shutting down the goads um and then and only then if you feel you really want to do this and it's in line with your ethics or you know I don't know if you're playing a drug tested sport Etc um then just minimal effective dose and then if you want to have kids someday or if you don't know if you want to have kids someday make sure you're taking the appropriate things to offset that that's basically what I would say and the major effect of testosterone in men and women is not libido per se and it's not aggression per se it tends to make people more like them if you're a jerk you're going become more of a jerk if you're calm you're become more calm if you're kind you're GNA I don't know if you become Kinder but there actually been studies of altruistic behavior and administration of testosterone by nasal spray or other means and frankly people will become more they'll become competitively altruistic um I think the major effect also could be described as it makes effort feel good so um we could go on and on about this I'll just toss in that nowadays there's a lot of excitement about peptides I'm going to do an episode about peptides a lot of the young people I run into um here and in the states are like what are you what are your thoughts on bpc c57 what do you think about this peptide or that peptide peptides are simply small proteins um amino acid chains um so there are lots of things called peptides but typically these are things that increase growth hormone that keep in mind that anything that increases growth hormone will increase the growth of any and all tissues so if you have a small tumor that you're not aware of that will grow also so just keep in mind if you're going to tickle these Pathways you're you're playing some with some serious biology but there are safe ways to do it sorry you said What are the benefits of star it sooner rather than later uh start it later what are the physiological and practical differences between breathing techniques can do Wim Hoff and the physiological side relation stress Focus Etc okay we can make this pretty straightforward first of all I know whim we go way back to 2015 I went over to the Pyrenees and visited him and hung out and then brought him to the states and you wiim Hof breathing is Tumo breathing but in science speak we call it cyclic hyperventilation it's just cyclic hyperventilation so um if you inhale vigorously and long your heart rate goes up if you exhale vigorously and long heart rate goes down through a process called respiratory sinus arhythmia volume of the heart changes when you breathe in versus breathe out speed at which blood moves through the heart changes as the blood gets bigger or smaller according to inhales exhales and basically the net effect is inhale heart speeds up a little bit exhale heart slows down a little bit so so if you do Wim Hof AKA Tumo breathing and you inhale vigorously and let it fall out of your mouth and then you're going to increase heart rate increase autonomic activation Etc if you do a pattern of breathing like inhale inhale long exhale inhale inhale long exhale cyclic sighing over time you're going to slow the heart rate down and you're going to calm down that's just how it works so when I hear about box breathing or now you hear about box breathing okay it's relatively equal ratios of inhale exhale so a little bit of pause in there that's the Box inhale hold exhale hold inhale hold exhale hold of varying durations depending on your so-called carbon dioxide tolerance but at the end of the day you're maintaining kind of even heart rate when you do big cyclic hyperventilation AK Wim Hoff Tumo breathing your increasing heart rate in autonomic arousal release of adrenaline do cyclic sighing a lot of exhales the opposite is true okay so that should give you a framework for thinking about breathing and how to apply different breathing techniques and get us away from some of the naming of things but I'm not trying to take anything away from so-called Wim Hoff breathing um by the way if you're going to do Wim Hoff breathing be very very careful to not do cyclic hyperventilation or whm Hoff breathing and then do breath holds and don't do it and anywhere don't do that anywhere near water there have been cases of people drowning dying from combining cyclic hyperventilation and breathholds with water because it changes the threshold for shallow water blockout when you exhale a lot or when you hyperventilate you remove a lot of carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide is the stimulus to gasp so what will happen is indeed if you do you're blowing off a lot of carbon dioxide and you go right that's a whim exhale and then you hold and you go underwater yeah you'll hold your breath longer than you normally would but instead of feeling that impulse to breathe like the that gas reflex and you shoot for the surface you'll just BL done so it's a serious thing and you want to be really careful to not combine cyclic hyperventilation and breath holds and especially both with cold water frankly any water exposure I always say don't do Wim Hoff Tumo or cyclic hyperventilation breathing even standing or seated in a puddle okay so in response to stress it's really if you want to be more alert increase the Vigor and duration of your inhales if you want to be more calm increase the duration of your exhales would you recommend that children also get morning sunlight yes and your pets too unless they're nocturnal pets right for anyone that had the not so smart idea of getting a hamster you realize they're nocturnal right they're going to run all night long on the wheel in fact rodents like to run on Wheels so much that hoppy Hofer at Harvard has shown that if you put a little running wheel like you know little wheels that the mice like to run in there in a field animals will run to the wheel and run in the field which tells you everything you need to know about rodents but really um children need that but obviously babies have sensitive eyes you you know we all can potentially hurt ourselves with sunlight and down here the UV index is very high when the sun is low in the Sky so-call low solar angle sunlight in the morning and in the evening the UV index and be mostly because of atmospheric interference but some other things as well it does it's not as damaging to the eyes that's why it's easier to watch a sunrise or a Sun closer to the Horizon it is to you know please don't stare at the sun in any case but an overhead Sun so I I think it's really important for circadian rhythms but of course kids need their sleep so if they're going to sleep in a little bit that's fine just get them outside afterwards it's the staying inside and staying on a phone that's problematic and then leaving that room at noon really shift your circadian rhythm in unhealthy ways and that's true for children perhaps especially true for children as a father what can I be doing to give my children the best start in life what a great question I hope my parents ask that um they abandoned me at the pet store no I'm kidding they didn't they didn't abandon me they didn't abandon me at the bed store um if they did I didn't notice I was among my friends the fishes and the birds um I think this question probably should be I'm going to I'm going to edit just say what can we all be doing to give our children the best start in life and and what does that mean for those of us that have already started in life um so first of all we have a episode of The hubman Lab podcast with an absolutely magnificent guest Dr Becky Kennedy um coming out on I guess it' be Tuesday down here so this coming week all about this and you know we could talk about things for learning encourage them to play an instrument um I would think that we perhaps should teach kids some tools to modulate their stress in real time like physiological size I don't see why not um I certainly wish I had tools to regulate my stress when I was younger now they didn't teach us that stuff they didn't know it where it the knowledge was there but as I mentioned earlier they didn't teach us that stuff they taught us all sorts of stuff in high school health and stuff I mean they they taught us that you know drunk driving's bad um they taught us it just takes one sperm one time they um they taught us all sorts of stuff but they didn't teach us the uh this business of physiological size or stress thresholds or about the intering L cortex because a lot of that stuff wasn't known or just wasn't discussed so I think some tools to control one 's inner landscape play music I certainly am going to encourage the exploration of these energy states that you know letting kids explore I mean they need rules and Regulation and boundaries of course but there's this concept of impingement that I find very interesting that the classic psychologists used to talk about you know when we when a kid says they like something or don't like things like yes they need to be doing certain things for their normal life progression but kids are very good sensors of what works for them and what doesn't work for them we don't want to impinge on certainly their healthy loves and desires things that don't endanger them right things that are really reflect their unique loves and desires don't force them to play Suzuki violin if they want to play the drums right let let them bang on stuff and let the kids that want to play Suzuki violin do that don't make them play the drums so these impingements actually I think are are problematic they they lead to a lot of Confusion And if anything else they you know they they take us away from that unique wiring to be our own unique expression um Becky Kennedy does describe a few key principles of parenting that I think are really interesting that extend to all kinds of relationships she talks about the main role of parenting and to some extent all relationships is to create boundaries and to make kids feel safe seems pretty good to me um the other kind of short list of two things and she describes how to do this in in ways that um are highly actionable is that every child I found this really interesting every child wants to feel real like they want to feel like they're real like they're seen they exist and they want to feel safe and so that one of the things that really rung in my ears and still does from that episode recording again out this week is that when a kid or an adult says something about how they feel that perhaps one of the best responses we can give them is you know I believe you like that it doesn't you're not saying that like you don't want to go to school don't go to school right we're not saying you don't you don't enjoy doing something don't do it or or you want like a you know a fifth serving of candy like you can say like I believe you you know no um you know and so I think that a lot of it is is is you know we get confused with terms like validation and listening I mean what I like so much about what Becky offers um and I'm I do hope to do a Child Development series and the not too distant future um what what I like so much about what Becky offers is that you know it boils down to simple Concepts like we want to be real which I guess is a kind of an analog for scene and we want to feel safe not unlike when we did the podcast series on Mental Health with Dr Paul kti he said you know it's really about mental health is really about agency and gratitude but there are a lot of things that siphon up into those feelings or those moments of or that state of agency and gratitude so I I would say that's perhaps the most important thing is you know boundaries make kids feel safe and then make them feel real like their feelings and and what they're reporting matters um and then of course the impingement thing becomes a little bit complicated because they do need boundaries so we have to constrain their wishes sometimes and their behavior but we don't want to do it in a way that takes them away from that unique wiring that makes them who they are so they can become you know the the characters and people and professionals and creatives and scientists and Poets and just you know good people right everyday good people so that's the best answer I can provide at this time they're not going to give me another question but I can keep going just briefly if I may um by just first of all saying that um again I'm very very grateful for the opportunity to convene with all of you here tonight I realized it was me speaking and you listening except for the guy on testosterone and um and I and I certainly um you know I I can't really express it enough in words what um the podcast means to me you know it's uh it's a it's a bizarre uh it's a bizarre thing it's completely transformed my life it's um made it you know incredible um I never dreamed of anything like this but for me it's really not about hearing my own voice it's it's this compulsion that came at an early age and and it's really my wish frankly that um the tools the protocols the knowledge whatever it inspires you to do or to think um you know we don't have to agree on everything I would hope we don't agree on everything the ways we disagree um with me and with each other and with others that you know that we start maybe thinking about ourselves as through a lens of science um and think about health and and and really trying to meet those discussions with with the kind of benevolence and curiosity and you know Vigor you know a good argument every once in a while it's healthy too um that it really deserves you know I think we're we're in very interesting and kind of sometimes scary time um I often feel scared frankly um because of what I see and and even my own position in this whole landscape I sometimes think like I feel like a lot of times things are just kind of hanging on by a thread but I actually have a lot of optimism I think our species is very smart I think that um we've managed to navigate tricky places before and I think that through the learning and teaching of things that work for us that we learned from this these kinds of things and from each other that pretty soon we're going to start to fill in the gaps between the silos that are the yoga Traditions the chiropractic massage health and fitness traditional medicine non-traditional medicine functional medicine I mean I really encourage all of you to try and you know stand back from it all and try and identify the common themes that may exist across these things and and really try and identify some of the the links and points of convergence more than the differences and and at the very least to explore things if you don't like them you know that's great and if you do to pass them on to other people um especially the behavioral tools that we all Harbor within us that I think can really uh enhance our mental health and vigor um our physical health and hopefully our longevity too so I could go on and on but I really just want to say thank you so much for coming out tonight um this is our last night in Australia and I'm certainly going to miss being here and we intend to come back again soon thank you so much for paying tuning into the podcast paying attention to and tuning into the podcast and for being willing to learn you're all amazing students and you're also amazing teachers I learned from you all uh in comments and feedback so um if you have that please keep that coming and last but certainly not least thank you for your interest in [Applause] science actually I've never done this before but because it's my last night here I've I've always seen people do this and I've never done it but I'm going to do it can we get the house lights up I want to get one of these like I'm going to do this as a video and you don't have to do it your faces will show up but don't worry we won't um it will on the internet but this is not for me I just want to I'm going to send my mother this okay there we go thank you that's on you thank you you made my mother very happy [Music]

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Mary Clair Haver Dr Mary Clair Haver is a board-certified OBGYN and an expert in perim menopause menopause and all aspects of female specific health during today's episode Dr Haver explains exactly what per menopause and menopause represent in terms of their underlying psychology and biology and the specific actions that all women can and should take in order to navigate these stages in Optimal Health she also describes the things that all women should know and do long before per menopause arrives in order to best navigate perimenopause and menopause once they arrive we discuss specific nutritional practices supplementation practices as well as conversations that you should have with your mother and with your physician in particular your OBGYN not just as per menopause and menopause approach but at every developmental stage a fair amount of our discussion centers around hormone replacement therapy not just for estrogen but for testosterone in women as well and the many misconceptions and controversies that exist around hormone replacement therapy for menopause Dr Haver explains how the specific timing in which hormone therapy is initiated plays a key role in whether or not the hormone therapy is beneficial for women or not and of course today's discussion gets into ways to offset some of the more common difficulties associated with menopause including sleep issues hot flashes inflammation and more by the end of today's episode you will have a clear picture from Dr Marie Clare Haver about what per menopause and menopause actually represent the best way to approach perimenopause and menopause and the various considerations around hormone therapy and lifestyle choices that can allow any woman to approach the years of Perry menopause and menopause and Beyond with the utmost vitality and wellness before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is arero press Aero press is like a French press but a French press that always Brews the perfect cup of coffee meaning no bitterness and excellent taste Aeropress achieves the perfect cup of coffee because it uses a very short contact time between the hot water and the coffee the entire thing takes only about 3 minutes I started using an aero press over 10 years ago I first learned about it from a guy named Alan Adler who a former Stanford engineer and inventor he developed the aobi Frisbee which I believe still holds the Guinness book world's records for the furthest thrown object in any event I'm a big fan of Adler's inventions so when I heard he developed a coffee maker the Aero press I tried tried it and I found that indeed it makes the best possible tasting cup of coffee and I'm not alone in my love of the Aeropress coffee maker with over 55,000 fstar reviews Aeropress is the best reviewed coffee press in the world Aeropress also just released a new Aeropress tumbler that makes brewing coffee when traveling or anywhere incredibly easy this new Aeropress go plus is incredible it's super compact easy to clean and you can use it anywhere all you need is hot water and some coffee and again it's very easy to clean up also with Father's Day coming up it makes for a terrific Father's Day gift if you'd like to try Aeropress you can go to Aero press.com huberman to get 20% off Aeropress currently ships in the USA Canada and to over 60 other countries around the world again that's Aeropress docomo today's episode is also brought To Us by eight8 sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity now I've spoken many times before in this podcast about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts of quality sleep each night one of the best ways to ensure a great night's sleep is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3° and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3° eight sleep makes it incredibly easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment by allowing you to program the temperature of your mattress cover at the beginning middle and end of the night eight sleep also tracks your sleep with very high Precision it will tell you how much slow wave sleep you're getting how much rapid eye movement sleep you're getting Each of which is critical for different aspects of physical and emotional recovery during sleep and that allows you to dial in the exact temperature parameters to really ensure that you get the best possible night's sleep I've been sleeping on an eights Sleep mattress cover for well over 3 years now and it has completely transformed my sleep for the better eights sleep recently launched their newest generation pod cover the Pod 4 ultra the Pod 4 ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity High Fidelity sleep tracking technology and it also has snoring detection that remarkably will automatically lift your head a few degrees to improve your air flow and stop your snoring if you'd like to try an eights Sleep mattress cover you can go to 8sleep.com huberman to save $350 off their pod 4 ultra eight sleep currently ships to the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's eights sleep.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by betterhelp better help offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out completely online I've been going to therapy for over 30 years initially I didn't have a choice it was a condition of being allowed back in high school but soon I realized that quality therapy can be extremely valuable and I now consider doing therapy as important as getting regular exercise including cardiovascular exercise and resistance training which of course I also do every week therapy provided it's with a therapist with whom you have excellent Rapport and feel supported by and from whom you can gain valuable insights can be immensely valuable because it leads to healthier thought patterns and actions related to your personal and professional life in fact I see doing quality therapy is a powerful way to direct your focus and attention toward what really matters if you'd like to try better help you can go to betterhelp.com huberman to get 10% off your first month again that's betterhelp.com huberman and now for my discussion with Dr maryclair Haver Dr maryclair Haver welcome thanks for having me delighted to have you here and to learn about menopause and other aspects of women's health there's a lot happening in this area right now yeah and you are at the center of what I understand is a new direction for the understanding and treatment of menopause that's what we hope and related themes like per menopause yeah and the many important aspects of female Health that stem from it like cardiovascular disease osteoporosis right and so on so we will get into all of that today but just to kick things off how do we Define menopause so the medical definition of menopause which I have a huge problem with is one year after the final menstrual period And the reason why I have a problem with it is not everyone has a menstrual period what if you've had a hysterctomy what if you have an IUD what if you've had an ablation or something that's suppressing your periods PCOS so for a lot of women and even clinicians they are struggling to like find that diagnosis because it doesn't fit everything what it represents is something much bigger menopause is also one day of your life it is that one day exactly one year after your last period but it represents the end of your ovarian function some of us call it ovarian failure ovarian sence but basically what separates males and females is many things separate us but in my world um we are born with all of our eggs we have 1 to two million at Birth by the time we're 30 most of us are down to about 10% maybe 120,000 by the time we're 40 we're down to 3% of our egg supply and the quality is declining as well so menopause is when you have no more eggs left and therefore no more sex hormone or very little sex hormone production from the ovaries so estradiol levels will decline less than 1% of your reproductive years your progesterone levels will decline as well testosterone declines for sure but we have other ways to produce it so it's somewhere 50% or less than your healthiest years so is it fair to say that we need a redefinition of what menopause is I think so I think defining it as the presence or absence of a period is a mistake is there any consensus about the quote unquote typical age of onset for men and paws and is it changing you know I hear a lot about how the onset set of puberty is Shifting earlier in females and given that puberty at least by some definitions relates to the onset of menes uh one could imagine that menopause would be shifting earlier as well so the things that determine when we have puberty or not are different than the things that determine when we run out of eggs um right now in the US it's the average age of that one year after your cycle so menopause that one day is about 51 to 52 years old however normal is still 45 to 55 and there's a big variation you know that curves pretty wide um Perry menopause begins 7 to 10 years before that last minstral period wow okay I say wow because um it's the first time I've ever heard a specific number tacked to this word per menopause maybe we could talk a little bit about per menopause since it sounds like it represents a transition phase into official menopause right um however one chooses to Define that what are some of the I don't know if I should call them symptoms sure where I should uh just well let me let me do let me walk you through the endocrinology and then we can go through symptoms so you understand so in a normal healthy menstrual cycle before menopause ever becomes an issue the female hormone cycle is a very EKG like reproducible monthly rise and fall of estrogen progesterone and then the brain hormones LH FSH and then g& RH so the way it works is our brain in the hypothalamus um is sensing for has a little sensor in the blood looking for estradiol levels and when they get low it sends G&R down to the pituitary saying hey tell the ovaries to start trying to ovulate so we can get more estrogen on board the process of ovulation is what drives up our estrogen levels okay so pituitary sends out the pulses of LH and FSH which then lead to ovulation when we reach in perimenopause the beginning of perimenopause that critical level of egg supply those signals don't work as well we start becoming resistant to the LH and FSH pulle surges so the brains like hey I told you we need more estradiol and the pituitary is like I sent the signal and the brains like send more so we get much higher pulses of FSH and then finally the ovary kind of is able to get that egg out but sometimes it's delayed so we have the timing of that monthly predictable cycle goes arise sometimes the periods are closer together sometimes they're further apart but also the estrogen and progesterone levels start changing dramatically we see much higher surges of estradiol than we ever had in our pre productive years and then much lower levels underneath so we end up with this very volatile curve and not predictable at all we call it in our world the zone of chaos so it is literal hormonal chaos what used to look like this you know every month is now just just insane and very very very unpredictable that is why we don't have a good blood test in per menopause to make the diagnosis those of us in the mense use symptoms usually to make the diagnosis and we rule out other conditions that might overlap so per menopause basically critical threshold it's a downward Trend overall of estradiol but is a very chaotic you know race till you Flatline and bottom out I see so for those listening um your description of the um kind of the amplitude of the estrogen surge it gets much greater in this per menopause phase you also mentioned that follicle stimulating hormone which comes from the pituitary has to be or somehow is upregulated in this phase because I don't know is it that the recept for FSH are somehow not responsive at the level of the ovary do we know what's happening to the ovary is it obviously the signals getting there it's not effective so then the brain is kicking out more FSH is it that the quality is poor and then around each germ cell is the tholian cells which is actually where the estradi the whole pathway going from you know actually testosterone's converted to estrad so that whole pathway you know it still will respond but the cells are just old you know is the way that it's been explained to me and from what I've read I think we need a lot more research in this area because that is how we're going to help women I think longer term is understanding that process better but you know all I learned in school 25 years ago was it's the transition to menopause the end you know the whole endocrinological process I didn't learn till about two years ago and my guess is just based on my understanding of the only recent Trend toward emphasizing studies of both female and male even just mice in mouse models which is where generally this stuff originates and then it shifts into humans once certain targets are identified um only recently has the NIH insisted that there be uh female uh mice in the studies of mice I mean it's it's been a few years now but that's a you know sex as a biological variable is is actually a requirement in most Grant applications unless of course there's a specific reason to study only one or the other um sex of mice so you can imagine that um the dir of research in this area is due to a a long um desert of um absence of studies into what is per menopause right so for women who are in the age range of per menopause or who are thinking about this are there things that they can do in order to either upregulate the sensitivity of the ovary to FSH or to somehow prolong this period of per menopause um and I should also say what are some reasons why they would want to do that um you know obviously this is part of the um of the Arc of maturation of the female reproductive axis but of course that alone is not a reason to not try and um I guess we say optimize it for one's well-being so we don't know when you the best way I can highlight why we don't know or or where the dollars are going for research you know we go to PubMed and you type in the word pregnancy 1.1 million articles come up type in the word menopause it's down to 97,000 really you type in the word per menopause and I checked this like 2 weeks ago and it was like 6,400 and something wow yeah that is surprising so or maybe it shouldn't be surprising given what we were just talking about in terms of so as far as like why those cells are becoming resistant and what's happening at the level of the receptor I think we need a lot more research in this area I think it's starting to happen because women are realizing there's a demand now because the older you are when you go through menopause the healthier you are for cardi metabolic disease it's the loss of estrogen that accelerates our path to those diseases so are there clinical signs of perimenopause that either directly or indirectly relate to these bigger surges in FSH and these larger amplitude um estrogen uh surges the the two best documented and studied are mental health changes um the brain does not like the chaos of and and the neurotransmitters are very very sensitive to estrogen and progesterone and even testosterone and so we see aberration in serotonin and orpine and and dopamine as the levels start becoming chaotic so we have at least a 40% increase of mental health disorders in and SSRI use doubles across the menopause transition across per menopause and now the data is showing that women who are given hormone therapy in their per menopause have a lower incidence of neonet depression and now the neuroscientists are saying hey for these women who are developing depression in per menopause giving them estrogen is better than an SSRI they're going to have a better outcome I think most people don't realize how rich the brain and rest of the nervous system are with hormone receptors in particular I estrogen receptors and as you mentioned testosterone receptors as well Androgen receptors um and the often direct relationship between estrogen and the neuromodulators such as serotonin dopamine epinephrine aceto Gaba for for um progesterone yeah it's it's interesting during neural development which is where I started off which was um neural embryonic development the hormones exert you know these widespread roles in defining even which neurons will Express certain neurotransmitters and then somehow the field of Neuroscience is only recently gotten on board the idea that um this intimate relationship between hormones and neurotransmitters is something to consider in essentially every aspect of of brain health right not just cognition but maintenance of neurons and um offsetting neurod degeneration and so on um I mentioned that only um so that people I think typically think of hormones as something sure there's a signal from the brain and but that hormones are mostly of the body when in fact hormones play an absolutely crucial role within the brain yeah so you mentioned that during per menopause there there are symptoms that are I guess it's are mainly reflected as shifts in mental health so is this women suddenly feeling um kind of um less uh optimistic is it like what what's the sort of um constellation of of of psychological shifts that can occur so we see uh increasing anxiety we see definitely loss of executive functioning so new onset of add type symptoms um we see of course the cognitive you know what we call brain fog and and lay terminology which is cognitive you know so they lose their words they're not able to do the calculations at work like their executive functioning ability in their jobs is huge like one in five women will quit their jobs because of menopause symptoms um that's that's an outrageous number yeah and the the economic impact is huge and so now companies are starting to get on board and this is a Time Of Our Lives when the kids are grown for a lot of us you know and we're trying we're ready to lean into our positions and really get into leadership we have all this experience and now we can't REM you know and now all of a sudden these and their confidence is just wrecked so and then the depression and they're not sleeping and like it's this horrible feedback cycle that they end up in that we end up in yeah I wasn't aware that one in five is is striking that came out of the UK but they're starting to like crunch the numbers here in the US and it's looking very similar I know we're going to get into actionable tools later as it relates to menopause but as long as we're discussing this phase of per menopause uh what are some of the basic things sure that women could a pay attention to we don't want to make people hypervigilant to the point of anxiety but but um certainly given the frequency and given the implications um it's important for them to pay attention to this phase and then some of the things that they can do to you know either behaviorally or perhaps through other tools offset um some of these changes uh dysfunctional uterine bleeding um which is abnormal periods so and again nothing's off the table it could be heavy periods menaga too frequent too few skipping it's really really chaotic and but a lot of women are suffering horribly from really debilitating periods either through the volume of blood loss or they're having you know cramps and you know really and so 90% of us will have that as a symptom um fatigue is a huge one a lot of them the symptoms are kind of vague you know and can be attributed to a lot of other things in our in my what we call the menopausia chat group you know we have a lot of theories about a lot of conditions like fibromyalgia and the irritable bladder syndromes and that probably just per menopausa menopause and doctors didn't know how to put you know make that diagnosis and so you know muscular skeletal system takes a huge hit through the transition so all of a sudden you have no injury and you're having hip pain joint pain back pain with you know you go to the doctor and you get an x-ray you do whatever work up and they can't find anything wrong palpitations are huge it is a vasomotor symptom so along with hot flashes palpitation so a woman will walk into the emergency room sweating profusely horrible palpitation she's anxiety and they'll tell her she's having a panic attack you know um they'll work her up you know everything's negative and just say well it's panic attack go home and no one knew to connect the dots and figure out that this woman was in her menopause transition and this is how her body was expressing it it's complicated because we have sex hormone receptors as you do in every organ system of our body and when these levels start going chaotic it can present in so many different ways and so when the patients come to me I'm doing blood work not a lot of hormone levels because they're not super helpful but I am doing thyroid workups and autoimmune workups and looking for nutritional deficiencies and anemia and different things because I don't want to miss those things and just pen everything on per menopause are there lifestyle factors that can offset some of this it's not a perfect correlation but the healthier you are so anti-inflammatory diet you know Mediterranean s galison dietes you know nutrition pattern um regular exercise good sleep habits you know all the pillars of Health the healthier you are when you hit per menopause the better the course is going to be for you they're looking at extending the life of the ovary with pharmacology we know what can shut it down faster so we have kind of a genetic predetermined age of when you're going to lose all your eggs but we can speed that up so if you smoke you're going to go through menopause sooner than your twin would have if she didn't smoke okay if you don't have children and you ovulate regularly then the more you OV the faster you run through your egg supply okay interesting I I wasn't aware of those data that's I I don't know that most people are aware of those if you have a hysterctomy and you leave your ovaries behind I didn't know I didn't never counsel my patients about this you lose four years off the life of your ovaries if you have a tubal liation you use lose a year and a half huge genetic disparities so African-Americans tend to go through a year and a half sooner and then there's caucasians in the middle and then Asian family tend to go through later and they're not sure why you know a year or two years years so there are if you have chemotherapy if you have surgery if you have any inflammatory process in the abdomen irritable bowel or endometriosis you're going to lose some of the life of the ovary you mentioned smoking are there any data on vaping not yet I haven't seen any there might be out there I just haven't seen it yet no I'm I'm guessing uh if they're out there they're not um prominent or you would have seen them I'm curious about vaping because a lot of people are vaping instead of smoking and hopefully people are neither vaping nor smoking because it seems that we had an expert on vaping on the podcast recently from Stanford and it seems that um there's nothing great about it right and there may be some things really bad about it but was just curious given that a number of young women and men for that matter are vaping nowadays who smoking rates have gone way way down another 10 years before we'd be able to you know see when those women are going through menopause you know because vaping I think of vaping as younger the younger generation um like my kids they're they people in their 20s and 30s 10 V so we're you know we're 20 years out from seeing how it's going to affect them is there any evidence that alcohol can impact menopause I haven't seen any but I can't imagine that you know heavy use of alcohol would prolong the life of the ovary in any way right so um and we know that any use of alcohol has some potential role in disrupting sleep and presumably like everything else uh if you disrupt sleep you disrupt things for the for the worse and got it so you mentioned um rough ages for onset of uh menopause um 51 but anywhere from 45 to 55 and the per menopause uh is defined as a period about seven years prior to that 7 to 10 okay um what's the earliest you've ever had a patient come in who entered menopause what's the latest you personal patient 27 and she came in just a couple months ago so she had a special condition we call premature ovarian failure and she had found me on social media and wanted to come just to make sure she was doing everything right and so early menopause is defined as between the ages of 40 and 45 and then premature menopause or pre premature ovarian insufficiency it's not a complete failure for most women but it is very very low is any time before the age of 40 so this patient kind of got kicked around for 2 years went to her doctor no periods horrible hot flashes again she was 25 and it was not on his radar and he never tested her for menopause and it took her you know 18 months to get the diagnosis and so the longer your body is away from estrogen the higher the risk factor and it's been all over the news this week where we know that untreated premature ovarian insufficiency has a earlier death so they have higher cardiovascular disease diabetes stroke all because estrogen is so protective and they have to go so long without it we can back negate most of those risks by giving her aggressive hormone therapy early so she came in to make sure she was on the right dose because in premature ovarian failure we don't want to give them menopause hormone therapy doses they're too low we want to get her more like she would have which is three to four times the amount of estrogen as a reproductive aged woman and so and she wanted to have a period so she would seem like her friends you know it was an emotional thing for her which I totally respect and so um so we were doing cyclical progesterone for her so that she would have a withdrawal bleed and feel like she was normal basic question but I I'm curious all I'll ask um given that levels of estrogen change so much naturally during the course of the um ovulation cycle menstrual cycle um with estrogen therapy is it a constant dose or it's modulated by week to week day to day question so there are some formulas so and when we look at hormonal contraception so the the biggest difference between contraceptive Doses and menopause hormone therapy doses they're both based in estrogen and progesterone mostly okay the hormone therapy was developed to stop a hot flash for decades menopause was defined by the presence or absence of you know severe menopause was defined by hot flashes or not they didn't didn't nothing else and so they developed the formulations with enough estrogen to stop hot flashes birth control was developed to stop ovulation you don't ovulate you don't get pregnant and it's but the difference between lowd dose birth control pill and higher dose menopause hormone therapy is not that far away and so um that a lot of people don't understand now the types of estrogen we use in birth control are a little bit different most birth control is ethanol estradiol which is one of the synthetics we have literally millions and millions of women's year data on it we know it's safety profile I think we're not counseling patients adequately about birth control as far as what it does to their testosterone and what it can do to you know oh it's fine it's safe I took it for years but I think we need to do a better job as a specialty on counseling women but I do think it's a good medication and then on menopause hormone therapy you know it's much lower dose it does not suppress ovulation so in per menopause it's a little bit of the Wild West which one we're going to use how high do we want to go do we need to suppress her ovulation because she's got acne or horrible periods or cramps or something where I want to suppress that ovulation to help her or can I give her menopause hormone therapy doses which in effect think of the hypothalamus I'm giving her just enough estrogen to calm the brain down and tell them everything's okay we're not going to get those big Peaks and drops and if she still ovulates that's okay too as many of you know I've been taking ag1 for more than 10 years now so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast to be clear I don't take ag1 because they're a sponsor rather they are a sponsor because I take ag1 in fact I take ag1 once and often twice every single day and I've done that since starting way back in 2012 there is so much conflicting information out there nowadays about what proper nutrition is but here's what there seems to be a general consensus on whether you're an omnivore a carnivore a vegetarian or a vegan I think it's generally agreed that you should get most of your food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources which allows you to eat enough but not overeat get plenty of vitamins and minerals probiotics and micronutrients that we all need for physical and mental health now I personally am an omnivore and I strive to get most of my food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources but the reason I still take ag1 once and often twice every day is that it ensures I get all of those vitamins minerals probiotics Etc but it also has adaptogens to help me cope with stress it's basically a nutritional insurance policy meant to augment not replace quality food so by drinking a serving of ag1 in the morning and again in the afternoon or evening I cover all of my foundational nutritional needs and I like so many other people that take ag1 report feeling much better in a number of important ways such as energy levels digestion sleep and more so while many supplements out there are really directed towards obtaining one specific outcome ag1 is foundational nutrition designed to support all aspects of well-being related to mental health and physical health if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs with your order plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman as long as we're on the topic of birth control earlier you mentioned that the IUD and presumably this is some form of the IUD not necessarily copper IUD can um disrupt or stop a period a period um maybe we could talk a little bit about the different forms of birth control um IUD um as the pill quote unquote um old term but um uh I think most people know what we're referring to when we say that the ring um and and on and on um what is your stance on on these different forms of birth control as it relates to their safety um you know a guess about a year and a half ago I hosted a um a female physician guest on on this podcast and both sides of the uh birth control issue were touched on one the relationship to um potential um inhibition of certain forms of cancers but then also the potential for certain side effects maybe even Cancers and so it you know it seems like it can play out both ways and this is a very heated topic yeah um in fact so much so that I learned that if one is going to post a clip of any of this on social media it almost makes sense to have them in the same post because we actually did both of them we we we did a post where it was more about the the pros of birth control and then the cons of birth control as as stated through um the words of this very same clinician um so we will be sure to so for anyone listening would you ever answer comes first stay tuned for the next answer because um my understanding is that it's not a black and white issue I think the best form of birth control is a vasectomy and so much of contraception is dumped in a female's lap you know in a committed relationship and I can't tell you the comments I've heard when a patient comes to me and she wants to get X Y and Z simply for contraception she's absolutely perfectly healthy there's nothing wrong with her she just doesn't want to be pregnant and I'm like okay you're done how you know she's completed her family she's out you know and I'm like tell your partner to get a vecto oh he won't do that you know so now all of the risk and the onus goes on her and so we we go through the options of surgical like you know tub legation um which is basically blocking the tube so when I you know talk to my teenagers I'm like here's how you not get pregnant a you don't have sex well if that's not an option then we have to either block the sperm stop the egg from coming out or stop the place where they communicate which is the fallopian tube and so when we look at the different forms of hormonal contraception which are meant to stop ovulation suppress ovulation because they're telling the brain we have enough estrogen and progesterone on board quiet down so it doesn't send those signals to the ovary right and so that can come in a pill form a patch form a ring form and they each have their own Pros cons risk benefits you know transdermal has less risk of blood clots versus oral has a higher risk of blood clot in any form of estrogen so so we talk about that we look at their family history or if they have MTHFR any of the clotting genes you know then we Council directly versus the IUD the iuds create an an inflammatory environment in the uterus that blocks and it creates a plug in the servic so that the sperm can't get through and then if any do get through it's a toxic environment in the uterine cavity for the sperm so that's really how the those iuds work some iuds are coated with progesterone progestin not progesterone progestogen and those end up decidualizing the endometrium so thinning that lining from that constant progesterone to the point where you stop bleeding so a lot of my patients really loved that option of being aaric no periods just for the convenience of it but they were still ovulating in the background so we're not suppressing their natural cycles just their periods I see and is there any evidence that the use of any form of birth control can disrupt the um timing or the uh availability of I realize availability of eggs is a very um clinically naive biologically naive statement but basically what I'm saying can it can any of them accelerate the onset of per menopause can they delay the onset of onset a little bit you know it's it's maybe a year if you use it for a long time from what the data shows so women who suppress ovulation we lose about 11,000 eggs each month with the ovulation process to get one out 11,000 race to the Finish Line and only one makes it but we lose about 11,000 in the process so women who are constantly you know for a long time suppressing ovulation will have um a slightly older age of menopause had they not done that when you say slightly older what's the longest extension of of the best I could see in the data was maybe nine months okay from nine months use ofth control so so maybe like 5 to 10 year use I have to look at the data again to be you know I'd have to look that one up but it was years got it um to to gain an extra maybe N9 months maybe a year of ovarian life I see and um nowadays uh at least if people have the means there's some um Trend if you will toward um freezing one's eggs um this might be a good opportunity to just State something that came up before when we had Dr Natalie Crawford on the podcast to talk about female fertility um I think surprising to many people was her statement that not because it's controversial but because we just don't hear this often enough that harvesting eggs for freezing or for IVF does not diminish the pool of eggs that one would have meaning you're losing them each month right anyway yeah and so they're only pulling out I don't know 10 12 maybe in a cycle and when you're losing 11,000 with an ovulation so it really isn't going to to effect when you go through menopause such a crucial thing for people to hear um I think uh there were a number of comments when we posted that clip on social media of people uh women saying wow I didn't realize that harvesting eggs would not um somehow uh shift the onset of menopause earlier and so for the record we are not saying that we're saying that um it does not and um and very interesting that the use of of birth control but I'm guessing only forms of birth control that suppress ovulation can delay the onset of per menopause menopause by about 9 months maximum maximum um so things like the copper IUD that right which um prevent pregnancy by creating a unfavorable environment for the sperm rather than disrupting ovulation in any way will not presumably extend par menopause menopause okay just want to make sure we're crystal clear for people you're being very clear but I I want to make sure that I'm clear on it and then reiterate because this can be um uh kind of tricky territory I think there are a lot of assumptions about this stuff and there's a lot of lore out there what why do you think that is is that because of the lack of solid research and communication in this area I think so or or is it something else you know I I I think these are um tricky topics for for uh discussion often because we hear all this stuff like birth control pills disrupt one's ability to get pregnant when they come off or where it we just learn that it can delay the onset of per menopause which by extension means there's a greater window for pregnancy if one um thinks about it that way but uh why do you think it's it's so um such a tangled discussion out there I think just the way that Society views pregnancy and female health and you know at least you know I live on the internet now you know this new life has brought me life on the internet and this what the algorithms are showing me yeah it's a very friendly everyone is super everyone loves you it's a listen it's what you're doing um is so important and uh I understand the the statement behind that statement I I think um but it's so important because it people are getting the opportunity to learn about really critical public health and female health issues um in a way that just was inaccessible before yeah it is and I I it's good and bad you know there's a lot of lore and misinformation that's getting propagated and I feel like as a specialty you know as a women's health specialist we did this to ourselves you know we have not properly educated ourselves we have not spent the money the research really you know championed women after reproduction when you look at the dollars and and the research and where it goes in women's health I mean Women's Health just gets a little sliver of all the NIH funding when you look at all NIH funding and what goes to menopause it's 0.03% unb less than half a percent this is onethird of a woman's life and when you look at McKenzie and Company just just published um a report where they pulled 680 studies on like chronic diseases diabetes hypertension cardiovascular disease and they looked at how they had they were women included in the studies but how many presented the data for the different Sexes like what happened to men versus what happened to women it was only 50% of the Articles actually did Sex specific differences and how this medication affected this process or whatever and then the ones that did 30% of women had poorer outcomes and and the other and on the flip side 10% of men had poorer outcomes and these things aren't just being brought to light so the the lack of recognition of sex specific differences in chronic disease and how menopause kind of plays into all that I think is where the future needs to go so we deserve as much good health as everyone else because yes we're living longer than men but 20 to 25% of that life is in poor health wow that's a a really significant statement I mean I think think that the National Institutes of Health has been terrific in establishing new institutes within it um they even have a complimentary Health Institute now there's the the national eye institute there's you know cancer here um is there a plan or one would hope for a dedicated Institute for Women's Health there push um so there was one piece of legislation that got pushed through the Biden signed it and it was a $100 million for Women's Health and that that got chopped up very quickly and menopause did get a little piece of it because we're also really struggling with endometriosis and you know a lot of the female specific uterine diseases and and PCOS and things and so we need more funding there as well um and then there's another bill that just got that's the one hi Berry was like um on TV talking about another bill for $250 million that bill includes language for education of providers so we have a whole generation of providers ERS like I graduated my residency training the year of the Whi came out so all we had very little like real clinically significant menopause education and then we knew about HRT and we were giving it in clinic um if she was coming in with severe hot flashes but that got taken off the table after the Whi and then we have a whole gener like all menopause education basically stopped after so Whi Women's Health Initiative HRT no that's that's okay just so that people are on board hormone replacement therapy um yeah it's um it's a Well we can encourage the uh expansion of of uh research in these areas and with this discussion and um certainly uh I was on NH panels for years um as a regular member in the I institute and what I've noticed with um NIH is that they are very responsive uh to the public call for growth of research in particular areas you know it can take time it's government after all and they need funding there's a finite amount of funding but but I think that um R rarely do I ever get into legislature based things but if you are somebody who cares about um more funding in a given area of research it's actually very straightforward what to do you call your Congressman or Senator and you tell them literally you leave a message I find this kind of interesting it's so it's kind of like what we learned in um social studies and uh in elementary school but you call your you call your um Senator or your governor and you leave a message and you say Hey you know there's this issue that impacts a ton of people and it's really important and um the next time it comes up uh when budgeting uh comes up in Washington it's really important and if you hear about a bill you can call and support a bill and believe it or not some of that stuff actually translates to more funding in a given area in fact that the brain initiative which unfortunately had its budget cut significantly recently maybe put that funding back um but you know arose from the um I believe it was the child of two Neuroscience professors up at University of Wisconsin I'm probably going to get some details wrong but um so the khil are the are the professors as I recall and their son over Hood all these conversations growing up about the importance of brain science and then eventually pushed through government channels for more money for brain research and then we had a a long phase of of um pretty pretty substantial research and then it was cut so these things um but it persists and so these things really matter can impact so and maybe we should send them a clip of of your statements on this podcast getting back to um kind of things that people can control so for people who are heading into per menopause or who are in the perimenopause phase um aside from the the typical things that we hear about fortunately a lot these days like getting adequate sleep um getting exercise um nutrition maybe we could touch a little bit on nutrition in a moment you mentioned Mediterranean diet Galviston diet um things that are going to promote overall health right um are there any things that people can do maybe even take that would improve uh their outcomes in this phase like I I've heard of people and I have no bias here or even knowledge of the research on this if there is any of people taking for instance grape seed extract or people trying to do a number of things to reduce inflammation kind of General themes around um self-care and wellness these days but what are sort of the five or six that come to mind um perhaps as like the things that can move the levers in the right direction what would tell my 35-year-old self you know who just kind of went into this obliviously and what I know now is your diet is probably one of the most important things that determines your level of inflammation and then estrogen is a really powerful anti-inflammatory hormone and we lose that protection when we go through we start losing it through the transition so whatever you can do in the other areas especially with nutrition sleep stress reduction we need to do it so fiber we are not getting enough fiber in our diet in the western diet I think it's most women are getting 10 to 12 grams per day and we need at least 25 and the health benefits tend to max out around 30 32 grams per day so focusing on foods that are rich in fiber Fiers is feeding the gut microbiome slowing down glucose absorption you know glucose levels of sugar absorption into the bloodstream it is slowing down the rate you know certain parts of Transit and pulling more water into the gut like there's nothing bad about it right the foods that are rich in fiber have a lot of other stuff that's good for you too co-actors vitamins minerals nutrient you know just they're just so healthful um and then ansans you know just find things that crunch that are and get as many colors as you can you know green red purple yellow every color represents a phytochemical that is going to be good for you in different areas of your body and try to keep it as varied as possible um we're not getting enough protein and I have to thank Dr Gabrielle lion you know really helping me focus and on that you know when I first wrote galison diet to be honest and transparent it was for weight loss and you know I was frustrated with my weight gain and I that was the pain point my patients had and that was my pain point but I didn't realize it represented something much more Sinister than than just the way I looked you know the visceral fat gain and so uh learning about visceral fat and what it really means and that is for your listeners the fat that wraps around our internal organs it's a very different fat than the subcutaneous fat and you know a premenopausal woman so we age matched and looked at visceral fat levels measuring it with the uh um dexus scanner you have about 8% of your fat as visceral as a premenopausal person and then when you go through the transition it's 23% wow with no changes in diet and exercise the visceral fat is not something that gets enough attention I think everyone thinks about subcutaneous fat because it's relation cosmetically distressing but really yeah um and one doesn't want too much of it for health reasons e either but the it's the um intval fat that at least by my understanding is is really uh the most problematic for for for our health it's a harbinger of of chronic disease so I read that weight gain is one of the primary symptoms of menopause itself yeah so it's you have to be careful how you think about that when we when we plot weight gain versus age it's a very straightforward linear curve and menopause does not seem to affect that what is happening is a body composition change we are losing muscle and we are gaining visceral fat and so and you might be gaining some subcutaneous fat but those are kind of the key things that are happening and so that's really when I'm counseling patients what I'm focusing on because I have a body scanner in my office where I can tell them what their level of visceral fat is in their muscle mass and so we bone and muscle that muscular skeletal unit works together and so we see this acceleration of muscle loss which controls our basal metabolic rate which determines our resistance to insulin which you know so it's just that's the the organ of longevity that's what I I've learned from Dr lion you know and everything we can do to hang on to it and build is so important so protein going back to the original Point protein intake is key and women by and large are getting 50 to 60 grams of protein per day and we really probably need 80 100 120 depending on our body composition yeah thanks for mentioning Dr Gabrielle L she's doing what I view world yeah terrific work really promoting Women's Health and health generally I know she's now I believe is exploring um Advanced Training in uh in urology for males as well and um so you know it's um it's it's only fair to to credit her with with really expanding into these different areas but especially this idea that we need and women perhaps in particular from what I understand um she'll be on the podcast soon so we'll get more of a of an understanding at least one gram of quality protein per pound of lean body mass maybe even per pound of body weight per day in order to optimize their their health yeah she's she's definitely on the higher end you know the Whi the Women's Health Initiative some of the my favorite data you know it's not all bad it's data and was looking at Frailty scores and protein intake in women and what they found was women who were having 1.5 to 1.7 so basically it was the higher their protein intake the less likely they were to be frail the end and it was you know they were reaching that was kind of peeking out somewhere around 1.5 to 1.7 gram per kilogram of lean body mass and most women are getting around you know the FDA recommends 08 wow and source of protein also important high quality right right you need all the amino acids yeah very interesting um now that's in menopause but presumably also so starting those habits in Perry just getting that laid down and getting those habits laid down are going to set you up for a much better post-menopause a much healthier postmenopause and we have to stop defining menopause by your hot flashes you know it may or may not make your hot flashes better and we have great medications for that if it's disruptive but I'm talking about your your cardiometabolic disease risk I meant to ask this earlier so forgive me for for leaping back briefly but is there any value in knowing the age at which your mother went into menopause as a metric or a sensor rather uh for or a as a window into whether or not you will go into menopause at more or less the same age yes there is a of course it's not one to one we get half of our DNA from our fathers so but I always ask and there's a you know the latest data that looked at it genetics is the biggest factor that determines when you're going to go through menopause so knowing when your mothers your aunts you know went through and if there were any medical conditions associated with that is huge okay so now we're talking not so much about perimenopause but also menopause itself what is the typical constellation of symptoms as one enters menopause like right at the beginning and then does that constellation of symptoms change as one is you know a year two years three years into menopause so it's almost 100% with body composition changes like very very close you know that visceral fat is tough to beat it's beatable but it takes a lot of work you know do people know if they have visceral fat I mean there's their scanning approach gold you know of course the gold standard is a DEA or even an MRI but no one can afford that so we have in like what I have um in my office is the inbody scanner so it's electrical impedance scanner and it's it's pretty good so you stand on the scale hold the hand I have a medical I have the highest grade one for my patients um and most people doing what I do you know utilizing a body scanner use that one um but you can use the waist tip ratio and so the waist tip ratio is a better measure of your risk of metabolic Health than your weight or your BMI so it's so simple you take a tape measure and a calculator you can do it in your head but you measure the smallest part of your waist and if you don't have a small waist if it goes out then just use your belly button just use something you can measure again are people sucking in or are they relaxed you should be relaxed and I tell my patients you know do it first thing in the morning when your bladder's empty and you're not bloated and you know um and then the widest part of your hips it's not perfect but it's better than your weight or your BMI so widest part of the hips with people feet feet people are going this and so um I only know the data for women so forgive me but um for a female if it's less than 0.7 then your chance of having clinically significant aberration in visceral fat are low and then if it's greater than one you likely have higher levels of visceral fat and so in clinic or when I was coaching online for galison diet we were using the waste ratio as one of the you know measures for their success when measuring the waist um which point along the waist is it right at Naval is it it's just wherever your smallest so that's kind of different for different women so I would just say look in the mirror wherever your hourglass goes in is where you want to kind of stick to but if you don't have that kind of a waist and you have a wider waist just pick the belly button because you always know you can go back to that level you know that's because we're tracking them over time great those are um very useful um recommendations and how often should people do that I you know you should never weigh yourself every day you shouldn't do this every day we were having patients do it or you know our followers do it once a month so changes in body composition as measured by dexa or impedance or you don't have access that waste of hip ratio uh what are some of the other symptoms of menopause fatigue multiple causes for the fatigue um a lot of sleep disruption um sleep disruption is another huge thing so all of a sudden you're struggling to go to sleep or you're having middle of the night Awakenings and not able to go back to bed that are new and different from prev new and different than before right I see there was a recent study that came out and most of my patients in hindsight say I knew something wasn't right or something was different something had changed but I couldn't put my finger on it and they just had a study come out saying something's then when they looked at what that means what does I'm not feeling like myself mean and it was psychological changes so you lose resilience you're suddenly more irritable you're suddenly not able to like go with the punches or or do you know you're you're not adjusting as well to change that you used to you're snapping at your kids more your partner you're you know you're you're getting frustrated at work you know it's just very kind of subtle and it takes going through it and then looking back to say yeah I really say may maybe about 47 that something was changing and I just thought I was just stressed out or whatever and then now I can see that was the beginning of the pattern so menstrual changes as we talked about um you know the big highlights vertigo tenus ringing in the ears um skin changes so dry skin itchy skin feeling like you're having crawling Under the Skin big gut changes so Nuance set bloating you're kind of eating all the same things and your guts just not handling things like it used to so the Zoe nutrition study took 1100 women and and did stool samples through menopause through the per menopause menopause transition and saw the changes in the gut microbiome from the loss of the sex hormones and basically we went from what a typical female microbiome to that of a male through the transition is there any direct evidence that um supplementing the gut microbiome and here I don't necessarily mean pills and powders I mean um my understanding is that getting enough fiber and low sugar fermented foods can also support the gut microbiome things like um sauerkraut kimchi miso miso um plain yogurt just straight up nothing added yeah so is there evidence that supporting the gut microbiome can um make this uh stage of menopause more I guess um reduce some of the symptoms of of menopause so the best I could find was most of them are are done with supplements because those are easier to measure than handing someone a cup of yogurt right and you know which bacteria you're provot so um they did lactobacillus and looked and bifido bacterium I think and saw that women who were obese and hypertensive in menopausal and they had visceral fat decrease and blood pressure improvements versus placebo um also it's hard to do Placebo studies with food you know so right um but they do and then in the retrospective studies they can look at dietary patterns and women who ate rich foods fermented and lots of yogurt you know Mediterranean type diets um have better symptoms overall what's the difference between the Mediterranean diet and the Galviston diet so so um when I so I got my culinary medicine certification I was culinary medicine yeah so I was frustrated in when I was working because I didn't know anything about nutrition and suddenly like everything I was trying to tell my patients was based on like the one lecture I got in medical school and you know good nutrition was like porn you know it when you see it you know the Supreme Court definition of pornography and so you know the best I'd ever gotten was the gational diabetic diet and it was this Xerox things with you know was in the Deep I was in Texas so it had like tortillas and stuff on it and and it had been copied so many times you could barely read it anymore and that was the diet we would that was the only nutrition I'd ever like handed to a patient and so I'm like eat healthy and so I'm like I got to do better than this I don't know enough and so we had a guest speaker for a Alpha Omega Alpha which is the Honor Society for medical school and I was one of the advisers so and it was this guy Tim Harland who had started this culinary medicine movement and it was basically nutrition for doctors and he velop this like online program and I had to go to New Orleans for a lab and San Antonio for a lab and work in kitchens where you were learning how to counsel patients how to cook and also basically like getting a little minor in nutrition um so it was the best thing I've ever done say very cool I mean I learned about allergies and like all this stuff you know food allergies and things that I just didn't know and just basic nutritional principles like what it takes to build a healthy body and and what you know I knew about quashi oror and like severe deficiencies but not good basic nutrition and so you know they talked heavily about Mediterranean they talked a lot about The Fad diets and stuff but you know the principles of the Mediterranean I was like I want to teach this to my patients but they're not going to eat a lot of um Greek yogurt or they're probably not going to eat a lot of feta you know like how can I kind of take these blocks and make it more Americanized that was kind of like the brain child for me around galison diet was let me like create something and I really was into fasting at the time too so I was like let me put this fasting thing together with you know good nutritional anti-inflammatory principles and talk about the things we know were probably you should you know not having a whole lot of you know processed foods and high sugars and stuff and and explaining in a way and how it's affecting their menopause and like how can she approach her nutrition and that's how Gallison diet was born it was for my patients and then I gave it to my girlfriends and then they started sharing it and I talked about it one day on Facebook and the world exploded in the best way in the best way yeah it l me here right so right um and we all benefit what is the evidence that fasting can be beneficial or detrimental to um per menopause menopause so the jury's kind of still out on that one I was re really liked the data that you know uh I think it was Mark Matson had done on neurod degenerative disease and and using fasting as a tool there and lowering inflammation levels so I was like this is amazing this is great because so much about menopause is pro-inflammatory you know is this intermittent fasting so Tim restri he was basically doing 168 you know and uh you know very scheduled intermittent fasting and so that was something I was coaching my followers about you know consider this try this this would might be something to help lower inflammation I pulled back on that because it's really hard to get enough protein in for a lot of of women especially if they came in at 60 and now I'm telling them to double their protein you know and then giving them an eight hour window to do it they're like I'm walking around n on a chicken breast all day you know this is hard right and metabolizing protein is its own work right and so you have to spread it out throughout the day you know and a lot of that work was done at UTMB where I did my underground I mean my residency and where I taught for years and so I was friendly with the Nutrition department there I was getting all excited about everything and they're like you know I went to several of their conferences and like talking about breaking up protein intake into nuggets throughout the day because most women have very little protein with breakfast maybe weak gluten in their toast and then have a little bit at lunch and then kind of Stack their protein at night and they're still not getting enough but they're overdoing it in their evening meal that's their big protein meal and so like teaching them to kind of you know what I was teaching in galison diet was you need to have a healthy fat a good healthy carb and a protein with every meal in snack that you eat you know why do you think that protein has not been emphasized um enough until recently I think because we didn't understand it you know we didn't understand how important muscle was and I mean we knew that protein intake was important for muscle but muscle was for bodybuilders and not for women I lived my whole whole life up until about 5 years ago eating to be thin and moving to be thin that thin was the only measurement of Health that I needed to worry about and what I did was chip away at my bone and muscle strength and thank God I don't have osteopenia yet you know i' I've hopefully have reversed whatever Trend I was on and I'm naturally low muscle so now it's just a battle to try to hang on to what little I have and build some resistance train yeah yeah yeah yeah now three days a three days a week three to four days a week yeah resistance training much less cardio I was running marathons I and it was a great social thing with my girlfriends but you know everything I did was cardio I taught step aerobics you know the only weights I did were maybe in Zumba maybe one or two pounds you know so and that was better than being on the couch I mean I loved the community and doing that but you know for me to like stay out of the nursing home which was my ultimate goal for as long as possible I need to pick up some weights and heavy weights so that's where my focus has changed isn't it interesting that it wasn't until Rec Rec L that um it was only bodybuilders and football players and people preparing for military or specific sport would resistance train and now we are told that everybody male female young old should resistance train absolutely probably three times a week yeah and the my generation is struggling because we don't know how to do it and so I'm you know and I'm not a personal trainer I don't pretend you know I hire one to help me develop a program so that I don't hurt myself and then I can get stronger you know Progressive loads so you know and again Dr lion such a huge proponent of that and so what I try to do publicly is show my workouts so that people I normalize it and people see me doing it and they're like well she can do it then I can do it it's great super inspiring and it really helps uh cross that threshold where people as you said they don't know how it's scary right for people who resistance trained for a long time they go into a gym they they know how all that stuff works but uh for those that don't it's you're wandering around like what does this one do you know it's intimidating for a whole bunch of reasons well thank you for putting that content out um both the uh prescription if you will but also the example that that one can go about it so I'm guessing if you could go back 20 years you would have started resistance training earlier and eating more stronger skinning nutrition over calories and and stop looking trying to look a certain way you know you're you're undermining your future health by doing that I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor insid tracker insid tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals now I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term Health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test now a major problem with a lot of blood tests out there is that you get information back about metabolic factors and hormones and lipids and so forth but you don't know what to do with that information with inside tracker they make it very easy to know what to do with those numbers because they have a personalized platform that allows you to see the levels of those metabolic factors lipids hormones Etc and they give you specific directives that you can follow related to nutrition behavioral modification supplementation and more that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you if you'd like to try insid tracker you can go to insid tracker.com huberman to get 10% off their new membership program insid tracker membership offers significantly reduced prices on inside tracker comprehensive blood panels again that's insidetracker docomo to get 10% off so um what are some other symptoms of menopause you you mentioned body composition changes the one that we hear about the most for some reason I don't know is hot flashes yeah so think hot flashes um so in medicine we call it a Vaso motor symptom so we have a a disregulation of the thermo regulatory Center in the hypothalamus and that that the the thermostat gets reset basically and so what happens is we have this vasal dilation of it starts in the core typically for most women somewhere in the chest neck area and you feel this heat yeah I can probably trigger one just by talking about it um and it it goes up into the neck and out into the extremities and then you just start profusely sweating from all the blood vessels dilating and then it can last minutes to a second but for some women it's preceded by sometimes palpitation sometimes by this intense feeling of of dis Foria you know this intense sadness feeling and then it and then it just kind of passes but you know say you're you know wherever you are in your life whatever you're doing all of a sudden you're just like sweating profusely in the middle of some important area of your life work you know whatever your jobs are in your life and it's disruptive if it happens at night you don't sleep and for some women it's severe where they're having multiple ones a day and when any time you disrupt sleep Then daytime is far worse regulation you yeah you stress differently you you know everything changes and so when my patients come in the first questions we ask are sleep and that's the first thing we work on is is you know what can we do to get your sleep better what can be done for hot flashes aside from the things that you've already described to offset menopause absolute goal standard is hormone therapy is like giving your body back the estrogen which will readjust get your serotonin levels back to where they were and leave that thermal regulatory Center alone so it's back to where it used to be let's talk about hor therapy it's a bit of a controversial topic for no reason yeah I I was going to say I don't know why yeah it's demonized it it got such a bad rap and we need to to it's just some of the was the worst misinformation campaign in the history of medicine well that's a bold statement but I believe you the um the way I understand it is that there was this large scale hormone therapy trial um and the interpretation of that trial was something different than we now believe um as a medical ini so it was really groundbreaking at the time aging women were finally being studied we knew from observational data that women on hormone therapy probably 40% of the population of females eligible were on HRT okay so very large amount so the women who were given hormone therapy had lower incidence of cardiovascular disease older ages of cardiovascular disease lower death from cardiovascular disease some people argued that that was an artifact of healthier wealthier women get HRT because they go to the doctor okay so this is just because they're healthier that they have less cardiovascular disease so let's prove it what do you do that with a randomized control trial so flaws in the study so they take I think there were 11,000 is women in the estrogen only arm because they'd had hysterectomy so for your listeners if you have a uterus and you're getting estrogen you must have a progestogen with it to protect the lining of the uterus from minimal cancer as long as you give an adequate proest you're fine okay but if you don't have a uterus progesterone is not mandatory so the women who had had hysterectomy got estrogen only or Placebo and the estrogen at the time was primin which was the number one prescription for HRT at the time so nothing weird about that so it's just um synthetic estrad actually no uh primin is is primin stands for pregnant mayor urine it is actually very natural they take pregnant horses and extract the estrogens from their urine because they're pregnant and they were screeing a lot of it and it was cheap and easy and I have a lot of ethical issues about how they do that but and I don't prescribe it but that's what was done at the time so I I've seen horses urinate they urinate a lot there's dozens of estrogens in that comp but the main one is estrad so um then there the other group who had uteruses were given Prim Pro which is primin plus proa and or Placebo so off we go they recruit 11,000 and then I think 15,000 in the other arm huge study it was like a billion dollar study like we're so excited this is happening this started when I was in med school and then they start recruiting patients and then um you know everyone's taking their meds they excluded women with hot flashes what because if your hot flashes go away you know that you didn't get the placebo ah so they excluded one with hot flashes problem number one yeah that's a big problem this the end outcome the what they were trying to measure was cardiovascular disease so they started with an older population the average age was 63 whereas the typical onset of menopause is 51 wow so these women had been menopausal you know on average for 10 12 13 years so time away from estrogen is when disease starts accelerates right okay so put them on their meds start measuring in the estrogen plus progestin arm they saw a non-statistically significant increased risk of breast cancer and it was this the relative risk relative now you know what this is but your Mone your listeners may not was 25% and and I hope I get the numbers right it was four out of a thousand women per year to five out of a thousand women per year okay so Placebo arm was four so we have breasts we are females we get breast cancer about four out of a th women per year and that increased to five and the estrogen only arm there was a 30% decrease risk of of breast cancer regardless of the of the average age M and they kept that arm going right because it's randomized so presumably the average age for the other group is roughly 61 as well they were match so in their 60s as well so they call a press conference at the Watergate Hotel the Watergate Hotel announce the findings they hadn't even published the data yet no one had had a chance to read it and these the head researchers called this press conference and say estrogen causes breast cancer exogenous estrogen from these yeah yes and they said it's a 25% increased risk but the absolute risk was like 8% per year but that didn't get that that's not a headline thing so on every like ABC NBC CBS all the morning shows Nightly News every major magazine it was the number one medical news story of 2002 that that estrogen was bad and it caused cancer and da d da the estrogen only arm kept going and they found after a couple more years a slightly increased risk of stroke so they stopped the study the effects on cardiovascular disease were neutral but there was lower um colon cancer in both groups but no one talked about that so the American Heart Association in 2020 went and looked at they looked at ages so there were younger women who were given HRT and what they found was if you started hormone therapy between the ages of 50 to 59 you had a 50% decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and death from cardiovascular disease and all cause mortality wow so age at which you start matters estrogen so that's where there's something called the healthy cell hypothesis or and so basically estrogen is better at prevention than cure and it's very protective especially in the Tima of the coronary arteries so taking that estrogen away we lose that protection once the disease builds up there's some worry that adding estrogen once you've developed a sclerosis or a plaque might loosen the plaque especially in that first year so which led for some people maybe to have a slightly increased risk of stroke so when my patients come in we are talking about these differences it doesn't mean that after 60 you might not have cardiovascular benefit we start losing the benefit so it's the timing hypothesis is key and it's the years away from estrogen that's the problem there's a great study in the British medical journal they looked at years years of reproductive life plus HRT and looked at cognition scores and saw that the longer your body is exposed to estrogen in any form like whether natural cycles or exogenous estrogen of any form and it was estradi in that study actually then you had higher cognition scores healthier brains which had a just very you know top Contour level makes total sense given that estrogen is neuroprotective I realize my not be neuroprotective in every instance in every neuron in the brain but it's generally neur neur protective and decline in estrogen is correlated with neur degeneration which does not mean it's causal I have to ask when they announced this study at the Watergate Hotel of all places um and the conclusion that they put forth was that estrogen therapies can um increase rates of cancer um I have to wonder if that had something to do with what I understand is a sort of party line around Cancers and breast cancers in particular which is that you want to quote unquote block the estrogen receptor you want to get in there and put give tamoxifen or nowadays I'm sure there are other drugs that are more effective to block the estrogen receptor it all seems to um pile up on the side of a story that says you know estrogen and estrogen binding to the estrogen receptor is proc cancerous which obviously I think you're telling us um in a in a indirect and direct way now and we'll go further into is simply not the case if you take a healthy breast cell and dump it at a petri dish and then marinate it with some estrogen it's not teratogen I it's not carcinogenic estrogen is not carcinogenic we live with it our whole lives if it was in pregnancy for those of us who are ever pregnant when our estrogen levels Skyrocket we would see this into uptic in breast cancer and we don't in fact I think there's some evidence uh for the opposite that getting pregnant prior to age 40 is is it true that that's protective against C be somewhat protect for certain forms of breast cancer yeah so we have this whole generation of Physicians who really weren't taught much about menopause don't understand the protective benefits of estrogen and and and menopausa effect on metabolic disease and they have this me this mentality of estrogen is bad and so a woman walks into her today 2023 they looked at the data she goes into her doctor complaining of menopausal symptoms which right now are still only recognized as genit urinary syndrome menopause hot flashes night sweats you know the very cliche symptoms documents in the chart she's having whatever only 10% are offered any therapy and they're most likely four to1 to be offered an anti-depressant that is where it stands today that is what we are fighting against is not every woman will choose HRT but every woman deserves an informed conversation about it and let her make her choice you know if you believe the Whi data which there are some problems there the risk is small okay but did you talk to her about about cardiovascular disease and diabetes and insulin resistance and her cholesterol because those things go up through the menopause transition with no changes in diet and exercise and those are all you know you're more even with the diagnosis of breast cancer the most likely thing a woman is going to die from is cardiovascular disease a heart attack or a stroke so framing it like that I think is where we need to head and the other thing is you know I was a great Oben in so many areas of what I did why should this all be dumped in the lap of the poor busy OB Jen who's running around the hospital doing pops smar trying to deliver babies surgery and all the things like this should be required education for all everyone in medical school we are females and we're not little men with breast and uteruses we react differently to medications disease disease burden you know and that's not been studied adequately and that's where the the push needs to go it's bigger than just half flashes do you think that one solution is to deepen in the medical school curriculum absolutely and more and and I hate saying women's health because everyone thinks breast and uterus right and reproduction it's the health of women and we're not addressing it differently than the health of a man and we're different we you know and so that I think is where we need to head given that it's half of the population yeah um one would imagine that the best thing to do is to make the Core Curriculum of medical students expand to include this as opposed to making it a specialty I think so does that mean a fifth year of medical school I'm not kidding I mean I I guess maybe I mean people said well you'd have to extend the the OBG in residency I'm like no any any specialist who touches a female should understand how that female I mean the starkest example is cardiovascular disease you know how much longer we have to wait in the Ed how much more likely we are to die in the hospital setting from a heart attack because we don't present the same symptoms as men do and it's just the default has always been how it happens to the basic you know really Caucasian male and so at least in the US and so because we respond differently because we wait longer because our symptoms are considered to be psychologically induced less than biologically induced and so women are dying at higher rates when you look at the data on Statin you get high cholesterol so 80% of women will have abnormal cholesterol levels through the minum PO transition if they were normal before okay so elevated LDL LDL and lowering HDL so now they are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease automatically a PCP will offer her a Statin okay that is standard of care do you know that the American Heart Association published in 2020 that statins have never been shown to decrease their primary heart attack in a woman secondary yes but no primary prevention and it does not decrease risk of death from cardiovascular disease they're know that yeah yet we're routine you know what does HRT if given in the right window of opportunity how is HRT um in this case estrogen HRT given is it a patch is it injections is it great question all the above so we have I like to break it down into oral and non-oral forms so everything oral we ingest goes into the gut the liver the hepatic system will pick up the portal vein and take everything to the liver for processing when that bump of estrogen hits the liver we can see a slight increase in some of our clotting factors so for that reason I tend to go with the non-oral formulations to avoid that risk especially if she has any family history of clotting or personal history of clotting you know we're going to go with a non-oral form so these are things like elevations in Factor 5 lighten MFR if she's had a history of a blood clot we are not going with an oral estrogen formulation and for people that haven't had a history of a blood clop my understanding which admittedly is is very um sparse is that you can do a genetic test just by blood draw to see whether or not you have U two normal copies of the of the gene for Factor 5 lien um some people are heterozygotes so they're more at risk of presumably bleeding in that case right um but in other words can people go into this knowing whether or not um they're more or less at risk from taking estrogen so I don't think that there's a high enough for that reason because we're not routin L screening for these things unless they have a family history I'm going with non-oral estrogen as a primary product for my patients because I can just skip that worry so a patch typically so typically transdermal so a patch there's even miss spray there's FDA approved options of a patch there's gels there's a ring there's a um spray and um there is a vaginal ring which I love love love because it's so you put it in for three months and it treats you know you get a two for one you get a local treatment in the vagina as well as a systemic treat treatment as well um it's just really expensive and typically not covered by insurance on the first tier so very few of my patients can afford it um there are um some injectables which no no one in the menop posi uses um there the menop yeah great there are also mention the mene and the menop posi are those terms that you coined I love it um I think I did yeah great all right you heard it here so the menasi is a a group of healthcare professionals who are from multiple Specialties we have card ologist orthopedic surgeon um Internal Medicine you Dr lion is a member and we have a big group chat and we all support each other we support each other's books and research and and we send articles back and forth and we support each other on social but we also band it together to kind of negate one of the bigger Publications on menopause that when the lanet published it's a whole another discussion um but you know we are fighting for equity in menopause care and and Fe and Women's Health great nothing succeeds like a group it's like the old menopause versus the new menopause I love it love it um so hormone therapy to increase estrogen how does it make women feel um psychologically physically what are some of the positive changes that can OCC aside from just offsetting some of the negative and I want to make sure that I remember to ask what if a woman has been in menopause for you know uh has passed that point because as you said it's a day so they passed that point um a year earlier 2 years earlier 3 years earlier um given the results of this first study um which as you explained it are uh problematic and their interpretation the way it was interpreted as opposed to initially yeah yeah um what's too long should um women should wom starten therapy in their 40s just in just to you know smooth the transition maybe we need more studies in this area like should we just the minute we figure out like I would love like I would glucose monitor I have um insulin resistance so for those listening there's just it looks like a little button sized um sticker on the back of the arm I would love to develop one to track estrogen levels starting your 30s just see where you're at you know start seeing are you having aberations in your cycle and we can start the per menopause journey and talking about should we begin supporting I think there's a tremendous amount opportunity for research in this area um but typically we are not starting patients until they're very symptomatic if they're per menopausal or they're postmenopausal so in general so if a woman is um in her let's say late 30s um she is anticipating perimenopause maybe is in per menopause and wants to start lowd dose um hormone replacement therapy I think it's something um worth mentioned that not all you know presumably the dosages are tailored and then blood so a given dose is tried blood is drawn you measure estradi so we're not um we don't have established levels of like therapeutic ranges of estradi what we found is that when we do that so far I think we have some opportunity here if my level's 50 and your level's 50 I could feel like I'm on top of the world my symptoms are gone you still need more so we are titrating from symptoms I see yeah interesting that's similar to what is done similarish with um testosterone replacement therapy which these days um you know I sort of have joke that the you can uh change out the r in testosterone replacement because a lot of people are a lot of men are taking testosterone not as a replacement meaning their levels are not lower than 300 n per deciliter which is kind of lower range um they're sort of low middle and they're trying to get high you know higher range but hormone replacement therapy as I understand it has never been um strictly in men or women strictly for people who are out of range that it in in theory it can be to optimize reduce symptoms right and to optimize well-being right um and I don't know if the medical establishment wants it used that way but certainly in the case of testosterone replacement therapy in men it's being used that way quite often in fact so the we don't have established therapeutic ranges for estrad if she's POI premature Varian insufficiency we know we want to get her to 100 or around 100 or higher in picograms per deciliter um and but in the menopausal patient we're rarely checking levels but I do think we have an opportunity to learn a lot more now that we're able to track how is it how does it affecting your cholesterol we need to look at those numbers like what's the optimal dose for cholesterol what's the optimal dose for cardiovascular disease all we all these Studies have looked at was was she on it or not so that's where I think the opportunities can come so if a woman goes on hormone replacement therapy how often is she coming in for blood draws or are you just you know well depend testosterone we tend check more often there's we don't have an FDA approved option for women for testosterone and so no so we either try to get her t- stem mhm um or she's finding someone to insert a pellet or something and there's there's other issues with that um what I do in Te Texas it's really hard the pharmacists do not like to do the t- stem for patients and I've even T t- stem is the gel you know um and I end up compounding it in a cream and do a transdermal PR for the patients but there's such variable absorption we do tend to check more levels of that just to may try to get her therapeutic so what for women at Peak dose is somewhere in a healthy female you know 35 to 70 and it's so so I had a woman coming in with signs of hyperandrogenism you know she's you know deep voice hair growth whatever acne and I'm going to check a level if it's above 90 for females I need to look for a tumor like that's too high okay or PCOS it can get that high certainly 200 that's that's outrageous so I'm trying to get my patients you know 60 50 70 but if she's like 50 and her she's got her libido back and she feels great and everything's wonderful then I'm hold you know because the higher we go the more likely you are to have side effects so you're losing hair you know temporal hair loss voice steepening acne new chin hair you know losing hair where you want it gaining here where you don't want it is how I explain it to patients and so when you say 50 that's 50 nanograms per de I think um many people including myself were surprised to learn um that women actually have higher levels of testosterone than they do estrogen um outside absolute ranges right in absolute ranges and I can tell you right now your natural level of estradiol is higher than mine now I'm I supplement but you know like when I go through menopause your residual estradi is now higher than a postmenopause a woman so this is the uh estrad that I have because testosterone was aromatized into into EST yeah interesting interesting uh so much uh is breaking down around the uh the old stereotypes female hor like testosterone is a human hormone right estrogen's a human hormone and they exist in in both U biological Sexes yeah it's um it it's sometimes unfortunate that compounds in the body get names like steroid hormones because then people hear steroids and then it has a gravitational pull toward um anabolic steroid use um or uh even the word fat you know it's like you know dietary fat versus subcutaneous fat versus fat we need better nomenclature um to avoid a lot of the confusion that exists out there what are some of the other hormones that um can be reduced and can possibly be replaced by hormone therapy like progestins um you know are there is there a role for um you know adjusting things like prolactin or is there a is there a role for other hormones in that what sure is to be a multifactorial thing I mean I think menopause is a process not an event hypogonadism for females right and so we know that you know because the pituitary and hypothalmus are involved and that G&R you know there's some cross reactivity so for example hypothyroidism when I have a patient who's on her and doing well on hormone therapy for her thyroid so she's on T3 T4 whatever she's on I'm like listen you know we need to recheck your thyroid levels in six weeks because giving you back estrogen is going to mess with a little bit of that feedback cycle so we need to make sure you're still therapeutic so I think we've got more work to do with some of the other hormones um but when we talk about replacement and menopause we are mostly looking at your estrogens your androgens and your progesterone so the formulations can differ um when we you know there's a lot of misunderstanding around what is bioidentical versus synthetic and I think a lot of cottage Industries in this little bubble that we had for 23 years where doctors were afraid to prescribe hormone therapy and then women were desperate for care we had some little cottage industries of people I think were well meaning and trying to help but kind of developed terminology that really isn't medically specific like estrogen dominance you know and what that really is and so that is not a term that is in any medical journal it's kind of something coined I think from a well-meaning provider trying to explain what's happening in per menopause that you're having more produced than progesterone than you used to have so PCO patients do the same thing you know there's multiple reasons for that to happen um so when we talk about you know in the miniverse of what we're trying to replace we all agree that we stick pretty much with estradiol we're just trying to give you back the water you were drinking so I want to be get as close to what your body used to make because that's what the receptor like I'm trying to give you progesterone you know rather than a synthetic not that they're all demonized progesterone doesn't work for everyone I'm glad I have option and then for your androgens we pretty much just do testosterone and we do a transdermal again because the oral can be hepatotoxic unless it's uno8 which isn't um available in the US so but in there's no FDA approved option for women so it's not covered by insurance we know it works for hypoactive sexual desire disorder what your followers would would call libido um we think we know testosterone women at the highest quartile of testosterone have better bone density and stronger muscles so I'm using off label for my patients who come in with osteoporosis osteopenia or sarcopenia I'm using it off label telling them this is a probably a hel it's not a h Mar we think it works but we don't have the you know it's not approved for that yet yet um we know it has receptors in the brain my patients are saying that they're more clarity of thought they're sleeping better they really really like the testosterone um so there's you know DHEA there's a great vaginal preparation for DHEA called inosa and then the receptors there will start converting it into to both testosterone and estradi you know through the process and so um the sexual medicine docs really like in Roa especially for breast cancer patients because they get that little boost of testosterone in the vulva intr Roa intr Roa is the brand name I think it's prostone and this is a prescription drug yeah these are prescriptions so intr roa's prescription DHEA was specifically formulated for the vagina got it which sits further Upstream to the production of testosterone and estrogen right and so fortunately the what's left in the vagina is able to you know plug that guy in and get it to produce both testosterone and estrad which testosterone is the immediate precursor we have to aromatize it right to make estradi in females as well these local effects on tissues um are interesting um I they make perfect sense if the highest concentration is at the site of release from the from the patch or the gel or the whatever the um the the you said intravaginal what is it it's like a capsule uh I think the Prestone is a um insert like a little gel looking not a gel but a um I forget what The Binding material is but it's like a little insert you put in okay so the local effects because I guess you know it stands to reason that the highest concentrations can be at the sight of the thing that's releasing the hormone but then it also goes systemic by getting into the blood actually so the the local formulations e the prostone and the um the inosa and as well as the estradi formulated for the vagina do not absorb Sy ically they're so low dose there's not been clinically significant tissue absorption I have a formulation for my face as well so it's a cream a cream that I put on my face it's estriol and so there's some decent studies with estriol but we lose 30% of our collagen it's a very big pain Point for women when they go through menopause that we lose so much collagen so quickly in the first five years of menopause and so we can slow that process down we can't stop it completely we can slow it down by using a topical estrogen and the topical really seems to help with the elastin concentrations as well interesting so you you will often prescribe a lot of local treatments for hormone it's so safe so we can take breast cancer off the table all the discussion around blood clots and everything everyone can use vaginal estrogen and they should and I'll tell you why starting at what age relative toop the old menopause thoughts is do not give adinal estrogen until she's symptomatic now all of us will become symptomatic from GSM so that's genital urinary syndrome of menopause so from the pubic bone all the way to the sacrum all of that tissue is heavily you know tied to estrogen testosterone and when those levels decline we see thinning of the tissue loss of elasticity loss of mu mucous production as well as the health of the urethra and so UTI like the best treatment for recurrent u in a menopausal patient is vaginal estrogen interesting not recurrent antibiotics and what about um so it's preventative we can probably keep 50% of women out of the ER and out of urosepsis if we gave them all prophylactic vaginal estrogen all these ladies in nursing homes should be on vaginal estrogen so just to protect them from getting Euros sepsis interesting what about um like urinary incontinence and some of these other symptoms that are associated with more elasticity presumably more elasticity of of tissue in that region if you're early in a so we have stress incontinence and then we have um overactive bladder urge incontinence and so it definitely helps with urgent condet it rela you know it helps to relax and decrease the inflammation in the wall of the bladder so thumbs up there so people are getting up at night and having that urge to go um but stress incontinence is an anatomical problem we've lost you know the the sling that holds up the urethra and the female fails right from herniation and and poor tissue Health we can build up that health and we you know there's Physical Therapy there's lots of options and you you know no Euro gynecologist wants to take a woman to the o to do a lift if she's not estrogenized they're all going to get vaginal estrogen pre you know through healing and forever to keep the tissue healthy everything that we've been talking about for about the last 15 or 20 minutes seems to go directly opposite this large scale study that was discussed at the Watergate Hotel um is your read that the medical establishment in particular the OBGYNs in the US and in other countries understand now that that study was um flawed to some extent in its design no or is what we're talking about here like really cutting edge I mean if we were to gather a room full of a thousand OBGYN trained in various decades and put there 10% would have any idea here's why and I'm going to call out the American Board of Oben directly on this we take our board certification exams every year in our specialty as every specialty does and they give us a set of Articles of The Cutting Edge newest research and it's divided into categories obstetrics office practice Gynecology GYN surgery Pediatrics onc you know there is no menopause category nothing so I went back over like 10 years of all my green journals and looked at how many articles were anything to do with menopause and it was less than 1% so they were not systematically trying to put the latest menopause information in front of us they don't even recognize the menopause society as a like entity well now they have to contend with the menop posi they do and because and they might you might see me banned from the a but you know what no no no but I'm so proud of what I learned I learned amazing things I am a boss at delivering a baby of taking care of a pregnant patient I am great at pediatric Gynecology I was so good with adolescence where I failed and where this I let the system let me fail was in the care of a woman after reproduction outside of surgery outside of her surgical needs well I have to imagine that given the medical profession is interested in the well-being of people and in uh for sake of the discussion today women that um they will be grateful that uh now you you have a microphone um many microphones uh in various contexts so uh that is surprising to me however I would think that given the exciting findings around hormone replacement therapy and the I'm kind of obvious at least when you describe them to me obvious flaws in these earlier studies of you know starting hormone replacement therapy when women are already 61 when they've already accumulated um in many cases um some health health issues that uh it would be kind of you miss miss the ability to to measure the protective benefits so but fortunately we've got great studies coming out of like the Danish data the Scandinavian data that are really looking at this again and showing the protective benefits so is it generally the case that the studies out of Europe and Scandinavia are more forward W thinking it depends you know some of the most Forward Thinking shockingly is um come out of Asia a lot out of China and I asked my husband he's worked there before and he said there's as many researchers in China that are female as male it's not like they have a big stay-at-home culture you know they're they're not um women are expected to work and they're getting phds and they're they're doing the research and so and he thinks at Le in his in of one you know his humble opinion and he's an engineer you know that that's I was like why do you think you've worked over there he goes I think because there's just as many women who are writing the papers as men interesting take I like it um it makes good sense what are the various things that people can do in terms of a non hormone replacement therapies that can support them through really into and through perimenopause and menopause we talked about nutrition earlier maybe we could touch on that a little bit more we talked about behaviors resistance training maintaining maybe even increasing muscle mass um there's no pressure to uh include them but what about the very supplements that we hear about that can touch on or we we are told can touch on these hormone Pathways things like dim things like grape seed extracts things like um evening primrose I I don't think they're harmful but there's just not robust data to really support so um menopause Society went and looked at all of them even soy and everything and they just outside of cognitive behavioral therapy which can be helpful but is not a menopause cure um they didn't find much in the supplement world that would stop remember we're defining menopause as hot flashes and general urinary syndrome of menopause so you know when I'm recommending supplements to patients I do think there's some okay data on turmeric for maybe hot flashes but I'm not saying to take that instead of replacing the estrogen your body is is missing greatly um I like the anti-inflammatory benefits of of you know of that supplement I'm recommending F 80% of my patients are deficient in vitamin D and struggling to get it absorbed you know um I'm recommending creatine for muscle I'm recommending um there's a specific bioactive collagen that was studied in menopausa one with osteoporosis where they saw Improvement in bone density so I'm recommending a weighted vest great studies elderly women but saw improvements in bone density and I'm like why do we wait until we're osteoporotic to make the diagnosis yeah this is interesting so weighted vest a weighted vest they looked at creatine weighted vest vibratory training in nursing home dwelling so they were kind of a population where they couldn't go anywhere vibratory training is the shake plate uh the shake plate and so you know anything that stimulates that muscular skeletal unit will will send the signal to get stronger you know what most women don't realize I mean they know about osteoporosis right and they don't want to have it but they don't understand that like your habits in your 30s and 40s are going to put you on that path and that your body is going to fight to lose muscle and bone naturally through the aging process and accelerated with menopause it doesn't have to be that way but you have to do the work you know and and there's some hacks and so I love the way to vest for a hack I'm like do the dishes with it on go walk the dog you know like like how heavy so you want in the nursing home they started at 10% of their body weight so I'm like 10 lb 12 PBS start with that so now my husband's obsessed and we have six of them and they go from 8 to 35 lbs you know so I have different weights that I wear like if I'm doing leg day I'll put the heavier one on so I don't have to hold as heavy so you'll use a a weight vest when you're doing leg day mhm wow so I can't cuz I don't have great grip strength and you know and so it'll help me be able to squat heavier you know but now I'm getting better I'm got the bar going so I'm I'm getting there you know I'm want to tell my sister and my mom this yeah and you know I've got my sister yeah doing some resistance training it's been and it's just a cheat I'm so it's so cute on social because they'll post and tag me and they're walking their dog and they're doing whatever with their way to vest on and now in galvaston where I live you can't go you see it all over the sea wall everyone's walking with their weighted best on I love it and it's hot down there a lot of the year so no excuses people outside of Texas or in Texas for that matter but my experience is that people in Texas don't tend to make excuses anyway that's said like a real Californian here um we were talking about this a little bit earlier in uh female specific weight vests I would love to develop one because the ones were made for men and they're okay but if you have larger breasts it's hard where the Snaps are to get it on right and I know there's a big Trend with Wrecking but that puts all the weight on your back and I really like the weighted vest because I feel and this is my opinion really but that you know the reason why it's helping with your bone density is it's putting the weight on the entire axial skeleton rather than just the muscles on your back so we're putting the force more evenly supported yeah um and so but some of my uh followers have written in and said they're struggling because they have larger breasts and how to get this around I'm like I got to make one that's going to accommodate you know have longer you know dist strap down here underneath the breast so that's yeah someone should develop that you should develop that um not that you don't already have enough on your plate already uh along the top I like rucking it is sort of backloaded you know by definition um some of the weight vests that are out there are little um are evenly distributed in a way that makes them pretty comfortable they're not all loaded up up front like like a a special operator or something would wear so I positive effects of of the weight vest would be increased bone density you you're doing more burning a little more calories getting stronger but I'm I'm I coach to it you know with my followers for this is part of my osteoporosis prevention pack love it are you willing to share a few other things that are in the prevention pack uh you know eating adequate protein doing resistance training wearing your weighted vest creatine five grams a day where most of the studies were done in in the women creatine monohydrate monohydrate yeah and then um the that cagen consider that uh collagen full disclosure I do sell that one but um really good investment I think maybe we could talk about collagen for a moment um it it's a complete protein no no no it's missing one I think one or two amino acids so it's not a complete protein um it's better than none so I do like include my collagen in my protein intake for the day because I eat all animal-based protein pretty much um so I figure I'm I'm covered my bases to have you know 10% of it coming with just missing two amino acids or I think it's one valine I have to look it up so and what are the specific effects of a quality collagen so you know there's a lot of controversy there I've seen the videos it is broken down into its component amino acids you know through the digestion process but the first ones I looked at were totally for vanity I was changing bathing I was trying on bathing suits with my daughter who was a little girl at the time and I was complaining about the appearance of my cellulite even then people have cellulite and oh mommy it doesn't look that bad and I you know scientist in me was like goes on PubMed and starts looking up articles on on cellulite and how to decrease the appearance of it and so I found these articles on something called verisol and it was a college in made in Germany and they'd studied actually done like really high quality studies like laser measuring wrinkles and cellular ger are precise and uh they and it looked they had positive outcomes I'm like well it won't hurt me so I ordered some I Googled where do I find this verisol collagen I find this company I order it and then one day I talked about it on the internet and the company called me and said would you please let us know when you do that cuz they sold out of their supply for like 3 months so the same like manufacturer of that particular verosol made this forone did the studies five years doing bone density scans on these women it was a small study but they saw improvements we know what happens to bone density if you do nothing it goes down these went up and I thought okay I want to do and I want to offer this to people like if not then me this is a high quality product I can rep you know and that so that's part of my um what I offer to people or what I recommend you can get it anywhere other people sell it not just me great um so I'm perplexed this isn't a challenge but I'm perplexed how would a protein that's not a complete protein um be beneficial for a body organ like skin whereas the complete proteins don't seem to do it on their own nobody knows okay I don't know interesting are they studying the right thing or they're not really looking at it so I don't know there great when I hear I don't know the know the scientist in me says great area for for exploration because we don't really believe in fact we don't believe um that amino acids um that are derived are derived from a particular body part Target that tissue we've heard this argument before um Dr Lane Norton and I have both gone on record publicly saying there is basically zero not basic delete the basically there is zero evidence that when you ingest heart uh let's say you you like eating liver or heart or skeletal muscle that somehow the amino acids are selectively trafficed to the organ uh of the heart or the liver or the skeletal muscle there's no evidence of that whatsoever certainly not in humans if there is evidence um I'm sure they'll let us know in the comment section on YouTube and let let us know but yeah it's it's it's perplexing why collagen would have a selectively beneficial effect on skin they didn't study it versus a steak you know they just they just looked at bone density if they took this product every day for 5 years and what happened and they weren't you know they weren't having tremendous cardi metabolic disease they weren't on bone building medications they weren't on HRT so you know they they did a pretty clean so there's you know not a huge study but it was interesting and I thought okay you know I don't want to break because if I break my hip well 50% of women will have an osteoporotic fracture before they die 50% 5050 what about men do we know just by way of comparison I think it's 25 wow but don't quote me on that I need to look that one up so it's it's about half okay and then hip fracture if you if you break that hip if over the age of 65 you have a your one-year mortality with surgical repair is 30% if you if you're not healthy enough to have the repair you can't afford to have it it's 79 goodness so that's what we're trying to avoid is that you know and the tremendous if you've seen the women who have tremendous osteoporosis in their spine and just how their lives are so hard and how much pain they live in every single day you know this a lot of this is avoidable with aggressive you know being aggressive and and intentional about this and HRT can be a huge part of that as well what I'm about to ask is a little bit outside the box but I feel um Fair asking given that um you know I'm not a clinician but I have some background and certainly understanding of neurod degenerative uh conditions of the eye and vision have you ever observed in your patients that when they get on hormone replacement therapy for menopause that things that are typically associated with aging like diminished visual function um hearing you mentioned tenus also called tentis I understand but tenus I think we'll do both tenus cored and said tenus we'll do both um here that that they um they report seeing better hearing better and any kind of sensory Improvement or offset of sensory loss so we know the data is clear on dry eye and how that can affect um but how it affects like the optic nerve you know we know that estrogen is anti-inflammatory so any kind of like inflammatory condition in and around the eye does tend to get better but we need you know probably more data in this area for hearing most of the research is around tenus and vertigo so the the the rate of which the crystals break off in the ear accelerates in menopause and people on HRT have less vertigo new vertigo than they would have had before and I forget what the pathophysiology I wrote it in the book but I can't think of it right now um what the physiology was behind why tenus increases in um menopause but it's due to the estrogen levels declining you mentioned dry eye a lot of people might hear dryeee and think oh no big deal but actually dry eye is one one of the most frustrating things um to have and it's a uh I believe a many billions of dollars of a year industry to find treatments for for dry eye um so does estrogen replacement therapy improve dry eye it does seem to they have less incidents most of the studies are just retroactive and they're looking at the incident of those things on women HR on HRT for other reasons are not and they just see especially like frozen shoulders the best data there I think and um what they see is a decreased risk of occurrence and then if they do have it they have a shorter duration and easier cour you know easier to treat if they're on HRT fantastic so um what are some of the cases where uh a woman can't or shouldn't do hormone replacement therapy and here we're using hormone replacement therapy is kind of a proxy for for estrogen therapy yeah so any hormone sensitive cancer a one of the things a lot of women don't understand if you have dysfunctional uterine bleeding that has not been evaluated you should not start hormone therapy because we don't know if it's cancer so if you're having really heav especially if they're heavy bleeding clots out of nowhere you know something unusual about the volume or the the frequency of your bleeding you need to go see a gynecologist and get that evaluated before you start hormone therapy okay it may not be anything cancerous or tumorous it might just be the hormone changes but that needs to be evaluated um if known breast cancer no if you're actively having a blood clot that you're being treated for they're saying let's hold off until that therapy is over um even if you've had a hormone sensitive cancer including breast cancer depending on the stage the type and and it's a very nuanced conversation does not mean that you automatically disqualified for hormone therapy after your treatment so that is one of the biggest misconceptions out there if you have really severe liver disease I'm not talking about mild fatty liver disease lots of menopausal women have that and it does tend to get better with HRT if you have severe liver disease that is where estrogen begins to be metabolized and so you could have abnormal metabolism you don't want that so that you're that's going to keep you from being a candidate why do you think we're seeing or at least hearing about in my case uh PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome so much more is it because people are aware is it because I think two reasons one the Obesity epidemic had led to more PCOS that is definitely a risk factor for for you know insulin resistance is usually the the main pathophysiologic cause behind PCOS and I a PCOS then PCOS sufferer so I had it my whole reproductive life um both but you're not obese at all no no they missed it forever I was just stressed out medical student which can potentially cause PCOS with acne yeah I mean you you can have PCOS is a symptom of something biologically a barent turns out I'm insulin resistant which is why you know even though I'm thin and so we've had higher increasing levels of obesity which is a risk factor for that also people are talking about about it and that writing books about it Karen Tang just published um it's not Hyster wait hysteria it's uh it's not hysteria and she's a gynecologic surgeon does a lot of work around enetri so she has like huge chapters on PCOS and how to advocate for yourself and you know all about the disease process so people understand interesting what what are some of the primary treatments for PCOS is it going to be blocking androgens so yes and so for me you know in all my training it was always put them on birth control because it w it it will suppress ovulation and suppress the over production of androgens in their system so I was a very happy birth control patient because I was thin for the obese patients if we can help them lose weight it does tend to they start ovulating again and so now with the new go 1s a lot of PCOS will probably resolve itself and they'll start ovulating again and go back to normal Cycles that's the pregnancies that are happening from G ones I see so glp1 associated1 babies yeah gp1 we saw a surge of that when all the patients the obese patients were getting the gastric bypasses then they get pregnant and so we were advising them to not be pregnant until their weight was stable for a year after surgery because of the medical implications of nutrition and pregnancy but they were going to you know they were so excited and CED and now their libido's up and and they're you know getting pregnant and um never really needed contraception before and just assum they'd still have trouble and so now they're ovulating and getting pregnant and we're seeing the same thing with gop1 so I'm anyone listening out there who's prescribing a gop1 please talk to your female patients about contraception if they don't want to be pregnant very interesting and um admittedly uh unforeseen uh implications of glp1 as long as we're there um what are your thoughts onic monjaro um I think that they can be a really important tool for a lot of patients I don't think they're for everyone I don't think people are being counseled adequately a lot of them I mean in my area outside of galvaston where I live there are Med Spas giving out GOP ons and as far as I can tell they're just giving them the meds and sending them out the door I've had patients coming in on it who were never counseled about the potential for muscle loss so when I look at a patient's health I look at a 30-year plan right and so they come in with a lifelong history usually of of having a weight problem and a fat problem and and here's this medication that's going to take the food noise away and help them focus on the habits that are going to keep them healthy longer so I do have patients that I've prescribed it to we have a very long discussion about adequate protein intake resistance training you know I have a a way to measure their muscle mass we are tracking that every month for them every month to six weeks while they're you know on the medication so women who are on HRT with the glp1 have a 30% increased weight loss wow yeah yeah I appreciate that you mentioned that the use of OIC monjaro is not mutually exclusive with resistance training and improved nutrition the way it shows up on social media sort of like people assume well you know you gotta take great care of yourself and exercise well great but there are also a number of people that are carrying excess weight to the point where um they are at risk of injury when they exercise um I mean everyone's at risk of injury when they exercise but what I'm hearing is that you basically take the view whatever can get people in a kind of forward Center of mass around management of blood insulin levels Etc cuz wasn't that the original FDA approval diabetes diabetes um and there's also some datas I recall that OIC monjaro can reduce alcohol cravings that so yeah the reward center in the brain are the the noise so they're looking now I guess that my friends who are like obesity Medicine Specialists and are all like reading every study that comes out any kind of impulsive behavior or reward-seeking behavior gaming gambling alcohol you know people are tending to do less of those behaviors because whatever the whatever is being blocked in the brain and you know more about this than I do seems to help with that those drives that's interesting that the hypothalamus is uh choca block full of neurons associated with all sorts of drives and temperature regulation you mentioned earlier you know the preoptic area of the of the hypothalamus involved in temperature regulation and we've always viewed those as somewhat separate but they're actually um quite interconnected and and so I'm not entirely surprised that uh a drug that would reduce cravings for food might also reduce cravings for other things it's going to be really interesting to see um what the science and the animal models and human shows us over time it's definitely happening I mean this is has it hit a trillion dollar industry yet it's probably hundreds of billions of dollar know the majority of big F research and funding is is being funneled into this um maybe not all for the right reasons but the the Obesity Medicine Specialists who are kind of who I turned to for how do how do I do this how do I do it right um how do I not hurt someone just to get them to lose weight you know and are very excited because these new levels they say it's like the iPhone 12 the iPhone 13 like they're just going to get better and better with Lower Side Effects better profiles you know as time goes on that we're going to look back at the Muro and these earlier meds and be like oh my God what were we doing you know because of the side effects well if nothing else there very interesting to pay attention to because it's uh clearly uh in the cultural Zeitgeist right now so every once in a while when a guest for whom the topic is of immense interest coming on the podcast I'll put out a call on social media for questions and so uh if you're willing I'd like to just ask you a few of the audience questions um and we can treat these as rapid fire or um as much depth as you like um first off that many of the questions you've already answered things like um what the role for testosterone replacement therapy in women um as opposed to just estrogen replacement therapy but one of the more common questions in here that uh We've touched on but I think could um uh deserve a bit more attention is you know if a woman is in her 60s and has already gone through menopause is it appropriate for her to consider or at least just talk to her doctor about hormone replacement therapy or she putting herself at risk there's definitely worth the conversation so if I have a patient who comes in and she she's she's more than 10 years P her menopause or over the age of 60 and has not been on HRT then we start looking at risk factors for cardiovascular disease or stroke and so we're looking at her blood pressure her lipids her you know cholesterol and triglycerides and looking for things that are going to put her at higher risk she's lost probably the maximum cardiovascular benefit but we don't want to put estrogen on top of severe atherosclerotic disease so if she has abnormal cholesterol I'm going to send her for a calcium cardiac score I want to see if there's calcified plaques around her heart I may even if if stroke is a risk we may even Cent her for an ultrasound you know looking at the intimal thickness um of the kateed so if those are normal or lowrisk then we will talk about the benefits of what what would the benefits be for her after the age of 60 will we probably lost the best of the cardiovascular protection but it will always protect her bones it will always protect her genital urinary system it will always protect her skin I mean there's things that estrogen will do for us forever and so and then let her make the decision certainly if she's still symptomatic meaning hot flashes or things we can easily identify that we know estrogen will help with but you know that first tenear window is kind of critical for the preventative benefits but it doesn't mean she's not going to benefit forever now when do we stop used to be doctors make up numbers three 10 years whatever if she's been on it since early in her menopause and has not developed any of these diseases and she wants to keep going we're going to keep her on I will probably die with my estradiol patch on if I don't develop a reason to take it off because I know it's protecting me in so many levels and I want to keep that going in so many ways it sounds very similar to testosterone replacement therapy and Men the ideas that people go on why you stop at 70 why would you do that right you know if you didn't develop a contraindication to it very clear and um potentially very actionable answer thank you um a number of the questions related to um the relationship between menopause hormone therapy and mental health mental well-being um but let's just keep it simple for now and ask what are the things that women can do in order to um optimize or their mental health in per menopause and menopause and that they can do to offset any mental health issues that might arise during per menopause and menopause and there's a reason why I asked about those two things separately one is just to very different than menopause for mental health so a great question so I just went to a menop posium menopause conference in Chicago and uh there was a whole section on mental health and it was uh neuroscientist psychiatrists and and menopause Specialists all up there discussing the latest data it was so f fascinating and so there really is a big difference as far as mental health for what's happening in per menopause and what's happening postmenopause and as we talked about earlier in per menopause we have that hormonal zone of chaos and we see this you know in the Australian data it's a four times risk of mental health disorders especially depression and then in postmenopause a lot of these things tend to stabilize or get better probably because just the estrogen is bottomed out and the brain is not having to deal with these fluctuations so we think that the data is looking like the best treatment for the mental health issues in per menopause is going to be estrogen for stabilization and not the traditional ssris snris you know the anti-depressants and the anxiety meds not incidentally uh one of the more common questions was um in this case very specifically worded I've been on HRT for 5 years and I'm 61 I feel great but how long as it quote unquote okay to be on them seems like I hear conflicting opinions well we just heard a very straightforward opinion from you so thank you for that as long as you want to be as long as you're still healthy how can I stop waking up in the middle of the night this is a problem since entering menopause MH so we see sleep disruptions definitely from not only from the vasomotor symptoms which will wake you up okay if we can get those under control you know your sleep function should not be affected by that what we're seeing though is people even with HRT even with estrogen are still having middle of the night Awakenings or racing thoughts or having they get up to pee or something in the middle of the night and they can't go back to bed usually because their brain is is going on what we found is that progestin probably through the effects of Gaba is very effective at settling your brain down and allowing for sleep so I'm having my patients take their progesterone Orly at night before they go to bed and we're seeing better sleep with that and that was also something covered in detail I was so excited by the neuroscientist that's part of her area of research that they are showing clearly and she can point to the neuro receptors of where that's happening that progesterone seems to be really protective for our sleep now take hormones off the table sleep hygiene is still hugely important and I need to see the studies to prove it but I'm telling you we do not tolerate alcohol like we did Prem menopausal women are in at least 90% every time I post about it online I see thousands of comments of I quit I had to give it up I cannot sleep and even in my own life if I choose socially to have more than a glass of wine I am giving up sleep like it is a choice I'm choosing not to sleep that night I will wake up 2:23 3:35 whatever time in the morning sweating and I'm like you know too much champagne at New Year's or whatever so you know that is a choice and it's something I councel my patients about like you probably can't tolerate alcohol like you used to aging is a factor here our body composition changes and there's probably something hormonally that's going on we don't understand yet but like you choose this you're going to choose not to sleep more than likely interesting I wonder whether or not um estrogen modulates the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme but uh time hav't seen the data yet but I'm sure it's coming here's an interesting One how can men help their female loved ones navigate these stages yeah you get that question a lot my and it's it's great and it always comes on the when I'm being interviewed by a male you know when I'm interviewed by a female they're wonderful but they they have their own experience and they have to talk about it and that's fine that's my job you know is women have to unpack their menopause trauma to me but the men are just so curious and just have so many questions and then how can I support a partner and or my mom or whomever in my life who's who's dealing with this one is is acknowledge that this is happening and and try to educate yourself there's my book other books there's lots of information now on the internet about the subject but she is going through a transition that is in her world more than likely and is affecting her brain her bones her heart her kidneys her skin her ability to relate her ability to tolerate it's probably going to affect your relationship in some way go there with her go to the appointments with her be there to advocate for her you know be a partner through this with her because you will get her back but it's going to take you know changing the way that you address things a couple of questions about quote how to rekindle libido oh yeah this person in particular says it's packed bags and moved out since I started menopause they're reporting their individual experience but um you touched on testosterone therapy earlier any woman in her menopause Journey at any time there's a 50% sexual dysfunction rate meaning she's not happy with whatever is going on now when we look at the buckets where sexual function fall into we have orgasmic disorder now in menopause when we lose blood flow to the area people can have delayed orgasms or less um the peak of the orgasm is lower you know less vibrant orgasms for lack of a better word um they have decreased blood flow to the area they lose elasticity so pain is another bucket you know it hurts the skin gets torn it's very fragile it's very Frable so vaginal estrogen therapy can help there there is arousal disorders where you want to do it but the blood's not getting where it needs to go so you're not having all the arousal type symptoms so sometimes Viagra selenophile topical selenophile can be helpful there there and but the most common thing that women have is hsd or of course relationship disorder you don't love your partner you don't feel supported it's going to be hard to you know relationship disorder official the official term so but then hsdd is hypoactive sexual desire disorder that's in the brain and so first thing I ask is did you use to have a good libido or a drive yes you know and you have a good relationship with your partner it doesn't hurt you we have to rule out the other things that's where testosterone comes into play that that is those patients it does tend to help there are two FDA approved medications for libido one is VII it's an injection you give yourself and actually works for men as well about 30 minutes before it's in the alpha melany stimulating hormone path mordon and then there is um Addie addyi works at the level I think of dopamine in the brain so it's more in the family of ssris that you know so it affects neurotransmitter and so you take that every day um and it works it was only studied in premenopausal women but it does you know it's modest but it does seem to have an effect so but most of my patients because testosterone has so many other benefits you and then the the cost the to get it compounded in Texas is maybe 30 bucks a month so it's really reasonable um and the V and the atti can be very expensive and usually not covered by insurance so because of cost and and potential other effects most of my patients choose testosterone if it's hsdd I see this is a question about the um side effects associated with estrad hormone replacement therapy in this particular instance um the person says um what are the best alternatives to estrad I've tried tiny amounts and the side effects in this case um skin rashes and hives are what they are describing so I wonder if it's the patch so um there's a certain percentage of patients who it's not the estradiol it's actually the adhesive in the patch they will have a reaction to it so one is try an alternative form another thing that one of the members on my team saw in her her chat group is they get the flon so corticon nasal spray over the counter and they spray it on and let it dry then they put the patch on and it decreases the risk of the reaction to the glue um I don't know how if that lasts forever but I thought that was a cool thing to know about and um but what I typically do for my patients is change them to an alternative form interesting um thank you for that they went on to ask about um trying a new supplement called equil EQ u e l e about that one again I don't know what's an equil um but again not really robust studies but most of these things are not harmful but you may just it may be a little snake oil you know throwing your money away really the thing that's going to fix the problem for most women is restoring your estr yeah because there were other questions about you know wild yam and and things more in the supplement um space um as well as things like acupuncture and herbal medicine so um acupuncture can really be helpful um but again it's it's hard to access and can be expensive for a lot of patients and it's not treating the root CA but it definitely can help you deal with some of the symptoms and make you more comfortable and then um last question um how best to attack and here I'm quoting attack the fat distribution problem at this time yeah uh you need a multifactoral approach to visceral fat so nutrition exercise women on HRT have less visceral fat you know um those are kind of the key things and and the way you approach your nutrition with the exercise with the stress reduction getting those cortisol leveled down are going to make you healthier in every other way as well great well Dr Mary CLA um thank you so much for giving us just a wealth of knowledge about per menopause menopause really explaining what those are clearly um for the first time on this podcast and really illustrating the things that people can do to think about these stages of life and to to I don't know if I should say tackle or to dance with the stage of Life whatever um term one prefers in order to offset the negative effects and it sounds like in fact it's very clear based on what you've told us that there are real levers of control yeah including hormone replacement therapy but other things as well nutrition exercise um sounds like when we put all these together there's almost like a mindset around per menopause and menopause that you are um promoting um which is one of of real agency that this is not something that is um going to bury us mentally and physically that's something that really can be worked with and I just want to say on behalf of myself because I've learned so much from you here and uh the listeners and and viewers of the podcast thank you for the information today thank you for your clinical work um thank you for your ongoing Research into this area for attending these conferences and learning so much

Title: Brief Post-Meal Walks & Blood Sugar Regulation
Published: 2024-06-01 20:51:54 UTC
Description:
Dr. Casey Means and Dr. Andrew Huberman discuss how a 10-minute walk or light physical activity after a meal can reduce blood glucose levels by 30-35%.

Disclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer

Transcript Language: English
I have heard that a short walk after a meal will reduce blood glucose in a way that's really dramatic. Huge amount. 30-35%, just taking a walk around the block after a meal. That's definitely a prescription, I think, everyone should do, 'cause the research is so strong on it is that building in simply a 10-minute walk around the block or a dance party in the kitchen, moving your muscles for 10 minutes after a meal can drastically reduce your glucose response, 'cause you're just bringing all those channels to the membrane, you're taking up the glucose, you're using it. It's a whole different physiology than sitting on the couch after a meal. That's very high impact. It's high leverage if it's after a meal. So highly recommend that. And the Levels data and clinical data has shown that out time and time again.

Title: What Should You Do if You Get a Concussion?
Published: 2024-05-27 19:16:37 UTC
Description:
Dr. Gary Steinberg and Dr. Andrew Huberman discuss the general safety and resilience of the brain against everyday minor head impacts.

Dr. Gary Steinberg is a neurosurgeon and a professor of neurosciences, neurosurgery, and neurology at Stanford University School of Medicine. Dr. Andrew Huberman is a tenured professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford University School of Medicine and host of the Huberman Lab podcast.

Transcript Language: English
Does one need to worry about one kind of dizzy inducing head hit from everyday life? You know, I think a lot of people are kind of scared, like, do they do brain damage? Or is the evolutionary adaptation which is the thick skull sufficient to, you know, keep us safe in most cases. I don't think you need to worry in general, especially if your symptoms resolve within a relatively short period of time. Such as, how long? A day or two? Yeah, I mean, you know, even if you have a mild concussion and you recover within a day or two, I don't think there's any need to worry or get a scan, and it's a commonplace occurrence. Yeah, I think your answer will set a lot of minds at ease because people do worry. I mean, there's something so mysterious about the stuff that occurs inside the cranial vault. We can't look to something. We can't, you know, take our pulse. It's just, you know, it's so hard to know what's going on in there. Well, as you say, that's why we develop very thick skulls to protect the most important organ.

Title: Dr. Diego Bohórquez: The Science of Your Gut Sense & the Gut-Brain Axis
Published: 2024-05-27 12:00:32 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. Diego Bohórquez, PhD, professor of medicine and neurobiology at Duke University and a pioneering researcher into how we use our ‘gut sense.’ He describes how your gut communicates to your brain and the rest of your body through hormones and neural connections to shape your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. He explains how your gut senses a range of features such as temperature, pH, the macro- and micronutrients in our foods, and much more and signals that information to the brain to affect our food preferences, aversions, and cravings. 

Dr. Bohórquez describes his early life in the Amazon jungle and how exposure to traditional agriculture inspired his unique expertise combining nutrition, gastrointestinal physiology, and neuroscience. We discuss how the gut and brain integrate sensory cues, leading to our intuitive “gut sense” about food, people, and situations. This episode provides a scientific perspective into your gut sense to help you make better food choices and, indeed, to support better decision-making in all of life.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Diego borquez Dr Diego borquez is a professor of medicine and neurobiology at Duke University he did his training in gastrointestinal physiology and nutrition and later neuroscience and by combining that unique training and EXP expertise he is considered a Pioneer and leader in so-called gut sensing or the gut brain axis now when most people hear the words gut brain axis they immediately think of the so-called microbiome which is extremely important but that is not the topic of Dr borquez expertise Dr borz focuses on the actual sensing that occurs within one's gut just as one would sense light with their eyes or sound waves with their ears for hearing our gut contains receptors that respond to specific components of food including amino acids fats sugars and other aspects of food including temperature acidity and other micronutrients that are contained in food that give our gut the clear picture of what is happening at the level of the types and qualities of food that we ingest and then communicate that below our conscious detection to our brain in order to drive specific patterns of thinking emotion and behavior and of course everybody has heard of our so-called gut sense or our ability to believe or feel certain things based on perceptions that are below or somehow different from conventional language today Dr borquez teaches us about all aspects of gut sensing how it occurs at the level of specific neurons and neural circuits how the brain responds to that how specific foods and components of food impact not just our feeling of digestion or feeling good or bad about what we ate but indeed how we feel overall how safe we feel how excited we feel whether or not we feel depressed or sad angry or happy today's discussion I promise you is unique among all discussions of neuroscience at least that I've heard previously in that it combines two seemingly disparate Fields nutrition and Neuroscience indeed today's discussion gets into how different foods and food combinations impact how we feel and what We crave and what we tend to avoid we also get to hear the absolutely extraordinary story of Dr borz upbringing in the Amazon jungle and how his knowledge and intuition about plants has influenced His science and how the incredible science that his laboratory is doing relates to all of us and our ability to better tap into our gut sense before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is ju juv makes medical grade red light therapy devices now if there's one thing that I've consistently emphasized on this podcast it's the incredible impact that light meaning photons can have on our mental health and physical health red and near infrared light has been shown to have profound effects on improving Cellar Health which can help with faster Muscle Recovery boosting healthier skin reducing pain and inflammation enhancing sleep and much more what sets juv apart is that it uses clinically effective wavelengths emits a safe and effective dose of red and near infrared light and most importantly offers the only true Medical grade Red Light Panel available I personally try to use the handheld ju go unit as it's called every day and especially when I'm on the road traveling if you'd like to try ju you can go to jv.com huberman that's jv.com huberman ju is offering an exclusive discount to hubman Lab podcast listeners with up to $400 off juuv products again that's jv.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need that means the electrolyte sodium magnesium and potassium in the correct amounts and ratios and nothing you don't which means no sugar now ion others on this podcast have talked about the critical importance of hydration for proper brain and body functioning even a slight degree of dehydration can diminish cognitive and physical performance it's also important that you get adequate electrolytes the electrolytes sodium magnesium and pottassium are critical for the functioning of all the cells in your body especially your neurons your nerve cells drinking element dissolved in water makes it very easy to ensure that you're getting adequate hydration and adequate electrolytes to make sure I'm getting proper amounts of hydration and electrolytes I dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning and I drink that basically first thing in the morning I'll also drink element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing especially in hot days when I'm sweating a lot losing water and electrolytes they have a bunch of different great tasting flavors of element my favorite is the watermelon although I confess I also like the raspberry and the Citrus basically I like all the flavors and element has also just released a new line of canned sparkling element so these aren't the packets you dissolve in water these are cans of element that you crack open like any other canned drink like a soda but you're getting your hydration and your electrolytes with no sugar if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element spelled l mn.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with the purchase of any element drink mix again that's drink element.com huberman to claim a free sample pack today's episode is also brought To Us by Helix sleep Helix sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are of the absolute highest quality now I've spoken many times before on this and other podcast about the fact that getting a great night's sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance when we aren't doing that on a consistent basis everything suffers and when we are sleeping well and enough our mental health physical health and performance in all Endeavors improves marketly Helix mattresses are different in that they are customized to your unique sleep needs so if you go to the Helix website you take a brief brief two-minute quiz and it asks you questions such as do you sleep on your back your side or your stomach do you tend to run hot or cold during the night things of that sort maybe you know the answers to those questions maybe you don't either way Helix will match you to the ideal mattress for you for me that turned out to be the dusk mattress I started sleeping on a dusk mattress about 3 and a half years ago and it's been Far and Away the best sleep that I've ever had because it's customized to my unique sleep needs so if you go to helixsleep.com huberman and take that brief two-minute quiz you can figure out what mattress is ideal for your unique sleep needs for the remainder of this month May 2024 Helix is giving up to 30% off mattresses and two free pillows as part of their Memorial Day offer simply go to helixsleep.com huberman to get 30% off and two free pillows and now for my discussion with Dr Diego borz Dr Diego borquez great to have you here thank you for uh having me Andrew I am super excited to learn from you today as I know everyone else is and if they don't realize why soon they will which is that you work on one of the more fascinating aspects of us which is our gut our gut sensing the gut brain axis which I think most people don't realize is nearby but separate from the so-called microbiome so we're not talking about the microbiome a very interesting and important top topic of course but we are going to talk about this thing that we call our gut sense and how it impacts everything from our Cravings to our brain health and our cognition so once again welcome and I'll just want to kick things off by asking you to educate us explain you know what is this gut brain axis that we hear about and what's going on in our gut besides digestion well uh Andrew thank you so much for having me here uh thrilled to be here I knew that since we met a few years ago uh that we will have this ongoing conversation and a great conversation um the gut and the Brain you know people call it an axis because traditionally thought to be an IM imaginary line that was connected through hormones so since 1902 when uh the first hormone secretion was uh a reported by Bailey and Sterling uh um it was known that uh when we eat then hormones these molecules in the gut are released and then they will enter the bloodstream and then eventually will have a cause in distant organs uh and for the next 100 or so years the the the the field focus on the on the hormones and as a consequence there was no direct line of communication between the gut and the Brain but as often I I say you don't you don't say or we don't say the nose brain axis right like or the eye brain axis right uh and all of the organs are in sync working in sync so H in the gut there are also some sensory cells that are able to detect the outside world ER and then quickly communicate that information to the brain and I say the outside world because the gut is the only organ that passes throughout our body but it is still exposed to the outside if you think about it uh if you will swallow a marble it still has the chance to get out um please don't do that anybody but uh but is still exposed to the surface you're right I never thought about the gut as the organ that is in contact with the outside world unlike our heart which is not in direct contact with the outside world or our liver or our pancreas but the gut is the gut is uh and if you think about it it's just separated by uh some compartments that have all of these VVS you the epiglottis the uh gastrosoph gel Junction the pylorus The ilocal Junction the rectum so these are the the sequences of valves of Chambers with valves between them that food passes through air passes through and within each as I understand it there are different functions related to digestion but I think where you're taking us is that there are different modes of sensing what's coming through and signaling to the brain and other organs what's going on in the outside world by what's sensed coming through that passage is that correct that's correct and uh if we think about it uh um the when we swallow something literally we have to trust our gut perhaps that's why we use this phrase trust your gut right because after that there's not much that you can do at least in uh regular humans that you can do consciously to uh expel something that perhaps is poisonous or toxic right um it is the gut that has to make that distinction and then usually accommodate things for abortion or let them pass uh through digestion and then ultimately they will be secreted right so if you could describe for us the architecture that is the cells that respond to things in the gut and where they send that information and how they send that information what what is this thing that we call Gut sensing made up of what what's the parts list so the parts uh list uh has been evolving recently and while some of the elements we have known for for a while uh but in in general what we're talking about because is an external surface it is lined by a single layer of cells that are called epithelial cells and essentially these cells are exposed to the outside world but they also are like attached in like a little membrane and they are the ones that interface with the inside of the body so in the stomach we have an try toi a epithelium for instance that is uh thicker so it can survive digestion chemicals and other things like harsh environment and in the intestine we have a little bit more of a um uh more delicate uh epithelia layer and within this epithelia layer there are several different cell types and one of those is the so-called enteroendocrine cell to put it in more simple terms is a gut endocrine cell or a gut cell that releases hormones the term was coined in 1938 by a German uh physician uh his name was Frederick fer and at that time it was a major advancement in our understanding of physiology because he came up with the idea that the organs were not only communicating to organs in fact there were cells within the organs that were communicating to other organs through the release of some of these endocrine factors these neuromodulators or these neuropep that we know as hormones and uh so he named uh the diffus endocrine system of the gut and then he came up with this word enteroendocrine cell and these cells are dispar at a ratio of roughly speaking like 1 to 1,000 epithelial uh cells throughout the digestive tract and we thought for the longest time that these cells were not connecting directly to the nervous system that they will release these neuromodulators and the neuromodulators through diffusion will act on receptors into some of the nerve Terminals and that is true that is a very well established uh system uh but in 2015 we made an observation that some of these cells anywhere from 1/3 to 2/3 of these cells it depends on like the type of a systems that you use to identify they were contacting directly the nervous system and that brought up a a a new dimension of how it is that the gut could be could be communicating to the brain because as you know in the brain the synapses are the ones that are most predominant however there there is a lot of neurom modulation from endocrine uh functions in the brain too so in the gut uh this was not well described there had been historically uh a few examples that these cells may be making synaptic contacts but they had not been studied and perhaps one of the main reasons why they hadn't being studied is because the the tools were not there and if you recall in in the um in 1990s uh with the advancement of green fluorescence protein as uh one of the main uh molecules to tag cells now all of a sudden there was a revolution in biology because you could identify the cells you can take them out you can do a a transcriptomic analysis to see what genes they express uh you could co-culture them you can modify their genome and then you can start to interrogate what is their contribution to the entire body I'll just interrupt you for a second just to make sure that I never else is on board so if I understand correctly it's long been known that there are cells that are in these layers of the gut in the intestine and it's long been appreciated that as food passes through these cells somehow can sense the chemical constituents of the of the food as it gets broken down and then release hormones into the bloodstream that could influence the brain those hormones could travel and influence things far away in fact um for those that don't know endocrine generally mean signaling at a distance between cells so between gut and brain or gut and liver it can also mean local effects so uh hormones endocrine effects can also be local but if I also understand you correctly it was only about 15 years ago when you mentioned green fluorescent protein we should probably just tell the Tale in a few sentences this is an amazing story in biology where if you've ever seen fluorescing jellyfish that's because they express a gene for so called Green fluorescent protein and biologists have hijacked that Gene sequence and put it into mice and now actually other organisms as well which allows you to see individual cells and cell types so these cells release hormones the hormones influence the brain and other organs and now I think you're going to tell us that they also are able to make direct communication lines with other organs as well correct uh so maybe here is feeling how it is that I I got into a starting the system and uh as you know between the 90s and the early 2000s there was an explosion in tools to study uh the brain and neural circuitry and the connection of neurons and each one of the neurons because up until the 1980s um the the tools were were limited electrophysiology you know Behavior Uh but then not only we had a green fluorescence protein we we had optogenetics we had uh a rabies modified to be able to trace how it is the the neurons connect at one synapse which was a it was a dream I think that in fact that was the dream of Francis Creek when he was at the Suk he he talked about that having the way to control for those who don't know Crick one uh was a co-recipient to the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the structured DNA but then later in his career developed an obsession for neuroscience and yeah he daydreamed out loud about having tools to visualize individual Connections in the nervous system and as uh Diego is pointing out scientists have hijacked the rabies virus which hops between neurons labeled the rabies virus with Things That Glow fluorescent and in doing so we now understand a lot about what Crick dreamed for which was the ability to see different specific Connections in the nervous system yes uh so then you could isolate the cells and then you could do sequencing technology to see like what are the genes that the cells are expressing and then you can start to understand the makeup of the cells uh in 2009 uh h cers a scientist u in the Netherlands uh did a beautiful experiment like he he discovered these factors that will trigger a receptor of the stem cells in the intestinal epithelium and will form literally a mini gut in a in a dish you know these cells will be all lined up and then they will have alumin and I remember like seeing some of these papers coming out uh when I was a PhD student and and I was already studying the gut so it was inspiring to see like all of the things that all of a sudden you could do right so when I began studying the cells um immediately by isolating the cells and simply observing the cells in the native tissue of these um m models it quickly became evident that some of the cells had a very peculiar Anatomy uh some of them had these very prominent arms at the base like like literally like um in the 16 Chapel uh Adam reaching out to to God right like with a hand uh the cells will have that type of anatomical H features and even ending with a little hand at the end of that arm uh and obviously I I immediately thought like why would a sell that it is supposed to react to food and release hormones into the bloodstream or just in the vicinity will invest so much energy into developing an arm right so then I started to look well perhaps it is because it's providing a bridge directly into the vasculature into the vessels to put the the hormones into the bloodstream right uh grown you know like a I couldn't find that that direct connection uh so then I started to study perhaps they were associated with nervous system and that's how uh we made some of the first observations that some of them uh with the arm uh or without the arm they will have a more intimate relationship with nerve fibers and that of course open up um a bunch of new questions and but the first things that the first thing that we had to do it was to come up with a name for this foot and it kind of became organic and I want to highlight this because I think that as we go through the discovery uh trajectory we don't realize the need to also engineer language how we go about language is we start to attach a words that we already knew and we start to put them together to describe something that new that we're observing right and I say this because at the very beginning uh with my mentor we will start to call these little feet first we call them axon which is like uh the for like the long extending branches of the neurons the main branches of the neurons so we will call them axon like because they look like a a baby axon but then we called them also like Pudo po because it was like a pot but it was Pudo uh and at some point we and it was coming from like some cells in the in the kidneys that they are called uh po podia or something like that so it was axon like pseudo like basal process to describe that it was on the base so at some point it became so long that we couldn't fit it in an abstract right so a bit of a mouthful so we began thinking about it and then eventually I came up with a term I thought like ah neurot um and I remember pitching it to my mentor and I said like let me let me think about the weekend and then on the on a Monday he came in and he said like you know it has a ring to it I think that we should use it but but essentially the the the thought was that if these cells are contacting then perhaps they are passing information directly onto the nervous system and that is very different than just spewing a neuromodulators in the vicinity and hoping that some of those catch the nervous system right and like I said while that is still exist and I think that is just like matter of space and time like they they modulate these terminals in a different space and time the hormones but the transmission uh the neurotransmission is directly and more precise in space and time could I just um interrupt for a moment please so hormone signaling endocrine signaling generally is slower than the forms of communication directly between neurons right um could be on the order of seconds sure but typically on the orders of minutes or hours uh whereas neural communication on the order of milliseconds correct so if I understand correctly these what you decide to called neurop pod cells and thank you for shortening the name um from the other description um line the gut are we talking about everything from esophagus down to the stomach to the intestine or is it just at the level of the stomach and intestine where where do they this is uh this is where the conversation becomes expansive because uh these neopods or causings of these neurop pods so these neurop pods are simply a specialized neuro epithelial cells meaning that are electrically excitable that they can discharge electricity but they are this type of cells are in every single epithelial cell epithelial layer of the body because that's how the body creates a representation of the world through sensor cells that are equipped to detect the outside world meaning that they can be exposed to fluctuations in temperature fluctuations in PH fluctuations in concentrations and then they quickly can generate a chemo electrical coat that they pass it onto the nervous system and then ultimately the brain integrates that and says like oh my belly is feeling good but I'm feeling cold in the skin right and that is thanks to all of these neuroepithelial cells that they are even in um tasting so to speak the uh the seru spinal fluid inside of the spinal cord and the ventricles they are inside of the the inner ears The Taste uh The Taste SPS so it is and in fact there's a beautiful book from the 70s uh from some Japanese scientists uh fuet Canon Kobayashi who uh called the cells Paran neurons and their whole concept is that there was not such a discrete distinction between an entire a neuron that lives inside of the brain or the central nervous system and a A neuroepithelial or a neuroendocrine cell that leaves exposed to the outside simply that there is a continuum of adaptation so the the organism can bring the information from outside inside into the uh body to be able to process it and then process it and then guide Behavior So based on the way you describe it we have these neurop pod cells that line our gut and we also have these similar cell types in the other organs of the body and these cells are responding to the chemical constituents of what we eat as the food is broken down also to the temperature of the environment to the pH the that is how relatively basic or acidic something is that we ate and presumably to other features in our environment as well and all of that information is activating these cells to some degree or another and then we're releasing hormones into our body as a consequence but also there's a direct line to the brain and we're not necessarily aware of all of this happening right I mean until you describe it I think most of us are have not been aware that this is happening and we probably shouldn't be aware you know like as I often say like um if you and I are having a conversation we probably shouldn't be aware of the macras and the spleen that is chasing this bacterium that got inside of the lettuce that we swallowed in at launch right like just do your thing so we can keep communicating right except maybe don't eat more of that lettuce right which is the okay so you discovered these neuropodial to selectively label them what did that reveal about their connectivity with you're referring to it as the nervous system which I love because a resounding theme on this podcast as I always say you know brain and spinal cord and all the connections to the body and back again is the nervous system but what what did you discover in terms of the connections with the brain proper here is where the tools started to make a a big difference you know all of the sudden you could see the resolution of a receptor inside of a cell using certain type of microscopes right so I remember that one of the first questions that I will always get drill on you know how these uh laugh meetings can get intense right like when I will bring data and showing just very simple um imunohistochemistry meaning labeling to see how the cells were interacting with uh the nervous system um as and I will show some of the images then uh the other scientists will say well you know yeah those are nice images but remember that contact does not mean connection you know and I went thinking about that like at the very beginning I thought that it was silly semantics you know um but I I specifically remember that there was one time I was running and I was thinking like how do you demonstrate connection between two cells and then I thought that since we had the ability to identify the cells by fluorescence we could isolate them based on their fluoresence and what will happen if we put them in front of a sensory neuron and then just record them inside of a microscope right over time and I thought maybe they will get close to each other and then we can go and do some more labeling and show that they are H contacting or connecting but much to our surprise we actually saw that in real time they when you isolate them from the mouth and you put them in a dish they both look like these round circles but after a few hours not only they get close to each other but they recapitulate the circuitry in the dish literally they form like two brains in a dish right like it's the gut and the Brain in a dish amazing uh yeah and that that was an eye opener you know I still remember it was somewhere I think it was like June 27 2012 when I saw that experiment because um it opened my my eyes to so many different things one was that this cells are not a static because since we have been seeing them for decades just in as slices or fixed tissue and we have lost the notion that this thing is constantly moving right the cells are actually moving the cells are actually moving so these cells line the gut meaning they're along the walls of the gut an intestine yeah the intestine they reach a hand into the gut to sense whatever chemicals are there yeah they have Little Celia little hair or microvi that is literally like little hair that is exposed to the Lumen MH you know so the Lumen folks is the the cavity the empty cavity of the gut not empty but you know the the the internal part and so they're sensing the chemicals there and you're saying they can move okay and they're sending a process by the way folks anytime you don't know whether or not something is a dendrite or an axon just call it a process you you'll get it right uh a process up to the brain underneath that will connect to the nervous system I see so through a series of of of stations yeah okay um amazing so what we're talking about here is Diego's discovery of a pathway from the gut to the brain that essentially allows sensing of what's happening in the gut to inform feelings decision correct yeah so that that was uh the first experiment like showing H in addition right the next experiment was well does it happen in the in the mouse and then through a series of I have a friend neuroscientist that she calls this Ravis gymnastics because you have to put in some genes and make things work then we demonstrated that these uh cells that the virus will be capable of infecting these cells specifically instead of infecting the other epithelial cells it will infect these new epithelial cells because rabies likes neurons and then it will jump from that cell into a nerve fiber and these ravies can only jump one connection right and what it was uh surprising is that the fluoresence from that rabies will show up in the brain stem and in the bodies of the cells that are in the noos ganglia which is this cluster where the cell bodies of the um neurons of the begos nerve are located right underneath the the neck meaning that there was just one stop between the surface of the intestine and the brain stem the two cells were connecting that um that space you know so obviously the information that was the anatomical basis for the information to travel very rapidly up into the brain and rapidly in the subconscious right like we're not necessarily aware of it although uh I've read that there are some instances in which people become more aware of it either in uh a ag typical uh fashion or with meditation and other things that people can become aware yes people definitely can become more aware of their so-called interoception what's going on at the level of their heartbeat frequency or their gut sensing if they spend time on it some people as you mentioned develop an almost pathologic sense of interception such that they have trouble navigating normal life because they're so aware of what's going on inside their body this is actually an interesting issue in the field of Psychiatry my colleagues in Psychiatry at Stanford tell me that um some people with a lot of anxiety for instance are so aware of their heartbeat that it becomes um disruptive and distracting to them so it's not always the case that it's better to become more aware of your internal processing sometimes it can be um dilus other times it can be good for us um some people are very unaware of what's happening in their body and they need to develop more awareness of that I feel like as long as we're talking about rabies we should have a little bit of fun and explain to people something about rabies viruses because what we've been talking about is the use of viruses as uh experimental Tools in order to you know take a virus basically attach or put something in so that whatever cell is infected by it glows a certain color so you can see the cells and visualize the circuitry but as long as we're talking about rabies I feel like it's such a uh a word that has such salience the rabies virus which exists in nature um is amazing because it's um I don't know if it has a Consciousness but it essentially propagates between animals by way of the animals that have it bite they they become more aggressive they bite a um a Target animal the virus gets in it's picked up by the nerve Terminals and is carried back from one ner cell to the next across synaptic connections right synapses the G little gaps between neurons and what Dr Diego Boris has been telling us is that scientists have engineered the rabies virus so that it only jumps one station and then stops you can do this by modifying the coat protein there's a bunch of fun virology that can be done uh to do that but what I find amazing about rabies virus and there's a great book by the way called rabid which is a a essentially a history of the of the study of rabies um is that once it travels from the S of the bite up to the brain what does it do it changes the brain to make the now infected animal or person more aggressive so that then they go bite somebody else um so I mean in some ways that the viruses have a sort kind of unconscious genius to them right what's the best way to get from one animal to the next well there are a number of different ways but one way is to just make that animal more aggressive so it goes and bites things yeah make wild make the animal work for you right make the animal work for you right it's it's it's almost exploitive right it exploits certain circuit in the nervous system I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 by now most of you have heard me tell my story about how I've been taking ag1 once or twice a day every day since 2012 and indeed that's true I started taking ag1 and I still take ag1 once or twice a day because it gives me vitamins and minerals that I might not be getting enough of from Whole Foods that I eat as well as adaptogens and micronutrients those adaptogens and micronutrients are really critical because even though I strive to eat most of my foods from unprocessed are minimally processed Whole Foods it's often hard to do so especially when I'm traveling and especially when I'm busy so by drinking a packet of ag1 in the morning and oftentimes also again in the afternoon or evening I'm ensuring that I'm getting everything I need I'm covering all of my foundational nutritional needs and I like so many other people that take ag1 regularly just report feeling better and that shouldn't be surprising because it supports gut health and of course gut health supports immune system health and brain health and it's supporting a ton of different cellular and organ process CES that all interact with one another so while certain supplements are really directed towards one specific outcome like sleeping better or being more alert ag1 really is foundational nutritional support it's really designed to support all of the systems of your brain and body that relate to mental health and physical health if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs with your order plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink ag1 /h huberman okay so you uh identified these you said described but you I'll say discovered because um that's what happened you discover these these cells you label their connections you see that there's just two Stations between these cells or one station really between these cells and the brain and so now these cells can sense chemicals in the gut that are the consequence of the breakdown of food and send that information directly to the brain what does the brain do with that information all so here comes uh the key experiment and this was building obviously on the work of other scientists that had already described that the gut had some uh receptors for uh sugars for specifically for glucose for other nutrients around this area in the early 2000s when we were starting to be able to identify some of these cells then uh it quickly became uh obvious that uh these cells these enteroendocrine cells throughout the lining of the stomach intestine colon they had multiple receptors for multiple nutrients you know like we have the macronutrients for instance sugars fats proteins but within them we have you know a repertoire of molecules you know multiple uh lipids multiple types of sugars and so on and so forth and these cells depending on their location they will Express a different type of receptors or a combination of those receptors and I said depending on the location because when we're eating let's say an apple you know the apple is going to be partially undigested by the time that it enters intestine but by the time that it gets to the the colon most of those nutrients have being absorbed and perhaps only fibers are surviving to feed off most of the microbes that live in the colon right so the gut has evolved to mirror and to become a velro to the molecules that will be in that in that specific space so it will detect so um it will detect sugars more in the proximal intestine but fibers or uh fermented by products more in the distal intestine or in the colon like shin fatty acids beate prop propionate um and so on and so forth you know what other kinds of nutrients do these neurop pod cells detect from food so you mentioned sugars you mentioned ferment fermentation so um presumably short and longchain fatty acids yes the short answer is that uh I think that in due time we are going to realize that they detect just about every single thing that we put on our mouths every day you know uh that they have some either an a specific receptor that is dedicated to it or a combination of receptors to be able to detect um some of these compounds and not only the chemical compounds but also an area that I think that is going to be fascinating in the future is the mechanical distension plus uh the the adjustment in temperature as the Kim starts to flow from the mouth into the colon like for instance I I I heard this from a bioengineer not long ago that was engineering a artificial gut on a stomach and he uh shared with me um a piece of information that I was not aware of that uh the esophagus has to adjust the temperature of the food very rapidly within seconds into physiological temperature of the inside of the the body like so we're having hot coffee within couple of seconds it has to be at the physiological temperature of the body by the time that it gets into the stomach right and all of that happens in very rapidly amazing suff right so if I understand correctly these neurop pod cells have a variety of different receptors depending on where they are located along the trajectory from the mouth to the rectum that's correct and some are sensing sugar some are sensing temperature some are sensing pH so relative acidity some are sensing amino acids presumably I mean I've heard it said and I believe there's a a researcher down in Australia who's been very bullish on the theory that we are not exclusively but we are predominantly amino acid foraging machines because we need amino acids for all sorts of important biological processes um and these cells are essentially evaluating how how much sugar how much Lucine how much um uh short chain fatty acid how much um you know essential fatty acids of different kinds and then making changes to the gut itself but then presumably signaling that information elsewhere in in the body so um here I'm going to give you a something that will get your gut Ching so to speak so these cells have to make sense not only of the molecule that had been ingested meaning the chemistry of the molecule let's say it's glucose it has to make sense a little bit of The Taste is it sweet right is it bitter then it has to take into account how much of the molecule is absorbed inside of the cell right so that's the second layer of integration then once the cell has eaten that molecule so to speak then that molecule will be digested inside of the cell to release ATP or some other uh compound ATP is for energy for instance that has also have to be taken into account for instance in the in the in glucose glucose activates the tas1 R3 which is a sweet taste receptor then the glucose is absorbed by some of the sodium glucose Transporters which are active Transporters and these Transporters uh depolarize the cell and then once glucose gets inside of the cell glucose enters the TCA cycle is catabolized and then produces ATP and the ATP further activates another uh voltage gated Channel further depolarizing the cell and then the cell releases in turn a transmitter for instance glutamate that very rapidly tells the vus nerve within milliseconds you know I got sugar uh and it tells it in two phases because that glutamate will activate two different type of receptors ionotropic which are very fast and metabotropic which are a little bit more you know more delayed uh but then the metabolism of that glucose that produces the ATP and farther polarizes the cell we believe that um it will cause the release of the hormone of the neuropeptide so then the neuropeptide comes on top of that and gives you that full experience of what it means to uh consume sugar right um so that happens at the level of one cell and at the level of one molecule so imagine like all of the computation that the gut has to be making for each one of the molecules throughout the digestive tract so if I stand back from the picture um what I get is there are very interesting cell types that line our gut that are evaluating all of the not just macronutrients proteins fats and carbohydrates but micronutrients within the food we eat as well as some of the other qualitative features temperature for instance maybe even quality of the amino acids or the sugars you know simple versus complex sugars Etc if we could just further zoom out for a moment and take a human perspective on this at the level of experience I once heard you tell a story about um someone you knew who changed their gut radically and that changed their entire perceptual experience of food including certain Cravings would you mind sharing that story yes uh thank you for uh bringing that story Andrew that story is very personal to me I of often say when I get on stage that we are constantly influenced by two things in life the food that we eat and the people that we meet you know like now I uh we have known each other but now we meet in person and we are knowing other people right and I remember that when I was uh starting my PhD in nutrition at North Carolina State University I was uh so I didn't grow up in the United States I uh grew up in Ecuador and uh I was invited to my first Thanksgiving celebration so I sat at dinner and you know as we began chatting with uh the people that were next to each other uh all of a sudden I was uh enthrall in this conversation of a woman telling me this story about her experience with gastric bipass surgery for treating obesity so gastric bipass surgery uh was begun to be um developed by surgeons uh in the 60s and by the 90s it had become a mainstream uh type of surgery for the treatment of uh chronic obesity so she told me that there were primarily three things that happened she said well within uh six months of the surgery I had lost about 40% of body weight you know she said like I was about 300 pounds you do the math you know so it was a it was a significant amount significant amount she said within one week of the surgery my diabetes was gone she said I did not need more insulin shots so I had the same reaction that that you're having I was like that you know I don't know much about diabetes but I know that is is a major health uh burden right but the thing that really caught my eye was when she said but since you're studying nutrition I want you to answer this to me she said why is it that before the surgery I could not even look at sunic Side Up X she said uh just looking at the Yoke will make me quizy you know but after the surgery no not only I can eat sonide up eggs I actually have a craving for the yolk she said every time we go on Saturday to a restaurant for breakfast I will take the toast and will actually clean the plate uh of the Yol so how is it that rewiring the the gut uh alter my perception of uh of flavor alter my my cravings and my mind to to get the the Yol she said and even inverted her sense of what was aversive versus repetitive and and I guess for those of us that don't know meaning me um I understand the gastric bypass surgery involves the removal of a portion of the of the gut um how much gut tissue do they actually take is it centimeters inches I mean the guts a long distance so what what what do they do for gastri in in in simple terms the most um the classic surgery is called uh ruin y gastric bypass surgery which involves a a reduction of the stomach and short cutting the uh connection of the stomach to the intestine so you will cut you know 1/3 which will be the dadum uh one third of that will be uh cut and then that portion will be reconnected to the stomach meaning that you're short circuiting the the gut and the whole idea was at the very beginning was like well if we reduce the surface that is exposed to food then we can reduce body weight by the simp L um reduction of surface that is exposed to the food that is absorbed right and uh what it became very clear is that well before the body weight uh changes got taken place uh there was already like some dramatic changes in physiology like like the hormones the neuropeptides that we release from uh the intestine in response to nutrients you know will change very rapidly then as I mentioned the food choices will change diabetes will be resolved um so then it became obvious that it was not necessarily just the the uh reduction in the surface of of the gut so that's one of the main uh surgeries the other one um as I understand is vertical isaf gastrectomy and this vertical s gastrectomy is simply a a reduction in the size of the stomach so is now the stomach is very tiny and the idea is that will accumulate uh less it could hold less food and then the food will go very rapid rapidly into the intestine and what is very is becoming very obvious is that there is a rapid change in the sensory function of the gastrointestinal tract so the gut seems to rapidly shift perhaps become more so to speak in general terms more sensitive to the presence of nutrients right interesting so this woman that you met at Thanksgiving had G gastric bypass surgery and presumably I think it's fair to assume a good number of these neurop hot cells that sense different nutrients were removed and as a consequence she completely shifted her craving of a particular food and is there any sense whether or not no pun intended the lack of sensing of what was in uh you know Sunnyside egg yolks was somehow related to a shift in appetite or something else or is it merely a a a um a qualitative albeit a dramatic qualitative sh in in what she craved so two uh contextual pieces of information uh so I remember leaving that dinner and I was like wow this is Major you know like I'm sure that people have green about this or don't research um and I realized that it was very little was known even gastroenterologists knew very little about this the first clinical report that um the alteration in food choices was common in these patients uh came out I believe in 2011 uh and then later on scientist replicated that even in rats or in mice uh we have done it in the laboratory and consistently they they Chang their food preferences their their um food choices so er in in recent years we have been we have been uh studying that that system um and I will tell you that in 2022 this is another important contextual piece that we have gotten have not gotten to it so after we uh found and we describe that these cells were connecting to the nervous system and that they were sending information up to the brain very rapidly the challenge was well if this is a sense what behavior is affecting right like how is it that is affecting the the responses of the organism and that took a little bit of a a technical hdle and here is where optogenetics uh comes in yeah please um explain for people what optogenetics is in at least at a top Contour level yeah so optogenetics uh 205 uh Professor Carl daero Ed boen and other scientists had been able to make this this dream of an experiment which was uh isolate the the genes that encode for these opsins that are sensitive to specific wavelengths of light and put them into neurons and now by turning that light they could make the neuron activate and then ultimately then later on they went on to describe that that could be used to control specific cells that are regulating behavior and then by that Define what cells are orchestrating certain type of behaviors like movement food intake thirst anxiety so on and so forth so in 2014 we we began H trying to adapt that technology to the gut very quickly we realized that the way that was that light was brought into the brain was through a fiber optic cable that was rigid and uh and in the brain you know it it helps that it's actually rigid but in the gut it doesn't help because the gut is constantly moving and so on and so forth so it's not compatible for running those experiments and here's where I usually say like you know we really don't know what is going on because some some forces like move around us and in 2017 uh Professor Paulina Nika from MIT came to give a talk at Duke and uh she reached out to me and literally she came and as we were chatting she said like Diego I see that you're you're working between uh in this interface of the gut and the brain and I have this fiber optic that is flexible you know would you have any use for it so with that H fiber optic that made a big difference to study interrogate the function of these cells to behavior so when we were able to put those opsins the light sensitive uh proteins inside of these neurop pods and now when we turn the light on to shut off these cells very rapidly we found something very interesting so normally animals when you give them the choice between a suer which is the void of caloric value so like a like a aspartame or or Stevia or something y uh and you give them sugar table sugar the animal invariably will go to Sugar they prefer sugar they prefer sugar you know uh if they have never seen sugar it will take them a little bit more time but regularly um by the second day is within 90 seconds that they detect what is sugar so they're drinking out of one tube they get some water with stevia they drink out of another tube water with sugar and they invariably prefer the water with sugar that's correct and uh people have described this um this phenomenon for a while and in fact in 2007 There Was An Elegant experiment done by Professor Ian Deo at Duke University in which the uh sweet taste receptors were or the The Taste uh receptors were genetically erased and the animals um were not capable of distinguishing the sugar the sweetener from the water but they could still distinguish sugar from uh water meaning that there was something else that was detecting that that sugar so just to make sure people are on board an experiment where sensing of sweet taste at the level of the mouth is eliminated does not disrupt the preference for sugar water correct which means that there's something going on below the depth of Consciousness that causes mammals presumably us included to prefer things that have sugar yes and uh then uh Professor ton clani he had been studying these uh these behaviors and he went in so far to suggest that perhaps the sodium glucose Transporters are some of the ones that are detecting the the sugar as it enters the intestine and that's what is causing the behavior um so we began working on the system and we we Wonder Could these cells be the ones that are guiding that Behavior Uh and around the time that uh we published this work uh Professor uh Charles zuker at uh Colombia also further uh Advanced that that area by uh building on the on the previous work and demonstrated that um there were a population of neurons in the brain stem that were integrating this information from the gut uh and by that ER the gut and the Brain were guiding this this Behavior so and it is true that from the earliest of Ages We crave sugar or at least if we are exposed to the taste of sugar it tends to drive seeking of more sugar you can see that in babies even correct and as I usually say um I call it instinctively because our mother doesn't have to teach us hey uh Diego that is glucose you know uh it may present Us in some ways but uh at the end of the day I have to go and get my glucose get my am acids right because eating is very simple we're just trying to solve this issue of getting our carbons getting our nitrogen getting our phosphorus our potassium our sodium and our chloride in so many different ways shape or forms right so I went back to the experiment the key experiment so when we were able to put these opsins and bring the light and shut off these cells very rapidly when we had presented the animal with a choice of sweetener over sugar then all of a sudden the animal became blind to the solutions it couldn't discern between the the the stevia so to speak or the sweetener from the actual sugar and the entire manipulation the experimental manipulation that is is occurring at the level of the gut the intestine that's right right after the stomach it's like just a small portion of the intestine so if we make an attempt to transfer this to the human Real World Experience um um if I have some ice cream it tastes sweet I like it and now I'm thinking about it and I'm craving it just a little bit I don't have a huge craving for sweets but um I do like some of them so eating ice cream it tastes sweet the tendency is to crave more that's correct right you have to eat a lot of ice cream before you're truly full yeah um and most people self-regulate or their parents regulate for them um by limiting the number of Scoops or something um and that sweet taste is part of the motivator but what you're saying is that as the ice cream enters the gut there are neurop pod cells there that are also sensing the sugar and signaling to the brain and the brain is responding to pursue more of that sweet containing substance that's correct and it's happening below our awareness it is independent from the Sweet Taste of the ice cream correct the the conscious sweet taste the conscious sweet taste which if you think about it it's not fully conscious right you know as a what we detect of the world it's just a very tiny little portion right even sight you know like we think we are looking for light but I don't know what is happening behind my my back I trust that everything is going okay right so um so when we shut off uh the cells uh the animal and as I usually say like became blind to the sugars because it's kind of like uh a keing to having turn off the cells that are able to detect light the wav length of light for us to be able to discern color right and it's not that the animal is losing its memory because then you if you remove the light and now the the cells are functional again then the animal again is able to distinguish one solution over over the other uh and then we did a couple more experiments in there and what happens uh if we do the reverse if we turn on the cells now and the fascinating thing is that when we turn on the cells now the uh the mouse will eat the sweetener as if it will be sugar interesting so the activation of these cells makes them crave non-caloric sweetener or low calorie sweetener as if it were sugar but is it blinding them to the difference between sugar and low calorie sweetener so here's another piece of information if we will offer them water and we will turn on the cells the animal will drink the water as if it will be sugar like it will be appetizing even though it's just plain water yes and what is becoming very obvious is that uh the gut has this sense at the most basic level what the senses are uh doing is calculating a couple of things one is um in the salience of the stimulus is like how intense is the stimulus and the other one is the veilance of the stimulus is a pleasurable or painful so to speak in like broad terms and I say this because on the on the pain side um uh Professor David Julius professor hly in uh jinra at UCSF they have done some beautiful work demonstrating that there are these serotonin releasing cells specifically in the colon they have focus in the colon that they couple two a nerve fibers of the spinal cord and when they are activated now all of a sudden they drive what we call in the clinical uh realm visceral hypers sensitivity so they are responsible for triggering the hypers sensitivity of the nerve fibers the colonic nerve fibers because they detect no noxious stimuli and then ultimately they gate that noxious stimulate and pass it on to the nerve fiber as a in Broad terms as a painful stimulus so is this irritable bowel syndrome it is we could call it as the biological bases of what could degenerate into irritable ball syndrome and so on and so forth or these chronical GI uh they call them uh disorders of gut brain interactions in the clinic I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better meet your personal health goals now I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term Health can only be analyzed with a quality blood test now the problem with a lot of blood test out there is that you get information back about metabolic factors lipids and hormones and so forth but you don't know what to do with that information with inside tracker they have a very easyto usee online platform that allows you to see the results of your blood test and then offers you various actionable tools such as behavioral tools nutritional tools and supplementation tools that can help you move those values from your tests into the ranges that are optimal for you if you'd like to try insid tracker you can go to insid tracker.com huberman to get 10% off their new subscription model which has significantly reduced prices again that's insidetracker decom huberman to get 10% off as a neuroscientist I was trained to think about the neural retina the light sensing tissue at the back of the eye the ca the essentially mechanos sensory cells in the inner ear that respond to sound waves not directly but through a number of different transducers and this kind of thing and then of course Where You Are all familiar with the skin and that it responds to pressure light touch tickle itch Etc what I'm understanding based on what you're telling me is that all along the pathway from our mouth to our rectum we have sensory cells that are evaluating the chemical constituents of the foods that we eat emitting broad kind of maybe even crude slow signals in the form of hormones to change our appetite our feelings of well-being maybe our feelings of not wellbeing um but also sending direct signals to the brain to drive certain types of thinking emotions and behavior what sorts of thoughts emotions and behaviors are foods known to evoke through this pathway from the gut because the story about the your friend that had the gastric bypass and then changed the relationship completely to the craving of or the aversion to uh Sunnyside eggs indicates that it's a pretty crude as I'm describing a system to begin with but It ultimately converges on pretty fine scale decision-making you order this and you avoid that um you really like this and you really are almost nauseous at the thought of something else that's pretty high level decisions it might not seem like it to most but um you know it's impacting you know significant be Behavior or impacting Behavior at a significant level that's correct um and and uh when I think about that specific example uh is that after there has been this rewiring of uh of the intestine then now the intestine is very sensitive so to speak to the stimuli and when those lipids from the Yoke start to enter the intestine if that sensitivity has changed meaning it could have change in how fast it reacts to the stimulus or how fast it communicates to the stimulus and how s sensitive it is to the saliency or like the the the strength of the stimulus it could communicate that o what it used to be repulsive with a tiny little bit of amount now it is actually pleasurable with a tiny little uh bit of amount and here's a a clear example so it has been very well um I will say that it has been documented uh in the clinic that patients that undergone gastric Bass surgery they're actually more prone I think that the the the it goes from like two to Sevenfold uh the likelihood that they become they they will they will develop alcoholism really yes uh because now the way that they describe it is like well you know either before I didn't like wine um and then now I you know after a few months of a surgery I'll have one glass of wine and then all of a sudden I found myself going to 2 three four you know and then they will become either more sensitive is still not known the entire biology but they will become either not only more sensitive but more more attracted to that type of stimulus I can't help but ask about OIC monjaro and glp1 glucagon like peptide one um analogues which are really out of all the rage right now at least for discussion but many many many millions of people are now taking this for treatment of diabetes and for weight loss um my understanding is that glp1 acts at the level of the brain the hypothalamus to reduce hunger but also at the level of the gut to give the sensation of more gastric distension is there any knowledge of whether or not glp1 interacts with the neurop Pod cells and this pathway that you're describing given what these neuropodia complimentary question and uh in fact when I got into uh studying in this field uh 15 years ago uh the study among scientists in this area uh glucagon like peptide was already very uh popular uh in the study in fact in this area it was people were very focused on on the study of this peptide and they were very focused on the study of this peptide because it was one of the most potent um stimulators of insulin release in the pancreas uh after gastric bass surgery it will actually increase its amount in uh circulating levels uh and there were already like uh some uh studies suggesting that the the effect of this gluc glucagon like peptide it was actually not through the circulation but more in a localized uh action onto nerve fibers especially of the vus nerve so there was already like someone going um discussion about this uh and certainly some of these enteroendocrine cells these um neuroendocrine cells particularly at least in uh in animals I think it's more distal and uh in the digestive tract that they do release this glucagon like peptide um one in response to primarily like all of the macronutrients but primarily sugar and then these glucagon Li peptide one will act on specific receptors of the nerve Terminals and then will trigger some of the behaviors is also thought that uh it acts at the level of the uh the brain stem and what it will uh potentiate is the reduction of uh appetite so I say that this is a complimentary question because what is happening in the first few milliseconds is the actual choice and the actual feeling of how you feel about food and what is happening in the minutes two hours later is the amount how much you can eat right and when you should stop because after four hours you're going to come back and feel again the tickling of the gut because the gut starts uh to churn again and it starts to call for food remember it has to fit uh two giant organisms the host itself but also the microbes that are inside right so it has to H keep uh so to speak that that hunger going every 4 hours or so right so that's why the hormones are more acting on the cyclical uh circadian way but the transmitters are acting in this very fast uh responsive way of uh the precise stimul stimuli in a specific uh regions of the gastrointestinal tract so these neuroendocrine cells are releasing glp1 or responding to glp1 they're releasing uh glp1 they're releasing glp1 to shut down transiently shut down hunger and probably there is some interaction between the cells that they are they are having you know the technical term is autoc cring or they are having like power cring between the cells you know neuromodulation but primarily let's say they respond to the stimulus and release gp1 onto the nerve fiber right I have a theory uh for which I have no direct data but I'd like your thoughts on um having spoken to a lot of people that work on nutrition but also gut bra brain axis today and U microbiome in previous episodes that one of the key things that a human learns somewhat unconsciously but also consciously is the relationship between a given food which macronutrients it contains the ratios of you know carbohydrate protein and fat the taste of that food the amount of that food translated into to calories but also physical volume and then the micronutrients why do I say this well there are a growing number of studies showing that the ingestion of Highly processed food leads to the intake of excess calories or more calories than if one consumes Foods in their more natural form single ingredient Foods or two ingredient foods are very different than a food that has a bunch of different things in it and it seems to me that if we were to look back into our Evolution um sure people were making stews soups and things for a long time um presumably the sandwich came about through a either desire for convenience or taste or both uh you know putting Meats protein in between two pieces of bread something of that sort um by definition of a sandwich maybe some vegetables in there as well some cheese but that what this whole pathway along the gut is trying to do it seems is to deconstruct what's coming in what's here and shaping choices as you mentioned about food Choice including the amount of food to further consume and whether or not to return to that food or to avoid it and at the extremes it seems pretty straightforward and this is a very classically described case right you you go and you have the um you know the kungpow shrimp or you have the lentil soup at a given place and a few hours later you don't feel right start some sweating some gastric distress and you develop a pretty broad aversion to that food or maybe the entire meal maybe the restaurant maybe even that entire type of Cuisine depending on how um how much of a lumper or versus a splitter you are as we say in science right how much you you make uh kind of large large bin decisions or fine bin decisions um this is nerd speak for saying you know do you do you go back to the same restaurant but order something different or do you just decide to never go back again but that's a pretty extreme case right the other extreme would be you eat a food it's delicious you feel wonderful the the restaurant the people it's wonderful and you crave more of that food okay there's all the contextual stuff too but what we really are talking about here is how one navigates this whole landscape of what to put into one's body in terms of nutrition and trying to understand how that's impacting everything from how we feel right away how it tastes whether or not we conceive it as good or bad for us whether or not we think it's impacting our body composition and health in ways that we want or don't want I mean it's pretty complex stuff right this is at least as complex as going to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and looking at a painting and trying to evaluate whether or not you really like that painting or not in fact it's probably much more complicated than that but it's what we do and I'm beginning to get the the asense again no pun intended that this pathway that we call the gut brain axis is really it's a six sense of a very elaborate kind so you just touch on a on an entire realm of a topic which is one of my favorite topics because at some point you know uh we as scientists we travel we travel the world and it started to become very obvious to me that wherever I went we solve this issue of food in a very similar way whether it's a tortilla or two pieces of bread which is another way of a tortilla uh you have your carbs and then you add a little bit of meat or a mushroom and now you have your protein or fish or chicken or fish your chicken the the carnivores will say Mushrooms not a protein the vegans will say mushroom beans lentil great protein we're not here to to resolve that debate um do as you choose and then you add the lettuce or the vegetables and here's the first stop in that com the first uh stop in that in that discussion because this is fascinating there is some recent work showing that if you remove the protein from a diet the animal swallows that that that meal ER the gut evaluates that there is no protein in there and it stops eating that meal wow so this is like um ordering the vegetarian Taco yeah or burrito or sandwich and then avoiding that particular taco or sandwich thereafter because it lacks protein because it lacks protein okay so foods that lack animal-based proteins are tend to be avoided going forward so here's the second part of that no and in fact if the protein is low not completely absent if the protein is low the animal consumes more of the diet because it's trying to compensate for the lack of protein and obviously if it has sugars or fats that are more pleasurable it keeps eating that that that meal right I see if the protein is completely absent the animal avoids that diet unless unless the diet is very rich in uh dietary fibers and the study that uh that I saw uh which I thought it was fascinating is that because somehow the microorganisms in the digestive tract if they have enough highly digestible fiber now they turn on the ability to synthesize essential amino acids really yes so our gut meaning the neurons in our gut are essentially waiting for hoping we give them a Consciousness proteins from animal sources that's correct if those animal proteins arrive in the form of meat fish eggs Etc the cells signal to the brain craving more of those Foods until satiety is reached but in the absence of that protein the animal quickly learns the person quickly learns to avoid that particular food unless there's fiber in it in which case these gut cells are able to now synthesize the essential amino acids microorganisms excuse me the microorganisms of the gut here we're talking about the microbiome now can synthesize the essential amino acids that ordinarily would come from the meat chicken fish or eggs that's right so wow so I'm I'm an omnivore I love meat high quality meat but I also love vegetables fruits and starches of certain kinds but I have friends who are vegetarian vegan many of them eat a vegetarian vegan diet that includes a lot of fiber and you're saying that the fiber itself can trigger the gut microbiome to synthesize the essential amino acids that ordinarily would come from meat but you also said if I recall that if there's a small amount of protein so not zero protein but a small amount of protein in there then We crave more of that food in order to try and get compens protein very interesting because this is the first thing that to me squares the argument based on the observation that or the hypothesis that we are essentially amino acid foraging machines and that complete proteins in the form of meat fish chicken eggs Etc you know there are those that argue those are the quote unquote best forms of protein right the most complete forms but there are many vegetarians and vegans who seem to thrive on a vegetarian vegan diet and you're telling me that perhaps their body is their gut microbiome is compensating for the lack of whole animal protein that's right but the people who are trying to limit their meat intake are what hungrier in general so you're better off either indulging it or avoiding it but not having a small amount of it is that the idea the the idea is that uh the the the body or the gut will be able to detect that and then we'll try to compensate right I see and this I I actually learned um recently from a friend Laura dubal at Colombia who works uh does some beautiful work on mosquitoes and how it is that they they feed on uh blood she came for the gastronauts uh uh series is she from Leslie V Vel yeah and what I learned is that when the mosquitoes are not reproducing they can leave off ATP which is the energy molecule right uh but they cannot lay X they need the protein in order to be able to lay eggs otherwise the mosquitoes cannot lay the egg you know so this leaves us with a picture of the gut sensing cells these neurop pod cells as exquisitely sensitive to amino acid content in our Foods um which makes perfect sense and it has not been published or demonstrated yet sure we're now in the realm of of new incoming data we want to highlight this bracket it bold face and underline it as we're now at The Cutting Edge of what's may be coming um that's right right observation um but nonetheless very interesting but there is this fairly long-standing hypothesis that we are foraging for essential amino acids because they are the building blocks of so many important things in the brain and body and in fact there is evidence on that and Professor Steven Simpson in Australia uh in uh the uh in nutrition uh Research Institute at Sydney University he is uh main proponent of these protein leverage hypothesis you know that and in fact protein is the most suting uh macronutrient so that that has been established and that's why uh normally we have focused on sugars and fats but we have neglected a little bit of on the protein because it's not as pleasurable as the sugars or fats but what is fascinating is that is the most suting um nutrient and as you know it's like the most limiting and also like even commercially is the most expensive right yeah I certainly have had the experience of um at one time in my life really enjoying and even craving sweet Foods desserts and sugars and things of that sort and I noticed that over time if I eat sufficient amounts of meat chicken eggs fish and which is not to say that I consume excess amounts of them that my sugar Cravings go way way down that's just my personal experience but I know it's an experience that family members of mine and others share as well but I promise you that this was a a fun um a fun topic right I couldn't uh we couldn't stop at like just layer number one layer number two is that in agriculture we have this instinct to plant plants that a complement each other like for instance a classic um especially native among native communities is called like the three Marys uh I believe is a a um pumpkins or some type of fibers with corn carbohydrates and Bings so in purely plant-based diets there's an effort to get the fiber the sugar and the amino acids that's right and I grew up uh in a in a farm my my parents had farms and I remember when they will plant they will also like throw in there the the beans and the beans will wrap around the the corn and it just seem like so natural and that's what you will do because that what you learn to do but if you think about it it's an instin that we have developed even agriculturally probably in the subconscious to cultivate them in such a way or perhaps the plants taught us how to cultivate cultivate them in such a way that now when we put them in the plate it just makes sense ER at the nutritional level because if you think about it every time that we go to eat how is it that we arrange that plate right there is some rice which is very deficient in in some essential amino acids but is rich in carbohydrates right it has some beans right uh and then there's some lettuce you know and sometimes we have like for omnivores people will put meat or you will put other types of protein in there right and certainly it varies by culture time of year food availability and things of that sort as long as we're talking about um your upbringing um you have a fascinating story um so maybe we could could discuss that for a few minutes uh where were you born uh I was born in the Amazonia of Ecuador a small town called el Cho in Ecuador uh is on the slopes of um the Eastern slopes of uh the Andes on the way to the Amazonia uh in the Napo Province uh coincidentally was like through the path from where uh Francisco the Orana in uh 1542 march on its way to the discovery of the the Amazon actually passed through a a trail that later on reading I realized that uh Native people had all of these Trails between the Amazonia and the Andes and the coastal line for thousands of years so you grew up in a very rural yes uh the uh oil had been detected in the 1920s in Ecuador uh it was first explorer in 1964 in uh the first uh ER oil um um well was uh in a town called lag Wago which now is only like three or four hours from the town where I grew up but at that time it was like eight hours the roads were not good and the first road passed through it uh in uh 1974 uh I was born in 1983 but I remember that we used to have like a a giant um a diesel T engine that will give us a light electricity only from uh 7 to 900 p.m. you know uh I remember when my father bought the the first uh a um color television in the in the town and then neighbors will come to the our living room and then we will watch movies wow and this was in the 80s that was in the 80s right um such an interesting upbringing so um did you eat a purely vegetarian diet or you ate Meats as well where did those meats come from if you did primarily from a cattle uh goats ship so how do you go from the Amazon to a study of nutrition and ultimately Neuroscience um yeah uh that's the question right like the deeper I go the more I question I used to think that oh it was very simple you know like when I was um uh specifically when I was 11 years old uh my father he was born in 1932 uh by 19 he lost uh his father my grandfather when he was six years old then he was giv away and he had to go and like build his his his life uh he was a very successful entrepreneur but in the process he had uh made a lot of uh a lot of friends and acquaintances so when I was 11 years old I remember specifically that a friend of of his who was in the Special Forces stopped by uh our home because that was the main road that we go into the Amazon jungle where the uh folks in the special forces in the in the military will will be trained and he stopped by and said like hey roio like what are you going to do with Diego you know like I think that is about time that you know I think that you should send him to the military school and I remember in a matter of like literally a couple of weeks or three weeks I had given the taken the tests and um I was accepted into the military school and then uh I ended up in a military school and this was the at that time it was the premier uh military school in the in the country that alone it was uh with years you start to understand the context in which you you developed uh because it was a it was a very interesting context for for a child like just to give you an idea uh these these uh this school had the first and the only zoo in the country so from my uh classroom I would literally look at the at the at the Lions and then I think that was by the second year that I was in the school second or third year that became that because the the the city start to grow and then the the military school is wrong and then they separated the higher education for Military Officers they separated them and they put them in a different place but that Zoo actually became the first zoo of the capital of Kiton wait so you had a zoo with lions at your school yes and you said you could could see the lions from your classroom and they could see you presumably probably know yeah well I assume they could see you uh lion vision is pretty good I don't know what the resolution is but I'm guessing that their Vision yeah they they definitely use their old faction but they are uh sight sight based Hunters as well so but I I have a specifically uh one memory like climbing up I think was like from the because we had an Olympic pool and we had all of these events um they they they the the soccer field uh was the the field where the uh national team will go and train on because they didn't have their own their own um H training grounds later on they had their own training grounds so but that was something that you just grow into it right like but you it was with the years and now especially like that I get to reflect on it I was extremely fortunate uh through that experience and that education and now I'm I'm I'm here sharing some of the story and hopefully uh through that inspiring some people uh especially young people that would like to go and chase their dreams you know so you you went to military school in Ecuador yeah you graduated and you decided to go to to uh yeah so I was allowed to become a so in the military school they will select uh the top uh Cadets um like I think was the top 10% and they will select them and they will put them through a special training um so you have essentially didn't have like what was a normal summer vacation you know I will go into a military training uh ER so for me it was going to be very not easy but relatively straightforward to transition into officers Academy right like do four more years like West Point here and then like become an officer right in fact I I had a reserved officer degree when I graduated but two years before graduating a friend man who uh he prefer other types of uh careers he said like you're not going to become a military right you're not going to go into the military and he said you should probably study something that will help your parents and then I said what will that be and he said like uh perhaps agriculture uh and I didn't think at that time it didn't dawn on me uh that uh you know people can study for agriculture and agriculture is like the base of food um er for all of us right and then I said where and then he mentioned for the first time this University in zamorano which was founded with some uh uh some funds that were donated by um the founder of the Standard fruit company which eventually became I think chikita banana Zam zamurai and that is an oasis that is in Honduras outside of tusi Alpa so it's a boarding school you wear uniform so it was kind of like military it's very strict uh you cannot accumulate more than uh 12 de merits otherwise uh they will send you home how do you get a Dem Merit um hey you show up uh two minutes late to uh work in the morning at 6:00 a.m. in the field and then you just get to two minutes late one De Mer 12 of those you're out two demerits two demerits you're out yeah you get a we used to get a um they they will check your room so for instance a guest like you if you will go there like they will give you a every Wednesday they they had at seven they will check your room but like very meticulously right and if they found a little bit of a dust on the window or something to the merits um and you're going home if you accumulate enough you will go home right wow um so it really forms character right and then do you do that with your kids no I think that I have become do they make their beds they do make their beds yeah okay but that's that was the context and it was then where I learned about two things one is where this idea of getting a PhD because I noticed that most of the leaders will have a PhD most of the leaders in the university and I realized in the United States is one of the training runs main training runs for phds and the other one was nutrition I was a little bit more King on perhaps going into a Veterinary um uh school and then uh I had an experience in a a dairy farm in uh California where I learned the value of uh nutrition there was more prophylactic rather than uh a paliative or like treating the the cow right um and that kind of convinced me like to look for a uh training in nutrition and then a friend of mine uh the late uh AEL gernat he was able to connect me with um some uh some friends and my mentor at uh North Carolina State University and that's where I ended up doing my PhD nutrition you know and that's where like the career be became and then maybe another detailing there is that that I uh I was so excited about taking uh that's where I took my first physiology class and all of a sudden I realized that in a way the body was like a machine right like obviously is a limited way of thinking but the body was like a machine and one of the professors was um a neuroscientist uh and I took two physiologies two human physiologies with uh with him and I was just thrilled by when he will explain how is it that in the synaptic terminal there were these vesicles that had like these proteins that will walk that vesicle in the preoptic active Zone and that's how we make movement you know or something like that um and I guess I kept that in the background of my head and when I had the opportunity to work in the gut uh I applied that so you were Enchanted by the nervous system yes yeah as as I was too I I'm um nothing to me is more um spectacular than the realization that we are made up of these little tiny cells many different types but that the neurons essentially govern our entire experience of life it's just amazing um well that's quite a journey from uh the Amazon to uh well this table and and much and much more of course um thank you for sharing that uh so you grew up in a uh let's call it a plr environment the Amazon at least from the pictures I've seen very um let's talk about plant Botanicals and um the idea that maybe plants for lack of a better way to put it have a certain intelligence or a composition that is not random with respect to our interactions with them right uh you described how agriculture in some places has evolved to include and ensure the different macronutrients and essential amino acid intake even in the absence of animal proteins you said the pumpkin or the squash the corn and the beans um what are your thoughts on Plants perhaps from the Amazon but elsewhere um too and their capacity to have things in them um chemicals that can be uh good for us at the level of the gut but perhaps at the level of the the brain or other organs as well yeah how do you think about plants these days so the first thing you you you mentioned there like uh intelligence right I mean I don't know like if that exact terminology applies but I I do like this word wisdom because it's reflected uh experience right and I said reflected experience because somehow we are uh going over the experience and plants have been many more Millions years of age on Earth than any other animal right therefore they have had way more time to actually experience the ground so to think that they they don't know what is going on um I think it's a little bit uh perhaps naive is the word I went to um the the the main Court of the uh these Mayan um ruins of kopan at the junction between Honduras and uh Guatemala uh this was a very special city of the of the Mayans and in the main Court you see like all of the EST Stellas which are like the main uh stones of the of the kings of several dynasties and at the top of one of the uh the the the stairs of on these pyramids there is this giant uh SAA uh tree which is like 650 years old something like that so that tree was there before the spers uh landed in there when the um Mayans perhaps were still celebrating things or perhaps right after right so imagine how much information that a organism has in there and we will be able to just tap somehow into that information like climate uh fluxuations organisms interactions movements I mean like so many different things right like that right now I don't think that we even have the the language of being able to understand at the organismic uh level of how much information that is stor in one single one of those organisms but then think about uh a um uh a chloroplast for instance or like one of the photosynthetic uh organel inside of the the the cells uh how is it that they have been shaped for hundreds of years in those organisms right um and I think that perhaps in the future uh this is more of a Sci-Fi right now but perhaps in the future we we will be able to harvest that type of wisdom we will be able to understand a lot about the uh about the the place or the Earth that we live in that's Point number one uh Point number two is that this plants have been interacting and we have been interacting with plants for hundreds of years right and obviously we are a consequence of the environment right like here driving in in La uh or driving in a major uh City uh for some of us is just like second nature right but if you go into a jungle then all of a sudden it will not be the same thing right but for somebody that has been in the jungle for hundreds of years now all of a sudden they are able to describe with such a sensitivity of like how it is that the the the jungle is uh the makeup of the Jungle is in there I've seen uh Native people walking through the jungle without shoes and right before for stepping on a leaf stopping and then pointing out like look underneath that leaf and then like lifting it out and then a tarantula right there like how do you even uh make sense of that like I don't have the sensory acuity or the wisdom to be able to figure that out uh but they do right and certainly that is a is is just a level of um sensory perception that uh I am not equipped with uh but I do think that there's quite a bit of that interaction in there to learn and then of course not only for food but also for medicine for textiles uh and for many other uh functions uh these plants have been part of the ecosystem of how these people navigate uh their world all the way from making a canoe to uh making a backpack to carry a fish from the river into the house right so how do you think we evolved food choices and flavor preferences I imagine humans you know um that existed long before us being hungry the gut starts rumbling and there are all these plants everywhere and some nuts and some berries and things and so they had presumably no choice but to consume them and decide at the level of the the mouth like that's bitter no that's not good maybe eventually cook those and see if that changes the relationship yeah I'm thinking raw Acorn versus cooked Acorn you know yeah um but that ultimately there was a lot of trial and error and that these neurop pod cells which surely existed for a very long time prior to us played a key role in Discerning what's in these plants barks Roots nuts berries we're setting aside Meats for the moment and other animal proteins and making decisions about what's nutritious what is safe what is not safe and that's a pretty complex process given that some things might taste okay go down okay but then you run into serious trouble later but given the critical importance of ingesting sufficient amounts of macronutrients and the need for micronutrients to survive on a day-to-day basis much less reproduce propagate one imagines that you know this is like almost as essential as breathing you know and that and that this path of in our nervous system of the neurop Pod cells to the brain for sake of decision making of yum yuck or me is perhaps one of the most important core functions of the nervous system once you get past the elements that control breathing heart rate um you know temperature regulation things of that sort I see it is some among the senses it's at least as important as vision and perhaps more in terms of making sure that we survive from dayto day that's correct and uh here's where I think that is a large vacuum in biology uh if I will be with my biological my training in biology if I would put my my hat of the training in biology I wouldn't be able to explain much of like how is it that we figure it out because uh even if you just go to a Botanical Garden here uh in you know in the city I will be really hard to figure out um you know what plant is for what right yeah what safe to e what safe to eat not you know uh maybe like the Coti you are able to figure that out by touch right so from the biological perspective I think that there is quite a bit in there to explore and to learn there is some very interesting work from the anthropological perspective so anthropologists and ER ER botanists that were studying the plants um were exploring the jungles not only the Amazon uh but Borneo Sri Lanka and so on and so forth and studying the interaction of native people with the plants and if uh going through the literature that literature there is a pattern that emerges and like uh the native people they talk about how it is that they actually learned from the plants that the plants were the ones that were uh teach them you know so that's why I said from the biological perspective like how can we make reconcile that uh I think that there is still quite a bit of uh to learn what does that mean to to learn from the plants I mean there's something that intuitively makes sense uh and when you say that I've heard about um you know looking at plants as teachers about the local environment you know when they're open right they're light sensing when they're closed um but you know in terms of trans ating some of that to you know how humans have learned to navigate given environments navigate meaning you sort of thrive in those environments um how do we go about that does it mean taking plants grinding them up and figuring out the constituent parts or is that too reductionist is that going to leave us with a parts list that doesn't mean anything sort of like if I split out all the pieces of a a car or an airplane um in front of us it doesn't really tell us anything about that except what parts make up the thing that flies yes and that's why I said like this is more on the anthropological um studies that have uh you know especially from scientists that have gone there learned the language leave with the natives as natives you know and then start to understand the dynamic of uh their culture and their interactions um then that's when like for instance uh how it is that they classify uh plants the way that they classify plants is like several levels more richer than our classification our our scientific classification by um the two name system or the variety right like for instance they take into account not only the the flavor but also the shape uh the location uh how they uh interact over the year how they react over the year uh for instance there's this beautiful plant that um people call it a the lips plant I don't know if you have a very if you Google it you will see it uh it's like lips literally like lips it has like these red beautiful lips like uh the the the plant just looks like lips um and then people use it for uh pain for some rashes skin rashes and also like in some rituals and like most of these plants um the the way that the natives interact with the plants is in a sacred uh level you know there is this respect for the plant right um so yeah I think that uh biologically I think that there is quite a bit in there to um understand and explore and Define I do agree with you that like just thinking about grinding it up and like just putting it in a in a tee perhaps is to uh reductionist it could be a beginning of a understanding but it is reductionist seems like nowadays in the field of bioed research and clinical research that there's a lot of interest in uh plant-based psychedelics um you know LSD from Urgot and psilocybin mushroom um and so on and so forth iasa iboga um so it seems like science and plants have merged at that level in terms of clinical implications of course there are entire fields of plant biology that are extremely important I think most people probably don't realize this but a lot of what we understand about circadian rhythms grew nope pun intended out of our understanding of plant circadian rhythms first and then it was translated to mammals your beautiful work by Steve Kay and and others um seeing the circadian rhythms in leaf opening and orientation of the whole plant and and other features of plants that are mirrored by the changes in um arousal level in in mammals including us which is why I'm always telling people to get sunlight in their eyes early in the day and to avoid bright light um in the evening and night time um so what are your thoughts on Plants as a source of medicine psychedelic or otherwise I think that uh well traditionally that's where medicine was um developed from I was at uh the Oxford uh botanical gardens uh last year with the family and uh we went into the gardens and they have a beautiful garden was established in 1621 I think was the first uh Botanical Gardens in England and they have a beautiful uh medicinal plant collection and there was this very humble uh a um uh what little sign with a description in there uh that said in there that about 80% of medicine it still comes straight from Plants really yes uh and if you think about it uh it kind of makes sense right like because you know when we think about like the the medicines that we have been able to develop which have been phenomenal for especially for certain chronic diseases uh but we don't have like a broad uh repertoire uh of it right um so I think that has been obviously a great Advance um in in our society that we have been able to identify the molecules uh synthesize the molecules package the molecules render them by available in a specific sites uh and I think that when we are able to couple that with the rest of the molecules that the plants through their I keep saying their wisdom because somehow they develop their ability to have not only one molecule but like a combination of other things that will provide the full experience of of the plant right uh for instance uh Gera mattive you know it's not only caffeine right because it's very different than a shot of espresso you know if you take the whole thing uh it not only gives you energy but it gives you a full range of experience that is specific to the yamatic which is a is a leaf right yeah it's a distinctly different um sub subjective experience than coffee and I I enjoy both coffee and espresso and yum mate you um were the one who introduced me to gu guayusa which is a is a causing of jate because jate is parensis WUSA is elix WUSA and it's not as bitter as mate but it has uh almost as much caffeine as coffee and it has antioxidants and other uh compounds um which give you this very smooth uh experience so natives in the in the in the Amazon they take uh a drink of a WUSA every morning uh around 4:00 a.m. between 4 and 6:00 a.m. they they wake up early they actually call it yes like Joo willink early yeah some people understand that joke he wakes up every morning3 A.M he post a picture of his of his Casio watch yep and he's already training 4:30 so no no guay Uso required for Joo and uh they call it the WIA opina Ura the hour of the WUSA and is a ritualistic uh drinking of the WUSA in the morning and where they talk as a family of the issues that they have had the the days before or the week before like either with other communities within the family if they have to reprehend or repr uh one of the children or talk to them about like some mistakes that they're making and then they plan the the full day of activities uh by drinking uh WUSA and uh around 5:30 because they will boil the W USA right and they keep boiling the W USA and they just keep adding uh water to it uh and then around 5 5:30 then they will have what is called um the is a bowl of um CH and Cha is this H Palm date uh very rich in lipids and fibers uh so they will have the WUSA because the WUSA they say that gives them energy it heals uh any any pain uh it shuts down appetite so they will eat at like 3 p.m. you know shuts down or modulates appetite as does your brma those one of the more potent effects actually of of mate and guayusa is a mild to moderate appetite suppression and then if you combine that to Cha which gives you the lipids and then it's like a full meal for until 3 p.m. and then you they go on a work in the in the fields interesting so they're essentially starting the day with hydration caffeine and then they what in some circles they call Fat fasting meaning consuming lipids in order to Stave off hunger I mean so highest density source of of of calories among the macro macronutrients and is a vegetable um based diet I guess right uh are they a healthy culture do they live a long time uh I am not uh and I should probably do more reading that I'm not well educated in what are the um studies that have follow up uh on the ER you know and the healthy status of the communi but what I can tell you is that uh at least colloquially I will say that the diabetes those type of issues are not as prevalent but they do have obviously through like social exposure they have other things you know yeah fascinating um this morning ritual of um conversation about family and culture and what's needed planning the day um we had on this podcast as a guest Dr sain Panda who is um at the sulk Institute for biological studies often known for his work on intermittent fasting Tim restricted feeding but also um has done beautiful circadian biology and he talked about um the use of Fireside Chats um not the sword on stage but you know uh gathering around fire at night um is something that has existed in many cultures where people reflect on the previous day and discuss issues social and work issues and sort of dissect what's happened and talk and um it's about um building and repairing relationships um sounds like in this is it a what is this group is it a rural is this a yeah native Native Community because there are like about 70 or so communities that have been uh documented in uh in the Amazonia with their own language with their own traditions and many of them share the same uh type of traditions and if you think about it like a podcast is a one way of an evolution of that conversation right like where we can have this extended conversation and get this uh the more primordial things the ones that we have them in the prefrontal cortex right away and like discuss about like well you know this discovers this identifications but then we get to the the part of like what does it mean for the whole Community yeah there's um doing there's reflecting and then there's um resting and recovering right and there is something about like leing that for the next uh generation right you know yeah passing on of lessons better learn from the mistakes and success of others if you can as you go forward very interesting um if we could I'd like to now return to the biology the nervous system absolutely um and thank you for that Voyage Through uh some of your background um in Ecuador fascinating I um due for a mug of guayusa um sometimes I'll mix the two the loose leaf yerba mate and the guayusa um and as you said what's how does he feel I really like it um most of the time it's loose leaf yamate or cobu yamate um it's um but sometimes I'll mix in the GU guayusa leaves um and what I do like as you mentioned is you can continue to pour water over them for many hours and it tastes different as the time goes on and my guess is you're extracting different things from it in different concentrations as time goes on I realize it's not a precise science you know it's it's interesting today we're talking about very precise neurons and methods of tracing neurons and spe sensing of specific Amino acids and lipids at the level of the gut then we're also going to um more macroscopic uh View kind of a broader scale view of the plants having many things that um need to coexist in um in certain ratios that the plants have evolved to create for us um so we're sort of straddling both both ends of the of the Continuum and if I could fit in their story I not long ago I visited a a friend a native friend in um a in a nearby by town and he produces some of the best uh chocolate uh what I say in the planet you know because actually um uh the plants of theobroma cacao it was recently documented there was a paper in science not long ago that it was domesticated in Ecuador in near uh where I grew up uh and uh they have done some tracing and genetic tracing and um so he produces some of the the best chocolate like literally like he harvested in there and then he roasted grinded and then he prepared uh for us in there and he the Swiss are saying well the belgians right are claim the best chocolate but now we know e Ecuador is the place for the best chocolate I think I just got a lot of Swiss and belgians angry at me for saying that but um it is do they have a very dark variety I like the extreme dark varieties you know 95% even even 100% chocolate if it comes from a really quality Source can be absolutely delicious it's like milk straight from the cow right like and what he did is like he said like uh Diego you you have to try it um with W USA and he mix uh the chocolate with WUSA as a as a drink a like as a drink boy like that will give you wings you know guayusa hot chocolate yes and uh and it's a very smooth experience right like you're mixing this tea which is for energy with uh chocolate you know of the best quality so we're not talking about eating chocolate and drinking tea we're talking about about melting the the chocolate in the in the GU in the guayusa it was something like Wonder hour kind yeah know of course I couldn't sleep until like 3:00 a.m. I think right there's something to do maybe this is why these um these groups drink the guayusa so early in the day that's right yeah and I have to imagine I would need caffeine at 4:00 a.m. 5 a.m. otherwise I'd be falling back asleep so yeah um so back in the gut and nervous system um in particular within the brain we haven't talked about the brain so much so the information from the gut is is sent via these neurop pod cells up to you you mentioned the noo ganglion such a a cool name for a brain um an a ganglion in this instance is an aggregate of neurons so it's a like a batch of neurons that then send a connection into the brain what what brain areas do they send to um and maybe we could describe these by name but also by function what what they generally resp are responsible for and uh probably should be prefaced with ultimately will go to the entire brain right everything ultimately connects to everything it's like Google Maps everything connects to everything but but what are some of the primary uh recipients of that information the um first hubs into of sensor integration are in the brain stem you know um and for instance the nucleus tractus solitarius is in a specific region within the the brain the Cal is one area and and NTS for those that don't know is involved in regulating hunger and appetite that's correct um other functions perhaps but like for instance um that seems to be an area of sensory integration for nutrients and when we say drives hunger or appetite sensory integration for nutrients I mean what would be great is if you know people could understand you know the the language of the nervous system is chemical and electrical so when these neurons are active um we tend to Crave certain foods you know seek them literally go to the refrigerator among the different choices go to that thing and select that and put it into our mouth so so presumably it's driving um reward systems motor systems I mean it um what we call hunger and appetite is really a kind of a a domino effect of a lot of different brain circuits do we know whether or not the um uh nucleus tractus solitus um projects to the areas of the brain involved in dopamine release and craving uh yes uh and there has been some elegant work uh from several different uh neuroscientists in this area like tracking the the circuitry uh from there onto many other uh different areas the hypothalamus for instance very basic behavioral fun functions um and the the stum where there is dopam dopamine release and then there is this pleasurable sensation and reward uh there is several other areas in there that are involved in this uh sensory integration uh there is quite a bit of work still to be done from specifically from uh the neurop pods there is like some evidence that they are connecting directly to um or there are if you put two papers together is obvious that there connecting to like some of these areas of dopamine release uh basal ganglia in the in the in the brain um and that's why they're causing this reinforcing uh effect like in the lateral hypothalamus and uh other other areas I do think that ultimately um there is quite a bit of a gap in like different regions of the digestive tract like we today we just talk about the esophagus right like the esophagus I think that is still there is a little bit of work uh perhaps I think that Steve liberis has worked in that in that area another great neuros scientist uh doing some uh very fine detailed work in sensory biology uh in esophagus uh there is quite a bit of Mis lack of uh precise biology in how it is that the esophagus specific cells of the esophagus are inated or like making sense of the environment and same thing for the stomach and how it is that ultimately each one of those regions are fitting into different regions of uh the brain uh even then how each one of these valves I'm fascinated by the each one of the valves that we talked earli on like um the gastroesophagal uh sphincter or the pyos or the oscal junction yeah we should um illustrate for people I'm not an expert in the gut by by any means but what Dr borquez is referring to is that you know the gut as it extends from the mouth to the rectum is not just a series of tubes of different uh diameters uh but rather they have valves Chambers and these sphincters that cut off you know everyone hears the word sphincter and they always think oh you know anal sphincter and then they ah you know it's like you know Elementary School uh Middle School humor but but sphincters are they they literally can close and open to varying extent um in order to allow um passage or prohibit passage from one compartment to the next such that the um certain things can take place over time in one one region like the esophagus or within the stomach or you know before passing to other um other Chambers and so I hear you saying that critical processing is happening at each of these Chambers the sphincters are determining how long that processing occurs and that distinct sets of neurop pod cells are likely detecting distinct of qualities and quantities within the food chemical qualities and quantities within the food and relaying that to the brain that's correct and here's something that since we're getting into the future of uh of this area uh and while there is not direct published evidence yet I think that is going to be a a fun area um so the gut as the brain also generates these electrical patterns those electrical patterns um change depending on fasting versus feeding and circadian rhythms probably can realize jetl the God is asking you for a burger at 3:00 a.m. and your brain is telling the God you know can you please go to sleep right um so these electrical patterns these electrical waves that are going into um that are uh being propagated by the gastrointestinal tract there are like several different cells like the ENT neurons are coordinating these these cells there are also these uh in interstitial cells of kahal so uh Santiago ramoni kahal uh the greatest neurobiologist of all time that's right it was named after after him he actually has I think it's like in the second volume of his classic uh book on the uh histology of the nervous system one of the last figures talks about like the inovation of the v in the in the intestine so I'm beautiful for those that don't know kahal um shared the Nobel Prize with Camilo Gogi in 1906 they together um developed tools and and mapped the uh structure of the nervous system and and it's fair to say that kahal had Supernatural levels of insight into the nervous system he looked at the nervous systems of so many different animals um in dead specimens the the um the the joke even though it's not funny is that many animal species entered his laboratory very few walked out um but by looking at fixed specimens under the microscope and then drawing them in you know select elements within them essentially came up with most of the major hypotheses about how the nervous system works not just its structure but neuroplasticity the failure of of mamalian central nervous system neurons to regenerate this is why after traumatic brain injury or stroke there's often loss of function that doesn't recover sometimes it recovers but um and that people who have injuries younger and can recover certain functions everything from the direction of electrical flow through the nervous system all from looking at tissue that was not alive no electrophysiology no behavioral experiments just just raw but incredible Supernatural seemingly levels of intuition and insight amazing yes there is a some quote in uh one of his books that when he got invited to uh one of of his friends to England I I don't remember remember he was a he was a famous neuroscientist at the time in the late 1800s that who had helped him to expose um his work to other audiences you know and invited him to to England so he said in there that it took like three months to go to that podcast right like it was a three-month trip trip so he said that he brought his um microscope with him with him and in the in the room he will be able to do some of these uh uh observations yeah peculiar guy also known for carrying a very heavy iron umbrella in order to do physical exercise on the way to the lab he was a he was a very very fit physical specimen also um reportedly reportedly I don't know which uh pick it pick which one um a pretty Gruff person not terribly Pleasant uh to be around ran a tight ship um but in any event um so the cells of the gut are named after some of them are named after kahal interstitial cells ofal there you just got a a waltz into um uh into some Neuroscience history but critical history so they they have this emanating uh electricity right and uh so far these uh and it seems like the the sprinters modulate the emanation of this electricity oh like a like an instrument it it's um and you probably think like that because the intestine and maybe here we get a little bit even deeper into this and I uh read some work from a philosopher uh in the UK who was and I'm going to paraphrase it very largely you know so please don't quote me but it's some something along the lines that uh if we are what we eat the place where food becomes us and we become food is should be the intestine right because that is where food is actually absorbed right so that is a is a very fascinating Point number two is that the food enters us at a frequency that it will modulate the entire body right therefore like the the body H through these electricity these electrical waves should be in sync with also the electricity of the entire uh nervous system so I think that here's where in the future I think that there's going to be a fascinating realm of understanding how it is that these waves of the body and the Brain uh are synchronized with each other uh because as we know like for instance sometimes um when we don't uh we're hungry we become hungry you know like uh we become irritated by the fact that we don't uh have food and perhaps is this dissonance in the emanation of the electrical waves between the digestive tract and uh the nervous system so I think that that is that's just like one of the one of the Realms um of how it is that the brain is connected to the gut at a more uh organ to organ level to be able to make us function ultimately right because um that's how we are integrating the outside world the food into our entire system so we can maintain the entire organism well certainly our level of alertness is linked to our level of anticipation and a lot of our food anticipation um impacts our levels of arousal AKA alertness so as you mentioned in the we're di we're a dial species so in the middle of the night it's unusual to get hungry right A lot of these pathways are shut down digestion is happening at different rates and um typically our appetite is greater during the day than it is in the middle of the night that's right um but in addition to that you know it makes good sense to me that what is going on at the level of our gut is going to tell the brain did we get enough nutrients from the previous day are we in a place of abundance um there's also the psychological aspect of gut sensing um and we haven't really touched on that what are your thoughts as both a scientist and a human with a with a gut brain axis on this notion of a kind of gut intuition you meet certain people and it sort of relaxes and warms you and you want to get to know them more other people for whatever reason um you just feel like I don't know something doesn't feel quite right that we can sense things at the level of the body that inform our brain um and no one really understands that process yet but we do know that the vagus nerve which is a you know multi- uh pronged pathway big pathway it's probably its own major branch of the nervous system really um is is sending bidirectional communication between brain and body and presumably when we're around somebody or something that doesn't quote unquote feel right the Vegas is involved um a few interesting things in in that area uh I mean in the work of uh Carl Yun talks talks about it about the subconscious and how it is that we're accumulating all of these experiences that we have been uh passing through in life is not that they are not a store anymore it's just that they are back in the subconscious right and then ultimately they become part of this so-called intuition right like we have this G feeling that uh and [Music] um if we analyze um some of the languages I think that I've in past people have told me in so many different languages that uh there is this phrase for God feelings in so many like for instance in I think Portuguese is free of the barriga you know like cold in the in the in the stomach you get a cold uh in Spanish we call it a pre sentimento like a preeing you know or pre yeah pre sensation or feeling it will be more feeling if you translate that as if it arrives first yes before you're able to articulate it right so uh there is this storage in the entire body that gives you like a depending on the context it gives you a certain type of uh feeling right and that's why we talk about uh intuition uh there's also like this this other aspect of um how it is that food synchronizes that intuition uh it seems to synchronize that intuition among two or more people because if you think about it we have this ritualistic way of uh serving something when we we we commonly say or colloquially say let's go for a cup of coffee and often what we mean is let's go and talk about business the future resolve an any issue but we're talking about the cup of coffee and we have to share and people I think that there are some psychologist that have run some of these uh studies in which they say that if um the food that that we eat is more alike we are more likely to to connect at least on the moment right so there is this aspect and that's why we share you know the food interesting so is the idea that it's the actual chemical constituents of the food that's creating a a common experience that then allows people to bond more readily or is it that the um the specific constituents of the food are actually driving bonding per se I mean it yeah and we go back to if we are what we eat then if we eat the same thing we should be more alike to each other right that's why you know like in communities uh you share the food in fact uh in like if you go into certain uh specific uh communities you pass around uh the food you pass around the the drinks you know and is a it's very common to share right yeah and certainly in romantic bonding um there are many factors of course but um the kind of uh more basic functions of food sex and sleep represent the common places of bonding initially right and conversation of course and values Etc right not to dismiss any of those they're essential as well but in terms of you know um feelings of safety that's right feelings of um communing with somebody right the these very basic biological functions yeah and in business too right like people there has been a studying like behavioral uh Economist they talk about how it is that business are more likely to happen when they are like made over a food or launch or things like that right like there's this synchronicity in the decision making and here is a a third uh dimension on this area that it has not been uh well explored but I suspected in the near future it will begin to be explored I read a while ago a very elegant paper from uh Walter Canon uh so you may want to expand on uh who Walter Canon was but uh one of the uh found figures of the study of physiology yeah autonomic phy physiology right uh chair of physiology at Harvard uh 1920s 1930s uh author of the wisdom of the body you know uh he has a paper or he published a paper I believe in the 1930s it's called voodo death um Voodoo death and I remember when I found that title I was like oh this is something to sit down and dissect you know yeah good title good title if you want somebody to read it good title and he essentially the gist of it let me see if I can uh if I can do a little bit of justice but obviously I will chop most of the details but um the um the gist of the paper is that in some observations in some native tries I I believe it was in in Africa that if uh a young people especially young youngsters uh if they were uh frightened by a shaman that they will not perform a certain thing a certain task right uh they enter a level of psychosis so to speak that could cause death like the cast an spell right um and uh that's why called Buu death what Canon goes and describes is there is an activation of uh the vus nerve and the peripheral nervous system that is a hyperactivation that is going through the subal level of Consciousness and that in some of these tribes uh that's what at least that's what he explains that is happening and I believe that he did some experiments in um in some animals but what he was saying is that there is a hypertonic activation of the peripheral nervous system when there are these uh spells that are casted by a member of the tribe that is in a higher or more Superior more influential uh position that if the other a uh member uh especially if it is pair with something right like if you say like if you go outside and don't listen to what I just told you and you see a black cat those two things uh match together and now you're hyperactivated right and become superstitious about it but it is what Walter Canon goes to explain is there is a hyperactivation of the peripheral nervous system obviously there is probably more details in there uh but the the the the paper um really highlights an area of exploration that we don't know about is a a threshold of subconsciousness of the nervous system how it is driving us to have Superstition to uh Drive instinctively to go and consume certain things things or behave in certain uh in certain ways right yeah so it's um it sounds like it's par Association learning through statements cognition but that's enacted through the Vegas in order to control the organs of their periphery that's nerd speak for um if we hear and believe that certain events will cause certain changes in our physiology they can in some instances become capable of that eat this food on this at this location and you'll get sick eat this food at this location you'll feel better cor and it's learned Association there's not and ultimately it's physiological but um it sounds like it's subject to a lot of learning effects as long as we're talking about the Vegas I think it's a great opportunity um to just mention that a lot of people um understandably think that the Vegas nerve activation is always about calming of the nervous system and indeed it's the N the Vegas is um placed under the umbrella of a parasympathetic um pathway but I think it's very important for people to know that both experimentally and clinically if the vagus nerve is stimulated you get exactly the opposite effect you get arousal effects this is um commonly known in Labs that do uh physiology of different kinds um it's in the clinical context people with depression are sometimes treated with vagal nerve stimulators and it certainly isn't driving more sedation more depression of the nervous system it drives alertness and arousal so we have to I think make sure that we looked at the Vega system and describe the vagal pathway as one that can both induce states of calm of ease rest and digest as it's sometimes called but also states of arousal and alertness even fear and so I think of the Vegas as a super highway of a bunch of different Pathways with lots of inputs and outputs that's highly subject to learning and um indeed the Vegas can slow heart rate you know down through numbered things like long exhale breathing earlier we were talking about stress modulation something my labs worked on extend your exhales that's that's the most basic way um physiological size two inhales followed by a full exhale to lungs empty um these are core physiological mechanisms known to activate the Vegas and lead to calming but the Vegas I I look at the Vegas as kind of a uh including both an accelerator of sorts accelerator based Pathways in terms of arousal and and breaks um and it and probably our basil level of vagal activation reflects sort of the RPM of our system how much are we are we calm or are we humming at a higher level of activity such an interesting pathway such an interesting area of the nervous system and we don't really understand yet um even the the major branches and pathways are just now finally beginning to be understood it's it's we're we're we're on um we're on Virgin beaches yes and right now that I I hear you uh bringing up the coming for instance there is a branch of the vus that inates the ear the inner ear you know and that's why uh it is belief and I think there is a little bit of evidence out there that how a certain music at a certain frequency will calm you down because it is immediately like brings uh the it starts to make the Vos vibrate at a certain frequency yeah and huming um has been linked to vasod dilation which is associated with a calming effect whereas activation of the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system or the kind of what sometimes is referred to as fight or flight but it's involved in other things causes phasal constriction and if you think about it like in several uh religious practices there is the humming right uh there is the uh singing there is the sound the sound plays a big role in running there is a certain frequency that makes you run uh make calms you more and makes you run uh better you know is that right yeah uh there is some evidence at least among Runners that they prefer a certain type of uh frequency for for the running right so a certain uh pace of running or breathing and the and the sound the specifically the sound the sound of their feet yeah no the sound of uh the music like if you if you play a certain uh certain music right and probably the sound of their feet too right like it's just that it has not been explored right it's fascinating and you know so much of what I think about when I think about the nervous system is the fine grain processing of you know of color of light or what but when it comes to our feelings of well-being our levels of arousal sleep Etc it's the rather um I don't want to call them crude because they're really sophisticated they evolve to be sophisticated but these um kind of macroscopic signals like light coming in in the morning has these you know long wavelength and short wavelength contrast that's what tells our brain it's morning that's right it's the orange red blue contrast even if there's cloud cover it's the it's the difference between those to um different qualities of light that says it's morning and when the sun is overhead you don't see that yellow blue or orange blue red blue contrast but you see it again at Sunset and it informs so um it sounds like the combination of specific chemicals in the gut tell us this is good pursue more of this and maybe even the place where you found it is is a good place um as opposed to and the opposite is probably also true yes like that's an entire new domain of uh the the Digest the sensory system in the digestive tract that we haven't even be to uh um articulate it memory how do we remember like what was that first meal like in the ratat uh movie from when we were children right like it was very different like uh I still remember like some of the very simple humble meals that my mother will make but it's just Priceless for me right uh I whenever I go home and it's like I I spec without asking sometimes my mother uh will prepare those for me and it's like it just brings you back when you were that age right yeah the memory system is tightly linked to taste and smell there's no question about it and then like the how it is that the gut triggers that uh those Sensations or further reinforces those Sensations we haven't even begin to articulate and when I said articulate because we don't even have the language to refer to these things you know that's why at the very beginning we were talking of the in our conversation about the axis you know and uh that we don't say like the nose brain the nose brain axis right like we just went for what we had at that time and I do think that the language will continue to evolve for us to be able to articulate more precisely more richly more elegant more you know in so many different uh ways how it is that um a the organs communicate with each other to make us who we are and in there um in one of our papers uh we quoted uh these uh beautiful passages from uh the book Memoirs of by stomach uh it was greeting in 1853 by a French by person by what it says in the first page by the minister of interior because all of those who eat May read or something like that and then on page 21 it goes to describe the dialogue between the gut and the brain and it says like that how it is that the gut communicates to the brain with a rapidity uh through uh these two sets of electrical wires that communicate uh the arrivals of the day as we may eat uh with the Precision and rapidity to the brain uh so the brain will make its own uh feelings and um Impressions and then he said that uh when he talking from the perspective of the stomach it says like when I grew a morose like meaning I'm not working in digestion then the brain also grew irritable and petulant you angry angry it's so interesting to look at Human Experience from the directionality of gut to brain rather than brain to gut um that's right and and you know as I do from time to time you know pay attention to what's happening in the landscape of wellness and mental health and physical health a lot of what um you see out there in terms of you know Highly Educated people um who have thought very deeply about how to navigate decisionmaking and lots of different domains of life and to do it in a way that really honors the our own individual preferences and needs needs um people like Martha Beck I don't know if you've heard of her but she exists in the she has triple degreed from Harvard um but has uh talked a lot about um learning to sense one's way into and through decisions through intuition that is more of the body and is more of particular brain circuits than our analytic like you know pros and cons lists um you know because pros and cons lists and obviously important metrics like OB Ive metrics like oh is this the right salary the right location the right you know dem you know all the all the things that matter for decision- making and we're trained in that in in school in in the United States and in many many areas of the world as well of course um and that's critical but that there's this other training there's this other learning of self that can be extremely useful and it almost always comes back to body first then to cognition and decision-making and I feel like uh modern humans are are trying to learn how to um run the the analysis of Life decision-making through uh this I guess more ancient axis so the again the intelligence of these what used to be called more primitive systems but I don't think they're primitive at all and talking with you today it's clear to me that these are highly sophisticated systems just as sophisticated as any forbrain pathway involved in um analyzing say like probability or something and that's why I like to highlight uh um the example of having a nice meal and having a nice conversation at the at the at the same time you know if you go to a nice restaurant and you have a nice meal while you're having a nice conversation and you pay attention to it then it brings humility to your body to know like how much your body is doing for you to be able to just Express a tiny little bit and having like some sort of like highly intellectual sophisticated conversation while you're able to put in the precise amount of lettuce inside of your mouth and chew it in the right way and like adjust it with a little bit of water and maybe a little bit of wine and understand what is cleansing your pette and like you know putting down the the napkin and so on and so forth uh without going to the restroom every time that you feel like going to it right there is an entire sophistication of of the body just to have something like as simple as a catchup convers ation you know do you think that our ability to sense into gut sensing more um to really hear and respond to the signals from the gut is something that we can learn even as adults simply by paying more attention yes and I think that here's the the concept that I usually uh you know that uh when we talk about topics like meditation you know is that self-care and that self self-care is listening to your own uh body right how it is that the body is feeling like uh I don't know you know I grew up in a my mother will tell me like or you know family will tell you if you feel like going to the restroom uh and uh to pee for a bio break don't hold it for too long because it might be bad right like and I think that just learning that part of like listening to to the body is an essential aspect it's just that we're not constantly doing it over learning about how we are moving our career forward yeah so much of what we're taught in order to um be high achieving and forward moving in life um in modern culture is about learning to override the signals from the body but it seems that um learning to listen to the signals from the body is is key to being a healthy human being yes and here I have an example uh years ago I used to run quite a bit um and I remember that after I had ran a marathon uh I took a a break for like a few weeks and then I got back on the on the trail and I began running and I was like you know I don't need to warm up for three or four weeks up to like get back into speed right and I remember that I started to feel like um that my right uh the soul of my right food was a little bit like bothering me like but like almost imperceptible and I was like no you know you just can't you just have to keep going you know and my wife elain told me like H you know you should pay attention take a break you know and I just kept running and I remember specifically that one time I went to run and say like I can put I can put in 80 miles that I think that I was running at like 7 Minutes 7:15 a mile or something like that and uh I began running it and I I after a mile I was feeling pumped you know uh two miles three miles I was like and then I usually will go and do four miles and then turn around and come back I got a mile mile four and I fell crack and I couldn't not walk anymore uh there was a hair fracture that is almost imperceptible in an x-ray but Bo that you cannot move your foot anymore I had to limp for four miles all the way back to the car uh because I didn't even have my phone and I H never forgot that uh for next time um you got to pay attention to your body you know your body is simply telling you like uh something is a little bit off just don't keep pushing it you know and I I specifically remember because I kept running and and I couldn't I had to literally limp all the way back to the car you know well Diego um I must say that among the many things that you've shared with us today and taught us about the gut and its ability to influence the brain um and the incredible things that are happening at the level of biology and physiology of the gut um Chief among them is the message that we should all pay more attention to our sensing at the level of our gut and nowadays we hear so much about the gut microbiome such that fortunately I think most people are starting to appreciate that the gut microbiome is vital for all aspects of health and that there are things that we can do to feed that microbiome fiber intake fermented food intake and so forth but clearly based on what you've told us today that even just paying a little bit more attention to what our gut is telling us at the level of feeling Good Feeling less good because the signs and signals are subtle I realize can really help us make better decisions and help us um decide not just what foods to eat or not eat how much to eat or not eat but um also how to navigate higher order decisions if you will um about who to spend time with what to do what not to do moving along the decision tree of life and along those lines I I want to thank you for making the decision to come here here today uh I certainly um am happy that we decided to do it it's something that's been a long time coming I really see you as one of the true Pioneers in this area of trying to dissect the understanding of the gut brain axis heal the brain through the gut understand and modulate our emotions uh at the level of gut sensing and while there are other researchers in this area um I refer to you as a Pioneer because you've really undergone this incredible trajectory from the Amazon through nutrition science into neuroscience and now we're getting a little bit into psychological science and I'm excited for what comes next I only ask uh one thing which is that as you make these discoveries that you come back and talk to us about them uh so that uh we can learn more about your incredible work so Andrew I want to say h a few things the first thing is that I I feel deeply honored by uh your invitation and thank you so much for uh the opportunity I I am just simply uh representative of uh the people that uh work uh with me and uh work uh with us you know I'm just an an ambassador and they get the majority of the credit for their dedication to help us understand a little bit more uh of uh the body and how it is help us to navigate the world that we live in so I want to thank uh you for the opportunity I want to thank uh the people that have made this possible also like um the people that are along the way or the institutions that are along the way uh have a help fund this um Endeavor you know my home institution I du I'm deeply grateful because my career has developed there uh and uh some of my mentors Roger little Andrew mure and the people that have helped me along the way and then finally I want to thank uh you uh and your your team uh and congratulate you for uh the work that you do and that you have created this uh window for uh us to come and share with the public uh some of the a little bit of the the work that we do uh perhaps uh some of that is uh is obviously is based on uh evidence uh some portion of that is thinking about the future uh but I do think that through maintaining the dialogue with the public uh that we can continue to understand the world that we live in and for that I I have to thank you for uh having creating this platform well it's a labor of love and I'm uh honored to uh be able to do it and um in no small part because I get to sit down and have uh beautiful intimate conversations about biology and life with you so thank you so much thank you thank you for joining me for today's discussion about sensing with the gut and the gut brain axis with Dr Diego B

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Gary Steinberg Dr Gary Steinberg is a medical doctor PhD professor of neurosurgery neurosciences and neurology at Stanford University School of Medicine he is a world expert in what is called the cerebrovascular architecture of our our brain which is a scientific term explaining how blood flow to the brain supplies oxygen and critical nutrients to our neurons our nerve cells as well as playing a critical role in removing waste products from our brain in order for our brain to function normally during today's discussion he explains in very clear terms how blood flow to the brain occurs and how disruptions in blood flow in things like stroke and aneurysm impact brain functioning we also discuss concussions and TBI or traumatic brain injuries which unfortunately are very common and what can be done to treat concussion and traumatic brain injury Dr Steinberg also shares with us recent findings from his laboratory and Clinic revealing how stem cells can be used to recover function in the human brain and spinal cord after things like concussion TBI stroke and other disruptions to the cerebrovascular architecture and he shares with us the science supported tools that is protocols that any of us can use to improve the health and functioning of our brains so if you or somebody that you know has experienced concussion or traumatic brain injury stroke or aneurysm today's discussion is sure to include Vital Information for you and for those fortunate enough to not have experienced those conditions today's discussion will also review the latest science and protocols for improving brain health before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity now I've spoken many times before on this podcast about the fact that sleep is the critical foundation for mental health physical health and performance now one of the key things to getting the best possible night sleep is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually needs to drop by about 1 to 3° and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and alert your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3° eight Sleep mattress covers make it extremely easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and thereby to control your core body temperature so that you fall and stay deeply asleep and wake up feeling your absolute best I've been sleeping on an eight- Sleep mattress cover for about 3 years now and it has completely transformed the quality of my sleep for the better eight sleep recently launched their newest generation of pod cover the Pod 4 ultra the Pod 4 cover has improved cooling and heating capacity higher Fidelity sleep tracking technology and the Pod 4 cover has snoring detection that will automatically lift your head a few degrees to improve air flow and stop your snoring this is really important snoring is associated with something called sleep apnea and sleep apnea is known to disrupt brain health and body Health in a number of ways put differently being able to breathe clearly throughout the night is essential for not only feeling rested when you wake up but also for brain health and body Health if you'd like to try an eights Sleep mattress cover you can go to 8sleep.com huberman to save3 50 off their pod 4 ultra eight sleep currently ships to the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by Roa Roa makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality now I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of different challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly Roa understands this and has developed their eyeglasses and sunglasses so that regardless of the conditions you're in you always see with the utmost Clarity Roa eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed for use in sport in particular things like running and cycling now as a consequence Roa frames are extremely lightweight so much so that most of the time you don't even remember that they're on your face they're also designed so that they don't slip off if you get sweaty now even though they were initially designed for performance in sport they now have many different frames and styles all of which can be used in sport but also when out to dinner at work essentially anytime and in any setting if you'd like to try Roa glasses you can go to Roa that's r.com and enter the code huberman to get 20% off again that's r.com and enter the code huberman to get 20% off today's episode is also brought To Us by arero press Aero press is like a French press but a French press that always Brews the perfect cup of coffee meaning no bitterness and excellent taste Aeropress achieves this because it uses a very short contact time between the hot water and the coffee and that short contact time also means that you can brew an excellent cup of coffee very quickly the whole thing takes only about 3 minutes I started using an arrow press over 10 years ago and I learned about it from a guy named Alan Adler who's a former Stanford engineer who's also an inventor he developed things like the aobi Frisbee in any event I'm a big fan of Adler inventions and when I heard he developed a coffee maker the Aro press I tried it and I found that indeed it makes the best possible tasting cup of coffee it's also extremely small and portable so I started using it in the laboratory when I tried on the road and also at home and I'm not alone in my love of the Aeropress coffee maker with over 55,000 fstar reviews

five-star review and now for my discussion with Dr Gary Steinberg Dr Gary Steinberg welcome thank you Andrew pleasure to be here I have a lot of questions I know people are interested in keeping their brains healthy and sadly things happen to the brain um sometimes as a consequen of Aging sometimes as a consequence of certain activities maybe you could just explain for us right off the bat what is a stroke what is an aneurism what is a hemorrhage where do these terms overlap how are they different obviously none of us want these things um and we will talk about ways to prevent them and your ways of treating them as well of course but just to start off maybe we can just lay down the nomenclature sure so a stroke is like a heart attack of the brain uh it involves disruption of blood flow to the brain either in the form of a blocked vessel or less likely a hemorrhage about 87% of Strokes are due to uh a clot either forming in the brain artery itself or forming uh closer to the heart in the heart or in the cored artery and dislodging and blocking blood flow to the brain about 133% are caused by a hemorrhage Bur thing of a blood vessel and that results in lack of oxygen and glucose being delivered to the brain cells and that ultimately causes death of tissue and disruption of bodily functions neurologic function that's what a stroke is how do we know if we have clots residing in our body that could be dislodged um I know that some people when they fly we wear compression socks um I know that some people have genetic mutations that affect clotting I'll raise my hand here and uh I'll do a disclosure I did some genetic testing I may heterozygote for um Factor five lien which is a clotting Factor um heterozygote folks means I have one mutant copy so fortunately I don't suffer from excessive bleeding or clotting but there are lifestyle factors that can exacerbate a an existing um mutation like that people who are homozygous mutants for five lien of course at much greater risk for um clotting and bleeding um so I just disclosed a lot um maybe you could comment on some of the clotting factors and lifestyle factors that impact clotting but how would somebody know if they're like they've got a clot that could potentially go to their brain sure well you might not know in many cases you don't know uh and that's the problem you can have uh a predisposition as you say due to uh certain genes that are mut ated or uh represented that predisposed to to clots and those clots can occur on the arterial side or the Venus side the arterial side is what generally causes a stroke an es schic stroke uh on the Venus side you can sometimes uh have problems uh when you talk about flying um not moving your legs developing clots in your legs wearing compression boots that's on the Venus side and that can cause uh something like a uh deep vein thrombosis uh which is not good because it can travel to the lung and cause a pulmonary embolis that generally on the Venus side does not go to the brain oh good in my case that unfortunate exactly uh you can develop some Venus problems in the brain which can cause a Venus type type stroke that's much less common and the way that causes a stroke is not lack of blood flow being delivered to the brain but by having a clot in an important vein the blood can't get out of the brain it backs up and causes swelling or edema uh but that's much less common uh generally we talk about Strokes as being uh arterial in nature um and you know either that either blockage of a blood vessel or bursting of of a vessel what are some things that impact clotting and or excessive bleeding um my understanding is these Factor five light in mutations are one example the other is um let's say somebody takes say a a blood thinning um agent like baby aspirin or um I told and I I'll have to check this I'm sure people will say in the YouTube comments that if you take lots and lots of say fish oil or things like that you can become more of a bleeder some are uh people out there are hemophiliacs and then my understanding is also that certain forms of oral contraception for women can increase uh the rates of bleeding um so tell me if I'm wrong about any of those and if any of those things predispose people to more stroke or Hemorrhage sure so um different kinds of drugs um thin the blood and they um can predispose you to having a larger Hemorrhage uh than you would if something uh bursts or if you uh fall and have some traumatic injury to your brain or anywhere in the body uh in general they don't cause a hemorrhage because they're fairly safe but uh if there's as I say some uh it's some Interruption um to the to the body um like a bruise um it would be a much worse um type of bleed uh so aspirin is a type of antiplatelet agent that thins the blood there are many types of antiplatelet agents and they're very very uh useful for treating people who have uh a a predisposition to develop clots because they thin the blood anticoagulants are another type uh they're they're called uh they're known as kumin warin elquist there's lots of lots of new agents um and uh they're often taken orally or can be given intravenously uh heprin another one uh again they thin the blood so they would uh put someone at somewhat increased risk for Hemorrhage um then uh as far as oral contraceptives if you go back to the 1970s when the uh oral contraceptives were first generation were coming out uh it turns out and they were heavily estrogen um dominated rather than progesterone um they did and they still to some extent increased the risk of developing clouds so women back in the 70s who took oral contraceptives and smoked had a very very high incidence of developing uh clots and and Es schic strokes and clots elsewhere in the body the newer Generations are are much safer in terms of De developing clots but for my patients uh many of whom have had Strokes or at risk for stroke we recommend that the women do not take oral uh contraceptives that they use some other form uh IUD for instance may have a little bit of uh progesterone which is released locally but it doesn't cause a large increase in estrogens or or progesterone systemically so we still believe that the oral contraceptives uh increase the risk somewhat not the way it did for first generation and then there are other modifiable factors besides the genetic ones so smoking is a very uh high risk factor for developing uh clots um which can lead to Strokes heart attacks peripheral vascular disease um High lipids is another so when people have high bad cholesterol LDL it's recommended uh that if they can't reduce it with diet that they take a Statin um the statins are very very effective in lowering the bad cholest stro preventing strokes and heart attack interestingly the statins have also been shown to be highly beneficial for the for the blood vessel Integrity even if you don't have high LDL interesting so they have other beneficial properties so again for my patients I often recommend they take a Statin even if they don't have high cholesterol interesting and then hypertension is another uh risk factor for for developing uh clots and and arterial disease when you say that smoking dramatically increases the risk of stroke is that because of nicotine per se is it the uh Vaso constriction and blood pressure elevation that comes from nicotine itself or is there something about smoking maybe even vaping I don't know that um the contaminants the other chemicals um in cigarettes or vape chemicals that increases the stroke risk or is it nicotine itself it's not just nicotine nicotine is one of the factors but it's the other uh products that are produced by by smoking that that can have an effect so given that so many fewer at least Americans and I think worldwide um people are smoking less uh are we seeing less stroke yes the the incidence of stroke is actually decreasing um it may be in part due to decreased smoking but it also is in part due to other modifiable factors so hypertension is much better uh treated now than it used to be people take better care of themselves in terms of other lifestyle factors so people uh exercise more there's a lower incidence in some subgroups of obesity those are risk factors also for for for developing strokes and as well as heart attack what is the relationship between heart health and brain health as it relates to stroke uh I would imagine that anything that's good for our heart is probably good for our brain brain um given the enormous amounts of blood and glucose that the uh the brain requires to function normally yeah it's a good point in general uh the things that are good for the heart are good for the brain there there are differences between the heart and the Brain but uh they they both uh depend very much on blood flow the brain's unique though because the brain represents only 2% of the body weight yet it draws 15% of the total blood flow and remarkably it consumes 20% of the body's oxygen so the brain I still think the brain is the most important organ uh not the heart not the kidneys but I'm biased of course yeah you've spent some time in in uh in the landscape of the brain yeah it's it's clear that um of all the tissues in the body if you had to pick one tissue to remove one you know cubic millimeter of that tissue that your brain and probably the neural retina would be your your least uh favorite um choice just given the deficits that can result right and of course the brain also is what makes us human right speaking of which if we take a little departure into uh neurosurgery itself your your specialty um of all the years of of doing brain surgery um can you recall maybe one of the most incredible moments or days um that allowed for some insight into how the brain works by virtue of let's say stimulating a given brain area or removing a given brain area or or something of that sort I I asked this because um you know so very few of us will ever have the opportunity to do what you do and if I were here talking to an astronaut and by the way I consider neurosurgeons the astronauts of Neuroscience um if I were sitting here with an astronaut I'd say you know tell me something interesting about being in space that I wouldn't know from looking at pictures or videos of it what is an example of maybe one of the more um profound um Insight stimulating moments um from doing brain surgery they're I mean every every patient is different so I'm always learning and that's why uh I still enjoy it that it's a challenge uh and you have to think quickly um it's not a it's not simply mechanical but for instance a couple weeks ago uh I had a p patient who had a vascular malformation which was located uh we thought right in her speech area so in order to operate safely uh first we did a what's called a functional Mr scan before surgery and that gives us some idea of where the speech area is we can map it out on an MR scan and the way it's mapped out is um we have the patient uh awake uh talk to us when they do the scan and because there's a coupling between blood flow and and the neur neuronal activity uh when the speech area the language area is stimulated by talking uh there's increased blood flow to that area and we can see that on an MR scan that's how the Mr scan works so we had some idea that this was very close if not in the speech area but the most accurate way of determining that is to operate on the patient with her awake so we took what we did was we sedate the patient we don't put a tube down and induce general anesthesia we numb up the scalp we take off a piece of bone after cutting the scalp open the membrane covering the brain called the dura and then we allow the patient to wake up more from the sedation and then what I did on this particular patient was to use a uh tiny stimulator a little probe and I can stimulate areas of her cortex with her awake and see if the stimulation impairs her ability to speak or understand language and quite surprisingly there uh was no activity in the corridor that I chose sometimes when we see uh an area that is involved with speech that's eloquent we have to choose a different pathway way to get to the underlying vascular problem and so that's what we did in this case and um she talked to us the entire case she told us about her daughter uh who uh was uh very involved in um debate and all of her successes while we were operating while I was taking out this vascular malformation uh under 20 magnification with very special instruments I use a laser now which has a diameter of the fiber optic cable uh the laser uh tip is 0.5 millim so that I think is the gentlest way other times I've been surprised um uh about brain function is uh operating deep in the brain there's a part of the brain called the brain stem which you know well it's a small area that connects the thalmus those are the signals coming from the cortex go through the thalmus to get down to the face arm and leg to move the muscles and all the sensory information which comes from the arms and the legs and face goes through the brain stem up to the thalmus and then to the cortex in this area although it's very small are contained uh very closely packed fiber tracks and nuclei those are the cell bodies for very important neurons and when I trained back in the 80s we never operated in that area because we couldn't do it safely with developments in computer technology and imaging and anesthesia we can now find safe corridors to get into the brain stem and sometimes we stimulate for other Pathways not language but other Pathways and I'm continually amazed um this last week I took out um two vascular malformations um and they're not big I mean they measure between 8 mm and a centimeter but they can wreak havoc in the brain stem because it's such high price real estate and these had bled but I found a safe Corridor to go through I took it out and I'm amazed that you hardly set the patients back in some cases because in the past we would have clobbered the patients doing that amazing yeah it's remarkable to me how much can be done now with imaging so visualizing the brain and being able to Target a specific location and you mentioned fiber Optic Cables I've also heard of things like the gamma knife and lasers so how much of neurosurgery nowadays is actually burrowing down through the brain to a given location to stimulate or remove tissue versus um you know using these laser or Fiber Optic approaches to sort of triangulate and get to something without having to basically drill down through the brain right neurosurgery is becoming much less invasive and this is something that I really tried to push when I was a chair of the department for 25 years at Stanford um so minimally invasive techniques include operating through the vessels right so now my I don't do this myself but my colleagues some of whom are neurosurgeons some are Interventional radiologist they can go through the groin in the femoral artery or through the radial artery they can thread a catheter backwards into the brain from the groin they can go up into the aorta up into the kateed artery from there they can go up into the brain arteries the middle cerebral artery and they can treat some of the uh hemorrhagic problems like aneurysms by deploying thrombogenic coils there or new devices they can pull clots out if there's an acute stroke from a clot in an artery in the brain wow it it's really it's really quite impressive um then we've we and others have developed techniques to use Focus radiation um on the brain and that's called radio surgery so examples of that are gamma knife um cyber knife was invented at Stanford by one of my colleagues actually and this uses uh beams of radiation gamma knife uses a Cobalt Source multiple uh sources of cobalt the cyber knife uses x-rays uh when I started I was very involved with using cyclotron generated heavy particles like helium and proton and they can be focused and the advantage of this is you don't have to open the skull you focus it on a very small area and you can eliminate um vascular malformations called arterovenous malformations tumors you can even use it for some pain conditions like trigeminal neuralgia it's not risk-free because even though radi ation is not is doesn't require opening the skull it Stills a form of energy that's damaging that that's how it works it causes for the avms it gradually clots off the blood vessels but it's much easier and much safer than some of the invasive techniques that we use we operate now through tiny openings even when we do open surgery when I trained we used to shave the whole head we would open a huge area of the of the skull now we operate through tiny a very small areas when I take out vascular malformations uh in the brain stem for instance uh I sometimes operate through openings in the side of the brain stem that are 2 to 3 millimeters wow um another form of non-invasive uh treatment that neurosurgeons use is called focused ultrasound again it's you don't have to open the skull it focuses uh sound waves um on areas of the brain we're using that to treat uh essential tremor MH or um uh Parkinson's disease um it's starting to be used for treating tumors so these are all advances that um were not present when when I trained another way of treating uh minimally invasive although it still requires a hole in the head is to put in an electrode and stimulate the brain so that uh was first used for treating Parkinson's disease very effective for medically intractable Parkinson's it's used to treat chronic pain recently it was shown to be beneficial uh for epilepsy in fact the two major trials prospective randomized trials that were done uh were led by uh Physicians uh neurologists at Stanford and showed the benefit of um stimulation of the brain to to treat a very difficult um epilepsy so this I think is going to be the future is minim more and more minimally invasive in fact we're using some of these techniques to even treat um psychiatric disorders like depression obsessive compulsive Behavior incredible I should have asked this earlier but um Tia is transient es schic attacks um I think most people assume or know that the symptoms of stroke include you know sudden weakness maybe Hemi paralysis of the face confusion Fusion slurring of the words of course these symptoms can be the consequence of other things as well um what are some of the symptoms of transient es schic attacks and is there anything that people can take for transient es schic attacks and I of course would love for you to inform us uh what a transient esic attack is right so a transient esic attack or Tia is a reversible stroke uh it results in a temporary loss of function such as uh inability to move partial paralysis or complete paralysis but then it resolves uh inability to speak visual problems double vision blurred vision loss of vision uh it can cause uh slurred speech uh or difficulty understanding language imbalance problems walking even cognitive problems so it can vary depending on what part of the brain it affects in the past it was defined has a neurologic deficit due to lack of blood flow that lasted less than 24 hours but now that we have such sophisticated Imaging like Mr scan some of these patients who have a TI what would have been considered a TIA before lasting minutes or up to 24 hours on Mr scan have been shown to have a little stroke so now the definition is a little different if there's an if you do an MR scan and it shows a new abnormality a new stroke then it's called a stroke rather than a TIA um so there's a little overlap there but it's a temporary um loss of of neurologic function due to lack of lack of blood flow or in in some cases a hemr my understanding is that people can also have strokes in their spinal cord um because spinal cord tissue is after all central nervous system tissue I think most people don't realize this but the the tail end of the brain the the brain stem as we're talking about before essentially extends down the uh the spinal column uh sort of like a a long tail right um uh uh down to the base of the pelvis really um so we call it the spinal cord but it's all brain it's contiguous with the brain so uh how often do You observe um spinal strokes and what are some of the symptoms of spinal stroke yeah it's much less common um than uh a stroke involving the brain uh probably because there's less tissue involved uh the spinal cord is supplied by um an anterior spinal artery that's an artery on on on this side and by two so for those listening sorry it would be the um sorry on the stomach side of of the body yeah and it's supplied by two arteries posterior spinal on the back side so if there's an interruption to blood flow in any of those arteries it can cause death of tissue in the spinal cord and that would result in a neurologic deficit depending on where it is so if it occurred on the stomach side that whole artery which supplies the the 2third of the spinal cord um on the stomach side uh and it involved both sides of the spinal cord it would cause a paralysis of both legs and a partial sensory uh deficit would call loss of pain and temperature because that's where those pathways are if the problem was on the backs side of the cord it would cause a problem potentially with uh a light touch sensation in the legs um if it was below the um it was in the below the cervical region uh and U problems with what's called propri acception that's the ability to recognize where uh your position of your joints is so it depends on where it is um some of the uh uh vascular problems I deal with actually do involve the spinal cord and you can develop other problems there um for instance you can have a direct connection between a abnormal artery and a vein in the spinal cord which doesn't cause a typical Stroke by blocking blood flow but it causes more of that Venus problem we discussed where there's so much blood going directly from the artery to the vein bypassing the capillaries that the veins become engorged the blood can't get out of the spinal cord and the spinal cord becomes congested and patients can present with problems uh walking or uh sensory problems if the uh spinal cord is involved in the cervical region up high then the arms can be involved as well I see I should have asked this earlier but is there any relationship between alcohol intake and the propensity for stroke or Hemorrhage or any of these other things yeah that's a good question yes there is uh there there the uh people who who indulge or overindulge uh uh are at risk for developing um uh stroke problem so it's another contribut contributory factor which can promote um problems with the with the blood vessels um clots but also Hemorrhage so it can make the blood vessels more fragile another factor I see commonly um in patients who develop aneurysms those are blisters on the blood vessels in the brain and they're like little balloons and as they enlarge they rupture just like a balloon can burst um some of the patients I see uh are not just smokers but indulge in uh other drugs so cocaine mam fetamines uh markedly increase the risk of developing these aneurysms or develop veloping Hemorrhage bursting of a blood vessel and is that because those drugs tend to increase blood pressure during their use um it's because they damage the vessels and they also can cause hypertension yes it's both factors so when I operate on uh on these patients and looking at the vessels um they are R they're ragged they're very thin they're not normal vessels they lack structural Integrity so it contributes to the development of of poor vessel integrity and drugs like cocaine and metamphetamine can jack the blood pressure up uh and that could cause a hemorrhage in these these um problematic vessels yes so it sounds like the message is clear uh avoid cocaine use avoid methamphetamine use and avoid excessive alcohol intake if you want to avoid stroke right and throw smoking in there too it's interesting because for a lot of years there was so much discussion about red wine being good for heart health now it's debated the moment I say that people will send a bunch of studies that say yes I my stance on the more recent data is that if you had to pick you'd drink less or not drink as opposed to drink um but I'm curious what your take is on this well you know this is interesting and um I'm always quite amazed at at um the way people change their behavior based on one study that comes out even if it's a good study so yes it used to be um uh considered beneficial if you drank red wine and then for a while it a study showed any wine was beneficial in moderation and um and that used to be two drinks a day for men one drink a day for women and then the latest studies which have been surfacing this year suggest no alcohol is good yeah but you know next year it may be that we're back to oh you know wine is the best thing you can do for your in moderation for your your brain and heart health so it yeah It's Tricky my read of the data and here I mean the data across multiple certainly not every study but multiple studies is that um zero to two drinks per week is seems to be the range that everyone agrees is safe at least for non-alcoholic adults um and then once you get out past two drinks per week is when gets into the gray Zone where some people say it's good some people say it's neutral some people say it's bad but that once you get up past you know four or five servings of alcohol per week it's pretty clear to me it's not a good situation well that was the prevailing Theory until this year and I don't know if you've kept up but in the past you know few months there have been several articles published saying um no wine no alcohol is good but then you have to balance that against the fact that alcohol um for many people tends to relieve stress so um you know if you're relieving stress maybe it counteracts any adverse effect so complicated issue but yeah my theory is um moderation is the key to life uh and you know and uh happiness also we know promotes longevity yeah absolutely I I agree with you I'm not heavy-handed about the alcohol thing I always just say you know do as do as you wish but know what you're doing um and I think many people who heard our podcast episode about alcohol who stopped drinking alcohol or who elected to drink less did so I'm told um because they really didn't enjoy it that much to begin with so it more or less gave them permission to drink less um not that they needed it but they took it uh anyway I think it's a really interesting area as you mentioned it probably lowers um stress it um probably also disrupts patterns of sleep and they got microbiome so there's you know you you can't escape in biology there's always some uh mod modulatory influence on something else exactly I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor a 1 by now most of you have heard me tell my story about how I've been taking ag1 once or twice a day every day since 2012 and indeed that's true I started taking ag1 and I still take ag1 once or twice a day because it gives me vitamins and minerals that I might not be getting enough of from Whole Foods that I eat as well as adaptogens and micronutrients those adaptogens and micronutrients are really critical because even though I strive to eat most of my foods from unprocessed or minimally processed Whole Foods it's often hard to do so especially when I'm traveling and especially when I'm busy so by drinking a packet of ag1 in the morning and often times also again in the afternoon or evening I'm ensuring that I'm getting everything I need I'm covering all of my foundational nutritional needs and I like so many other people that take ag1 regularly just report feeling better and that shouldn't be surprising because it supports gut health and of course gut health supports immune system health and brain health and it's supporting a ton of different cellular and organ processes that all interact with one another so while certain supplements are directed towards one specific outcome like sleeping better or being more alert ag1 really is foundational nutritional support it's really designed to support all of the systems of your brain and body that relate to mental health and physical health if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs with your order plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman speaking of Lifestyle factors um anytime we hear about traumatic brain injury or concussion people immediately seem to think about football um but I'm told by colleagues of ours in neurosurgery at Stanford and in neuroengineering that most head injuries are not from football they're not even from sport they're from construction work accidents they're from car accidents what is your um take on you know somebody let's say um God forbid gets rear ended in a in a car accident maybe gets whip laap maybe they're feeling a little off like maybe they have a minor concussion maybe there was some um movement of the brain that wasn't good what's the going consensus on how to deal with that um sleep more but then they tell you not to sleep excessively um should people take blood thinning agents I mean obviously avoid alcohol or certainly don't get another head injury anytime soon but you know what do we know about TBI and concussion that that can help people move through that period in the in the weeks and months afterwards where it's really scary you know if you've ever had a hard head hit you know and they go they might scan you they might not see a bleed but it's it's kind of scary when you feel a little bit off because you've been hitting the head yeah it's a great question and there's a lot of interesting concussion now um I got very involved in this back in the 90s CU I was the 49ers neurosurgeon um for a decade from 1990 to to 2000 how are they doing in that point I remember the dynasty of the 80s the '90s are good oh they they were super goal contention in fact uh I took care of Steve Young yeah he's a local guy who yeah Steve's a great guy and Steve a really smart guy um uh in fact he has a a a law law degree from uh Brigham uh young uh Steve was quarterback then and they were in Super Bowl contention and uh Steve had had some uh concussions and um I actually sent him back to play when he recovered so you can examine someone um uh and get a decent idea of how they're recovering from a concussion uh Steve unfortunately had a a a bad concussion at one point and um he ended up retiring which was the smartest thing I think uh for him in the end and he's become very involved with um studying concussions and and uh trying to figure out better ways to um to diagnose them uh prevent the sequella for football players including uh changes in equipment and and and in in uh tackling and that kind of thing um but concussion is we've learned a lot since the 1990s at that time uh concussion um was not known even repeated concussion to cause CTE chronic traumatic enopi in football players CTE which became a hot topic was known only in boxers so I became very well informed at the time about uh concussions and there was surprisingly little known um soccer players had a high incidence of concussion uh at that time it wasn't known if there were long-term sella and usually there are not long-term sequella um as long as you don't get repeated concussions um so um now what we generally recommend uh if someone has a concussion um we usually get an MR scan if if it's severe Mr scans usually don't show anything they would show a contusion if there's any bruising of the brain but um they don't show the the the molecular um abnormalities that occur with the concussion so the best way to um figure out how severe it is and when a when a person has recovered is to do more sophisticated neurologic testing uh eye tracking is a very sensitive way um to to to to detect problems with um with the brain after a concussion because you won't track as well and in fact many sports uh football hockey uh are incorporating um pre-season ey tracking testing I see to get a baseline to get a baseline of course some of the players will um game the system because they still don't want to be taken out so they may try to perform not as well as they they could on their eye track yeah on their see they throw the test they throw the test so their Baseline is I mean you know I don't think that's very common but that's a way you can game the system but uh as long as it's performed well that's a very good way uh of of detecting um subtle problems with the brain well you're a vision scientist so you understand how important um uh all the circuits are um in terms of and the visual system is unique because it tests uh the brain from the retina all the way back to the occipital so it's the whole longitudinal access of the brain that's being tested yeah I'm always struck by when I see these News News Real highlights of you know a player goes down they stay down um and then you know they're helped up and everyone cheers and then they might hobble off take a few moments and then you know how are they gauging the decision to put the person back in and the reason it's per in to me how they would determine that is that you and I both know that the neurons the nerve cells in the brain very likely um could be injured maybe even on their way to death after a head injury but that the actual dying off of the tissue could take several minutes hours maybe even days so putting someone back in to get hit more um seems really risky but at the same time that's their profession that's their choice and so you don't necessarily want to make the decision to take someone out of a game or a job um or have them stop driving if they don't actually need to stop so it's a tricky thing it is tricky and I think we have better uh methods of uh even at the if you're talking about sports on the sideline of doing testing um there are neurosurgeons there now uh who are part of the process um uh as far as recovering uh in general it's good to not stress the brain but uh total absence of sensory you know uh information sensory deprivation for long periods is not a good idea right just staying home in the dark with sunglasses on also not a good idea exactly so you want to make sure the brain still has input but you don't want to um overstress it when you recovering from a concussion sounds like doing all the things to keep blood pressure relatively low um LDL cholesterol relatively low so interesting what you said earlier that statins might be vascular protective even in the absence of high cholesterol yeah there's a lot of good evidence for that in fact some Studies have suggested that taking statins reduces the risk of cognitive decline including conditions like Alzheimer's interesting I know that statens are a bit of a controversial topic um among listeners because some people um report I think I have this right that statens can give them a kind of a brain fog if they take the wrong one or excessive amounts uh yeah it it I'm not challenging what you're saying I just I just hear the sh the in the comment section and I'm just I don't take a Statin but my cholesterol is in check um but I'm hearing more and more about some of these benefits of statins yeah yeah and the the information is still emerging for a traumatic brain injury in general you not a good idea to take uh an aspirin as opposed to a stroke or a TIA where you would want to take an aspirin right because if you have injury say you have a contusion to the brain and there's some uh some traumatic damage taking a blood thinner might cause that to worsen or cause a hemorrhage what about caffeine is there any evidence that caffeine can increase stroke or resum me I like coffee and I like uh yate tea so I'd be reluctant to give it up but I consume it in moderation is there any direct relationship there I don't know any relationship unless it unless you're taking so much that your blood pressure is Skyhigh my blood pressure tend lots of benefits uh um evidently to to caffeine in terms of of Health yeah I agree with you there um have a question about something that many people are starting to do now which is to get um exploratory MRI I actually did one of these um I wasn't gifted one I just decided to bite the bullet and pay for it is a whole body scan they put me in the tube did a MRI get everything from tip to toe um and I learned a few things I learned that I have like a slight I think it's L3 or L4 disc bulge that explained a little bit of like pseudo sciatica and I've been able to work around that um and keep that strong I learned that fortunately for me I only have one white spot on the brain I was told that you could have one per decade I'm nearing 50 so I feel very lucky there especially given that I've hit my head a few times skateboarding and doing martial arts and things like that but um so I feel lucky but I also know people that go in for these scans and get the report that you know they have a um a growth of some sort or they have multiple white spots as they're called on the brain which is kind of damage to to tissue to neural tissue you know what is your thought on these um exploratory SL preventative scans do you think they're useful um do you feel like they cause undue concern I mean this is a new thing people going out and getting their brain scanned yeah and people are getting total body scans so I think there are benefits and risks involved so the benefit is that you might pick up uh something that should be treated like an early cancer uh or a large aneurysm in the brain which would have a higher tendency to bleed but many times and I see patients all the time who are referred for a tiny aneurysm um blister on a blood vessel in the brain that was found incidentally on a total body scan and these aneurysms which can be one or two millimeters sometimes we don't even consider those as real aneurysms um they don't need to be treated in most cases um and so it's uh it's a little controversial because people can be worried about them even if they're reassured other examples are you find something in the brain or elsewhere in the body not sure what it is and then in order to determine what it is patients start having more invasive biopsies and tests which can lead to what we call iatrogenic injuries that's iatrogenic is caused by the Physicians so uh I think you have to be very thoughtful when when you interpret the results of of these um total body or or or even brain scans and um I would recommend talking with a specialist about it um if if if you're concerned but um you know people wonder I have this uh we were discussing it earlier today actually um with one of your colleagues and what if you're found to have a 1.75 millimeter aneurysm if it's really even an aneurysm should you change your lifestyle and for something like that I would recommend no you should forget about it get a follow-up scan but you may very well live and die with with this little blister that is of no consequence so uh as I say I I think you have to be careful about how you interpret and and how you uh act on on these uh findings maybe we can talk about lifestyle factors because I think anyone listening to this is going to think I don't want a stroke I don't want transient es schic attack I don't want Hemorrhage I don't want any of this stuff and we already discussed a little bit about how what's good for your heart generally is good for the brain but you know I think most people strive to eat well meaning not excessively also not undereat um to hopefully eat a lot of unprocessed or minimally processed foods and to avoid smoking perhaps um avoid alcohol in excess avoid hard drugs um get exercise um and so you know I think people generally try and do all these things get good sleep Etc um but at some level I think everyone also wants to know like when are they in their safest um kind of shape for avoiding a stroke is is there sort of a blood pressure cut off where we could say okay you know if you keep your blood pressure resting blood pressure below blank you're doing pretty well um and if your cholesterol is below blank you're doing pretty well and then you just you know while keeping moderation uh in mind try and live a life that um you know reduces the probability of getting a stroke or a or some other you know blood related neural attack well I think it has to be individualized to some extent and um over time the standards and the guidelines have changed it used to be if you're systolic blood pressure that's the upper number was under 130 130 or under that was considered normal and and would not lead to problems now the guidelin suggests that 120 or lower is better in large you know studies but um as an example uh when my blood pressure gets under 120 I feel lightheaded in fact I had an event uh about 15 years ago when I was overdoing it like I shouldn't have been overdoing exercise overing everything I was in my I was Stanford faculty member that over that was a joke that among Stanford faculty I was 56 and I operated all day in two operating rooms um I got done early um it was in the spring and I took a run up to the dish and then I took a red eye to Houston for a meeting and I emailed on the flight got an hour or two asleep went to the meeting was fine uh it was a stroke meeting with a bunch of scientists uh neurologists and scientists there were about 120 people there were two neurosurgeons there plus me and um drank some coffee at noon I went for a run cuz I like running and in hu at that day in Houston it was um 90° and 85% humidity and got back had a glass of um tea went back to the meeting had some more coffee and then as the afternoon session opened up I started to feel lightheaded and um next thing I know I'm looking up at the chandelier and they're they're they're shouting um stroke Cardiac Arrest seizure and they're starting to pump on my chest so they rushed me to the hospital where I had uh a simultaneous workup for cardiac arrest and stroke and after um I'll make the story short after uh a $100,000 workup it was determined I had a faint because I was overdoing it so since then I now I try to get seven to eight hours sleep at night that's clearly the Bedrock of health so I increased I used to get three to five hours sleep at night now I get 7 to nine if I can do it uh cut back on on on coffee on caffeine and um uh I don't push myself to exercise like I used to I'm feeling a fatigued I'm on an anti-hypertensive agent but I actually don't take it every day because um for me it's better to have a pressure 125 to 135 and it's true for some of my patients if you've got some disease in your arteries you may not want to have such a low blood pressure so I would individualize it but in general um you want to take care of your body like I've learned and probably maybe you've learned over time I'm learning I mean this is very interesting I've I tend to have low blood pressure it s of runs in my family to have low blood pressure um I can definitely relate to the um hard driving um ambition phenotype I think it's it's worth people hearing this because it's characteristic of a lot of people in high-intensity professions and I made the joke about Stanford faculty but um it's true I think that if you're ambitious you tend to overdo a bit more that's something I'm certainly working on and I've um run a very busy life and learning to slow down prioritize sleep prioritize meditation non-sleep deep rest is something I've benefited from a lot journaling things of that sort that really just kind of slow the pace I think that um you know in the landscape of Health optimization we can often put ourselves into modes of excess in the other direction um meaning doing so much to try and avoid uh issues with health that we end up creating issues with health but yeah certainly reducing caffeine intake and prioritizing sleep are key so that I appreciate that you shared that story so if somebody has naturally low blood pressure and starts to feel a bit um let's just say kind of sleepy or woozy in the afternoon would you recommend um that they obviously not take a a um pressure lowering drug but that they add a bit of salt to their diet that they um feel free to um you know to to exercise less I'm a little bit confused I I also love to run and and do resistance I would recommend they take their blood pressure so um you want to try to correlate any symptoms you're having with vital signs that you modify right so take your blood pressure if you're feeling faint if it's low uh one thing you can do uh easily is to hydrate that was something else I used to not drink much because I don't want to have to pee in the operating room I can imagine that' be pretty uncomfortable I don't want to be the patient that you're operating on when you have to go use the bathroom yeah so now and then uh I'll reveal that I um had a kidney stone which is common among surgeons uh this was a decade ago and since then uh I hydrate all the time so I hydrate to the point that my urine is crystal clear all the time and that helps with some of the brain Clarity so interesting I've done a little bit of work with people in the Special Operations community and you know I think people hear about them and they think oh you know what's what's the magic potion that they're taking what are they doing and they do a number of very interesting things um but one of them is they really emphasize hydration they just like hydration water sometimes water with electrolytes if they're working in in in hot conditions just hydration hydration hydration skeptical um and I used to dehydrate I felt better dehydrated and fit you know but um as I've matured um I think it's very very important um and uh for you know for for your blood pressure for your General Health uh and for your kidneys Yeah you mentioned sleep um is there a relationship between sleep deprivation and stroke risk uh that's a great question there's interestingly um Strokes occur more commonly during sleep it's not known why one theory is that it's related to sadian rhythms um I don't know if there's a relationship between sleep deprivation and and um and stroke I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge one of our sponsors element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need that means the electrolyte sodium magnesium and potassium in the correct amounts and ratios and nothing you don't which means no sugar now I and others on this podcast have talked about the critical importance of hydration for proper brain and body functioning even a slight degree of dehydration can diminish cognitive and physical performance it's also important that you get adequate electrolytes the electrolytes sodium magnesium and pottassium are critical for the functioning of all the cells in your body especially your neurons your nerve cells drink element dissolved in water makes it very easy to ensure that you're getting adequate hydration and adequate electrolytes to make sure I'm getting proper amounts of hydration and electrolytes I dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning and I drink that basically first thing in the morning I'll also drink element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing especially in hot days when I'm sweating a lot losing water and electrolytes they have a bunch of different great tasting flavors of element my favorite is the watermelon although I confess I also like the raspberry and the Citrus basically I like all the flavors and element has also just released a new line of canned sparkling element so these aren't the packets you dissolve in water these are cans of element that you crack open like any other canned drink like a soda but you're getting your hydration and your electrolytes with no sugar if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element spelled l mn.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with a purchase of any element drink mix again that's drink element.com huberman to claim a free sample pack I'm going to tell a horror story but not I want to repeat not to demonize chiropractors here here's the positive story I had a back thing that my back hurt and I wasn't sure what I needed to do and a chiropractor um gave me some exercises to do that essentially were like the up dog movement in yoga that my understanding is it helped the the disc bulge to kind of work its way back into the spinal column and it worked terrifically well I took no medic medication I required no surgery and I eventually learned to correct some imbalances that have led me to not have that issue again it was really remarkable and this chiropractor essentially um saved me from surgery and and I'm forever grateful so there I think there are excellent chiropractors out there um but when I was a postto uh living in San Francisco I had a roommate I believe she was a neurology resident and she came back from the clinic at UCSF and she told me this story that a patient had come in who was experiencing some Hemi paralysis of the face that patient I believe it was a young woman um had gone for a neck adjustment or head adjustment at a car up with a dissection of her artery right and something had happened and she had essentially a stroke yes and so I I share both these stories to make very clear that I have nothing um against chiropractors but I think like any health practitioners they come in a range of talents um uh and this was really like for me uh um an alarm and I decided at that point I would never allow a chiropractor to adjust my neck I said okay you can you can make adjustments to my back you can give me suggestions about exercises to do but how common are these um this uh you said it's a hemi dissection um it it's a dissection of an artery either the uh vertebral artery in the back or the cored artery up closer um in the front so no cutting when you say dissection they're Mak basically making an adjustment yeah well what happens is um and I agree with I we're on the same page I recommend patients if they're going to have chiropractor not to have manipulation of their neck because that's what occurs it's not common but uh I see it we see it what happens is the artery is damaged um the manipulation of moving the bone and the soft tissues causes a tear in the wall of the artery and and what occurs interestingly is that the blood that's usually in the space the Lumen the middle of the artery gets into the wall and causes a false Lumen a false passage and that that blood in the wall pushes part of the wall into the the main artery obstructing flow and sometimes causing a clot to form that can be dislodged and go up to the brain yikes so and there's no way to know whether or not this is going to happen no that's why I recommend not having uh neck manipulation by a chiropractor even if it's rare um it's it's so devastating when it occurs that uh personally I I I would avoid that um yes I tell the chiropractor uh stay away from anything um above the shoulders please um and then the back work has been beneficial again these exercis is perhaps the most beneficial thing about it um as long as we're there I realize it's a bit of a niche condition but what about hanging upside down I had one of these inversion tables I really enjoyed that thing but then once I looked at my camera phone while I was hanging upside down and it looked like I was going to blow a gasket from all the vasculature in my forehead is it bad to hang upside down no evidence that it's bad oh good oh good maybe I'll get an inversion table again um as long as you don't stay there of course you had some okay great um would you let your kids play football or rugby that's a great question I would not uh that's my personal decision I think there are a lot of benefits to um children playing uh football rug like any sport uh it's a team sport a lot of good skills are learned um besides the you know just the the the physicality of it the coordination uh but being a team player and the socialization but uh I think talking about tackle football um uh I think um the risk there is still risk we're just learning about it and even um high school players who who um uh many years ago were found to have multiple concussions are showing up when they when they're doing autopsies uh uh with some of this uh chronic traumatic R for injuries not just head injuries other injuries um my son who's a very good athlete he played four years of High School uh baseball and soccer was asked to try out uh for the quarterback position his senior year and we went out to try out but and he decided um you know with my encouragement not not not to play did he go to gun high school he went to meno okay I went to gun our football team was at that time was bad enough that there was no incen to play what about soccer and heading the ball I've actually heard that can be problematic which to me at first when I heard that I I was like no there's no way I mean the ball is so light but is there any evidence that repeated you know heading there is it's again it's it's it's not uh uh incontrovertible but um uh there is some evidence that multiple headings can can cause some some concussions and some long-term injury um again when I studied this in detail um as a 49ers uh neurosurgeon back in the 90s there was very little data although there was some evidence even then that soccer players had a uh High incidence uh particularly female soccer players had a high incidence of of concussion surprisingly uh but now there's much more evidence that head injuries and even heading the ball may lead to some you know some some some injury I feel like if a sport is not your profession the risk benefit analysis is pretty clear like like like why box I understand it's a great sport there's a lot to learn there um done a little bit of it in the past but but unless you're going to get paid substantial amounts of money and maybe even then it's probably not worth it well I feel the same way um it is different for professional athletes I mean this is their job um you know I remember talking with with Steve Young at one point about you know continuing to play or you know finally deciding to retire and uh I was thinking what if you know I was asked to retire as a neurosurgeon at the prime of my career um you know uh it's your profession it's your income it's your you know it's how you identify yourself um you know uh your self-esteem is dependent on it your family maybe put pressure on you as a professional athlete um if you're not a professional athlete I I think for me and this is my my own opinion individually I think um there's less of a controversy and what there's so many other sports which uh uh benefit in the same way um as as football or or boxing um why not why not you know participate in those that's my feeling but I know it's a controversial subject yeah um maybe we can Circle back a little bit on a a fairly common scenario um you're in the attic and you're looking for something you stand up boom you hit your head on a beam and you know kind of dizzy for a bit or recently our podcast team was on tour in Australia and the way that the the uh shelf over the kitchen sink and our um Airbnb was arranged it was certain that everyone pretty much would hit their head hard on that thing at some point does one need to worry about one kind of dizzy inducing head hit um from everyday life you know I think a lot of people are kind of scared like do they do brain damage or is the The evolutionary adaptation which is the thick skull um sufficient to you know keep us safe in most cases I don't think you need to worry in general especially if your symptoms resolve within a relatively short period of time such as how long a day or two yeah I mean you know even if you have a mild concussion and you recover within a day or two I don't think there's uh any need to worry or get a scan or uh and and it's a common place Place occurrence yeah I think um your answer will set a lot of Minds at ease because um people do worry I mean there's something so mysterious about the stuff that occurs inside the cranial Vault we can't look to something we can't you know take our pulse um it's just you know it's so hard to know what's going on in there well as you say that's why we develop very thick skulls to protect the the most important organ because after all the tissue doesn't regenerate um at least not much of it there are a few areas where there where there neurons that can replenish you know I'm going to take um issue with you at that because the the prior notion of course was that once nerve cells in the brain die they don't regenerate and for a long time it was thought you don't produce any any new nerve cells any new stem cells in the brain um and we used to think after an injury uh or uh a disease like a stroke when that tissue was damaged and you were paralyzed or you couldn't talk that there was no way to recover that those circuits were were dead uh it turns out that is not true and we are learning that I think in recent years um when I trained there was no hope to restore function in patients who had a stroke traumatic brain injury spinal cord injury uh uh and um other diseases uh ALS lugar's disease um Parkinson's disease now we are learning learning that uh there is hope we know that stem cells do form in the adult brain that's not controversial anymore we know that other circuits can take over for circuits that were dead um and we know now and this is some of the work that we're doing with chronic stroke patients who we thought could not recover after 6 months at all we know that there are ways of um promoting uh regeneration or recovery of function we're still working out the details of that but um for instance we've done studies and this is still in um clinical trial phase with patients who are years out from a stroke they've been through rehab uh they've been through physical therapy and 90% or more of recovery after a stroke occurs in the first 6 months after that time you know patients are not going to recover and now we are finding in some of our early trials with patients that if you for instance put in stem cells into the brain uh or um if you another treatment which was uh approved by the FDA the very first for chronic stroke if you put a stimulator on the vagus nerve in the neck and stimulate coupled with physical therapy intensive Physical Therapy you can improve arm function in those patients in our patients that we've treated in multiple trials we're seeing early indications that patients years out from a stroke can start to recover function in their arms in their legs in their speech and we don't know all the mechanisms but the old notion that these circuits are dead is simply not true they can be resurrected and so um you know this is part of the the the excitement about um Discovery and um doing research and trying to translate into the clinical Arena yeah oftentimes this boils down to really critical of the- moment decisions I'll tell a story um I won't reveal the the hospital or the the exact players involved but um some years ago an ex-girlfriend of mine um who then was just somebody I was uh friends with um slash dating contacted me and said that her dad had had a stroke and I was um near that hospital so I went um and spoke to the resident and the resident who was overseeing the case essentially said look it's hopeless there's a huge necrotic piece of tissue in there um the probability of any kind of quality of life is essentially zero my suggestion and I was there as as um the resent made the suggestion would be to remove him from life support essentially and um the other members of the family were like oh my goodness right this is not a situation anyone wants to be in um I made a couple of calls including to um someone who's previously been a guest on this uh podcast who's highly qualified to know about this sort of thing they asked a couple of questions about the location of the stroke which side of the brain it was on and said um keep him alive there's a good chance that he'll have um some degree of recovery of function so that's what they did and indeed um while he lost some motor um abilities um lost some speech abilities and has some disrupt of affect where he'll sort of spontaneously laugh or cry from time to time he has at least by my observation been able to enjoy substantial amounts of Life interacting with grandkids um enjoying holidays and actually took I was told some um some physical steps at some point with assistance with a walker gone done a lot of physical rehab um obviously a really hard situation but it told me that often times when we think that All Is Lost not All Is Lost even in people in their 70s right it it has to do with plasticity and um we all wish we were neonates or infants because um the body including the brain is so plastic that's the ability to regenerate tissue and circuits and recover so if an infant has a stroke and is paralyzed on one side usually they can make an excellent if not complete recovery um this is the as I recall from my undergraduate years the Kenard principle if you're going to have a brain injury have it early in life exactly so um I mean you notice this too when I cut myself now it can take a week for that cut to heal when my granddaughter who's six years old cuts herself the next day it's totally healed so little kids are like salamanders right they almost it's by the way that was a biology joke they're not like salamanders that but um salamanders can re uh regenerate entire limbs by the maintenance of a small stem cell population at the at the tip of the the limb bud um or what would be the limb Bud um and it is remarkable how kids can regenerate without a scar they can often times they can't grow an entire hand back but it's kind of striking how much plasticity there is and that's what we're trying to develop are new ways of promoting plasticity in the adult brain as an example so we think stem cells injected through various mechanisms stimulation of the brain or the vagal nerve as an example can prom remote plasticity in a sense we think what's happening is um that these methods can turn the adult brain into an infant brain in some ways where are the stem cells coming from in these experiments it depends um there are different sources so um some of the studies I've done previously with other companies uh they made the stem cells either from uh bone marrow donors so they were meenal or uh another group made the cells from uh from fetal uh neural tissue okay so just to orient people inside the bone you have the marrow most people know that um because they've ordered it at a restaurant um cow marrow that is um uh typically um the cells within the marrow um contain as I recall a hemopoetic population so a population of of sort of potential blood cells you know cells that can become blood cells or other things and if taken out put into a petri dish and given the appropriate factors you can drive the fate of those stem cells to be say neurons or cardiac cells and then you're taking those cells and you're injecting them into the brains of patients in the hopes that they will re become neural cells neurons that will incorporate into the circuitry actually that was the initial notion 20 years ago when we started doing this was that these cells you put in uh become these exogenous cells you inject become neurons and asites and alod dendrites all the cells in the brain and that the neurons reconstitute circuits that is not how they work the way they work and this is why it may not uh matter what particular type of stem cell you put in the way they work primarily is by secreting very powerful proteins molecules growth factors that promote native recovery so they promote angiogenesis they promote native neurogenesis endogenous gliogenesis synaptogenesis but the main benefit may be that they modulate the immune system that's what we're finding so by modulating somehow the immune system in the brain they are able to induce plasticity and recover function interesting I I'm tempted here to weave in the the stories that date back to the90s but that we see more and more of mostly studies in rodents but a few in humans showing that there are dormant stem cell populations in certain compartments of the brain the Dage Gus of the hippocampus the olda factory Bulb Etc that upon hyper oxygenation or increasing blood flow to the brain largely by virtue of exercise but also sometimes by way of engaging in learning tasks and exercise that you can basically cause the release of stem cells that normally would lie DM is that um literature reason enough to suggest that people who've had a stroke um continue to move their body to walk get exercise maybe do resistance training maybe even some skill related training yes there's a lot of evidence that um activity Physical Therapy even forced activity um is very beneficial and it's not just um stimulating endogenous stem cells in the brain but it's multiple mechanisms uh it's recruiting uh circuits that were not involved before for instance Studies have been done on stroke patients who make a recovery show that um not only is the side of the stroke improving in some cases but the other side of the brain is showing increased activity so circuits on the other side of the brain may be contributing to the recovery on the the side of the stroke brain so it's much more complex than we thought it was years ago I um developed an affection for a literature it wasn't a very prominent literature um but I found it really interesting um is the work of a guy named Timothy Scher and um Teresa Jones I yeah I know you familiar with this yeah we almost recruited to to to our department yeah the sort of overarching theme of this literature was it was animal work um but I think some of it might have been translated to humans which was that for instance if somebody has damage on one side of the brain uh because of the way the circuits are organized and of course you know this better than anyone uh Gary but that one might experience deficits in limb movement on the opposite side and that the tendency for somebody like that is to then over rely on the intact limbs um essentially lean on the the intact Limbs and the approach that they took to try and uh recover function was really interesting they had these animals and I think eventually there was some human work done I could be mistaken to um sort of uh tie up the the more active uninjured arm or leg or hand such that they then had had to rely on the non-dominant or let's just call it injured sometimes even flaccid paralysis Limb and in that way they could generate a lot of plasticity that normally would escape the patient especially in the days and weeks following the injury just forcing movement uh or forcing the attempt to move of the injured pathway I find this literature to be so striking and maybe one that should deserve more attention yeah it's called constraint therapy and um not only has it been shown in uh animal studies preclinically but it's been shown in some uh clinical studies of patients with stroke in fact one of the trials we did with transplanting stem cells into the brain included restraining the good limb to force use of the other limb so there's um some very intriguing data suggesting that that's important however some of the animal studies also suggest that you may have to wait a time if you force use of the uh involved limb too soon it can be detrimental to the recovery I see so there may be a a an important temporal Factor there in terms of the timing of when you do that is there anything that people can do or take for neuroprotection after an injury to essentially try and rescue neurons that would otherwise die right so this is a a very interesting subject um back in the late 1980s 1990s a lot of emphasis was placed on trying to protect the brain against acute stroke different pharmacologic agents were tried um probably um a thousand different drugs were tried which blocked uh the pathway leading to cell death so interestingly when you deprive the the brain and the neurons of oxygen and glucose they don't die immediately and it takes some time and it's actually an active process so the release of these excitatory amino acids occurs so normally as you know glutamate aspartate are important neurotransmitters in the brain and you need them to function but after a stroke when there's a deprivation of oxygen and glucose and a mismatch between the metabolism and the supply of oxygen and glucose for some reason there's a release of these excitatory amino acids like glutamate and that causes an influx of calcium into the neurons which is the final common Pathway to dying and then there are other Pathways that can that lead to release of free radical and uh which are more damaging and those can cause another type of cell death called apoptotic cell death that's a cell death that occurs and requires protein synthesis and then uh with reperfusion um say the artery opens up then you got a lot of inflammation so these pharmacological treatments as I say a thousand of them were tried um and they were found to be very effective in pre-clinical stroke models so we could cure stroke in the lab my lab studied this for probably 15 years and um you know there was no doubt we could cure stroke if we got the drugs on board even after the stroke um within a few hours but it never was able to be translated to the clinical Arena except for one case so besides drugs that were tried um another method of protecting the brain was tried called mild hypothermia and that uh was a process of reducing the brain temperature and body temperature just a few degrees from 37° centigrade to 33 and we were one of the first to to show um that that was protective even after the stroke in animals um my understanding is that when you cool neural tissue you quiet its electrical activity in fact this is a common um tool for experimentation in in Neuroscience Laboratories you know you want to shut down a a brain area transiently you you cool it down right and in fact deep hypothermia has a profound effect on shutting down the metabolism so that's why when a someone particularly kids fall into a frozen pond with with ice cold water they can survive there for half an hour uh and make a complete recovery because their body temperature is dropped down to very low like 20° Centigrade but this is less this is just a few degrees so the amount there is a slight decrease in the metabolic activity but that does not account for all the protection it's due to the fact that hypothermia mild hypothermia blocks many of those detrimental Pathways it blocks partly the release of those exitor amino acids glutamate it blocks the calcium influx it blocks the inflammation uh and so um that's probably why it works so well it even blocks that other pathway of program cell death um because it hits all these Pathways it's multifactorial it's very effective and in fact it was finally shown in the early 2000s in prospec of randomized studies that one type of stroke actually two types I should say two types of stroke are benefited by cooling the brain quickly one is cardiac arrest from ventricular fibrillation and prospective studies which were published in 2002 showed that if you uh cool patients who have cardiac arrest and then are resuscitated out in the field down to between 32 and 34 degrees Centigrade from 37 much better outcomes neurologically that's from Global eskema that's the no blood getting to the brain briefly and the other area where it's been shown to have um better outcomes is in neonatal what's called hypo schic injury those are neonates who have lack of blood flow for some reason to the brain when they're when they're born and if you cool them it's been shown in studies up to 10 years later that they have better cognitive outcomes so for cardiac arrest in in uh in the mid 2000s uh I think it was 2003 the American Heart Association determined if was a standard of care a guideline that you had to cool patients after cardiac arrest yes how was the cooling done in the experiments that you were involved in yeah so there are many ways to do it but in the animal models you can just cool them with a a cooling blanket actually in people uh we got very interested in this in fact when I saw in the laboratory that it was so effective and and that we could cure you know Mouse and and rat Stroke by Cooling I started cooling my patience in the operating room um because I I felt you know even if it hasn't impr proven in in in patience that you know it was so effective it's the gold standard now actually for neuro for neuro protection against stroke in the in the laboratory so back in um the 1990s I started cooling all of my patients we started by cooling them by putting um packing them in I and putting alcohol on them but uh the operating room staff appropriately didn't like that cuz cuz alcohol is inflammable so then we started using cooling blankets and then a number of companies um started developing cooling catheters and I work with several of these so you can actually cool very quickly uh if you put a catheter in the uh into a a a vessel say in the groin and um Infuse cold saline which doesn't get into the into the circulation but it cools the blood and the cooled blood then circulates um other ways of cooling are to putting on um um special devices which cool quickly and that's what's used now are are external devices people are working on cooling just the head with helmets um so it's still an active field of of Investigation for stroke and also for cardiac arrest actually it has not been proven in well-designed prospective trials that it works for garden variety focal stroke it works for cardiac arrest where there's Global lack of blood flow to the brain like when the heart stops it hasn't been proven yet for the kind of stroke we've been talking about where there's a single blocked artery to the brain so interesting I mean a lot of times on this podcast we talk about the critical need for body temperature to drop by 1 to 3° to get into deep sleep we had Craig heler our colleague from the biology department at Stanford on the podcast where we talked about some of the Palmer Cooling and um essentially cooling the um soles of the feet the palms of the hands and the upper part of the face as a way to more rapidly reduce core body temperature um I think these are fascinating areas for exploration um that obviously have clinical applications but but also you would imagine for some of the things we were talking about before like just to um provide a bit of neuroprotection after a head hit or provide a bit of neuroprotection perhaps even as it relates to aging you know spending a little bit of time maybe 10 minutes a day you know not badly hypothermic please people but slightly hypothermic and then bringing the body temperature back up yeah I mean I wouldn't recommend if you have a head injury or or or a TIA to stick your head in a in a snow bank but um even with traumatic brain injury severe not just concussion but severe TBI traumatic brain injury um studies were done looking at cooling hypothermia and it's called mild hypothermia because it's just a few degrees and the studies were very suggestive but uh didn't get to the point that it was proven um although certain subgroups who were cooled quickly seemed to do better so I I think it's a subject that's still being studied um and as I say it's easy for us to do in the operating room you don't want to cool too much because that can then inter fear with um other um metabolic functions and clotting parameters and there uh it C can cause increased infection if you go too low for too long but um I still um uh let my patients cool just a few degrees and we've had some anecdotal cases where where patients have had um uh problems um and um because we cooled them we think it it it made a benefit for instance we had one patient who we hadn't even done uh I was getting ready to do a bypass to sew a scalp artery to a brain artery but we hadn't even um uh I think made the the the the skin incision and the patient had a cardiac arrest so we um uh and and it lasted for a long time so we were pumping on the chest uh couldn't restore function and it was uh way outside the uh amount of time that you would have expected a good recovery but the patient had been cooled down to 33° before we by the time it had happened and um and then we finally uh got the heart started we ended up putting some uh restoring flow through catheters and and a heart lung machine and remarkably the guy made a complete recovery so anecdotal but cases like that um suggest maybe cooling um even a few degrees has a protective effect on the brain uh we certainly know it it's true for cardiac arrest and Global esia what are your thoughts on Plat rich plasma PRP these days we hear so much about PRP I think it's FDA approved for certain things right people will get um blood drawn they'll um spin down platelets and then put in platelet rich plasma um a few years ago people were making claims out there about PRP containing stem cells I just for the record my understanding I'm sure someone will argue with me online they always do but my understanding is that PRP contains very few if any stem cells um and that it's not legal to assert that PRP is stem cell therapy but PRP seems to be something that after an injury or in anticipation of a surgery people are starting to do more and more because they can go drop a few thousand dollars and I don't know get this infusion of PRP does it does it work to help recover brain tissue or preserve brain tissue is there any evidence of that what's whatever I'm not an expert on on platelet rich um you know um plasma but um my reading of the literature uh cursorily uh suggests there's not hard evidence that it's beneficial I think one has to be a little careful for instance um I still um get um emails uh you know every few weeks from people saying uh I've had a stroke or I've had a head injur and uh should I go to uh Russia or India or Mexico and get um stem cell therapy yeah this is a big topic area and and you may have discussed it another podcast I have not I I'll do a solo episode on stem cells and what they are and what they aren't I I just will just sorry to interrupt but I'm aware of a clinic in Florida that was injecting stem cells into the eyes of patients with macular degeneration and some other eye issues and those patients rapidly went I was going to bring that up to and that's what led the FDA to really clamp down on stem cell clinics in the US although they haven't clamped in on those type clinics as well they should but I um I tell patients no if you go out of the country uh often you don't know what you're getting if there's not a an equivalent of an FDA which is overseeing it um you don't know whether these sell where they come from sometimes they're not published literature um you don't know um where they're derived we've seen cas es of patients going elsewhere getting injections into the brain or the spinal cord and developing tumors or other problems so I discouraged that and I was going to bring up even in this country um these clinics and that was published um a number of years ago that clinic in Florida um those patients had macular degeneration and they were losing their sight but they could still see to some extent they had their own adapost tissue taken they sorted it for certain uh stem cells meenal stem cells and it was reinjected into the into the eye should have been safe right their own cells even and as as you say several of them went blind irreversibly irreversibly so um I think this is very important to highlight the the dangers of of stem cell therapy in general there's a lot of Hope for it I mean we're engaged we're just finishing a a trial a first inhuman trial at Stanford using we developed in my lab 20 years ago it took us 20 years to prove that they were safe effective didn't cause tumors and the study is looking very promising it's a phase one study and we we're making uh plans to do a phase two study with control patients which you always want to do uh but despite the Hope um there is still a lot of hype and I think it's very important to to be careful about getting therapies that are not proven yeah and uh while we wouldn't want anyone to take any kind of unnecessary risk you know to me anyway this goes back to the beginning of of our conversation that there's something very different about a knee from the brain right I'm not saying go get stem cells injected into your knee but should you be the sort of person that wants to do that because that you feel that's within your rights you know again I don't tell people what to do and you go to a clinic they get stem cells or I don't know they they take stem cells from some source and put them into your knee I mean that's a very different um situation than injecting into the brain b you know what some of the approaches um to treat diseases of the brain or injuries to the brain are not injecting directly into the brain they're injecting intravenously or intraarterial threading a cath up as we discuss and injecting in the brain those cells it turns out don't even get into the brain um and the idea is that uh in some of the better studies that that have been done in animals that they work by modulating the IM immune system systemically those cells get trapped in the lung in the spleen which people describe as bioreactors and modulate the immune system which does make some sense as I say we we think one of the main benefits of these stem cells is that they modulate the immune system uh and that helps with plasticity in the brain but even intravenous delivery can be can be dangerous to the brain yeah this is an area that uh we will spend a lot more time on during this podcast um despite what you just said I think the the data I've seen from your laboratory and as you you told me there's a trial that's finishing up now um that uh features those data or that uh is where those data arve from rather um are really impressive I mean some people who were largely IM mobile or aphasic they couldn't speak um in some cases are able to speak or move and that's really remarkable it's really exciting so I think that the future of stem cells in stroke therapy um is pretty pretty bright at least from where I said yeah we don't want to oversell this um but uh some of the uh results in certain patients are remarkable I mean the patients and their families has changed their lives if you see them before and after it's almost like a miracle others are not as impressive but uh so far in our trial uh and we've 17 of the 18 U uh intended patients uh almost all the patients have recovered to some extent and many of them have improved um in a meaningful way if you use certain scales so again we want to be cautious we're going to do a prospective randomized blinded controlled study uh and that's the way it should be done and um if that's positive it would lead to a a a phase three um larger study again blinded controlled and if that's positive then it would lead to commercialization FDA approval um it's a long process I've spent 23 years and more than 46 million in Grants and philanthropy um getting it to this stage wow yeah wow that's that's a lot of time and a lot of money amazing that's way science and and and translation to clinical medicine is um I would be remissed if I didn't ask you know what are some of the things that you think could accelerate that process or is that just the slow iterative process that is science in medicine I mean for instance if there was um five times as much money um would the science progress at you know five times the rate probably not um no but M money is a factor um it's not the only Factor uh the FDA is appropriately very cautious I think uh other countries the equivalent of the FDA uh moves things along a little quicker especially for therapies where there's no no no other treatment um uh so uh I think those factors are are important um and would accelerate it I think greater collaboration with industry and promoting more academic industry kinds of um relationships would help because uh the the government agencies uh do not uh provide enough money to uh do the final stage you know there's called this Valley of Death where you get initial uh encouraging uh data even clinically but you can't move the hurdle to get it into FDA approval um because of uh of money in some cases I've seen as an example uh a number of very good stem cell therapies um um not make it because the companies went bankrupt the board of directors of the company felt the results were good but not good enough and they pulled the funding yeah so uh this is a whole area which I was not well well informed of until I got into this um of how you you know move through the FDA and how you um you know work with industry uh I haven't formed a company yet but I'm going to have to because for the next trial this trial I was for forunate to get a grant from surm California Institute for regenerative Medicine of $12 million that's taxpayer dollars exactly great use of taxpayer money putting into really Forward Thinking research but the next trial and our results are good enough that we probably will only need if we do a statistical power analysis 69 patients initially we thought we'd need 170 patients but the results keep getting better and better so now uh it seems we would only need uh uh uh about 69 patients that will cost at least 45 million um and as the trials get larger even more so uh yeah we need to figure out a better way to allocate money to to make these advances it sounds like um a company or some role of industry is going to be necessary a um well you might be interested in investing right I mean well that the um the this podcast is always available free the standard La podcast our premium channel um actually generates uh money we do uh askme any things and things of that sort we have donors that have come in for a dollar match and we do philanthropy to Laboratories at Stanford sulk Institute Columbia University we've already done that we're going to do more of this well I was I was big fous oh no listen we could explore it one of the one of the guidelines is that we fund research on humans exclusively um so we could talk about that the um a former colleague of ours at Stanford um once told me that the joke um we'll see if I get in trouble for this joke um which is that there are two kinds of Stanford faculty Stanford faculty with companies and Stanford faculty with successful companies so um we'll we'll see if we'll see what comes down the pike from that but you know I mean many of the Technologies and and discoveries that have been made at Stanford have spun off into um you know there these little companies like you know Chente and you know other companies like that that um are not strictly Stanford relations but of course other universities too but you know the universities are where the basic research is done and then then somebody has to implement those Stanford's getting much better when I came to Stanford in 1974 um it was uh the medical center was more like an NIH of the West and there was not a lot of uh clinical Excellence except for cardiac surgery norm shway and radiation oncology uh Henry Kaplan who had developed the first radiation uh method for treating lymphoma uh and we were great at making basic discoveries is not very good at translating them but over you know the last what 50 years Stanford has gotten much better at uh translating them um uh into you know clinical therapies uh and even doing some of that work at Stanford not farming it out to other other places so I think that's another area that we need to we need to encourage well the proximity to um big Tech um is uh sort of built into the fabric of of the Bay Area now there's just no escaping that and I think uh overall um you know it's not without its sometimes issues but overall I think it's a really good thing um facilitates the most rapid possible flow between basic science Discovery and um implementation at at large um I want to make sure that we cover just a little bit about vagal stimulation a lot of listeners this podcast are familiar with the Vegas nerve as this very extensive pathway connecting brain and body in both directions um the common idea out there is that the Vegas is associated with calming because it's in the parasympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system the so-called rest and digest pathway but I happen to know and I'm sure you know from experimentation and from Clinical work that oftentimes vagal stimulation is a way of bringing say depressed patients up to more alertness that vagal stimulation is not always about calming it can be about alerting the brain um or making the brain more alert um so what sorts of vagal stimulation are you doing um given that the vagel pathway is so um extensive you know like like which branch of the Vegas do you stimulate there's it goes around the ear it's in the neck it goes down through the gut I mean we're talking basically about a super highway of I mean it kind of reminds me of the Austin freeway system if you've ever driven in Austin it's like the freeways go in every which direction that's so whenever I'm there I'm like the freeway system here is kind of like the Vegas so which um Avenue do you stimulate in order to get a desired effect right well for stroke and as as I alluded to um vagal nerve stimulation coupled with physical therapy physical activity very intensive was the very first FDA approved treatment for chronic stroke patients that was approved in uh 2021 3 years ago and it was shown in the study that compared with um non-stimulation in other words putting the stimulator on but not not stimulating and doing the therapy that patients did better it was a modest Improvement but felt to be uh meaningful and it was shown to be effective at 90 days only three months now recently at the last International stroke meeting last uh this past February uh it was presented and I don't I don't know if it's been published yet that those results hold up for for a uh up to a year so um the way it works presumably is that you stimulate the entire vus nerve in the neck and it's not the peripheral effects on the heart or the other autonomic organs where it's working it's stimulation that goes back to the brain right because when you stimulate a nerve it doesn't go in One Direction and that's probably how it works for depression also not a systemic but and the Vagas has lots of connection with brain functions right um and so that's it's not completely clear which areas are being stimulated to recover from stroke or or improve depression but it's brain stimulation that somehow again resurrect circuits or induces plasticity in circuits uh again it's it's it's something that um we're learning about and uh I think not just vagal nerve stimulation but stimulation of the brain is becoming a very important uh Innovative treatment for many brain diseases and injuries is the vagal stimulation uh is it invasive or can you use an external stimulator it's invasive you have to do an operation it's lowrisk um very few side effects occasionally there are some it can cause some problems with swallowing which are usually temporary right because the vagal nerve um the recurrent vagal nerve supplies the the laryn the vocal cord but um so it's an implanted stimulator but the stimulation could be turned on and off with an external um magnet device incredible Gary uh Dr Steinberg I want to thank you um for several things first of all uh for coming here today to share with us um right up until the point we hit uh hot mics meaning we we started recording uh you were getting calls about patients I know you're still in the operating room you were our department chair for more than two decades 25 years 25 years thank you for that um uh and you know still just so active in this area doing Cutting Edge research and stem cells and so much more um so as an extremely busy person who has many important duties you are literally a brain surgeon um to take the time out of your schedule to come here and share with us all this information about how to keep our brain healthy the relationship between alcohol nicotine fortunately caffeine's not on the list but don't overdo it folks um neuroprotection the discussion about TBI something we've never discussed on this podcast um transient esumic attacks and just a really vast survey of things that concern a lot of people and that also now having uh heard what you've shared also it puts them in a position now to empower themselves to take some agency over their brain health which is something that I think most people really fear that this thing inside our skulls is outside the reach of our efforts to try and maintain health and clearly you've um explained how that is not the case and there are things we can do to both protect ourselves and to overcome challenges should they arise so on behalf of myself and and all the listeners and viewers I just want to say thank you so much and hopefully as these trials um continue to develop um you'll come back and update us on the progress Andrew it's been a real pleasure thank you for inviting me thank you for

Title: Dr. James Hollis: How to Find Your True Purpose & Create Your Best Life
Published: 2024-05-13 12:00:26 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. James Hollis, Ph.D., a Jungian psychoanalyst, renowned educator and author on finding and pursuing one’s unique purpose. Dr. Hollis is also an expert in the psychology of relationships and healing from trauma. We discuss how early family dynamics and social context create patterns of both adaptive and maladaptive behavior and internal narratives that, when examined, lead to better choices and a deeply fulfilling existence.

We discuss discovering your unique self-identity and purpose through specific practices of reflection, meditation and conversations with others. We also discuss self-perception and the evolution of roles within marriages, parent-child relationships, and work.

Throughout the episode, Dr. Hollis provides both basic knowledge and practical tools to help us assess ourselves and better understand who we are and what we really want in careers, relationships of all kinds, and society.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr James Hollis Dr James Hollis is a jungian psychoanalyst and author of more than 17 books about the self relationships and how to create the best possible life some of the notable titles and topics of those books include creating a life finding your individual path as well as the Eden project in search of the magical other which as the name suggests is about relationships he has also written about how to access our most resilient self in the book entitled living Between Worlds finding personal resilience in changing times during today's discussion Dr Hollis teaches us what questions we need to ask of ourselves on a regular basis in order to best understand who we really are and what we most Des desire at the level of vocation romantic relationships friendship and family and indeed in relationship to life's journey what you'll quickly realized during today's discussion with Dr Hollis is that while yes he is trained as a yian psychoanalyst he is also very firmly grounded in Practical tools that is he teaches us the simple and yet practical tools that we can each and all apply on a daily basis in order to make sure that we are staying on our best path we discuss how family dynamics that we grew up in as well as trauma and attachment Styles combined with our unique gifts and indeed our shadow side as well in order to drive us down particular trajectories in life that sometimes lead us where we want to go but other times lead us astray and when they do how to get back on track today's conversation with Dr Hollis is truly a special one in that he rarely does podcast appearances in fact we travel to him to record this podcast that's how motivated I was to be able to sit down with him because I'm familiar with his many books and his incredible teachings but I really wanted to get his knowledge collected in one format in one place and what I can promise you is that by the end of today's podcast you will be thinking differently about yourself about the people in your life and indeed life itself before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is matina matina makes loose leaf and ready to drink ybba mate now I've long been a fan of ybba mate as a source of caffeine in part because of its high antioxidant content as well as its ability to elevate glucagon like peptide 1 or glp1 which leads to a slight appetite suppressing effect as well as its ability to regulate blood sugar and possible neuroprotective effects I also just happen to love the way that yerbamate tastes I'll sometimes drink it hot by pouring hot water over the loose leaf yerbamate and I'm particularly fond these days of drinking the zero sugar cold brew matina yerbamate that I help develop now I realize that there are a lot of different brands of loose leaf and canned and bottled yerbamate out there but the reason I like matina the most is first of all it has absolutely the best taste of all of them secondly they only use organic ingredients and thirdly because they offer low sugar and zero sugar varieties if you'd like to try matina you can go to drink maa.com huberman that's spelled drink m a t i n a /h huberman Right Now matina is offering a free one PB bag of loose leaf yate tea and free shipping with a purchase of two cases of their C Brew y bate again that's drink maa.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by ju ju makes medical grade red light therapy devices now there's one thing that I've consistently emphasized on this podcast it's the incredible impact that light meaning photons can have on our mental health and physical health red and near infrared light has been shown to have profound effects on improving Cellar Health which can help with faster Muscle Recovery boosting healthier skin reducing pain in inflammation enhancing sleep and much more what sets ju apart is that it uses clinically effective wavelengths emits a safe and effective dose of red and near infrared light and most importantly offers the only true medical grade Red Light Panel

betterhelp offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out online I've been going to therapy for well over 30 years initially I didn't have a choice it was a condition of being allowed to stay in school but pretty soon I realized that therapy is extremely valuable in fact I consider doing regular therapy just as important as getting regular exercise including cardiovascular exercise and resistance training which of course I also do every week the reason I know therapy is so valuable is that if you can find a therapist with whom you can develop a really good rapport you not only get terrific support for some of the challenges in your life but you also can derive tremendous insights from that therapy insights that can allow you to better not just your emotional life your relationship life but of of course also the relationship to yourself and to your professional life to all sorts of career goals in fact IC therapy is one of the key components for meshing together all aspects of one's life and being able to really direct one's focus and attention toward what really matters if you'd like to try betterhelp go to betterhelp.com huberman to get 10% off

I'm excited to talk to you today thank you Andrew it's a privilege to be with you thank you let's talk about the self this is something that I think people occasionally wonder about you know who who am I we wake up every day we have some stable representation of who we are in our name most of the time and we develop a self a story MH based on what we know about our parents our siblings our life from the perspective of yion psychology maybe psychology generally how should we think about ourselves well first of all the idea of the self with a capital S to distinguish it from the ego Consciousness that is to say my conscious presence as you and I are talking right now um is a Transcendent other it's a mystery it's um essentially governed by our instincts you know it's nature seeking its own expression and its own healing what I've seen in terms of the activity of the self through the years it has two agendas one healing when injured and secondly expressing itself in the same way that the acorn becomes the oak tree so to speak um now the ego of course is that little cintilla of energy that we begins to Cluster we're born without an ego but then there's this sbl shards of experience between the the me and the not me that slowly accumulate almost in Tidal pools so that I begin to differentiate myself from the other my mother let's say or my father or the object that is there and you're right we are an animal that seeks to understand as part of our adaptation to the world and so we are narrative animals we create stories about it and our stories rise out of what we're experiencing at the moment so you can see why a person bornn into a certain culture or a certain family of origin with its style of relating or disr as the case may be uh becomes the ground for defining that person's sense of self so it's important to distinguish between the self and one's sense of self the sense of self is who I think I am in any given moment that's very fluid of course now we have all kinds of internal clusters of energy that are called complexes a ter that young ized and complexes are uh Splinter personalities he said so a person might say why did I get so upset yesterday what what came over me or I don't know what I was thinking when I made this important decision and that's our recognition that we were in an altered state at that moment that it that something within us had been triggered had sufficient energy to come up usurp ego Consciousness and take it over actually the term that y used in in German meant possession it's a state of psychic possession temporarily you know we we joke that lovers are fools or lovers are blind so we know that people are in a certain they're caught in a certain projection onto the to the other and you know that ultimately gets um you know resolved into some sort of reality through time and and experience with that individual but in that state of being one senses that one's making the right decision and no one wakes in the morning and says for example well today I think I'm going to do the same stupid counterproductive things I've done for decades but there's a good chance we will why because we have certain clusters of energy in us that are regularly triggered when triggered they catalyze a response in the ego that enacts that program so it affects our body it affects our our script and of course it affects our our percep I of self and world so you know from the standpoint of of therapy one of the things we try to do is suggest to people you're not what happened to you because one of our Tendencies is to internalize whatever is happening to us and thinking of that defines us of course the younger the more less formed we are uh the more we're likely to be defined by poverty or by disease or by alcoholism or or by sexism or or whatever the social constructs are into which we're born as well as the psychodynamics of the family of origin so in those circumstances uh we all have a provisional sense of self and if you have a culture that says this is who you are this is what you're your your orders are your your marching orders here's your script and the more authoritarian the culture or or the more traumatic one's environmental situation and family of origin the more likely I'm going to be reacting to that so when I've had an experience I'm either going to repeat it or I'm going to try to run from it or maybe I'll be spending my life trying to treat it in some way that I'm not aware of um this activates many people into the healing professions by the way whether it's clergy nursing therapy etc etc that that's often a sensitive child in the family who feels I have to try to stabilize my environment in order to uh so get things back to a a normal State whatever that might be so that then it can be there for me but of course that never quite happens you know a child can't fix a parent you see and so many people in the helping professions um are are driven there by a powerful internalized message which becomes their sense of self so it's a long-winded way of saying there's distinction between the self which is the natural organic development of this organism you know as we're speaking it's growing our toenails digesting our breakfast mentating emoting and so forth most of that's autonomous activity it's kind of like the centipede you know you congratulate the centipede on how well he coordinates all of his legs and then he thinks well should I move this leg or this leg or this and he's immobilized these are not functions that we govern consciously although we can interrupt them consciously but something is there taking care of us it's an organic Unity and that's what you meant by the by the self capital S our sense of self is a different matter and so one of the things that I've tried to emphasize in therapy is you're not what happened to you because we tend to be bound to our story that says either that's who I am that's what I'm defined by or I'm spending my life trying to differentiate myself from that get away from that perhaps so um again our sense of self is very provisional it evolves and and in any given moment there may be something in the unconscious that's um triggered and of course the problem with the unconscious it's unconscious so I don't know that it's happened it's I I have the unconscious uh triggered it has the power to rise take over provisionally spin out its program and then after a while you know it recedes back into the unconscious and as I said sometimes people will stop and say well I wonder what was behind that decision or why did I choose that path or what in me is blocking me from doing what I know is right for me you know as uh Paul said in the letter to the Romans though I know the good I do not do the good well why not well he saw it as in insufficiency of will but we know it's more than that we we know that there are unconscious factors at work that have a certain autonomy and the more unconscious they are the greater their autonomy will prove to be if they are unconscious and they're driving us sometimes into States other times traits I mean and that's a perhaps an interesting discussion in of itself is you know when what's the difference between a state of mind and body and a trait but if it's unconscious what chance do we stand to overcome these things I mean what where how does the awareness come about can we do it on our own does it require Reflection from a trained professional and if so um you know when we become conscious of something does that immediately flip a switch or does it require constant returning to um you know seeing and uh for you know forcing the the unconscious to become conscious over and over again sure well those are great questions um f first of all again none of us rise us saying we're going to be counterproductive today but we will because of the autonomy of those clusters of energy within us now I've said to many people who've asked that question well start with your own life look to the patterns that you have a pattern is an indication of some cluster of energy whether it's outward or whether it's inward that you're carrying with you um and we don't do crazy things we always do logical things if we understand that what we're in service to iny Ally I give you an example I was working in a closed ward of a hospital many decades ago and there was a fellow repeatedly trying to break a window people were assuming he was trying to escape or get a Shard of glass for some nefarious purpose and no one bothered to ask him why he was doing this and he said he had the delusion that he was first of all in a locked Ward so he was caught in a you know non-voluntary situation and in his psychosis he felt that um somebody was pumping air from the room now if this door was locked and the air is being pumped out of this room the most logical thing we would do is break through a window or break down the door so his behavior was logical based on the premise now the premise is often inaccurate or tied to one place but gets extrapolated to another one somewhere else and and then we are responding logically to that that premise so you start with your own life particularly the places where you you find these are self-defeating behaviors or behaviors that are hurtful to you and someone else and then you say since that's not my conscious intention and yet there it is as part of my history then I have to say all right what is it within me that you know has the kind of power to take over my ego Consciousness now just to back off for a moment here I I think we're only conscious in the ego dealing with reality uh a few times during the course of a day my favorite analogy is when you get up in the morning and you step in the shower it's too hot or too cold so you change the water temperature well that's the ego and its proper function it's being adaptive to its reality it's being protective at that moment it's achieving the optimum situation for you but from the rest of time on when that same ego is flooded by other material some of which just conscious who gets the kids today after school how do I get to the work on time Etc but underneath that are other drivers that have to do with fear-based responses or adaptive responses that um were perhaps once protective but later you know we weren't born with them but we acquired them along Life's Highway so what was once protective often becomes constrictive later and and creates those patterns so the number one you start with your patterns um secondly and everyone sort of laughs at this but there's a certain truth you might talk to those around you such as your spouse or your closest partner or or your children and ask them about what they see in us if you can bear to hear what they have to say and to say where is it you see me being hurtful to myself or others or where is it that I get in your face in an inappropriate way uh and they'll usually have something to inform us with thirdly we pay attention to our dreams because we don't choose to dream but sleep research tells us that we average about six dreams per night that's a lot of activity nature doesn't waste energy it's processing something and it's not just processing if we pay attention over time um you begin to realize it has a point of view another way of putting this is the psyche which is the term I would use here and that's the Greek word for Soul by the way the the the psyche you know has its own intentionality it's omnipresent and it's commenting and it comments in terms of our feeling function you don't choose your feelings feelings are autonomous responses to what has happened you can repress them suppress them anesthetize them project them on others but you are in the end um you know a creature that has an autonomous feeling response secondly we have energy systems if I'm doing what's right for me the energy is there the flow is there we can mobilize our energy and we have to in life to get up and feed the baby at 2: in the morning or um you know put in our 40-hour week or whatever the requirements are uh but over time uh forcing the Energy System leads as we know to boredom and burnout and ultimately depression often with self-medication attached to that um thirdly we have dreams which comment um fourthly most importantly is the question of meaning if what we're doing is Meaningful as understood by the psyche it will support us even in the face of suffering and sacrifice and so forth if what we're doing is wrong as seen by the psyche then over time it begins to pathologize so you take that word Psychopathology literally from the Greek it means the expression of the suffering of the Soul which I think is ratory the expression of the suffering of the Soul now that seems to me obligatory to take seriously if my soul and again that's a metaphor you know people look for the soul throughout history and you can't find it in the pineal gland for example the Soul's a metaphor for the organic wisdom of that natural being that we are the soul is a metaphor for uh this purposeful expression of the organism it is purposeful in other words question that occupies all of us in childhood and throughout the first half of Life at least if not an entire lifetime is what does the world want of me what do my parents want from me what do my school teacher want me what do The Playmates expect of me what does the partner want for me what does the employer want all of these are reality-based encounters with the demands of the environment and and part of what we have to do is develop enough ego strength to create a provisional sense of self and a provisional functional self to deal with those expectations but then when you've done that you know why are you still here what's the purpose are you simply here to be a creature of adaptations now without those adaptations we would be overwhelmed typically by the circumstances of our lives so we accommodate them in some way but in the second half of life and I'm using a ter very Loosely um the real question is what does the soul want of me you know what does the psyche want of me that's a different question then the issue comes up what is it that is wishing expression in the world through me that's a different question then what does the world ask of me the people that we would most admire in history are people who in some way found and lived out what the soul was asking of them it didn't spare them from suffering sometimes even martyrdom it doesn't spare you from conflict and pain maybe isolation maybe Exile but you're fed by the purposefulness of it take that away and life is pretty empty and of course we live in a culture where there's this enormous barrage of external stimuli well buy this purchase that do this or that the latest thing in this or that the newest shin and the more I'm seeking to Define myself through that environmental summons the more likely I'm going to be aranged from something inside all of us know it but we don't know what to do about that at some level and typically it has to hurt enough inside to bring a person into therapy people don't just walk in and say well I was in the neighborhood and I thought I'd pop in and talk to a total stranger pay him some money and then you know walk out as a different person doesn't work that way I I've often said to people this is not about curing you because you're not a disease this is about uh making your life more interesting where you realize every morning you get up um you have something profound to address today why am I here and in service to what because if you don't ask that question you're going to be in service to your adaptive postures from childhood as many people prove to be until the conflict within reaches that point where the suffering of the Soul Psychopathology is sufficient um I myself was cruising along in my 30s I'd achieved everything that I wanted to achieve and was enjoying my life and then suddenly inexplicably had a very serious depression and it took me a while to realize that I was asking the wrong question the first question that occurs to a person under those circumstances is is um how quickly do I get rid of this you know give me five easy steps or a pill for that or whatever I didn't understand the real question is why has your psyche autonomously withdrawn its approval and support from the agenda that you've been addressing it was a good agenda nothing wrong with it but there was something else that was missing in this process and it took a depression like something from below reached up and pulled me down something was being pressed down down that's depression and at the bottom of that well there's always a task there's always an issue the identification of which can lead one into a new place in one's life a different journey in my case it it led me to uh leave a very fine tenure position in Academia travel to Switzerland and spend several years there in retraining as as a psycho analyst and uh I now look upon that depression as beneficent but at the time I certainly didn't as you can imagine I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 by now most of you have heard me tell my story about how I've been taking ag1 once or twice a day every day since 2012 and indeed that's true I started taking ag1 and I still take ag1 once or twice a day because it gives me vitamins and minerals that I might not be getting enough of from Whole Foods that I eat as well as a adaptogens and micronutrients those adaptogens and micronutrients are really critical because even though I strive to eat most of my foods from unprocessed or minimally processed Whole Foods it's often hard to do so especially when I'm traveling and especially when I'm busy so by drinking a packet of ag1 in the morning and oftentimes also again in the afternoon or evening I'm ensuring that I'm getting everything I need I'm covering all of my foundational nutritional needs and I like so many other people that take ag1 regularly just report feeling better and that shouldn't be surprising because it supports gut health and of course gut health supports immune system health and brain health and it's supporting a ton of different cellular and organ processes that all interact with one another so while certain supplements are really directed towards one specific outcome like sleeping better or being more alert ag1 really is foundational nutritional support it's really designed to support all of the systems of your brain and body that relate to mental health and physical health if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs with your order plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman so if our task is to get in touch with this kind of Yearning of the Soul MH um to perhaps do some reparative work from our childhood or at least understand our parent child relationships and then in an ideal circumstance to express ourselves through some higher calling if you will but higher meaning for us or for the world hopefully both that's that would be ideal in terms of the day you know you said you you can wake up in the morning presumably some of the residual thought processes and emotions from a dream or dreams still live within us early in the day and then we start going about our day doing the Practical things making the cup of coffee drinking the water getting some sunshine uh these sorts of things how is it that the typical person any of us can think about segmenting our thinking and our actions in a way that we're touching into the deeper meaning of life while also carrying out a life because as you know and I know and everybody listening and watching knows that there's stuff to do we need we need to often get an education make a living tend to people around us tend to ourselves and and it becomes a a a kind of a Neuroscience problem in my mind right you know different brain circuitries for different types of thinking and if I may it I think it also becomes a time perception problem you know the brain the human brain to me is so magnificent at setting Milestones that are like get in the shower finish the shower check the text messages talk to somebody and get about the day the Milestones become very close in and then if we're lucky enough to be able to take a walk and reflect put the phone away Etc then our mind can expand into you know gosh why am I here you know uh what about my that thing my grandfather said to me or my grandmother said to me and you know that the ability to to place our perception in larger or smaller time bins seems very closely linked to all of this um and to the sense of mortality which we'll certainly talk about in a little bit but in in a kind of a practical way in the absence of a daily therapy session um how how do you suggest people start to segment um or um compartmentalize in a way that's functional for instance um should people set aside 15 minutes each morning to just think about why they're on this Earth uh and why they're doing and what they're doing as opposed to just doing sure well this is a central problem of our time is is um everybody is going to say I don't have time for that I had a colleague now deceased Maran Woodman in Toronto who used to say to her clients you have to guarantee me one hour per day that you reflect on your dreams or you you journal in terms of what's going on in your life and she said always people say I don't have time for that then she said then you you don't have time for therapy you don't you're not making any priority here for this and you're right the claims of you know woodsworth wrote and 1802 the world is too much with us getting and spending we lay waste our powers this is 1802 before the internet right with all of its claims upon us there's such a noisy Den around us we're all distracted by that you see that's why it usually takes a crisis in a marriage or depression or whatever the case may be to get people to pull out of that and reflect upon that so I spend 15 minutes every morning before starting uh just meditating particularly working on a dream if I've had a dream and and secondly I reflect on things in the evening too because one of the things we want to try to do is to say what are the stories I'm living here you know one of them I've got to earn a living one of them I've got to do this other one I have to do that you see but but what's all of that frenzy about you see that's why I think the first half of life and I say this semih humorously is a huge and unavoidable mistake because we're living just reactively you see it's not generative it's reacting to whatever is going on around us is one's entire life to be spent reacting to things now when you're young there's only so much ego strength to to reflect upon this a number of years ago I was asked to give a talk to an advanced group of uh college students at a university on the psychodynamics of love well they were all interested about love I can tell you right so it was a 3-hour seminar so over the first 90 minutes we talked about projection transference all these they got it they were smart kids and then we took a short break when we came back and I said now let's apply these ideas to your current or recent relationships it was like the curtain came down you know they were 1920 21 22 in that area they couldn't bear they could get the idea but they couldn't bear to look at themselves with that kind of scrutiny Flash Forward 20 years when they're 40 and their marriage just dissolved or um you know the the relationship has hardships of one kind or another they're much more likely to be able to a have enough ego strength to bear looking at oneself secondly um there's enough life experience to reflect upon because this kind of work takes courage in the first place I have to be able to Bear to look at myself and see what's there which won't always be pretty and and secondly it's humbling because this is not about feeling great it's about being called to accountability which is a whole different matter to be an adult is not just to have a big body it's it's to know that I'm accountable for what's spilling into the world through me you said once in one of those telling statements that haunts me in a constructive way he he said the greatest burden the child must bear is the unlived life of the parent so where I'm stuck as a person my children will be stuck or they'll be spending their life trying to get unstuck you see so the best thing I can do for them is to model for them you know a life lived with as much courage as I can mobilize and as much Integrity as I can manage and in doing that it not only models it gives permission to them um one of the things I found for many people they don't really feel permission to feel what they feel desire what they desire go out and fight for what matters to them because life we learn early is conditional you will be acceptable in this family you will perhaps be loved you'll be rewarded or you'll be punished if you meet these conditions and if you don't meet the conditions a lot of people put conditions on their on their children you know a lot of people are still living through their children um you know if you forgive the joke here there there's an old joke about Jewish Mothers the fetus is not considered full term until it's graduated from Medical School you see and that's an it's a joke about a cultural expectation and carrying someone else's unfinished business in a way in which you know is to make them feel good rather than serve what is one expression through you which is quite a different matter so one of the things one has to do is seize permission to realize life is short um we're we're here a very brief time and the summons is to live your journey as honestly as you can and when you do it ultimately serves other people it's not selfish it's actually serving the self if you will it's not narcissistic it's not self-absorption it's it's actually humbling I would never imagined as a child that I would spend my adult life listening to people's suffering and yet that's my day job and I'm humbled to be invited into the lives of other people it's profoundly meaningful I can't imagine living without that at the same time um it's not fun it's not pleasant but it's profoundly meaningful that's the distinction that's why of those very various sources of insight that we can have into our lives you have to ask about what is most meaningful to me as defined by the psychi not by the culture around you because what the culture says it's all about being successful it's all about making money it's about living in this neighborhood it's about buying that object and if that worked we would know it it obviously doesn't so that's what brings us back to that humbling moment that maybe I'm not living my life sir in k guard the Danish Theologian in Copenhagen the 19th century talked about a man who was shocked to find his name in the obituary column and he hadn't realized he died because he hadn't realized that he was here in the first place now this is a carard talking in the middle of the 19th century think about the ramping up of the stimuli around us the the steady drum among young people you take away their cell phone they experience enormous anxiety because this is their link to the world and yet it's constantly making demands upon them so again underneath all of this is we have an appointment with our own souls and the question is are you going to show up for the appointment and I thought I had but my psyche thought otherwise so it was in the midst of a serious depression that I began showing up and it was a a difficult process but ultimately proved to be I think transformative like I certainly agree that hardship for better or worse is often the way that these things stimulate the self-reflection that's required for change there seems to be a a tricky situation whereby on the one hand I'm hearing and I agree that it all starts with being very honest with oneself about what one really wants yeah and I love and thank you for mentioning this 15 minutes in the early part of the day perhaps ideally 15 minutes at the end of the day where one takes time away from input from others of any form electronic or otherwise to just reflect on what's inside and the messages coming up through dreams and reflection Etc uh so important um and and may I just add another pie forgive the interruption but I've often said to individuals it's not so much what you believe feel or do it's what it's in service to inside of you that's an important distinction so I may think I've done a good thing when it's really an old codependence or it's it's a way of avoiding conflict or it's a fear-driven response we have to always be asking but what was that in service to inside of me and you may not know at first but you keep asking the question it'll it'll it'll start you know rising to the surface you begin to recognize that that's how we begin to identify some of those internal drivers that we call the complexes because again they they're they clusters of energy with the power to create a provisional personality and many times people are identified with their complex that's who I am you know I am what I do I am my performance rather than beneath all of this is a human being who is wandering through life afraid of dying trying to avoid pain as much as possible and um hoping that someone's going to step in and make it all right I'm certainly familiar with the feeling of um recognizing what I want but being afraid that if I were to express that that it would not um would not be accepted certainly and that certainly can create problems um I'm also familiar with recognizing what I want and stating it very clearly and some people um fortunately respond in well but I think it's fair to say at least based on my experience that when we are really honest with ourselves and with others it doesn't always land well right I mean um I pay a lot of attention probably too much to U messaging on social media in the landscape of science and health it's just kind of the world I live in um much of the time these days uh and what i notic is that there's a real gravitational pull of people to um what's called the one whatever they are influencers public figures or that that are just very clear about who they are um at least in their own self-perception but then here in lies the the twist it seems is that what I'm hearing is that often our self-perception is not accurate that's correct and it's almost futile to try and convince people that we are who we believe we are right and I have a theory that's emerging it's not a formal theory that the internet and in particular social Med media are is borderline it weaves back and forth between sane and psychotic yes as if a borderline person would projecting either adoration or total disgust and I I warn anybody now including myself if you're going on social media you're interacting with a borderline organism so you need to be prepared to be told in various ways sometimes subtle sometimes overt that you're terrible and you also need to be prepared for immense reward and being told that you're spectacular simply by being there that's what it is to interact with a borderline person and there's no controlling or predicting their um their flips so um in any event that's a little uh you know Theory that's emerging why wouldn't it be that way right you're the psychologist but why wouldn't it be that way because ultimately social media is the emerging property of all these individuals um okay so You' made it clear how one way to Anchor to the self and get in touch with what's really going on inside yes reflecting on dreams reflecting on what guers to the surface journaling perhaps meditation ideally twice a day perhaps therapy as well would be ideal yes but then we move about our day and we do our best to be the best version of ourselves right and when we get positive feedback we tend to I think as you know neurobiological psychological organisms do more of that do more of that um uh and it's sort of a bank account of sorts we're going for a net positive balance um and we tend to do less of the things that give us negative feedback except perhaps or go to social media where people seem to go on there specifically for friction-based interactions as well which is its own thing so as we move through life first half of Life second half of Life how is it that we can Orient in time as I kind of put it before how can we um Carry Out These daily or weekly or maybe yearly Reflections in a way that really serves us well I mean do you recommend one day a week stepping away from everything do you recommend um doing Retreats of sort do you recommend that um people keep a life journal is the story and seeing how one's story EV evolves is this useful what I'm trying to do here is um kind of uh Orient people to some practical tools because um because I think at some level we can get pulled down currents of any kind that's right and ideally we we you know stay out of deep pathology but even if we hit the rumble strips and go back over and over again um this is this is important work right this is this is about being the best version of ourselves and Society benefits from that so are there more macroscopic things that we can do um or is it just a daily chip away two meditations ideally Therapy Journal and just anchor down um like do we ever get do we ever get to relax well of course of course um f first of all there's no formula it's applicable to everybody in their life circumstances you know the word Psychotherapy literally means from the Greek to listen to or pay attention to the soul however you go about doing that is right for you it's up to you to figure that out and for some people be working in nature for others to be working with their hands for others it'll be through some creative Enterprise or working with their dreams or meditating or or whatever um I would say whatever helps you step out of the stimulus response stimulus response melee that we call our daily life is likely to be helpful to you either because you rest and you restore the psyche and or you have some reflection upon it you you recollect yourself as it is right you remember the self because we get unraveled I often have the feeling of getting unraveled in life where you know this calls you and this calls you and this calls you and that calls you and you're just it's just pulling you away where from from some Center here and again this is not about self-absorption but if I'm not in connection with something abiding here my behaviors or choices there are not going to be very helpful in the long run you see they're going to be merely responsive to the demands of the environmental circumstances one thing I enjoy doing from time to time is drawing I like doing anatomical drawings and things of that sort and I find that if if I engage in an activity that absorbs all of my attention yes even though I have zero minus one aspirations of becoming a commercial artist or something of that sort that um two things happen one I exit the stimulus response world and at the same time it's inevitable that some insight comes later that's right what is that well I see I think that's a good example though as you said of exiting the stimulus response cycle because in that moment something in your psyche Rises to express itself through you and and you know it's your drawing it we we could perhaps read that drawing and and perhaps interpret something of it you know like the famous Roar shock for example I mean what Roar shock's an ink plot when's an ink plot not an inklot well when I confabulate a response to it you see and that response is indicative of what is going on inside of me so that's a good example I mean for some people you know they they have those moments when they're out jogging for example or riding a bicycle or or whatever whatever ever it does listening to music there's no right path for everyone it's like find the place where you're able to be alone with yourself and if you can tolerate being with yourself and you pay attention something will start coming up you see and and ultimately ironically that's the cure to the great disease of our time which is loneliness it's interesting that the UK and Japan now have cabinet level posts for ministers of loneliness so great is a lonely we've never been more connected in human history through our Electronic media and yet people are now isolated in their rooms talking to each other and I I saw a cartoon I probably New York or somewhere where a couple was getting married and the the minister says to the couple well text each other I do you know it was ultimately a joke about how we are so media dependent now that we're disconnected from each other and so whatever it is that helps you link to something in here you asked this question which I I'm also haunted by in a constructive way he said we all need to find what supports us when nothing supports us and that's ultimately the cure for loneliness that there's something inside of me that knows me better than me is is working hard to bring about a healthy response to whatever life brings and it has a purposefulness to it an intentionality an expression and when I'm in touch with that I feel that sense of wholeness and purposefulness when I'm out of it when I start unraveling so to speak and un just that's how how we get exhausted and burned out and so forth so again this is I use that word recollecting remembering it's like pulling the pieces back together again in some way so what Shakespeare said the um knitting the Ravel raveled sleeve of care you see he he was using the same metaphor of being unraveled in some way I love this notion of um spending time alone and accessing one's deepest resource for self-care as a way to deal with loneliness because ultimately I also completely agree that stimulus response is the Hallmark of of text messaging there can be useful sure aspects of text messaging of course coordinating plans Etc and communicating but but certainly social media it's a you know we have a stimulus response device some people think of it more like a slot machine but it never actually Returns the jackpot is the is the issue um and I also think that social media can be terrific for educating and learning as well um certainly much of what I do or strive to do I think time alone is incredibly beneficial so thank you for for highlighting that and and also that it doesn't take much you know maybe even a half hour that's right walk or something of that sort if I may what do you think happens when we exit that stimulus response mode do you think the unconscious mind is revealed a bit more to us um and I think of the unconscious mind um a a former guest on this podcast um a psychiatrist described the unconscious is kind of like the the the iceberg that's beneath the surface all the stuff going on that we're entirely unaware of do you think that the water recedes a little bit absolutely because there's no room for the expression of of of whatever is wanting to be acknowledged within us when we're constantly responding to our environmental demands um one of the things I try to do is walk a mile every day I've gone through some health issues in recent years and so I'm sort of in a physical recovery stage of life and I mock a mile day even though it's physically difficult uh and I find that revelatory because that's I I'm focused on being present here rather than all of the distractions there and that's one of the things that I have found a form of meditation if you will and what comes up for me is often surprising I've talked before in the podcast about meditation clinical hypnosis something called Yoga Nidra which is a self-directed relaxation sometimes call it non-sleep deep rest Etc and without taking us on a tangent um I I raise this because we keep talking about meditation and um I think to a lot of people meditation sounds like something esoteric to me as a neuroscientist meditation is a perceptual exercise it can be done to enhance focus by focusing on a specific location behind the forehead or looking at a a light it can be um an uh open monitoring meditation where you're intentionally not trying to focus on any one thing but it at the end of the day it's a perceptual ex it's it's a deliberate perceptual shift um much in the same way that if I decide to you know listen to an opera with my eyes closed that's a in some sense it's a meditation it's a deliberate perceptual shift um so a deliberate perceptual shift that we're calling a meditation which I think is a great label for it that is directly aimed at better understanding the UN one's own unconscious processing so that one can then lean into the stimulus response parts of life with more intentionality with less opportunity to hit the rumble strips or go into the gutter um with a more authentic response to it you see because it's more likely to be coming out of me rather than simply being reactive I think that's the important thing what's so important about what you're saying is that for years now we've heard about you know meditation being important as a way to uh intervene in the Ulus response process yes um and people say be responsive not reactive and it all sounds so wonderful just as sounding being gritty and resilient sounds wonderful but one of the things that's many really important here that you're raising is that there are methods to do this they almost always involve going inward or someone who can see what we can't see pointing out blind spots in us that's right well I I think again the issue is to still the traffic inside and be present to the moment in whatever way that is that's why I said a person can meditate by work of the hands or by walking or something that pulls one out of the the cycles that are running their their little script over and over and over so there are many forms of meditating and you know ancient Traditions have revealed that too there was walking meditation and so forth and you mentioned music I think that's another example to listen to music I think takes one out of you know nature said once without music Life's a mistake and I think what he was getting at was there is a sense in which music has no purpose except being itself so when we're really present to the music we were in the midst of being if I'm well we're at Spring right now as you and I are talking and it's beautiful in the neighborhood and so I've been watching the flowers emerge and so forth um and and simply being present to that means some of that other traffic is stilled and then I return and the traffic resumes but maybe I have a little more of a sense of who I am and from whence I'm responding you see as a result of that reentering process you know the the Zen folks talk about being no minded I think that it was their way of talking about being present to this moment but but not consumed by the demands of this moment and that's that's a difficult thing to manage but it's essential I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge one of our sponsors waking up waking up is a meditation app that offers hundreds of guided meditations mindfulness trainings yoga needer sessions and more I started meditating over three decades ago and what I found in the ensuing years is that sometimes it was very easy for me to do my daily meditation practice I was just really diligent but then as things would get more stressful which of course is exactly when I should have been meditating more my meditation practice would fall off with we piing up they make it very easy to find and consistently use a given meditation practice it has very convenient reminders and they come in different duration so even if you just have one minute or five minutes to meditate you can still get your meditation in which research shows is still highly beneficial in addition to the many different meditations on the waking up app they also have Yoga Nidra sessions which are a form of non-sleep deep rest that I personally find is extremely valuable for restoring mental and physical Vigor I tend to do a yoga NRA lasting anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes at least once a day and if I ever wake up in the middle of the night and I need to fall back asleep I also find Yoga Nidra to be extremely useful if you'd like to try the waking up app you can go to waking up.com huberman to try a free 30-day trial again that's waking up.com huberman perhaps we can talk about the shadow this notion of the shadow um sounds very ominous um what is the Shadow and are people aware of their shadows and if they're not how can they become aware of them and how can they work with them well a shadow was yung's metaphor for those parts of our own psyche and or our affiliation with groups for example whether it's a religious group educational group a national identity that when brought to Consciousness we find troubling perhaps contradictory to our values or um you know inimical to our sense of self-worth or something like that for example typical Shadow issues include our capacity for jealousy and for Envy for aggression for greed etc etc uh we don't want to acknowledge those things but since when are we exempt from The Human Condition the wisest thing ever said about the shadow came from the Latin playright Terrance two Millennia ago who said uh nothing human is alien to me now I think that's important to recognize in me I carry the entire capacity of human nature to express itself some of those forms of Expressions will be acceptable to the society or to my psychological culture and some will not be um and that's the shadow material and you know there's the personal Shadow and there are group Shadows because Nations can be possessed by Blood Lust For example or or a fashion is a shadow issue where everybody has to look the same way and dress the same way and so forth you know the more insecure I am as a person the more likely I'm going to try to look around me for what are the clues so I can fit in be be like others therefore I'll be acceptable you see that's not a federal crime that's a very deep complex that is left over from childhood I'm not here to fit in I'm here to be who I am which at times will fit in and other times it won't but that's okay okay because I'm at least in good relationships to my myself at that point so typically the shadow manifest as being unconscious therefore it just spills into the world through us a perfect example of Shadow issues as I mentioned before is parents expecting their children to grow up and have you know the same kind of values that I have for example same religious views marry somebody that I find acceptable etc etc well that's not really loving the otherness of the other is it it's not really loving the child for their own Journey that's them carrying some piece of their of their own unfinished business secondly uh we disown the Shadow by projecting on some you know those people across the border they're you know they're the carrier of they're they're what's wrong with this world you see I disown the shadow in myself by seeing it in everybody else around me Yung actually said what often we find troubling in another person is because they're they're expressing something within our own unconscious um you know as a certain itinerate Rabbi said two Millennia ago um I can see the speck in your eye but miss the log in my own that's a perfect illustration What The Shadow is thirdly one can get caught up in it that's at times what rock concerts are mass events people caught up in a mob mentality where you lose your sense of individual ego identity and become subsumed into a collective mood and you know that could be um a hanging mob for example as has happened in history too many times um and it could be a force for good or a force for evil but again the larger the group the lower the level of consciousness of the individuals in that group and then fourthly we recognize it in ourselves in a um speech at Yale University in 1937 Yung said a person who could look at their own shadow and own it he said now has large problem because they're no longer to blame others for what goes wrong in their life they they have to acknowledge that within themselves and he said further it's the single best thing you can do for your Society this is not Naval gazing this is how you lift your unfinished business off of your partner your children take it back yourself which is a loving thing to do and a civic-minded thing to do if you look at collectively here so how does one learn what their Shadow or Shadows well again if you're married ask your partner sure you know who will tell you immediately um what your unfinished business may be um or your children or your close friend perhaps um it shows up in dreams um you know Freud talked about a young man who's disowned what the content of his dream he says well I I don't you know fre said well whose dream do you think that was it was your dream you have to acknowledge that that was embodying something within you so um there are many ways to recognize the shadow often consequences pile up and then one begins to realize well the only consistent person in all the uh scenes of this drama I call my life is is mAh so I have to acknowledge that that's my stuff and that's a very humbling thing that's why I say this work is humbling not not uh inflating in some way it's humbling so um again shadow work is never going to be popular because it means I'm taking responsibility and yet what else would being human being who's responsible and adult like um do accept except responsibility you see it's one of the definitions I would say of an adult person is I I know I'm accountable for what spills in the world through me yes I'm responding to various things that happen around me but sooner or later I I'm the one bringing my stories my condition responses and something of my shadow to the mix and responding out of that now that's a witch's brew at times as you could imagine at the same time you recognize all right but that's my business to address because if I don't it just continues what I observe in the world and what I've experienced before is that um certainly we all have Shadow sides um me everybody I mean I think that's like I think anyone that doesn't believe that is uh perhaps not of homo sapiens um you know um maybe other animals have shadows too who knows um but that when Shadows Clash it becomes very confusing because um given what you're saying very few people address their shadows and these days especially there's no need to make this political this is just social sure um we see mobs forming as you said the larger the group the lower the level of Consciousness and then it becomes even more challenging to address one's Shadow when a there's the perception of an attack mhm B that attack often times is the reflection of the other group Shadow and C people find Refuge with people who have similar Shadow yes processes so it um not to be pessimistic here but um perhaps the answer is what you referred to before is to go inward to the self work with somebody or or um somebody close to you that that has your best interest in mind truly best interest in mind and then um try to resolve that well yes and very few people are willing to do that that's what polarizes societies polarizes groups and and so forth it's it's comforting to find like-minded people but then they're both caught in the same complex there's another way of putting that so ultimately whatever reality is it's going to wear through that and and reveal something that's uh going to be pretty disconcerting to individuals who who are caught in a collective identification that way you know the the shadow comes because our human nature is thrust into various social situations we can't help but have a shadow you know I we we have to socialize a child we learn to use a knife and a fork and not take our siblings food and that sort of thing you learn to look both ways for you cross the street there's socialization that's important and yet the greater the socialization the more likely there's going to be an interruption I mean think about those cultures where people are forced to dress alike for some form of unity or Conformity um um think think about where a person might have a special gift or talent but it's not appreciated in family X or Y well where does that natural form of expression go it pathologizes as depression or it comes out in compensatory dreams or projections onto someone else or or it makes the person ill you know the unlived life can make a person ill there's a sickness under death as kard talked about it you know it's it's uh it's that sickness where where the human spirit is being being repetitively violated and much in our culture violates our spirits and and spirit is not something you will it's something that that is the quickening of life's energy and service to something and if your family or your situation imposes itself upon that uh to give a quick example my my own family of origin was one in which they were by the circumstances of decades ago unable to to attain an education my father worked in a factory my mother was a secretary and um for them life was a series of shaming events and um overwhelming events and the message to me both over and covert is don't go out there it's it's too too big it's too much stay here and we'll take care of each other so one of the first things I did when I was 18 was left I went to college and came back for vacations but but I left psychologically at that point I something in me knew that I had to have a larger life than that and I say that with love and respect and compassion for my parents the last conversation I had with my mother before she died of cancer um her ancestor her father she'd never known was from Sweden and I'd had a book translated into Swedish and I told her I thought that would be something that would be nice for her and and she was horrified it's like why have you written it what are they saying and I thought she meant reviewers at first and I realize that's the voice I heard in childhood she was saying you shouldn't be out there now people are going to attack you this will draw attention to you you see and her intention was protective in her last days actually before she died she was more afraid of what people thought than whether her son was living his journey or not and I say this with grief for her and and that was the message of childhood you know it's too much out there and yet something inside quickened and said well you need to go where those airplanes are going you need to go see the ocean for yourself um you need to try to live in a foreign country and see what that's like um was I was that easy no it was doubly hard because of the messages I had but it was just necessary sooner or later again the appointment with your life do you keep it or you not keep the appointment so that was the first meeting of the appointment was to to leave home and start the journey you know in terms of the the archetype of the of the journey first is the departure and then you have the initiatory experiences which can knock you down and then the question is do you get up and go to the next one and sooner or later something begins to change inside and you begin to feel that this is this is the journey that's right for me it's very moving to hear because I you know we hear with that we become our parents M and yet I've never believed that um I believe that um for whatever reasons inside us that we either adopt their traits unconsciously or consciously or we resist them 180° in the other direction MH there doesn't seem to be a 90° response that's as as your example beautifully illustrates that there's something in the brain and in the human psyche that either says yeah okay like that's just the way life is um For Better or Worse um or says no and you know I feel I'm 48 years old so I'm still learning to be a full adult um um I like to think there's some neuroplasticity left science tells us there's neuroplasticity throughout the lifespan so and I do believe that um but I feel like so much of being an adult perhaps just being a human being is about learning to stand one's ground and say no no no no that's me and this is what's right for me and you're wrong crazy or just different and we agree to dis agree and then there's the other half of being an adult which is saying oh goodness you might be right maybe you are right okay you're right I screwed up or I need to think at least think about this differently and and the hard work of being a human I think is knowing when you are dealing with incoming messages that are real they could be from a healthy Source or an unhealthy Source it's complicated this is why I mentioned this thing about the internet and social media in particular earlier I do believe it's borderline I think if you were to remove the names and the um faces and you would just put that into a a a script you'd say this is a dialogue coming from a borderline person weaving back and forth across the line literally of healthy and psychotic and so as a human especially nowadays it's complicated um we don't just live in little Villages where we go okay well that person tends to kind of you know spin off and that person seems very grounded but occasionally makes mistakes too you know um and so I feel like so much of the work of being a I said an adult but I I'm going to replace that with just a human is trying to know thyself right as the Oracle said and own thyself and and report that into the world but also to be semi-permeable and in a way that's functional is such hard work because in both cases the adoption of what we were told and what was ingrained in us and is unconscious so that we just live out the script of our parents or where we say no I'm I'm going to leave this little town or I'm not going to live life or relationships that way at all I'm going to do it this other completely different way maybe unconventional way both have an element of reactivity in them and cly both have an element of um kind of uh um there's like a there's a Vigor behind it sure no your your point is very well taken and and appropriate because it is a paradox first of all in the Eden Project a book I wrote on relationship and subtitled the search for the magical leather there is inside of us this infantile and understandable desire to find the right person who's going to make our life work for us who's going to take care of us meet our needs read our minds etc etc you see and the other person has that going on in them so they project that on to us you wonder why relationships get so complexed you see but the great gift of relationship if you can tolerate it is the otherness of the other produces the dialectic produces the the enlargement that comes from encountering the other I've learned so much from my my wife and I believe she's learned a few things from me uh our ongoing dialogue because we're both similar and very different at the same time is one that has at times been conflictual naturally but most the time is a pattern of growth because we we are allowed to bring in that other perspective and see the same reality my my my wife has taught me to see some things that I wouldn't have seen before because she's has an artist's eye on the other hand there are places where you have to come up as you said against what is Central and critical to your own well-being or your own integrity and then you have to stand for that and the wisdom to know which is which at any given time is is not in bred it's it's one of those times where we have to find that balancing point between legitimate dialogue and compromise and sacrifice in a relationship there's a place for sacrifice but at the same time there's a place where you have to say all right but I also so have to separate myself here and and stand for this on the other side of that and you know it takes a solomonic wisdom to know always what's right but over time I think one can get a sense of of what that's about so you know again that's why we we have to individuate as individuals by definition but also in relationship because it's the otherness of the others that pulls us out of that self-referential system otherwise we get caught you know in a circular dialogue among our complexes for example as y said it's important to go to the Mountaintop to meditate but if you stay up there too long you'll be talking to ghosts you know your your complexes will be caught in this this looping cycle and you need the other to pull you out of that into the presence of the other and it's out of that that the third comes um Joseph camel made an important distinction once he said about committed relationship he said if you're constantly sacrificing to the other um you'll grow resentful but if you're sacrificing to the project the two of you've launched to together as a friendship or a marriage or whatever form it takes you can do that in a very constructive way you're fed by that because you're you're you're mutually committed to the project that this relationship represents and that's an important distinction I think yeah given that 50% or more of marriages seem to end in divorce these days I think that statistic still holds um do you think that can be largely attributed to uh people not arriving to those relationships with the mindset you just described people not arriving to those relationships having um a deep enough understanding of themselves prior to that or um something else I think all of the above um first of all young people tend to marry and make babies understandably um um and then 20 years later in some way they're a different person and it's very hard for the premises that brought them together to still obtain in a Developmental and honest way you know many years later when you reach that point then there is a time for renegotiation or if need be unfortunately the dissolution of that relationship um because I had a colleague in New Jersey years ago who worked exclusiv with the couples and she she talked about starter marriages and she said I would never say that publicly because that sounded too pessimistic but she said if you're lucky your starter marriage will be a good one that will evolve and so forth but for most people that which brought them together was running from their parents or replicating their parents' relationships or uh their their insecurity about themselves therefore they bonded with someone else who was going to take care of that for them whatever it was it's been outlived their their own natural development their life circumstances have changed and then it brings about you know the necessity of some very difficult decisions so you know marriage marriage is an institution with the best of intentions that is sorely tested over time and you know sometimes it'll survive the test in I I would not automatically applaud if someone's been married 50 or 60 years I would ask what has happened to the soul of that person in that relationship has it grown has it developed did did they mutually support each other's growth and development or did something get stuck at that point and um our our early family of origin Dynamics still dominating that relationship and from the outside we usually don't know the answer to that question but inside you'd have to say what what has happened to this person and the same is true with parenting you know parenting is very very difficult because we'd like to think we know what's right for our own child but then they have to spend a good part of their life trying to get away from us in some way as we did ourselves you see and then you if you remember that then you're a little more likely to say you know I really don't know what's going on here but I have to pay more attention to what I think is wanting expression through my child and and support that rather than assuming that they're going to grow up and replicate our lives and our values as I've said before given the number of people who do deep introspective work either by themselves or with a trained professional it's perhaps should surprise us that 50% of marriages do survive yeah in a in a way yes and and those that survive are not necessarily good marriages in the sense in which the person is growing and developing they may be stuck they may be afraid of the Alternatives they may be Bound by economics for example or or cultural forms so again from outside you don't know what's happening inside the soulle of that individual and it's very important for us to not judge them for that reason earlier you you described the the painful work sometimes painful work of really addressing what one wants and really getting in touch with one's Soul psyche um and how Society or we think Society might not approve of that and yet when I think about popular culture um often times it's the people that seem to be living in their own truth that are most celebrated that's true like there's something about the the crowd I've shifted from Mob to crowd here to make it sound more benevolent but but it's still a mob that cheers on the person who really seems to be in their we say full expression or living in their truth but who just comes out and says like yeah I don't I don't really care what they're saying about me or what people think I know me I know my own goodness my own intention my own um Mission and the people close to me do hopefully they have people close to them and we say yeah like go it's inspiring yes that's why I said earlier many of the people in history that we would admire had difficult lives but we admire them because they stuck to some value that was Central to who they were and they lived that maybe at Great cost but they live that through whatever suffering they had to to trans to experience um again from outside we don't know do we when we see some cultural figure out there uh may maybe they're manipulative may maybe they're caught in a complex of some kind we don't know from outside you you have to say I mean one of the Shadow issues how often people will live through a celebrity or live through a pop figure in some way maybe imitate that person uh again for a child that's natural and normal on the other hand uh sooner or later you have to say but my journey is a different Journey maybe they're living there has been in my living mind and I don't mean this in any grandiose way I don't mean that they have to go out and become something that's noted in the society but to live in accord with something that is wishing its its U expression through us that's why I said the final question in life is is what is wanting to live in this world through me rather than what do I want or what do my complexes want because they're noisy chatterers in there you know I had a a dear friend from another state right to me just yesterday and um he's in semi-retirement now and he's been dealing with some health issues and uh he said now that I'm not distracted I have time to work on all the Goblins of the past that I left behind and he's an analyst so it's not like we get rid of these things they're lifelong this is why Yung said we can't solve these things but we can outgrow them there's a big difference you know you become larger than what happened to you for example you become larger than that voice inside of you that says you can do this but you can't do that um and over time you know something inside of you is wishing that growth and pushing that and again pathologizes when that's blocked so so people can be doing all the right things is defined by their values and their environment and it violates something inside that's why we can be quote successful and Achieve things and it still feels empty there's no there there you know you get to the top of the ladder and you realize there's no there there and that happens so often in our culture um I I remember one of the um fiscal figures in the late 20th century who had a personal Fortune of $400 million and he was asked what was his philosophy of life and he said well at the end of life the person with the biggest pile wins and I remember thinking how infantile is that this was a smart man and Elder Statesman in his field ultimately went to prison because of some things um but that's the philosophy of the sandbox I have the biggest pile of sand I've won no you haven't won your debt and it's a pile of sand what are you talking about and yet this is what drove the man's life and obviously drove him across enough lines that it got him into legal troubles sooner or later and again I say that without judgment I'm just saying here is an example of a very achieved person who's been living an infantile philosophy and as such something else causes him to pay greatly for that yeah I certainly can say that um despite having pursued work with a lot of vigor and career that without question friendships and relationships are the most important thing there's just no question right the uh especially when things get hard that's right you know I I actually I actually have a list in this very book I won't flip to it now of the people that I'm just really blessed to call close friends like real friends that you can count on and to me it and I've always in my sister I have an older sister and she always said you've always been a pack animal I've always had uh U big groups of of biggish groups of friends and it's something I've invested in heavily sometimes to the expense of other things um including work and other relationships but um but the notion that um yeah the material things or that the uh opinions of strangers would somehow fill us that to me is like the most foreign concept sure like that's that's the the most foreign concept but um but clearly some people operate on those metrics that's like of course and my guess is that they have a a um a a reward Horizon that is you know tacked to whatever it is the algorithms are that get them that thing and so it must feed some reward mechanism that hasn't distracted enough like locked into this one mode of time perception you know just hit the mile Mark hit the mile Mark hit the mile Mark so that they're not aware but when you take somebody like that who's been doing that for a lifetime and you say wait you know you're on this track going around and around and AC crewing trophies but actually that track doesn't go anywhere doesn't lead you into the world that's right my guess is that they they just they've been doing it so long that they're like an animal that's just been you know digging a trench and in its Zoo confined sure cage which is something I'm finding with a lot of the men that I see uh I happen to see right now in my practice uh several men between UH 60 and8 80 and uh one 82 um and of course they've been conditioned to work and then suddenly you know on Monday morning you have to stop and think who you are you get up and you go to work and you do what you've done all these years and then suddenly you don't do that what are you going to do you say well I'm going to go play golf every day well okay go do that but typically within three or four months the depression comes and they'll think about well I need to get back into doing this or get doing that you see so often we find people defined by exactly that kind of mentality I've finished the first lap so what do I do run another lap and run another lap and you realize you keep coming back to the same starting point that's why I say it's not what you do it's what it's in service to inside that makes a difference so is that person being successful by external standards yes whatever that means does that mean that their psyche is going to cooperate and give them that genuine sense of s atisfaction in something no it won't it's autonomous it's not going to get co-opted into that and soon or later you know chickens come home to roast and then you have a depression as I experienced and and or you you find your relationships are in tatters all around you so sooner or later I mean no Revelation on my part nature will Express itself and if uh if we live long enough and then everything that we've pushed underground is be is going to be coming up you mentioned men in particular so now it probably be a good time to um ask about men in particular you wrote Under Saturn Shadow which is how I initially learned about your work and then I listen to some of your lectures online I'm still in the process of reading your um other books but um let's talk about archetypes stereotypes of men and women um with the intention of course of um better understanding what's real as opposed to what's stereotype um so in the um let's call it the 1930s 40s 50s 60s view of men in the United States and elsewhere there was this notion of kind of like the stoic uh and work and um uh Duty and um and to some extent a fair amount of Mystique right like it wasn't really because with um fewer words uh we have less awareness at least of what people are saying who knows what they're thinking whether don't they talk a lot or not um but there was this idea of of the um the male as somebody who did stuff maybe thought about it but didn't really talk about it much um nowadays things have changed um this is born out in the statistics on College campuses about how many people seek therapy um if they have an issue it's gone from like 15% to 85 plus% at least roughly in the statistics I've seen so um but in terms of males and their sense of Duty and how they're supposed to be in the world um I would think just the way I just laid out the little you know by all admittance like just very Antiquated now view of maleness um that they would be thinking a lot about what's going on it would meet some of the daily practices that you talked about earlier um that there would be reflection that there would be um Consciousness there would be um uh an understanding of one's Shadow or if one were to add in the the other stereotype that went with it that they drink a lot right that was very much I'll remember my first I went to graduate school first at Berkeley before I shifted to a different place um and I was told when I got there that it used to be that the faculty and graduate students of which at that time in the 1970s and 60s was mostly male mostly now that's changed fortunately right that they would meet every day after work to drink and then stagger home to their Partners every day and I was shocked like are you kidding me I was like no every single day so you know the the idea here is that um that was the old view now things are very different but what about the work of men men and boys to try and understand their own psyche better what what is the uh what are the things that are specific to them that you've talked about and then we'll turn to women and then uh we'll we'll do our best to bridge The Divide in a conversation well um Ju Just to go back to our our earlier conversation for a moment you know why would those men have to drink every day and the answer is because there was some deep pain that they had to anesthetize of which they were by and large unaware or presumably they would have the opportunity to address whatever that was um you know and I'll come back to that in a moment I've been asked often to speak about men by women's groups and by the way men's groups have never asked me to talk about women right is that right that's right you know individuals such as yourself but it's it's mostly women's groups have asked me talk about those strange creatures called men and I say imagine these three things first of all that you cut away all your close friends the women that you share your worries about your marriage with about your children about your body your love life or lack thereof you know those people are gone forever there's no one you can share that with secondly um you have to sever your link to whatever your guiding Source may be you call it your instinct or your intuition whatever it is that's that's cut off it's not acceptable and thirdly your value as a human being will be defined by your meeting abstract standards of productivity as defined by total strangers in your culture and sooner or later no matter how much you win today you'll wind up a loser and the thing is you hold that off as long as you can so keep running all right and women hear that and they think well that's horrible that's horrible how lonely that would be how isolating that would be and of course it is it's self- arranging you know my my poor father was pulled out of the e8th grade sent to to work in the factory worked all of his life in that factory and and by the standards of his day he was a good man he supported his family he didn't run away he he accept the responsibility but I also know he didn't live his own soul I know that and I had Clues here and there and I even saw that as a child um and and so when I started to reflect on men I I realized I had my own inhibitions about that and I was fortunately enough as a therapist I would say all right what would you say to someone who expressed these inhibitions I would say all right there there's some some fears here that you're defending yourself against what's that about so I thought and then I had a voice in me that said but these are secret you don't talk about it then I thought well that's my duty isn't it I have to bring some of those things up and so that's what led to the writing of the book under s Shadow and um I suggested a number of those Secrets One is men's lives are much as much governed by role expectations as women's lives are less so today but in the past they were Ironclad right um and they the net effect of those roles was self- arranging you know you are your function you are your duties um men's lives are governed by fear-based responses and there's a certain level of competitiveness that is essential to to men's culture women learn through the years probably out of necessity to cooperate and support each other um and and they can get through difficult things by doing that for for men it's you're always having to demonstrate your competency in one area or another and the one thing you don't want to do is be a loser you see it's a zero sum game winners and losers and um ultimately there's a deep deep uh longing for well there's a fear of the feminine socalled that can include the feminine within hence men's estranging themselves from themselves I had a client many years ago who was sent into therapy by his wife saying you know either you go to therapy or I'm out of here so he was there very reluctantly and he walked in and he saw a box of uh tissue there a Kleenex box and he he just kind of sniffed at that without saying anything and I knew exactly what he was saying but I acted like I didn't and he thought I'd missed the clue and so he pointed the box and sniffed again and I I said what what's this about and he said well you had a woman in here before don't you I'm not going to be needing that and I said you know every man has a a lake of Tears inside of himself and a mountain of anger in there and I said sooner or later and he said no no we have other better ways of dealing with that and I thought well our prognosis is not very good here he he left after about five sessions because it was just going to ask more than he was capable of so there's a fear of the feminist like I have to be so much in my masculine mode of combativeness or competitiveness or expression of Competency I can't afford anything that one would undo my my shaky hold on that wheresoever you see Macho Behavior you see fear-based overcompensation is what it amounts to right you know saber ring rattling is is always a fear-based response and and underneath there is a very deep longing you know for the wise father for for the the person you could see some modeling from who would teach you something who would share with you wisdom he's learned along the way and so you know the condition of modern men and things have changed a great deal and I think partly stirred by the um revolution in in in the history of women you know and and their courage in addressing these stereotypes about what a woman is and what she's supposed to do with her life um required men to start looking at themselves as well so women have done us a great favor not always recognized by men but um you know in both cases you have to say all right the message you have from family of origin and culture may or may not work for you but you're here to in a certain way deconstruct you know those expectations and and find your own path you see uh the Spanish analist Irene Deo not long decease now talked about the difference between focused awareness and defuse awareness and I think rather than talk about gender which is a social construct coming out of this culture or this culture or this culture talk about those are two different modes of orientation to the world and we need both we need focused awareness that's gold directed behavior that is historically associated with the masculine and we also need this awareness of context and of relationship so this focused awareness without relatedness leads to sterility and isolation and on the other hand too diffuse without a sense of directed and purposeful Behavior you know means that one is just sort of fumbling one's way through life too I've always said to women in therapy you know to be a man is in a sense your requirement is to know what you want and to do it but you have to do that too in what y called the Animus that is to say the so-called inner masculine or the inner focused awareness and that gold directed behavior is what moves your life forward in a purposeful way but for men it's it's about becoming aware of again context and relatedness what happens if I have the biggest pile of sand at at the end of my life well you know obviously you can't take it with you but in the end it's only sand money is only money what was your life about that's the question women have to ask that men have to ask that and sometimes the culture is supportive in that process sometimes it's opposed to that and and then that's when you have to engage in a fight men and women have a you know a common summons here and they can be very supportive of each other as well as you know celebrate their differences and recognize um you know as men are beginning to recognize if you don't address what's going on inside of you you're you're going to be uh simply a creature of adaptation and you're going to lose your way sooner or later um when I came back from my training in Zurich in the 70s um I would say my practice was 90% women and 10% men today it's the reverse 90% men I don't put out a shangle and say I see men or women I I see both but uh I think again it's the change is in men now they they recognize they're lost in some way the old masculine definitions are no longer applicable you know a lot of this happened with the Industrial Revolution where Fathers and Sons work together in the same trait if you were a Tanner you tanned you know if you were a carpenter you you built houses if if you were a Shepherd you you know worked with a sheep and so forth um and you sort of learn who you are from your rubbing shoulders with the father well well today men go away to the factory or go away to the office and Sons are at home with their mothers you know and they're female School teachers and so forth and so there's again this deep hunger for the initiatory Father the the the the supportive father in traditional cultures where there were rights of Passage they recognized the importance of separating the boy at puberty in a simpler culture yes but at puberty it wasn't initiated by the personal father or relatives it was by the elders in the tribe often wearing masks or painted faces because they were archetypal forces they were not the neighbor down the street it was like you're in the hands of the Gods now and they require you to leave home and we're going to teach you things but we're also going to bring about some forms of isolation and suffering for you so begin to realize that you have within you the resources to undertake this journey what we have now is is a whole culture of uninitiated males who haven't left home psychologically speaking you know in the past they were simply governed by masculine roles and now as those of dissolved for many men um there there's very little sense of well what does it mean to be a man what am I supposed to do as as a man and the answer basically is go live your life find find your path find the courage and resolve and resources to to sustain that over time but you know how to do that is there's no model for that it's it's you have to sort of find that your yourself you see and that's what brings people into therapy at times and it's interesting that I have right now this collection it's consonant with my own stage of Life Journey too of of I only have one man under 50 and all the others are interested in how you deal with aging and mortality for a good reason and they're also dealing with how do I Define myself other than my work and and that's where the unlived life often is coming back back in a very useful way all right although there are some things that have left and not coming back in terms of the changes in the body and that sort of thing but basically now is the time to address this emotional developmental spiritual life that is to say do you have any concept of a story that's larger than the stories of your complexes you see doesn't mean one has to be part of a religious group it means that you have to question what quickens the spirit in me what stirs me inside what touches me where do I encounter the numinous and the the word numinous means there's something there that that causes this reaction within me so if you and I walk into an art museum let's say and you're touched by a particular painting and and frightened by it or moved to Tears by it or whatever and the other person walks by and is indifferent which is a right well it's not right or wrong it's this here it correlates with something in here that's what caused that resonance and that resonance is your engagement with something numinous for you you don't have to know it or explain or whatever but you have to Value it and ask what is it that was touched in me and if it doesn't speak to me um Duty or convention or expectations insufficient to make it happen we can't will these things to be numinous numinosity is something that's defined by one soul and not by the collective that's for sure and women and men in time I think will find that they have very similar goals in their life and that's how to balance my journey with the legitimate commitments of relationship on the other side and that that's why we have that wonderful word sacrifice you know not surrender sacrifice is fer to Sacred sacrificer to make sacred if you're sacrificing on behalf of a value that is right for you and for your project together then you're both served by that on the other hand and you don't sacrifice the Journey of the individual Spirit too and again it's about balancing that as best one can and there's very little in our culture that rewards that but then the price is again the symptomatology that comes from to the surface and from a psychodynamic standpoint we don't say well how quickly to get rid of the symptoms we say why if they come what are they asking of me that's why as I I said my first question in therapy was how quickly did I get rid of this depression get back on the road you know the careerism road right and and I came in time to realize it was my psyche saying you're on the wrong path fella you don't know it's not so much that it's wrong it's just not right for you there's a big difference here and you're going to have to find a different kind of conversation in your life and so forth and during my training I was obliged to you know do my um clinical experience I was working in a psychiatric Hospital in uh New Jersey and sometimes I was shuttling back and forth the same day between the psychiatric hospital a locked word in the in the University campus and I came to realize the conversation in the hospital was more real somehow it was more more about things that mattered and that's what began to to you know further my resolve to move from Academia to being a a therapist you know working therapist and and and so forth so it it the point is I need to add this my way of responding to the family of origin and social context stuff was to retreat into the life of the mind I didn't realize that's what I was doing at the time that's why the psyche had to reach up and Pull Me Under And um then I came to realize that the fears that I had in childhood were the ones I had to face at midlife the difference being I was bringing the adults capacity to the table that was not present to the child so quick example in my first week working in the psychiatric hospital I was signed to a kind of grizzled old ex-military guy who was the my mentor and without asking me he took me into an autopsy it was his you know let's initiate the new kid kind of thing you know well I realized it was a test so I stayed cool and so forth all the while I'm seeing this human body you know cut up and so forth in a radical way and and I realized all that I had fled in childhood was right there on the table before me and it continued to perseverate in my dreams and so forth and I I was back in Zurich in my own analysis and I talked about this and my analyst said quite rightly he said when you've dealt with your fears the fears of others will not be so threatening to you cu the the closed W I was in was at times violent and so forth and was not a pleasant situation but I could feel my own sense of purpose and gravitas in that situation after that so it's like you can run but you can't hide sooner or later what you've avoided will show up in your behaviors or your blockage in your behaviors so it doesn't go away it goes somewhere I'd like to just hover a bit on this idea that um you know on the one hand our work is to understand ourselves and what really feeds our soul um and to try and live that forward as much as possible in a benevolent way one would hope and on the other hand anytime we are in the relational aspects of life in particular romantic relationship as we sort of framed it here yes um because I think with friendships and work relationships oftentimes it can align with the self in a different way um and it's our work to try and as you said sacrifice to to sacrifice one for the other one for the other in a way that over time allows both to not just persist but grow and I'm also thinking about what you said earlier which was you know we should be cautious about immediately applauding the 50-year marriage because often times there's a a soul death in one or both people um and that we don't want to celebrate that and yet there's something pretty impressive about a 50-year marriage as as a um if for no other reason as an endurance event but we have to be cautious about rewarding endurance events like that because in as much as they sound to be about love I mean there's also the endurance event of the person that was a stock broker for 50 years and got to the end and then walked out of the stock exchange or stepped out from behind the computer monitor and went oh wow I missed a lot that's right so um there's no handbook for this of you know you spend 15 minutes here and 30 minutes there ratio of 2 to one children absorb energy and when there health or other issues in a relationship then then you know energy goes you know as well um so what's the you know what's how does one guide the rudder I mean uh does it require third- Party Support I mean I mean I've often thought this that because we evolved presumably in small villages where there was support that at closer proximity than perhaps we have now um people that know both individuals and have the best uh uh in mind for both um and for the collective I mean is there the idea that like every romantic couple should have a third- party trained counselor to guide them seems like not a bad idea although I think people are pretty resistant to that and of course it takes resources which is always an issue sure sure well there's nothing wrong with having the third party conversation from time to time that's for sure we have to remember that what we call therapy is a relatively modern invention um how was that addressed before you're right at the Village level uh when people were living in um vit vitalized mythological systems they had a sense of relatedness to the Cosmos first of all who are the gods what whether do we go when we die what's this life about in other words every tribe had its story secondly what is our relationship to Nature and to live in harmony with that nature as opposed to violating it repeatingly for our own purposes thirdly who to whom do I belong who is my tribe who are my people and is that a life serving or a life supressing experience and fourthly is the mystery of individual journey by what lights do I conduct my journey and so forth and of course those mythological systems were not particularly interested in the development of the individual but they're certainly about the individual being subsumed into the the tribal experience at least you have a sense of belonging erode that and people fall out of that into the abyss of the self as it were um you put it this way he said you know PE people walked off the medieval Cathedral into the abyss of the self in one of his letters you see and it became a cultural contrivance with the best of intention to help people find their path and deal with whatever their psyche's reaction to you know again typically not always but typically what brings people to therapy is that their belief system or their conventional practices are no longer working for them I had a client from Houston once who said in his AA group their slogan was this isn't working for me but I do it very well that pretty much um summarizes the first step of going into 12st step is that recognition that's right and then uh you know 12st step of course provides so much more but applicable to all of us you know our our our practices sooner or later will often because they're driven by these stories that we carry INTC psychically uh they don't work for us but we've learned to do them with certain facility and so forth and that's when the discrepancy becomes so difficult then one has to to face the you know the the fire so to speak then what matters is how am I to conduct my life in the face of these circumstances which I'm not able to solve in the old way and that's the adventure and that's the challenge and at the same time it's intim to to many people understandably so sooner or later again one has to say is this your life or is it someone else's most people are not living their life sadly they're living reactively they're living whatever the stories were and I put stories not in the sense that they're so conscious as such as they are representing whatever message we internalized and produced a splinter narrative again when triggered it has the power to to govern our behaviors it's why again you start with your own patterns and say where did this come from I wasn't born with it pattern is something that is replicating itself as a result of this story spilling into the world so you know what what I learned in my own life was I had put so much of my emotional distress up in the world of the life of the mind which was rich inv valuable I don't repudiate that but it was too one-sided and what I had to do was come back and face what was on the operating table in that Psychiatric Hospital the world of repressed emotion fears etc etc it's like both are true now see if you can honor both of them and when you do something grows and develops within you to respond to that in a new way so we've been covering a lot of human universals and things that everybody should think about and address we talked a bit about things more or less specific to men um what about women what what are some of the um unique psychic challenges that um that they face and need to address in specific ways sure well first of all each woman has to examine what was the message given her by her family by her mother her family extended family expectations and role models and cultural setting and so forth and say is is this something that supports my personal growth and development or not I mean that's a kind of inventory men have to ask that same question as well um we we have to acknowledge that biological differences suggest if you're a woman you're the one who's going to be carrying that baby and still in our culture the major responsibility for it while shared by father and mother hopefully still is something you have to attend and many women are trying to have it both ways as we know the the career development and and being a parent at the same time I saw a survey some years ago that um a large number of women Executives all at M mbas and had all achieved you know like vice president status or something in their corporation when at asked around age 50 would you do this all again almost 100% said no it cost too much from me it cost me too much they felt something else was missing they they felt friendship was missing they felt intimacy was missing in many cases they felt parenting was missing or it had gotten short shrift you see um as as men often face when they look at retirement they you know as the old saying you on your deathbed you say GE I wish I spent more time with the office you know it's like I wish I'd done this or that I know a few scientists who to this day say that they plan to die in their office it's always a sad thing for me to hear this yeah I also know their children in many cases and that's uh about four fifths of the time is not a good picture that's right yeah and uh again not all right this four fifths but um because other colleagues are spectacular parents but I grew up with the children of a lot of academics and a lot of times it ain't the pretty picture that's right so I I think that um another thing that men in our time really need to learn is if you're in a relationship part of your role is supporting the growth and development of your partner and the more insecure the man the more threatened he will be by that because she might go off in some other direction you see um and that means sharing household duties and sharing child care and so forth forth which you do to the best of your ability having a child and having two careers requires an enormous amount of juggling as we as we all know but you can do it in good faith with the best of intentions if not resentment builds and one-sidedness build so I I think for for women they still need a partner that will buy into the notion of genuine reciprocity in our responsibility to each other and to our our work together which includes child rearing uh without which women are unduly burdened you see unfairly burdened and I don't think we've solved that one yet I think that's still open-ended in the in the culture at this point on the other hand it's it's stunning to see women grab hold of the opportunities available now uh I'm living in a retirement community as of a year ago and so many of the women that I've had din with my my wife and I have dinner with various people have said well when I was at this stage women were not allowed to do this one woman was a scientist and she said I just wasn't recognized in the physics World until like late in my life and you forget how recently that was the case I mean that was that was a deep violation of the human Spirit Well it was routine and so many of the women that I see there who are going to be over 70 most of them are over 80 live lived in a world that was not unlike a segregated world you know just as you know I grew up where segregation was practiced by half of this country it's not so long ago somewhat hard to Fathom um how much things have changed and yet also how much things persist that's right that's right well and you know the 60s happened and what this what happened to the 60s is a a a kind of re Resurgence From Below in both men and women some men and some women to overthrow the sort of oppressive nature of role definitions and so forth you know I mean you couldn't think of marrying a person uh in another religion for example you couldn't think of marrying someone of A different race I mean it was the price of that meant you had to go live in anonymously in the city somewhere or you couldn't be gay for example uh the love that dare not speak its name as it was called um all of that's been radically challenged and rightly so and and yet what that does is bring about a world of great Freedom greater freedom but also ambiguity you know if this isn't right well but what's this and what's that and people are troubled by ambiguity and so therefore there's there's always a reactive uh nature in in some individuals who are fighting that you see so again it shows up in very ious issues of of racism whether we have abortion or not or whatever the social issue may be lot of what's playing out there is the traditional role definitions versus a sense of the autonomy of the individual to live his or her journey you say I'd like to shift a bit to discussions of pathology or um asserted pathology nowadays I think thanks again to social media um or no thanks to social media um there's a lot of use of psychological terms M narcissism projection um gaslighting clinical diagnosis I mean I I admittedly took the liberty of saying that I as a non-clinician view the the landscape of a lot of social media as as borderline and I have no credential to be able to diagnose an individual let alone the internet but so I'll be clear about my limitations um whenever possible but there are real pathologies of the of the psyche of the mind yes um I'd be curious about your view of the ones that tend to capture people's um attention the most you know I mean uh I think we Now understand some of the neurochemical basis of certain CH psychiatric challenges schizophrenia bipolar in particular OCD particular sometimes by way of which medications they respond to or don't um but that alone doesn't allow us to understand their underlying mechanisms I think a lot of that is still mysterious but I'd love um to get a different perspective on these things which is the psychological perspective which um of course Embraces biology but um looks at it a little bit differently so um yeah what what are your thoughts about the way that these days um these words are slung and um and what's your view about our actual treatment for these uh for these conditions both for the people suffering from them and the people that suffer because others suffer from them yeah well you're asking me to speak both as a therapist and as a citizen I think and I'll address the first one first um part of the therapist's role is to differential diagnosis in other words if a person comes in with a depression we have to try to Define what kind of depression are we talking about there different kinds of depression is this a reactive depression it's only pathological if it lasts too long or lasts interferes with their normal functioning too much and that's a judgment call if a person's grieving the loss of something important in their life the loss of a marriage would say it's appropriate to feel uh depressed for a certain length of time until life's ches move one forward and so forth there is um um biologically driven depression which can be approached with medication although many of the anti-depressants are very limited in their success long-term therapy tends to be more effective as various Studies have recognized albeit there's a you know an economic cause to that and then thirdly there's what you can call an intas psychic depression which is what I experienced was that you know there were certain parts of my life that had been walled off and and you know that was crying out pathology comes from the Greek word pathos which means suffering and logos which means expression of so pathology means the expression of the suffering Psychopathology is expression of the suffering of the Soul so what is it in terms of this person's natural desire to live in a meaningful way that's interfering with her life is it biologically driven is it as function of the social context in which they live or is it some personal task that they have to address and that kind of differential diagnosis is is essential and as you said there are certain conditions that are predominantly biologically driven such as schizophrenia bipolar Etc so secondly then speaking as as a citizen you know the internet and I don't want to get lost in the internet again but it's like it's a vast Open Stage in which whatever is unaddressed in people can can be put out there without censorship without reflection without the other being represented and you know it it allows people to to reveal whatever is going on within them uh with without genuine dialogue and of course you can have opposition but what has to happen typically is again associating with like-minded people I must be right because these other people agree with me you see so you know any of these terms can be misappropriated and and will be sooner or later so what one has to say is we can only make diagnosis with you know observation over time it's very hard initially to to know what's really going on as I mentioned what we do or what someone does is logical what we don't know is what it's in service to inside of them and you will not get much sense of that by the internet because it's too superficial that's why it takes repeated observation and conversation for that to emerge the reason I keep coming back to the internet is I think it's where most people get their information now it's unless they're listening to this as a podcast that's where they're going to get this information um I think what you said about um the lack of dialogue being really key I mean I think we see this now also at the level of media we have a very polarized media yes um this is an independent media channel we don't have a political stance despite what some people might assert we don't right it's about science and health information to the for everyone who is interested zero cost that's that's that's the the mission understood um when we read and see things now um about politics but also about business about sports about celebrity about kidss about culture um all too often the the labels of psychology are placed on those kids are depressed they're you know they're not just lonely they're depressed and they may very well be um experiencing high levels of clinical diagnosis of depression that that could be true so you know my concern it's a it's a real concern which is why I keep bringing this up is that uh in doing that that we both um diminish the suffering of those who are really suffering from those pathologies yeah and we also perhaps um create a little bit of catastrophizing about you know feeling low for an afternoon um might be a great source of of stimulus to go like you know write or think or nap or Insight um and you know I load to think that in people learning terms that somehow they're getting further away from what they need no I I agree you know Lou pastur from which from whom we got pasteurization of course um reportedly put over the entrance to his office tell me not your politics or your religion tell me only your suffering and I I always think about that in the context of therapy because everybody's a suffering Soul because you know life is difficult and then you die so have a nice day right um life is suffering and that's not that's not pessimistic that's just you know descriptive the question is what does that suffering make you do what does it keep you from doing that's the central question there is where the person is called into some accountability you know if you're depressed all right what's the task that that depression is asking of you uh if you're anxious where's that anxiety coming from how much of that is archaic how much of that was inherited from family how much of that is what you know unique to your life and what is the task that is to be addressed there I also wrote a book called swamplands of the soul that deals with anxiety depression loss betrayal etc etc and sooner or later life is going to take us to swamplands where you find yourself really mired into something and one will feel very much victimized in that way but that's that's the passive experience the summons is always what is the task that this visitation to the swampland is asking of you what do you need to address if if you feel that your partner betrayed you and left the marriage for example all right and took your self-esteem with that all right well your task is the recovery of self worth because without that no other choice you make is going to be very good um and maybe that's a hard project but that's nonetheless the work you have to do so always the question what does this make you do what does it keep you from doing and to bring responsibility back to the individual and of course some people are willing to accept that responsibility some are not and that makes the difference I had a colleague many moons ago who said she could tell in the first hour whether the person she was seeing was a big kid or a little kid because everybody's recovering child and the big kids could do the work the little kids wanted someone to tell them what to do or tell them that there's an easy fix to this um and in the long run uh those persons going to stay stuck pretty much until something else happens in their life perhaps well to me it seems that the the litmus test is the extent to which somebody is pointing fingers at others or directing the work towards themselves regardless of who was wronged sure right one individual both individual like regardless ultimately I think what you're saying and forgive me for interrupting is that if one is asking what is the task to develop what you know to control one's anxiety to develop stronger sense of self to um to better understand uh what one really wants and assert that um to uh set better boundaries so that um people's projections are not as um permeable to us whatever it is ultimately There's No Business of looking at what others are doing wrong in that it's all introspective and self-directed thing that's right well and you gave good examples of the kind of tasks that rise out of a person's experience now for example if a person has been subject to Serious abuse in childhood physical or emotional or sexual or whatever um it's affected their entire life well what is the task you know it's it's it's to rest from that experience a sense of self and that one is still here to live one's Journey that's why I said at the beginning of our conversation I'm not what happened to me I'm what is wanting to be expressed in my life through me to get a person to that place take some time and repetition frankly you know the two hardest things I ever learned as a therapist and I still don't like either one of them is patience you have to sit with it over time you have to sort and sift and sort and sift and hold this over time till something else emerges and secondly powerlessness I can't fix anybody right but we can try to promote the attitudes and behaviors that will allow that person to find what is Right From Within them because something in each of us always knows what is right for us if we pay attention and if we are willing to honor what emerges and have enough courage to address that then we can live in a different way and it's very tough in the face of subst substantial abuse for example because it was so intrusive and so devastating it's cleared out a space in which the self seems to find no room but that's that's the task then is the recovery of a sense of self and purpose that's independent of what happened to oneself it's almost as if one needs to really understand their own story but then be able to depart from that story yeah that's why I said one has to have a larger story than what happened to you right one has to have a larger story than the story that one's culture gives you or your family of origin gives you what is that story that's why I said my instructions and my models were to stay home and stay safe something in me hungered and I honor my teachers to this day I enter a local librarian who showed me any book she said she recognized this kid's a reader so she said to me you don't have to stay in the children's section you can go anywhere you want in the library which I I thought was like having a lot of candy I I enjoyed that and as a child I devoured the biographies of famous people because I think I was looking for clues about how do you live a larger life I couldn't have languaged that it was just some deep urge within how do you live this life in a way that's more satisfying and I was privileged to have some people there notably teachers and the librarian who gave permission to that and and supported that and I'm and I'm grateful to them so um you know I I I think it probably would have happened anyway but much later in life but I I look back and I realized there was something there that wanted to go as I said to see where the airplanes went what the ocean looked like what it meant to live in a foreign country what it meant to learn a foreign language you know all of those things were unimaginable to my family and I you know rest their souls um because I I I grieve the life they were not allowed to live you know I I never forget that and then it you know causes me to resolve again to stop and say all right now where are you being blocked today by convention or your old fears or or your inhibitions or or whatever because there's there's always a summon to show up in fact in one of the books I said my motto which I think about every morning is very simple shut up suit up show up now I'm speaking to myself when I say this shut up means stop whining you know there are people who don't have food today there are people whose children are being killed today there are people don't have a roof over there you you have tons of things shut up don't whine speaking to s suit up means prepare do your homework don't expect life just to present it to you you have to go out and work hard at something show up meaning not show off but just do the best you can step into life you know sooner or later life knocks us down death is the great democracy but you're here to live it as best you can by lights that matter within instead of what people around you are saying you know and as simplistic as that slogan is I know a lot of people have copied it and put it on their refrigerator because it's a reminder of this is your life you're accountable what are you going to do about that I'm going let that sink in for everybody I think um shut up suit up show up is uh is um essential um I love that I love Eric's stages of Developmental maturation um for those not familiar um Ericson I think another danne right is it danne yeah um psychologist you know set about to um kind of explain neurobiology without knowing any neurobiology and asserted that there were specific core conflicts that infants and children young adults and adults go through um and the AG the age ranges are more uh variable now um based on life expectancy and other factors than they were originally but one reason I like um Erikson's stages of development so much is that um as a developmental neurobiologist first that's where I started out more or less um it makes perfect sense to me that the brain circuitry would be resolving certain things about interactions with physical objects and relational objects and it just makes perfect sense and and what what genius it was to to um to superimpose on that um some ideas about what infants are doing from 0 to one and from 3 to 5 Etc rarely if ever do we hear about the maturational stages of adulthood and the core conflicts that we all have to go through um you know perhaps not exactly from age 45 to 50 or 50 to 55 or 75 to 80 and so forth but that life as it were might be a series of of um trying to make it through specific milestones and when we don't make it through a milestone um problems arise sure sure you described the first half of life as one in which we're kind of foraging more or less for most people unconscious of how our parental influences or family influences um set about certain patterns that may or may not be healthy for us and then at some point some event comes um often times a painful event but that but it could be a joyous event like the birth of a child or something like that and all of a sudden we get hit Square in the face with the work that we need to do would you say that the second half of life is one in which we because of our life experience and because of some awareness and yet because also our brain is yes still plastic but it takes more work than when we're kids to to modify our brain circuitry that we you know that we have to set about this juggling Act of still trying to understand the self while still bringing the self that we have into the world right we don't we don't really get to pause go to the shop and um come out a year later in most cases um so regardless of whether or not somebody is 10 15 20 50 or 80 years old how do we know what our work is then like how do we best know like what to to focus on because it can beit be a bit overwhelming to to think about like tackling all of this sure sure well let me say first of all many years ago I was when I was still teaching at a university um I taught a course on life stages and for one of the papers I asked the students to imagine two stages ahead of them so if they were typically 18 to 22 let's say to imagine themselves in their 40s and try to write about their in their 40s and the assignment completely failed Al although it it was made useful uh for the classroom discussion because all of them imagine in their 40s they would have this perfect marriage their adolescent children will would adore them and they would be in these satisfying careers despite everything we'd read everything we' talked about as a time of turbulence and disappointment and and and so forth and and it was a complete failure so it it's hard for us to imagine that we too will go through these similar kinds of things but usually we do and some of this is triggered by roles in one's life a lot of it's determined by our own aging of the body and so forth so for example the last stage in Ericson's um um discussion in so-called old age is the conflict between Despair and integrity and I remember reading that when I was young I wondering what did he really mean by that now I know that in a very personal way despair is one sees friends die one sees Avenues in your life closed that you can't possibly do that you're confronted with the unlived life or the mistakes you made you're dealing with loss of functions of the body you're you're facing your mortality and so forth and so on and how could you not despair in the face of that well at the same time there's again the summons to accountability what now is life asking of you how are you to show up today in in this changed environment you see so you know the the stages of life you know and Shakespeare wrote about the seven stages of life I think Ericson had eight stages and again underneath this these things happen right and often one doesn't realize it one reads about it somehow it's sort of like when you're young yes mortal I understand I'm mortal but you know that happens to people out there you know it's not part of my DNA you see well it is and sooner or later life is going to unfold unless it's cut off in some way you know and uh I remember reading when I was in graduate school um a saying in ancient Greece that I saw in several different environments and it said best of all is not to have been born second best is to have died young and I thought gee how awful that is right well I think I've understood why they were saying that if you if if you're born into the veil of Tears so to speak you're born into suffering you're you're you're born into mortality you're born into loss and so forth if you're going to live you're going to go through some of those if you live long enough you'll go through the loss of people you love and care about you may outlive your children as I've had an experience and sooner or later you know life will take you to these difficult places and what are you going to do then who are you then and how are you going to address that and that's where the issue of Integrity came in I think Ericson was was right on that to in to be a person of integrity means to integrate something to pull back one's stuff and and sense this is who I am and and this is where I stand Visa this dilemma it's why I said the Practical question is how now am I to live my life in the face of this situation that's a task that comes to each of us at at some place in our life and that never goes away let's talk about death okay I've often wondered whether or not um the human brain's ability to um adjust the aperture of our time perception is an Adaptive thing because we're we to not be able to do that we would probably always focus on the fact that at some point we are going to die this to me um is analogous to uh situation in space not outer space but um let's just frame it this way we can Orient in time and in particular under conditions of stress the our time Horizon tends to shrink we have to solve for now we get the troubling text message somebody's we care about is in trouble we need to solve for now now so the time Horizon has shrunk we're on vacation we're relaxed everything's taken care of we're fed we're rested our loved ones are safe we're safe and all of a sudden we can Daydream right so um in the space domain um the brain can learn to navigate a small environment like this room um and in conversation we're present to this room but we can also imagine that we're just two people among billions of other people floating on a planet in the galaxies and we can expand our notion of space the space-time dimensionality of perception of the human brain is vast and it can be consciously controlled or unconsciously controlled so that's great it allows us to be functional in a number of different SpaceTime Dimensions um it also can allow us to avoid the reality which is that at some point our time here is finite yes and the example you gave earlier of somebody who is just trying to pile up as much money to get to the y was an example I think of a a shorten time Horizon other compulsive behaviors maybe even addictive behaviors I would argue um have some component often of being a way to avoid the reality of death it's a way of packing away the fear of death because if you can create these reward-based which eventually become punishment based in the case of addiction um milestones and and algorithms that the brain is running solve for this now solve for this now solve for this you Stave off the reality which is death is coming are we as humans meaning is it our work if we wish to be the most conscious healthy version of ourselves um to understand and acknowledge our sense of mortality I I think of the um what I consider the great commencement speech of Steve Jobs at Stanford in 2015 where he talks about the the knowledge of one's mortality is actually in his words more or less one of the most important features of our self-recognition as humans um so that's the question and then the um the challenge becomes how often to think about it um you don't want to think about too much it can uh because it can be paralyzing it can lead I mean if we just think that we're if we acknowledge that we are indeed it's a fact just two people among billions floating around on a planet in the M then then nothing really matters right our one can get the sense that our impact is zero but if we over um emphasize our impact thinking that everything we do like the movement of this book is going to impact molecules that then will impact you go you'd go crazy you become dysfunctional in a real way so those are the two extremes and I'll just kind of set that about and and let um for uh reflection but it in terms of our our sense of our own mortality and what that means about our sense of life seems like a pretty big topic and I know you're writing a book about this and I'm very excited to read it when it comes out well I've actually written about it before um the Paradox here is it's mortality that makes this life meaningful if we were Immortal we would simply do this for a century then we' get bored and then we do something else for a century and then get bored and something else for a century life is short as as Yung said that short pause between two great mysteries from whence we come we know not whether we go we don't know the problem is the identification of the ego one of the things that's occurred is in many traditional cultures that ego was subsumed as I said into a larger story take away that story and what's going to fill that space the ego you know my my own importance my self-perpetuation the fact that people have Frozen their brains and wanting to be revived in some future um you know era is a good example of denial it seems to me um it's it's life means something because your choices are finite you don't live here forever now when the more you identify with the ego the more threatened you're going to be by that um and and then you begin to realize all right the center of my personality is not the ego there are several things to say about this none of which is proof of anything simply observations uh and and Yung pointed this out in a essay once called the soul in death um psyche doesn't seem to recognize uh its own termination people who are overtly dying and they know they're dying and I one of my patients right now is a gleo blastoma client who's who's not going to be here in a few months um who's acutely aware of of mortality but the dreams have to do with Journeys and crossings and things of that sort in other words as if the human psyche is not bound by time and space per se but the ego is so if there's another life it's another life you know if there's a life after this it's another life this is the only one we know about for sure and I would say in terms of the fear of death which most people don't want to talk about but sooner or later it comes up in therapy no matter what stage of life one is involved in you know is either either there is another life of some kind which is larger than my imagination can conjure up or there's an annihilation of this ego identity either case my theories about it and my anxieties about it are rendered moot so again the more I identify with the ego Consciousness the more I'm tied into its perpetuation the less I'm identified with that the less it matters I would say to you at this moment I'm trying to be as honest as I can about it the chief thing I worry about as I approach my mortality uh is I don't want my wife to be alone I care for her and I know there are areas where she needs my help and I want to be here for her as long as I can and my existence a little over a year ago was sort of problematic coming out of the all those surgeries so that's one reason we moved to retirement community so there' be some structure there for her secondly I don't you know want to suffer obviously um but that's outside of my control and and thirdly I'm still curious as a human being there's so much to learn and when we were talking about the internet and its perils it's also an enormous learning tool I I love to Google up things and find out about things that used to be so difficult to learn about so I I still heavily invested in the adventure of life but I'm less and less um attached to it in some peculiar way uh it's the ego attachment you know um the German word galenite mean is the word for serenity it's it's the condition of having let go and the only solution so to speak for our fear of mortality is accepting it paradoxically of letting go of the fantasy of the sovereignty of the ego that it's immune somehow to the Natural order of things the natural progression of things now I'm not saying that makes me wholly unafraid of death that would be delusional and it's in another way but I can say that I'm not defined by it in any way and I think you're right A lot of people what what it usually produces is either depression and and toror of some kind or phonetic activity so the inability of a person to relativize the ego in the context of the idea of the soul and does that Soul perpetuate I don't know if I knew I would tell you I wouldn't want to keep that a secret I don't know it's a mystery maybe I'll be a conscious enough to experience it maybe I'll just be annihilated either way as I said my present speculations are just that speculations and ultimately irrelevant and again the thing we have to recognize it's mortality that makes this life mean something because your choices matter you're here a short time what are you going to do with that precious gift you call your life what are you g to do with it I can't think of a more appropriate place to end and yet um I have still so many more questions um but I think because of today's conversation I realized that those questions are uh questions to ask of self um as I think everyone listening and watching this surely is stimulated to ask ask many important questions of self um I must say I'm both um a bit a struck frankly because I uh you know again I'm familiar with your teachings and and work in the form of books um and it was a great wish of mine in my life journey to sit down with you uh face to face and have a conversation so um that's why I'm uh speaking more slowly today than I normally do uh my audience perhaps will notice that and if they send some emotion it's that I feel like there's just so much richness here to take in uh for myself and for everyone listening to take in um I'm certainly going to listen to this again and and take careful notes and we we likely will put some notes and some highlights we always timestamp everything so that people can navigate back but I think there are just so many um essential prompts of the self of the soul that um people are going to be motivated to take as a consequence of of hearing your words today so uh I just really want to say thank you so much for the work that you've done and that you're doing and continuing to do um and for taking the time to share this uh this information with us because it's it really is uh it really is the the guts like the core stuff of of being a human being so thank you so much well thank you Andrew may I just ask add as a footnote here there's a wonderful letter of poet RKA to a young man in which he said you want the answers the key is to find the right questions and live the questions you're not yet ready to live the answers but you you ask the right questions in time if you live them honestly with as much Integrity as you can manage someday you'll live your way into their answers for you and that's what I would say h ask large questions as children we did what was the about why am I here what's what's the story what's going on here we get so inured to those questions by our adaptive necessities and we have to come back to those questions I'm still asking those questions I've do it consciously now ask large questions you'll live a large and interesting Journey ask small questions and it gets diminished somehow another thing I say to a lot of patients when you reach a a decisive point in your life we have to make a decision one way or the other ask does this path enlarge me psychos spiritually or does it diminish me and you usually know the answer to that if you choose the larger path you're going to grow and develop it it's going to take something out of you but it'll give something to you if you don't your life gets narrower and narrower and narrower and something inside of you knows the difference and sooner or later the psyche is going to show up with its point of view and the more we fled from that kind of question that kind of conversation the more pathology is going to erupt when we've avoided the big question so thank you for asking big questions and thank you for inviting me to be part of this conversation today it's been a privilege and a pleasure thank you so much thank you for joining me for today's discussion with Dr James Hollis I hope you found it to be as

Title: Dr. Matt Walker: The Science of Dreams, Nightmares & Lucid Dreaming | Huberman Lab Guest Series
Published: 2024-05-08 12:00:19 UTC
Description:
This is episode 6 of a 6-part special series on sleep with Dr. Matthew Walker, Ph.D., a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley and a leading public educator on sleep for mental and physical health, learning and human performance. In this episode, we discuss dreaming, including the biological mechanism of dreams, what dreams mean and their role in daytime life. 
 
We explore how dreams can enhance our creativity and emotional well-being and help us resolve various challenges and dilemmas. We discuss how to remember and interpret your dreams and the abstractions/symbols frequently present in dreams.
 
We also discuss nightmares and therapies to treat reoccurring nightmares. We explain what lucid dreaming is and if there are benefits or drawbacks to this type of dreaming.
 
Dr. Walker also answers frequently asked audience questions and discusses snoring, body position, sleep supplements, sleep challenges due to aging, menopause, stopping racing thoughts, and how to fall back asleep if you wake in the middle of the night.

[Music] welcome to the hubman lab guest Series where I and an expert guest discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today marks the sixth episode in our sixth episode series all about sleep with expert guest Dr Matthew Walker today's episode focuses on sleep and dreaming as well as lucid dreaming we talk about what's happening in your brain when you dream both mundane dream as well as heavily emotionally Laden dreams and we discuss how to think about and perhaps even interpret the content of your dreams and we talk about lucid dreaming which are dreams that occur while in sleep of course in which you are aware that you are dreaming and because Unfortunately they are relatively common we also talk about nightmares and both what to do about nightmares as well as how to think about nightmares this being the final episode in the six episode series all about sleep I put the call out on my social media handles for any and all questions about sleep that I could direct to Dr Matthew Walker so as today's episode closes I ask him those questions focusing specifically on the questions that were most frequently asked by you the audience and he answers them in Rapid succession before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is better help better help offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out online now I've been doing therapy for well over 30 years initially I had to do therapy against my will but of course I continue to do it voluntarily over time because I really believe that doing regular therapy with a quality therapist is one of the best things that we can do for our mental health indeed for many people it's as beneficial as getting regular physical exercise the great thing about better help is that it makes it very easy to find a therapist that's optimal for your needs and I think it's fair to say that we can define a great therapist as somebody with whom you have excellent Rapport somebody with whom you can talk about a variety of different issues and who can provide you not just support but also insight and with better help they make it extremely convenient so that it's matched to your schedule and other aspects of your life if you'd like to try betterhelp you can go to betterhelp.com huberman to get 10% off your first month again that's betterhelp.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means plenty of the electrolytes magnesium potassium and sodium and no sugar as I mentioned before on this podcast I'm a big fan of salt now I want to be clear people who already consume a lot of salt or who have high blood pressure or who happen to consume a lot of processed foods that typically contain salt need to control their salt intake however if you're somebody who eats pretty clean and you're somebody who exercises and you're drinking a lot of water there's a decent chance that you could benefit from ingesting more Electro ltes with your liquids the reason for that is that all the cells in our body including the nerve cells the neurons require the electrolytes in order to function properly so we don't just want to be hydrated we want to be hydrated with proper electrolyte levels with element that's very easy to do what I do is when I wake up in the morning I consume about 16 to 32 ounces of water and I'll dissolve a packet of element in that water I'll also do the same when I exercise especially if it's on a hot day and I'm sweating a lot and sometimes I'll even have a third element packet dissolved in water if I'm exercising really hard or sweating a lot or if I just notied that I'm not consuming enough salt with my food if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element spelled El mn.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that's drink element LM nt.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by Helix sleep Helix sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are customized to your unique sleep needs it's abundantly clear that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance when we're getting enough quality sleep everything in life goes so much better and when we are not getting enough quality sleep everything in life is that much more challenging now one of the key things to getting a great night sleep is to have the appropriate mattress everyone however has slightly different needs in terms of what would be the optimal mattress for them Helix understands that people have unique sleep needs and they've designed a brief two-minute quiz that asks you questions like do you sleep on your back your side or your stomach do you tend to run hot or cold during the night or maybe you don't know the answers to those questions if you go to the Helix site and take that brief quiz they'll match you to to a mattress that's optimal for you for me it turned out to be the dusk D mattress it's not too hard not too soft and I sleep so much better on my Helix mattress than on any other type of mattress I've used before so if you're interested in upgrading your mattress go to helixsleep.com huberman take their brief two-minute sleep quiz and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you and for this month only May 2024 you can get up to 30% off all mattresses and two free pillows again that's helixsleep.com huberman to get 30% off and two free pillows and now for my conversation with Dr Matthew Walker Dr Walker my day good fellow Dr hubman today is the Sixth and final episode in the six episode series that we've been recording on sleep during episode one you told us about the biology of sleep and some actionable items to get the basics of sleep well worked out for each of us and it's highly particular to our individual needs and you explained to define those needs then you beautifully described in-depth protocols for let's call it optimizing one sleep and then a third episode focused on caffeine napping and also food intake and its impact on sleep we talked about the relationship between sleep and learning and memory and creativity and then of course in the fifth episode just prior to this one you beautifully described the literature and actionable tools for connecting sleep sleep to emotional health and mental health as well as the relationship between lack of sleep and certain mental health challenges or conditions today we are going to dive into a truly exciting and fascinating topic which is dreaming I can think of fewer topics more intriguing than dreams I know there's a lot of interest in lucid dreaming that is one dreaming while being aware that one is dreaming you'll tell us more about that but I think Dreams Just Intrigue and Fascinate us for so many reasons but not the least of which is that at some point we all seem to have them and they seem to have a relevance for our lives they're not just epip phenomena as we say so today I know you're going to explain what they do and do not provide for us and I'm really excited to dive into this topic it's something that I've been fascinated by and I know many people are fascinated by so just to kick things off how do we Define dreaming what is a dream what is a dream state you would think it's fairly simple because when people say oh I had the strangest dream last night everyone seems to know what a dream and by the way dreaming is is we take it for granted we say oh I had a strange dream last night just think about it though last night both you and I and everyone listening as long as they slept we all became flagrantly psychotic now now before you reject my my diagnosis of your nightly psychosis I'll give you five good reasons first when we start to dream we see things which are not there so we hallucinate second we believe things that could not possibly be true so we're delusional third we get confused about time place and person so we're suffering from disorientation fourth we have these wildly fluctuating emotions something think that's psychiatrists called being affectively labile and then how wonderful you woke up this morning and you forgot most if not all of that dream experience so you are suffering from Amnesia if you were to experience any one of those five symptoms while you're awake we'd probably be seeking psychological or psychiatric treatment but for reasons that we still don't fully understand that seems to be a normal biological and psychological and in fact and I'll describe the data absolutely necessary life support perhaps necessary set of experiences to go through so that's the peculiarity of dreaming but how do we Define it one of the loose definitions that we often use in sleep science is that a dream is any report of mental activity upon Awakening so I'll come into the laboratory and I'll wake you up and I'll say what was going through your mind and if you just say nothing think really then we note that down as no dream report but if you were to say well you know what I was actually just thinking about the next time you're going to come in and wake me up um then we would report that as a dream but that's not really what most people mean when they say I had this strange dream what they're referring to is dreaming that takes place during the stage of sleep called rapid eye movement sleep or REM sleep and during REM sleep there we have these bizarre hallucinogenic these Vivid these narrative these emotion filled story experiences those are the types of reports that we get principally from Ram sleep so if I were to go back to episode one and say think about those different stages of sleep light non-rm sleep deep non-rm sleep and REM sleep when does dreaming occur well if I wake you up during stage two nonrem sleep that's one of the lighter forms of non-rm early in the night but especially later in the night you typically will report a dream maybe about 50% probability 50% of the time I wake you up out of that stage no report the other half yes if I wake you up out to a deep non-r sleep stages three and four we down to a 0 to 20% chance that you'll report a dream so very very unlikely if I wake you up out of REM sleep somewhere between 80 to 90% probability that you were going to report a dream there's Nuance in that REM sleep Story by the way rapid eye movement sleep is defined by those rapid eye movements but when you're in that stage of sleep you're not always having the eye movements they come in these strange phases so though you will be in REM sleep and we can Define that with lots of different um sensors on your brain and your body but then there will be times when your eyes are darting back and forth and times when your eyes are not and when those eyes are moving during REM sleep we call that phasic REM sleep and when they're not we call it tonic REM sleep don't worry about the the terminology when I wake you up out of tonic R sleep when the eyes aren't moving I'm around that 80% probability if I wake you up out of real sleep when your eyes are darting back and forth there is 95 to 100% probability that you're going to report a dream some people theories in the past have said well if that's the case then presumably those eye movements are tracking something in the dream if you do careful analyses that just does not seem to hold up there is some evidence that that may be the case but your eyes are moving back and forth it seems that these are impulses that are going to your eyes that don't have a strong correlation with what it is that you're dreaming visually in the scene that's that's not the case but that's a little bit of a definition of what dreaming is and also when dreaming occurs I should probably note by the way that we human beings we seem to be special in our REM sleep dreaming amounts now I've just done a little bit of a slight of hand when I say REM sleep I'm going to infer that it's dreaming but Charles nun um wonderful scientist has looked at the proportion of REM sleep across different mammals and what he found was that we human beings are a complete anomaly when it comes to our relative amounts of REM sleep in other words our dream sleep he found that across most other primates REM sleep was usually averaging about 9% of the sleep period however we human beings on average including When We're Young will have a REM sleep proportion of about 20% so if you plot the amount of REM sleep of primates in a graph they're all sort of clustered around this mean and then all of a sudden on the our right hand side you've got this one single data point that sticks out that's us human beings and we don't fully understand why it is that we have such exceptional amounts of REM sleep now I've done a lot of hand waving and written some theories about why that is but it's still it's still very unclear the other thing and that's a very I I can go very philosophical about the functions of REM sleep and how it changed as we made the transition as a species from tree to ground because don't forget as we mentioned in one of our episodes when you're hanging like a bird on a tree or you're resting on a branch as a primate up in the trees and you go into REM sleep you lose muscle tone so it's quite a fragile state when you're 30 foot up in the air and you've got um gravity desperately wanting to bring you and your your limbs down to the ground but when we made the transition down from tree to ground we no longer had to worry about that did that open up the opportunity for more REM sleep to occur and that explains why we human beings have that we don't know REM sleep however does seem to be quite fundamental and fundamental from a life necessary perspective there were some studies done back in the 1980s and there are studies that have not really been replicated and I I think I agree as to why because ethically and and you know they're right in that Gray Zone in fact for me I find them quite uncomfortable when I speak about them or even teach them in class they took rats and they deprived them of sleep totally and what they found was that Rats on average will die somewhere between about 13 to 17 days after total sleep deprivation in other words rats will die almost as quickly from sleep deprivation as they will from food deprivation it's that that essential brutal but then they did something different they said well what about the different stages of sleep so they selectively deprived them of either non-rem sleep and REM sleep the hypothesis was perhaps that non-rm sleep is from an evolutionary perspective a much older form of sleep the first stage of sleep that came into being was non-rm sleep and the way we answer that is we look across philogyny and these sort of different branches and what we find is that in insects and in reptiles amphibians and fish they all seem to have non-rem sleep but for the most part with a few exceptions they don't seem to have REM sleep but if you look at birds and mammals they do have REM sleep and in fact it seems as though REM sleep evolved twice independently once in Birds once in mammals which tells us probably that it it's essential if it's being forced through the evolutionary pipe twice independently so you would argue well if I selectively deprived you of nonr the older stage of sleep presumably that's more life support necessary and REM sleep REM sleep is the new kid on the Block evolutionarily they found the opposite they found that if they selectively deprive rats just of non-rem sleep they did die but it took them longer they died after about 60 days if you deprive them of REM sleep dream sleep they died after 40 days versus 60 days other words this this new type of sleep REM sleep seems to be on that basis maybe even more important to supporting life than non-r sleep it's super interesting and as I recall from graduate school there are certain patterns of brain activity that occur during a rapid eye movement sleep um maybe we could go a little bit deeper into those patterns of activity I know you touched on some of these patterns in the first EP episode um the thing that comes to mind here is PG waves pawns geniculate occipital um pwns being an area of the brain stem that is chocka block full of different neurons involved in basic functions rhythmic breathing um eye movements um and basic reflexive functions that preserve the the well-being and life of the animal and that the neurons there then um do indeed connect to the thalamus this is like egg like a shaped structure in the middle of the brain where you have something called the geniculate which is a uh there's a auditory geniculate and a and a visual geniculate but it projects to this relay station for vision mainly and hearing and then it goes up to the occipital lobe the area in the back of our brain that incited people as responsible for conscious perception of images and I was taught and I don't know if this is um still true uh that based on the work of people like um mer stad and um folks like that that these Pon geniculate occipital waves of activity that were ongoing during sleep I think during REM sleep um were essential for resetting uh something essential about brain function and wakefulness so that you needed these pggo waves and that maybe even the activation of the visual pathway was part of the reasons why we um often experience such robust uh visual hallucinations during dreams um what is thought about PG are they related to rapid eye movement sleep and um are they somehow the reset um that we need um and indeed is essential for life because as you pointed out in the absence of rapid eye movement sleep we die it's a great demonstration of the uniqueness of your brain I mean essentially what we're asking is um this is your brain on dreams explain and REM sleep has many different brain features to it the first of which is as we spoke in the first episode your electrical brain wave activity at the top of the brain the cortex looks almost identical to that which you have when you're awake which is stunning because you're not conscious you're lying completely still no presence of muscle tone whatsoever yet your brain seems to be just as on fire with electrical activity as it is when you're awake coming down a step though there are these unique pulses of electrical almost like lightning bursts that come up from the brain stem up to this sensory relay Center in your brain called the thalamus and then they were initially recorded out in the back of the brain in the visual cortex hence this pgo waves describes the three sites that I've just mentioned goes from the brain stem the ponds up to the thalamus a part of it called the geniculate and then out to the back of the brain called the ocip cortex pgo what they found was that those bursts of pgo wave activity were very much linked to these rapid eye movements so once you got this burst of a pgo wave um this sort of brain Stam up into the brain burst then you got one of these rapid eye movements so it was linking something there with the eye movements and I told you that when you're having these eye movements that's a state where there's a high probability of dreaming and is it a surprise then that the final destination of that lightning bolt where it sort of strikes is at the back of the brain in the visual cortex probably not there's also been some links with those PJ waves and learning not so much that those PG waves seem to consolidate memories in other words they may not be critical for sleep after learning but they seem to be related almost to sleep and initial learning and the more that animals learn the greater the amount of pgo wave activity they have when they go to sleep so pjo waves are unique PJ waves don't simply just hit the back of your brain that we've now measured them in all sorts of different cortical areas and they seem to light up the lightning splits as it were and it strikes all sorts of cortical areas so then the question was well let's take humans and let's put them inside of brain scanners let's allow them to fall into REM sleep and then we'll start scanning the brain what did we find it was very interesting when you look at the brain during REM sleep compared to let's say non-rem sleep you see motor regions of the brain lighting up you see visual regions of the brain lighting up just as we described you see memory related structures lighting up like the hippocampus and you see emotional related structures like the amydala and something called the anterior uh cortex uh the anterior singular cortex I should say so if I were to just show you an expert a brain Imaging map with memory centers related uh in terms of their activity emotion centers visual centers motoric centers and I were to say to you Andrew this is a scan that we got from an individual just describe the type of experience that you think this this person was having in the scanner you would probably look at it and say well they were probably recollecting things from their past memory structures they seem to be having a visual experience but there was also probably movement involved in that brain scanning experiment and also there seems to be some degree of emotionality to it that sounds strikingly similar to what we know dreams are like with one exception though and another part of the brain bucked the trend of increased activation during REM sleep that part of the brain with a far left and right sides of your frontal lobe something that we call the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex terrible mouthful of word salad essentially just means the far left and right sides of your prefrontal cortex those are very important for logical rational thinking and decision making those parts of the brain went down in their activity almost as though they were suppressed during REM sleep dreaming so now let's go back to our map you're having a visual experience it's filled with movement and memories and emotions but it's utterly bizarre completely illogical and totally irrational if that's not a perfect neural definition of this thing called Dreaming I don't know what is it's so interesting we think of dreams or at least I think of dreams as a fragmented representation of real world experiences from our recent past maybe even the previous day you know sort of meshed with um our distant past experience and then of course our brain is also a very good anticipatory machine and somehow you know puts that into a movie that um for all purposes when we're in it we feel as if it's happening in real time yeah then of course uh we try and untangle what the meaning of all that is uh I think people are really intrigued by dreams um because they're they just feel so real to us and yet we know they're not of the same real that is our waking experience and um and you know throughout history people have um alluded to the idea or have been convinced of the idea that dreams are meaningful and something we're going to get into and I I should mention by the way that your dreams based on those brain pain scans still remained your own you were the only person privy to the experience of the dream itself I could stick you in a scanner and I could say you know were you having a visual dream and was it you know filled with motor activity and emotions and memories that tells me how you're dreaming it doesn't tell me what you're dreaming so at that point you still had this degree of security in privacy no longer it seems there was a great study done by a Japanese group using very Advanced Brain imaging technology and techniques such as multivoxel pattern analysis again word salad but it's a very clever technique and they were able to start to understand exactly what you Andrew huberman were dreaming and they would know what you were dreaming even before you woke up and told us what you were dreaming and they did a two-part experiment first they showed you lots of very specific images images of cars of women of houses of men of dogs of cats of just a whole category of different visual elements and your brain was being scanned as you were awake watching each of these and then using this clever analysis they were able to build up this very specific pattern this very specific template of activity that for you Andrew huberman said he is now looking specifically at a set of keys or he was looking at a car or he was looking at a woman or a man or a house and we knew ground truth in terms of what your brain looks like when it is seeing these different categories and then they did something clever then they let those individuals sleep and go into sleep and then they started waking them up and getting dream reports but once they got the dream reports the analysis sort of Team remained blind to those reports what they did was almost like a forensic team that goes hunting for DNA at a crime scene they had the DNA and they started going around and searching to see if they could find a DNA match but here they weren't using the DNA they were using these templates of a woman's face or a car or a house and they would search through this electrical this brain activity sort of static of your dreams at night and find these matches and then we could wake you up get the dream report and see how well did our brain performing a sort of algorithm match with your actual subjective report when you came out and it was stunning how close so I could tell you were dreaming but you were also dreaming about a house and a car you're dreaming about a woman turns out and we started to want your dreams as I said were your own but now no longer because science can start to reveal those what we can't yet do is understand which specific woman in which specific house so what you would probably see my brain based on my uh own proclivities lighting up is it would just be full of cars probably sports cars and then maybe another special uh individual woman those two things would be dominant but you wouldn't know that I'm dreaming about the new Porsche 911 GT2 RS you can't tell that you can just simply tell me he was dreaming about a car so there is still some distance to go I can't help but ask based on what you just described when people say things in their dreams when they sleep talk um how Faithfully does that report what's in the dream it doesn't at all and the reason is because when you sleep talking or sleep walking or even sleep eating you're not dreaming because you're not in dream sleep this is one of the fallacies that sleepwalking or sleeptalking you're you know stop dreaming wake up you're dreaming you're waking someone out of the very depths of deep non-rm sleep and these different things sleep walking sleep talking sleep eating um sleep um there's sleep Associated sex behavior all of these things are what we call parasomnias Par meaning sort of around somnia obviously sleep so these are things that happen around sleep but they're not quite in sleep because when you have those you are launched from Deep non-rm Sleep up to wakefulness but you don't make it all the way to wakefulness and so you act out these very rote routine reflexive behaviors you just repeat certain words you lift a cup to your mouth go over to the refrigerator so they are not faithful to the dream because if I were to gently wake you as you're sleeptalking and say what was going through your head you'll say nothing at all and you don't report a dream I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also can contains adaptogens and is designed to meet all of your foundational nutritional needs by now I'm sure you've all heard me say that I've been taking ag1 since 2012 and indeed that is true now of course I do consume regular Whole Foods every day I strive to get those Foods mostly from unprocessed or minimally processed sources however I do find it hard to get enough servings of fruits and vegetables each day so with ag1 I ensure that I get enough of the vitamins minerals Prebiotic fiber and other things typically found in fruits or vegetables and of course I still make sure to eat fruits and vegetables and in that way provide a sort of insurance that I'm getting enough of what I need in addition the adaptogens and other micronutrients in ag1 really help buffer against stress and ensure that the cells and organs and tissues of my body are getting the things they need people often ask me that if they were going to take Just One supplement what that supplement should be and I always answer ag1 if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer you'll get five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman earlier in this series You describ Beautiful experiments by Matt Wilson others at MIT um who explored neural activity within the brain within the hippocampus in particular an area associated with memory formation in which the neurons in the hippocampus fire in the same sequence as they did during a particular daytime activity that preceded that night's sleep but they do so at a much more rapid rate sometimes they play in Reverse Etc yeah um this raises the question of first of all is that sort of neural replay of events from the prior day is that also associated with Dreaming or more specifically is that Dreaming or is dreaming that and that's really to raise the larger question which is what is dreaming for what is the function of dreaming so what we know is that Matt Wilson's data during nonrapid ey move and sleep the brain was replaying those memories 10 to 20 times faster so but when you go into REM sleep it's down to 0 five times so listening to this podcast now and you hit that speed button and you drop it down to 0.5 that seems to be the replay speed during REM sleep we've not yet been able to confirm that in human beings but if we did does that mean we can explain the time time differences that seem to happen in the dream state that time is longer in the dream world than it is in the waking world I think that's fascinating but you're right it does point us more towards the question though of what are the functions of this state called Dreaming and we can get on to whether or not dreaming is a very faithful recapitulation of our waking experiences and I'll give you a spoiler now no but I'll give you the data in a second but the functions of dreaming come back to some of the functions of REM sleep that we described in an earlier episode those two related functions in the episode on learning in memory um was that one function of REM sleep seems to be creativity associating memories together so that you can come up with these wonderfully Divine solutions to problems you couldn't answer when you're awake the second came in our last episode about emotional and mental wellness and we spoke about this theory that we put forward that REM sleep is a form of overnight therapy and we described the evidence supporting that therapy so I would say that those are the two leading theories of REM sleep and Associated dreaming but I perhaps didn't give you the full story there there is a Twist in both of those stories I told you that when you are in REM sleep and you're dreaming the next day you are better able to assimilate and Associate memories and come up with these creative Insight Solutions it turns out that sleep is necessary for that and not just sleep but dream related sleep REM sleep is necessary for that but it's not sufficient you not only have to be asleep and dreaming to get those benefits you also have to be dreaming of the very things that you are trying to solve the next day there's a great study by a scientist called Robert stick gold at Harvard and he had a whole group of individuals learn a virtual Maze and they were dropped down in different locations of the Maze and they had to try to get out of the Maze and gradually when you're dropped down in different locations you do that enough times you start to build up this mental map of the Maze and then he let one half of those participants take a 9 minute nap and the other half remained awake and then some hours later they tested them on the Maze and they measured how quickly were you able to navigate and get out of the maze that was the outcome measure and sure enough just as we described those people who slept versus those who didn't they were better able to navigate The Maze after they had slept versus those who remained awake but then they went back and they separated those individuals who were napping into two classes because as they were napping they were waking them up intermittently and getting dream reports from them and what they found was that those people who slept and still had dream reports but those dreams were not related to The Maze they didn't show an improvement but those individuals who slept and who dreamt but also dreamt of the specific maze elements themselves they were the only subset of people of participants who showed the benefit and that's a beautiful demonstration that yes you need to sleep to get creative benefits and in fact seemingly have dream sleep but you also need to be dreaming about specific things is that rule true for the second function of REM sleep dreaming this overnight therapy benefit yes it does seem to be true there were some great Studies by a scientists who sadly passed away now Rosaline cartright and she was looking at different patient populations who had undergone really painful difficult emotional experiences for example a very bitter painful divorce and she would at the time that those individuals were going through this difficult challenge she would be recording their sleep looking at their different stages of sleep and she was collecting dream reports from them and then she would track them and their progression clinically over the next year and what she found was that some of those participants about 50% of them ended up getting clinical remission from the depression that was instigated by the painful experience they'd gone through the other half did not get clinical remission from their depression they remained depressed and then she used those two classes to go back and have a look at the sleep and dream reports and what she found was some differences in REM sleep but more interestingly were the differences in the dreams both of those sets of individuals were dreaming at the time of going through those difficult emotional experiences some of them however were dreaming of that challenging experience others were not those who dreamt but also dreamt of the problematic experience were the ones who went on to get clinical resolution from their depression those who dreamed but did not dream of those events seem to be the ones who did not get clinical remission from their depression in other words here once again is this new rule that when it comes to Dreaming it's not just about sleep and it's not just about dreaming it's about dreaming of the specific things that you're trying to get the functional benefit from whether that's creativity and insight or whether it's emotional resolution and over night therapy both of them seem to depend very much on the expression of dreaming of specific things itself and we'll come on to why that's maybe relevant when we speak about Lucidity too what you just said is very reassuring at least to me because uh when I'm going through a challenging phase um which somehow seems to happen periodically in my life at a frequency that uh let's just say keeps me dreaming um about things um You're Not Alone by the way I'm sure I'm not which is no no I didn't mean that I just mean that there are lots of people who can resonate with that so thank you for being vulnerable and sharing yeah yeah it's um one of these things where I you know put my head down on the pillow fall asleep and um on you know assuming I can get good sleep amidst those those real life events which is something that um sometimes is the case sometimes is not I always dream about things related to those events or those events in particular and I'm a longtime practitioner of of um writing down my dreams when I wake up from them um or as we discussed in an earlier episode I'll um my phone is on airplane mode at night typically I'll grab my phone and I'll hit the voice memo um button yeah or function rather and I'll just you know in my groggy state with my eyes closed so I'm not getting any light in my eyes I'll say you know I'll describe what I can recall of the dream then I'll sometimes go back and listen to those um those recordings and they've provided me Insight um and in some cases a path to Solutions so I'm 100% on board the fact that our dreams can help us resolve challenges in our waking day what's always fascinating to me though is how the dreams are not a one forone representation of what happened during the day it's you know I think symbolism is a is a is a Hallmark feature of of dreams you know um and that's uh something I know we're going to talk about you know in terms of dream interpretation and much has been made of this um throughout history um so it seems that when we're asking what are the functions of dreaming one of them is to resolve uh challenges from our daytime experience um it's emotional first aid yeah that's beautifully put and in an earlier episode on learning memory and creativity you uh described how specific sleep stages and perhaps dreams themselves are involved in the consolidation of of memories from daytime experiences or things that we're trying to learn from daytime experiences and then in the episode on sleep and emotions it was made very clear that rapid eye movement sleep is a time in which we get a a sort of um therapy that is a disentangling of the emotional load of a given experience from The Experience um so to me it just seem so clear like dreams are critical sleep is critical but I think one question that Still Remains unresolved at least for me is are dreams really there to just be a replay our waking lives with some Distortion because when the conscious mind is asleep the unconscious mind can kind of throw things up to the surface in ways that U you know don't seem so obvious like you know symbolism analogy some of us are more visual than others um you know are there any rules about the way that dreams convert our waking experiences into dream content there are and the short answer to your question do we simply go into sleep start dreaming and then rewind the videotape and Replay in a faithful recapitulation the waking day in our dreaming night and the answer is no and here again uh the scientist I mentioned before Robert stickgold um with uh raw fossy they looked at this question and it was a very difficult study to do they did what we call experience sampling during the day and they would give you sort of like a little beeper and they would set it to go off multiple times throughout the day and then you would write down what it is that you were experiencing right in that moment and again they were trying to build up this sort of time lapse photography as it were of your waking day experience and then they would bring people in and they would start to record their dreams at night and then they would match those two and ask what is the degree of overlap what is the ven diagram proportion or percentage of those two things aligning and what they found was that there was really only about 2% of your dreaming life that was a very faithful replay and reiteration of your Waking Life however what they did find was something even more interesting to me which comes back to this idea of overnight therapy they found that there is something that runs through like a red thread narrative from your Waking Life into your dreaming life that is emotional concerns and people of significance if there is anything in terms of an algorithm that seems to overlap and predict where those two vend diagrams sort of collide it really is in the emotional personal significance space once again pointing us to perhaps a re affirmation that a key function of dreaming is about dealing with our waking experiences and particularly the things that are Salient to us okay so clearly there's a functionality to Dreaming but what should we make of the specific content of our dreams really meaning should we interpret our dreams or should we allow anyone else to interpret our dreams there are scores of books out there websites programs there's a long history of this in classic psychoanalysis what about this dream interpretation business I mean it really started you have to give credit in some ways to Freud although if you look back at very ancient cultures so much of their artwork so much of the sort of left imprint on the world suggests that they were fascinated by dreams and use dreams and gods of dreams so we've always been thinking about what are these things called dreams and can we interpret them but it was really Freud who put his seminal works together in 1899 and then published it in 1901 um called the interpretation of dreams and it's probably one of his if not his most famous text and you can unfairly sum it up as um you know if it's not one thing it's your mother when it comes to to Freud but in some ways Freud with his interpretation attempt in my mind was 50% right and a 100% wrong because until the moment that Freud came along we left the interpretation and the instigation of our dreams to things outside of us maybe it was there were comments that it was due to our soul or it was from the gods on high that they would descend down these these dream manifestos to us but Freud full credit was the first person to put dreams front and center into this thing called the brain the mind so in some ways Freud shifted dream science from really more of a sort of spiritual philosophical you know condition to very much a neuroscience it was of the mind and therefore of the brain and earlier he had he had tried to describe the neural patterns and he had these beautiful drawings of neuronal circuits that could try to explain what was going on but Neuroscience was so anemic at the time in terms of its knowledge he had no chance to do what we can do now so in some ways it's very unfair of me to criticize him as his theory being non-scientific it is also non-scientific in the very strict sense of the word when we create create a scientific theory just as though he created his interpretation of Dreams Theory we allow that theory to be testable which is to say that a scientific theory is only a scientific theory if it can be falsified or supported but Freud's theory was not a scientific theory it was not something that you could test and therefore it was not able to be falsified or affirmed and in some ways it was Freud's simultaneous downfall and his utter genius it's the reason that Freud remains to this day because we we can't put him in way in a box and say we've disproven him but we equally will never be able to prove him and therefore he's been in some ways let go in hard science as being representative his theory which we don't need to get into which was um called disguised censorship was really a very interesting proposition which was that there was something about our dreams that was veiled and masked and Freud believed that he understood the decryption code to our dreams and if you tell him your dream he has the special filter that he can pull that dream through the filter and magically out on the other side is the true meaning of that dream there are several problems with that uh Theory not least of which I think you know at the time if you look at his writings it seemed that Freud was probably doing enough cocaine to kill a small horse at the time but we'll put that aside for a second uh the the issue there is that it's not very replicable as an analysis method and there was a fascinating um study that was I remember from a conference I I should check to see if it's been fully published and they did something clever they took the Freudian method and they took a single Dream from one individual and they had three Freudian psychoanalysts analyze that dream so it was the same dream but three different analysts now in a scientific protocol if it's a scientifically rigorous assessment tool you would get back the very same answer from that measure mement technique all three times or very similar so for example a carbon dating machine if I were to take a fossil and put it in a carbon dating machine and then another another one and another one for the most part they're probably going to return something that's much more similar than different in terms of the carbon date of that fossil why because it's been very well validated and replicated that's what you want from a scientific method and Tool but when they gave this single dream the f as it were to these three different interpreters the three different carbon dating machines as it were they all came up with completely different interpretations and so that's not necessarily a reliable valid method so in that sense we've abandoned and let go of Freud as being relevant or meaningful however I personally and I think if you look at the data I don't mean that to suggest that you should not try to think about and quote unquote interpret your dreams and the term interpret when it comes to dreams is so loaded so I tend to I would just simply say see if you can really deconstruct some of your dreams I think dreaming just as we've spoken about is a very solid window into the things that you should be concerned about from your Waking Life it's very obvious that what whatever it is that we typically dream are the things that our brain is telling us the human being this is the stuff that's essential this is the stuff you need to work through this is please pay attention to me and any amount of journaling or deliberation digestion citation of that specific dream is going to be beneficial to you because in my mind a life unexamined is not a life life well- lived and that isn't just applicable to your Waking Life it's especially applicable to your dreaming life now does that mean I suggesting that everyone should race out and start cataloging and and uh interpreting their dreams not necessarily but I am saying that if you wish to do that I as a scientist based on the data I'm not telling you that that's whoy and non-scientific I think it's very valid it's just that some of the Freudian principles I think we've being able to dislocate ourselves from I wholeheartedly agree with what you just said um and I've spoken about dreams and their possible relevance to clinician psychiatrist such as Paul KY and others um some who have more of a psychoanalytic training than others but certainly folks like Paul um know a ton of Neuroscience they understand pharmacology they understand family systems models uh dialectical uh therapy and so many other man is he's extraordinary he's not extraordinary he's extraordinary he is extraordinary and um in part because he can synthesize across all these different domains of Psychiatry psychology Neuroscience Etc as opposed to just be existing in one Silo like psychoanalysis or um or psychopharmacology so and there are others um although few as um as as extraordinary as Paul which is why we hosted him on the series here and one of the things that has come up in the discussions with Paul and others um with similar training about dreams is that dreams seem to present us with emotional states and scenarios for which there's a lot of um swapping in and out of of identity so for instance the notion of symbols within dreams is a long-standing conversation and I think one of the mistakes as I understand it is to assume that every time there's an animal in your dream that it represents children or that every time it's a particular kind of animal it represents you know uh you know your boss or something right sometimes a cigar is just a cigar right right uh on the other hand it's very clear that within our dreams there's rarely a completely linear one forone relationship with what happened in the daytime um of real experience so there seems to be a swapping in and out and there I just sort of zoom out and forgive me for going long here but I think um this would be a good fod for for exploring this a bit more deeply you know one of the best um descriptions of brain function that I've ever heard is from the Nobel prize winning neuroscientist Richard Axel at Columbia who often talks about the brain creating abstractions of the outside world so if I were to take a photo of your face for instance and then show you that photograph you'd say yeah that's me but if I Were A Painter I might um you know swap some of the positions of of um components of your face and show it to you and you might say well that doesn't look like me and I'd say but that's my abstraction of your face so to me it makes sense because I understand the rules by which I made those swaps and moves there's some algor gorithms or rules that are are known to me so there's a s preservation of real world to the abstraction and that's really what our brain does all the time it attempts to Faithfully represent the the uh the world around us but it is indeed an abstraction and when it comes to the colors of things or the position of objects it's as one for one as our brain is capable of um but when it comes to ideas to feelings to our relationships to other people the brain abstracts those in a in its own little neural Symphony of this is the relationship to my dog this is the relationship to my friend and colleague Matt Walker so it makes sense that in dreams those algorithms could be different they could be faster or slower um but they could also be entirely different and I don't think we yet know what the algorithms of transformation of real world experience to dream experience are and once we do and I think somebody we will understand those through electrical recordings and MRI type um uh experiments and some of the experiments you talked about earlier point to this and so I think it's entirely reasonable to assume that we each have our own unique abstraction algorithms so that indeed we can have consistent representation of real world experiences in symbols but that it's not going to be the same for everybody correct right your way of abstracting your real life to your dream life could be entirely unique to you and mine could be entirely unique to me making it very difficult for a third party to come in and say okay Matt here's what your dream means but you can know what your dream means if you explore your dreams over time not just that one dream does that make sense it makes total sense because in some ways there is no one who knows your own autobiography by definition than you than yourself now I'm not suggesting that having that interpretation Guided by someone who also understands the emotional problems that you're having and also sees your blind spots which is what a really good therapist can do can then help with that interpretation but you're right because my representation of information in the brain is going to be very biased by also what I've experienced in the past and how that past experience augments and modulates the current representation of that information and thus the meaning of it for me the unique individual and you're also right to say that it's somehow you know it's almost as though you're squ inting your eyes when you're in dream sleep in terms of the true vision of things things get a little bit wacky and distorted this bizarre nature We There is some very interesting data and it comes back to what we described earlier the neurochemistry of the REM sleep State I told you that during REM sleep levels of neur adrenaline are at Flor levels neur adrenaline is shut off one of the things if you sort of drop neur adrenaline onto neural Circ it will very much increase what we call the signal to noise and this is why noradrenaline when it's released or if you administer it to an animal you can become very you can become almost um more directed you're much more Divergent you're focused in attending and it's really there you're very blinkered you're very focused but when that goes away the neural circuits become a little bit more Loosey Goosey and I also told you that the other chemical if there is a neurochemical that defines REM sleep dreaming it's this thing called acetycholine and acetycholine seems to do the opposite it seems to inject a little bit more noise relative to the signal so in other words your brain circuits are neurochemically modulated when you dream to inject almost what we would think of as fuzzy logic and this is why I think the analogy that we spoke about in a previous EP episode holds that when you are awake and you're given some information you produce the most obvious links and obvious associations because you're very much blinkered and you have nor adrenaline on board but when you go into dream sleep the it's almost like the Google search when you're awake you go straight to page one and it's very related but do that same search when you're in the dream state and it you know you go straight to page you know 35 and it's an utterly bizarre page and you think hang on a second this got nothing to do with the search term when you read it you think well a squint my eyes kind of does it's very distant very non-obvious but that's a very smart connection that as a waking brain I never would have put together so I think neurochemically we can start to understand it but I think this is a very good important Point were you could almost say the very best person to interpret your dreams it's probably you I want to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor whoop whoop is a fitness wearable device that tracks your daily activity and sleep but also goes beyond that by providing real-time feedback on how to adjust your training and sleep schedule to perform better as a whoop user I've experienced the health benefits of their technology firsthand for sleep tracking for monitoring other features of my physiology and for giving me a lot of feedback about metrics within my brain and body that tell me how hard I should train or not train and basically point to the things that I'm doing correctly and incorrectly in my daily life that I can adjust using protocols some of which are actually within the whoop app given that many of us have goals such as improving our sleep building better habits or just focusing more on our overall health whoop is one of the tools that can really help you get personalized data recommendations and coaching toward your overall health in addition to being one of the most accurate sleep trackers in the world whoop allows you to recover more quickly and fully from physical exercise and other kinds of stress and thereby to train more effectively and sleep better

specifically referring to nightmares uh I've had one nightmare countless times throughout my life um it's I won't share what it is um it's not a real world experience or at least it's not a one for one of real world experience but I've had this nightmare since I was a kid I have it seldom these days but every time it starts again I'm like oh no and there's a bit of Lucidity to it where I'm like I hear him again been working on this one a while um as you can imagine but given what we understand about the relationship between real world experiences and dreams what should we make of the fact that we have nightmares so let's just start there the phenomenon of nightmares does it represent something that troubled Us in the daytime and that we're trying to work out in our sleep um and then maybe we can get into some of the specifics around why regardless of whether or not the answer to that question is yes or no that we would have this thing called nightmares especially given that there's all this Machinery to make sure that we don't move and the nor adrenaline is low in the brain While We're Dreaming um seems like there's all all sorts of mechanisms to try and ensure that our dreams are very pleasant or at least neutral but um nightmares suck but um so I'd love to know me that t-shirt please so I'd love to know that they uh serve some utility so nightmares how do we Define a nightmare in sort of science clinically it's a little bit tricky but usually the way we Define it is it's a strongly unpleasant dream that causes some time of daytime um displeasure so in other words some type of daytime dysfunction or distress so everyone can have a bad dream but when you go up into your Waking Life and about your waking day it doesn't seem to bother you too much and maybe we'll just say that's a bad dream when it really becomes a nightmare is when I almost think of it as though you wake up and that blanket of strong nightmare emotion is still wrapped around you and you can feel it you can just know that my emotional state is still heavy and I know exactly where it came from and it was from that Nightmare and throughout the day you don't seem to be able to drobe yourself from that cloaked affect of The Nightmare it drenches you almost that's where it really starts to become unpleasant and we actually do have a clinical category it's called nightmare disorder and the way we typically Define that is the same thing as I said a very unpleasant dream that causes some type of daytime distress and it's happening at least once a week at that point we start to move it into this category of nightmare disorder what are nightmares doing if anything at all there are at least two theories one is that it's simply the system failing the system gone wrong and we're not processing we're not moving through things and therefore nightmares are maladaptive they're not warranted they're not normative the other is that no they are adaptive and they are meaningful and it's us really trying to go to a very specific pain point and we continue to process it over and over perhaps to the point where we get resolution but sometimes we just don't so it keeps cropping up we don't have good data to disambiguate those two right now so I think it still remains at least I don't know of any data that tells me are they functional or are they maladaptive even when we get that answer in some ways it doesn't change the fact that it still leaves a patient with nightmares with recurring nightmares so then what do you do about that how do we is there any treatment for people out there if they're under this distress is there hope and for a long time there really wasn't very much hope at all you just had to go through it but recently there was a a method that was developed and it's very effective and it is called IRT which stands for image rehearsal therapy and its basis comes back to something that in fact we um I think hopefully published the first evidence and humans of um some years ago now called memory reconsolidation so in our episode on learning and memory we said that there is at least sort of two main steps of memory first you have to imprint and learn the memory lay down that memory Trace but then that memory is very fragile and vulnerable to being overwritten by competing information knocked out of place and for you to hold on to that memory you have to go through a second step called memory consolidation a very slow process it's like a very slow pressing of the save button because it's biological it requires Pro prot synthesis and all of that good stuff but that always struck me as a strange model because it's the equivalent of opening up a Word document you type out all of the information into it and then you hit the save Buton so I've encoded imprinted the information that I've hit save and saved it and then I close that file and then the next day I come back or some days later and I double click on that file again because I want to edit it I either want to add to it or I want to revise it and change it but according to that model it's been logged in place and you could never edit that word document that seems like a profoundly useless way to store information and what we learned is that every time in subsequent days when you reactivate which is to say when you recollect the memory that has been Consolidated it opens that memory file back up to once again being plastic and malleable so you can go in and update the information in that memory store and then the next night you consolidate it again in other words you reconsolidate it so it's memory updating and there is a very clear mechanism in the human brain that allows us to do this memory updating iteratively time and time again this comes back to nightmare uh disorders this therapy image rehearsal therapy or IR will have you sit down with a therapist and at first you'll describe the nightmare that you're going through and you'll write that narrative down and then working with a therapist you will agree to think about a more neutral ending to that that nightmare so let's say that I was involved in a very um very difficult car crash was just horrific and every night since I'd say at least once a week I just continue to have the the nightmare of the car crash I know that I'm traveling towards the junction I apply the brakes the brakes have failed I am just looking around I'm trying to maneuver but nothing is going to change this I go through the red light and someone sideswipes me and that's the end and I relive that time and time again and it's awful so you with the therapist or I with a therapist would then start to say well what about the alternative iio I depress The Brak and the brakes don't work but gradually I think well I'm just going to reach over to the handbrake and I'm going to gradually apply the handbrake and that slowly is going to bring the car to a nice safe stop and then I'm going to call the emergency services the car is going to get towed I don't go through the junction I survive everything's fine so you rehearse this alternate ending and you keep going through that rehearsing that and then you go to sleep the next night and you'll probably have a high chance of that nightmare again but if you keep doing that once you've got that alternative ending essentially what you're trying to do is every time you reactivate the memory of the trauma car crash and then you rehearse this alternate ending it's like me going into the word document and editing the section that was really horrific and bad and replacing it with something that's neutral or even positive and over time then I sleep and I will consolidate that memory I'll come back back the next day and I'll do some more editing and more updating and Time After Time After Time gradually you dissipate the narrative that is fixed inside of the brain and the nightmare frequency decreases in proportion now it's not effective for 100% of patients if if you look at the data on average it's about two out of every three people so about 66% of people will benefit which if you look at some Medical Treatments that's that's a great treatment that's still very effective there was a very recent study from um uh Sophie Schwarz and her colleagues at the University of Geneva that did an even more ingenious study and they were able to nudge the effectiveness of that treatment from 66% up to 92% and they used an additional memory related research tool we've uh come up with in sleep science and it's called TMR or targeted memory reactivation and here's how it goes I'm going to have you learn a set of associations have you ever played that card game I think in America it's called memory which is very apt where you get a deck of cards and it has two of the same items two houses two cars two fire engines two cattles and you Shuffle the cards and then you put them face down in a big Square in a big Matrix and over time you have to turn over one card and it's a kettle and then I'm just going to randomly pick another card and it's a fire engine uh okay but gradually you start to learn where each one of the purs are located so what's clever about that is we would do that type of what's called a Pur Association me memory test you have you you learn these Pur Associates and then we test you after night of sleep and you're better however if for as you're turning those items over I play a congruent sound so let's say you turn over the fire engine and then when you turn over the other fire engine I'm going to start playing a fire engine noise in the background so I'm bonding the association of the memory card purs with this tone with this congruent sound and then a kettle I turn over a kettle I turn over the other Kettle and it's whistling and then when you let people sleep at night if you start replaying those same tones at a subway sub Awakening threshold so you're not waking people up and you bring them back and let's say that you only do those sound Q reactivations for half of the memories that you've done and the other half you leave untouched so with within an individual you have a unique within individual control you test them on the things that you didn't reactivate at night and those that you did it's almost like uh creating a bespoke playlist at night where you say look I learned all of this information during the day or wouldn't this be wonderful and then here is the stuff that I really think personally to me I want to remember well it turns out I'd been tagging that with particular music and then at night I replay that music and the next day it turns out that those things I reactivated are much more strongly Consolidated by way of sleep than those things I didn't so that's the basic method of what we call TMR targeted memory reactivation what they did was something very clever they had them go through this process of the image rehearsal therapy they were rehearsing the alternate ending but about every 10 seconds they were playing them this very pleasing piano chord in the background and they were just bonding the association of the new outcome ending to the nightmare with this Pleasant piano chord and then sure enough in the subsequent weeks afterwards Not only was that person day after day doing the diligent therapy practice of rehearsing the memory whilst the piano tone was playing but then at night they would wait until they went into REM sleep which is the state we think the emotional therapy begins and they would start to Replay that same piano chord over and over again and sure enough those people who had image rehearsal therapy standard they improved by about 60% in their nightmare frequency reduction those people who did that plus the memory reactivation at night it drove it from 66% all the way up to 92% so now modern-day Neuroscience with its techniques is starting to overlap with classical Clinical Psychology and we're developing these next Forefront of methods that really harness and fine-tune the brain's ability to undergo effective therapy it's incredible I mean I think that we've known about classical conditioning for a long time and the uh you know the the case of Pavlov's dogs is the most you know known of those um am I right in recalling that um this pair dissociation way of bringing about certain memories or strengthening certain memories in sleep can also be accomplished with odors um that it's not just the playing of tones during specific experiences but also for instance if one were to pair a particular odor with a certain uh novel memory event in the daytime or attempt to learn something new that if that odor is then infused into the room of the sleeping person later that night that somehow the the memories would be strengthened do I have that correct there's nothing wrong I've said it before I'll say it again nothing wrong with your memory that was one of the seminal papers that started this whole movement and what they did was they had them learn this kind of Pur associate card test but they were wearing this Mass almost looks like a fighter pilot mask and they were either puffing up inert air that was that didn't smell at all or they were perusing this very pleasant Rose scent because smell in particular has a very unique relationship with our memory in part because we emerged you know from animals that would principally use smell as their navigational tool I think everyone has had this experience where you Bond a certain cologne or a certain perfume with a particular individual so they were puffing The Rose perfume up the nose of these participants and then when they went into sleep they started to reperfuse that Rose odor now what was clever also about the experiment you could say well look just anytime you get something that smells puffed up your nose your memory is going to be better now the initial experiment had them learning the information when they're awake with the rose scent getting pushed up the nose and then when they slept they had the rose odor again another group did had learning but they had no rose smell pushed up their nose to bond with the information at the time of learning when they were awake and then when they slept they also had Rose odor stuffed up their nose and they showed no additional benefit so it's not just enough to have Rose odor at night you need to have made the initial bonded familiar connection with the novel information that you're learning to get the subsequent targeted memory reactivation benefit and you could then think well practical tools what should I do maybe you know when I'm learning for studying for a test I should blaze up my you know my most preferred incense and I'm I have a particular proclivity to green tea incense it turns out and maybe then before I go to bed at night I get a couple of sticks and I you know Blaze them back up took my head on the pillow turn the light out however do not do that because it's probably a desperate fire hazard so do not listen to me but you could think about doing something along those lines perhaps anyway um so that's targeted memory reactivation yeah um it's a perf segue for what I wanted to talk about next which is lucid dreaming um but um before we move to lucd Dreaming I'm wondering whether or not there's a an opportunity here to construct an experiment maybe even a protocol of sorts to uncouple the negative experience of nightmares to our daily experience could you so for instance we're talking about pair dissociation based on odors or sound replayed in sleep to um sort of nudge um or conjure particular daytime memories to the surface in the form of dream sleep yeah but we also know that one can uncouple um associations so for instance um if one experienced something negative and maybe this is being attempted in the in the realm of of trauma therapy um and that experience was paired with a particular odor it would be hard to do with visual cues and sleep or sound um could one um attempt to introduce a sort of a competing sound you know set up a sort of a collision um uh stimulus so that in sleep the the dream would no longer contain the the scary content or it would be less scary or is this exactly the wrong approach because if we believe that the nightmares are serving some functional purpose allowing us to work through what you really don't want to do right okay great then we answer the question well no I I think it's I think it's unclear right now but you're on the right line because there is something that we have in in learning in memory called fear Extinction and let's say that I were to sort of classic pavlovian learning Pavlov's dogs let's say I show you a specific image on the screen and then you hear a specific tone and then you get an electric shock I show you the stimulus on the screen you hear the specific tone and then you get an electrical shock that I don't show you the S stimulus on the screen but you do still hear the tone and then what happens is that you have a braced response to the electrical shock and there's all sorts of combinations in between of that but essentially I condition you to learn that these things seem to be associated with a negative outcome the inverse being the pavlovian dog which is that you ring a bell you show the dog some food and it salivates you ring the bell show the dog some food and it salivates and then you ring the bell you don't give it some food and it still salivates because it knows that the Bell precedes the the meat being shown and I actually mixed my um my order around there in my own experiment to begin with but then there's something different that you can do you can start to perhaps change the sound or the bonded connection and then you don't start getting the shock anymore so that same ringing of the Bell now is no longer consistently associated with the food and gradually you decondition the dog such that after some time it learns oh I started to learn that the Bell predicted food but now it no longer does and it takes some time to remove that and that's what we call Extinction you've induced an association and then you gradually extinguish it by way of that alternate Training Method so the question then became could we use that type of method but during sleep could we train you up on a fear memory and then just begin the early signs of extinguishing of deconditioning you but then we don't do that very much we wait until sleep and we continue the deconditioning protocol and sure enough sleep seems to be as if not more effective at extinguishing those fear memories than when you enact the protocol during wakefulness so here is a very good example of where you can use this sleep dependent memory processing tapestry this opportunity to harness not just to strength memories that you wish to keep but start to extinguish memories you wish to remove and so I think it's a very exciting it's right on the cusp of what we're starting to do right now but I love it because I think some people would like to experience certain dreams and other people would like to uh not experience certain nightmares which reminds me of a a tool that Rick Rubin taught me um I don't know of any experiments that uh support this directly but I've tried this and and it certainly has worked first time and every time which is Rick said um if you wake up from a dream and you want to remember your dream and you or and or you found it Pleasant or interesting lay there completely still with your eyes closed and it will come to you um whereas if you wake up from a nightmare which many people do and um in a state of anxiety and you have a hard time kind of shaking the the disturbing AFF effect associated with that nightmare to move your body get up and move your body and maybe even flip some lights on something that normally I don't suggest in the middle of the night but waking up from a nightmare can be quite quite um disturbing and it can be um disturbing enough that it makes it difficult to fall back asleep um so and by the way he's he's he's right I I don't know if he's read the science or it's he's just it's knowing Rick he's probably just because he's so Yoda likee he's probably intuited Supernatural levels of insight tens of thousands of scientific articles but he's absolutely right one of the ways if you really wish to remember your dreams is not just jump up out of bed and start trying to write them down don't lie in bed keep your eyes closed and gradually rehearse that dream over and over in your mind almost as though you're scoring it into the etched surface your memory Trace more and more and gradually when you've re sort of capitulated and pieced back the jigsaw puzzle then gradually open your eyes start to dictate start to write down but don't do it immediately because as soon as you start doing it it begins to float away it begins to dissolve in a way that's you you sort of you know you're running and you're trying to reach your hand out F exactly that's why I use the The Voice Memos last night I woke up in the middle of the night from a dream and I decided to turn on voice memos and I remember thinking I'll remember this in the morning and I remember you never remember this in the morning that is a perfect segue for lucid dreaming which is uh the awareness that we are dreaming well in a dream uh is lucid dreaming real can we train ourselves to lucid dream and what is the value of lucid dreaming is it just a fun um game we can play is there any is there any reason we should attempt to lucid dream if we don't already or encourage more lucid dreaming or even any reason we shouldn't perhaps um lucid dreaming you beautifully gave the definition Loosely defined lucid dreaming is that you simply know that you're dreaming whilst you are dreaming so in other words as the dream is unfolding you gain awareness of ah this is a dream but I'm still dreaming at that moment by science definition you are in a state of Lucidity but most people don't really mean that when they say oh I'm a lucid dreamer they mean yes I'm I become aware that I'm Dreaming as I am dreaming and then I take over the Reigns of control and then starting to decide exactly what it is you dream and how you dream so now I'm on the ground and I'm walking through a park and I decide that I just want to take off and I want to fly over the river or I want to fly out over San Francisco Bay and take a tour so I decide to start flying that is what most people think of as lucid dreaming if you were to think about it this thing called Dreaming as we've described is utterly absurd as a state based on its psychotic kind of Nature and characteristics to then start to say it's that idiotic and strange and bizarre but PS I can also take control of it and decide what I want to do with it injects a whole dose of disbelief into a process that's already unbelievable by itself so science for a while just thought this is charlatan type stuff that these people claim that they can control their dreams how can you ever prove that because don't forget when you go into rem's sleep and you dream you are paralyzed so I can't just wake up and say I was lucid dreaming that's not proof I have to in some ways be able to demonstrate that I'm lucid dreaming as I begin to become Lucid but I can't because I can't communicate with you as the scientist well it turns out that you can one of the things we spoke about in the first episode is that yes you get these rapid eye movements but think about what that means I told you that when you dream your brain paralyzes all of your voluntary muscles so that you can dream and dream safely and you don't act out your dreams with the exception that at least two muscle groups your extraocular muscles that move your eyes and your inner ear muscles for some reason they are spurred from the paralysis so you can still move otherwise you could never have rapid eye movements so the eyes all of a sudden because we have electrodes up top and below and left and right sides we can measure what you're doing with your eyes during sleep in fact we have to do this to determine are you awake or are you in REM sleep the brain activity by itself doesn't tell us that we measure your muscle activity and if you lose muscle activity and your brain is very active and the eye channels that we're recording start to show these darting back and forth signals we know you're in Ram sleep that's how we Define it so that then suggested to us we can use the eye movements to create a form of Morse code signaling from the participant to the experiment and so let's say that with this claimed Lucid dreamer who comes to my sleep center we'll create a very specific greed upon code which is that as you start dreaming I can see that and when you become Lucid in that dream firstly give me three leftward flicks of your eyes we never see that in dreaming it's a very deliberative act and then when you say okay I'm I've started the lucid dreaming and you've agreed with the experiment that you're then going to start um moving your hands you're going to start to move your right hand well when you start to move your right hand give me four flicks to the right and when you're moving your left hand in the dream give me four flicks to the left and so there we create this very specific instigation code but then how does that help help us well we can have you sleeping in a brain scanner and before the brain scanning session when you sleep I have you just go into the brain scanner awake and I say move your left hand and your right motor cortex is going to be lighting up and then I'm going to say move your right hand and your left motor cortex is going to be lighting up and for you and me I build up a very unique map of your left hand motor memory representation and your right hand motor memory representation and if it's the left hand as I said it's the right side of the brain if it's the right hand it's the left side of the brain so now I've got ground truth as to where your hand representation is on your motor cortex in my brain scanner and then I'm going to put you back in the brain scanner let you go into sleep let you start dreaming then you give me three left flicks good this person has now become lucid and now he's doing four rightward flicks which which means he's clasping his right hand over and over again and then he gives me four leftwood flicks which means he switched over he's now using his left hand in his dream by the way I'm looking at the participant inside of the brain scanner through the glass and of course they're not moving their hand why because they're paralyzed but in the dream they are claiming based on their eye movements that they are moving their hands we bring them back out of the brain scanner and we analyze their brain scans during the period when they said I'm moving my right hand I'm moving my left hand what did we see sure enough we saw the same and we being the Royal wi it's a great study by a German group sure enough you see exactly the same pattern it was scientific groundtruth evidence that when a lucid dreamer claims they are doing something in the dream the brain scans that we received confirmed that indeed that's exactly what was happening it's just that none of the signal is being sent out to the periphery to the limbs because there's that that um cut off at the spinal cord descending inhibition yeah at the level of the alphao neurons if your spinal cord incredible so here we are talking about lucid dreaming which is a kind of mixed level of Consciousness dreaming of course but also Lucidity that is an awareness that one is dreaming now in just about every one of the five episodes leading up to this sixth episode in this series you emphasize the key importance of deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep and in many ways some of the problems that arise from waking up in the middle of the night too many times or being in Shallow sleep as opposed to Deep Sleep lucid dreaming it seems is a kind of a case of light sleep because of one's awareness or is it so that's one the first question and then just very quickly an anecdote when I was a kid I used to read these like boy life magazines and those kind of things I for what they called but in the back they would have these um these ads for for products like x-ray glasses or you know or um or sea monkeys which turned out to be Brian shrimp what a disappointment that was um and um I thought they were monkeys on the on the package they were little monkeys but they were Brian shrimp um there was a product advertised that I in fact purchased which was an ey mask that had a little blinking red light in one corner and it said learn to lucid dream and the idea was that you would put this thing on and look at the red light just prior to going to sleep and then you go to sleep with this thing on and then at some point in your sleep you would see or think that you saw the red light flashing and the idea was that because you were in the ey mask you're in enough of a dream that you would be able to link the waking State recognition of the light Etc okay people get it I purchased that product I used it I thought perhaps there was an effect quote unquote where I could lucid dream but I wouldn't consider myself an avid Lucid dreamer although sometimes I am aware that I'm dreaming and usually it's in um pleasant dreams in which case I'm usually like yeah let's keep this going things like flying and and being you know particularly talented in a sport that in my Waking Life I had minimal Talent things like that okay so is lucid dreaming a case of shallow sleep and therefore something to avoid or is lucid dreaming something quite different and is there any advantage to learning to lucid dream or enhancing one's amount of lucid dreaming and if so how should one go about that so I'll take the question should you be lucid dreaming and I think I can argue it both sides right now and we don't have a very clear answer yet the first side is if you take a step back and ask from an evolutionary perspective let's assume for for want of a better worth that lucid streaming is helpful it's meaningful and that we should engage in it if that's the case that it confers some type of evolutionary benefit then you would expect that a lot of people would be doing it but if you look at the statistics somewhere between maybe just 10 to 20% of the population are natural lucid dreamers and so from an evolutionary perspective I could say well if it was so powerful it was so meaningful because we know everyone sleeps and for the most part we can say that almost everyone dreams if that's the case then those must clearly serve a purpose but the fact that very few people are lucid dreamers doesn't that tell us that it isn't necessarily beneficial so from that perspective I can play those numbers there is an inherent flaw in my argument there however because that assumes based on the argument I've just given you that we have stopped evolving and of course we have not and so perhaps that 10 to 10 to 20% of the population who are natural lucid dreamers are at the Forefront of homonid evolution and they're the next Super rate we shouldn't be worried about AI we should be worried about the lucid dreams because they're going to come and take over the world so I can argue it from that perspective which is just a philosophical argument it doesn't have weighted data to it but there is some data some individuals have asked the question is there any changes to your sleep or even the benefits of sleep when you are a lucid dreamer versus not and what's interesting is that for some papers that have been published after nights when people report lucid dreaming they wake up and they don't feel as restored they don't feel as refreshed by their sleep in the morning suggest just as you sort of hinted at the that the lucid dreaming state is associated with perhaps a less deep or more shallow form of REM sleep or a more active state of REM sleep perhaps too active so that it's fatiguing and depleting and upon Awakening you don't get that memory and that body that brain and body reset there are however a few papers that have not found that result so I think right now we don't truly know if the Lucid state is associated with unrefreshing sleep and unrest of sleep but if that proves true then I think that that's one argument the other argument I would put forward against it from that perspective would be think about what we've said regarding the functions of dreaming memory processing but particularly emotional therapy to gift us mental health if we then come along and say presumably you know nature through millions of years of evolution has come up with this this blueprint Manifesto of exactly what should be served up on the dream menu this evening that's there's a reason for that and that reason has been sculpted over millions of years to become wonderfully optimal for us and our emotional mental health and then we come along in the space of a lifetime and perhaps you could argue a little bit humoristic we think h i perhaps know a little bit better than a couple of million years of evolution I'm going to push those things off the rank ordering chart of what gets served up into my dreams and I'm going to supersede that and decide what I would prefer to be dreaming about and again I think that there's no good evidence that you could argue that that isn't true but equally that it is true we just don't know yet it if that is the case that lucid dreaming does produce unrest of sleep in some ways it also begs the question well what is happening in your brain during lucid dreaming is there anything in your brain that would explain why you don't feel refreshed and early studies looking at lucid dreamers when we put them inside of a brain scanner I told you at the start of this episode dream sleep has a unique brain signature memory regions emotion regions motor regions and visual Regions they're all lighting up but then there's this one part of your brain that does the opposite which is the lateral uh left and right sides of your prefrontal cortex The Logical rational thinking controlling regions of your brain those go offline but early studies demonstrated that the activity including the electrical activity over those frontal regions would be down as you were in non lucid dreaming but then when people rise back up and said now I'm lucid dreaming with those leftward flicks that activity was brought back online which makes a lot of mechanistic sense which is all of a sudden the part of your brain that prevented you from having rational logical control has been re-engaged and as a consequence you yourself can re-engage in volitional dictation of the outcome of what you're dreaming some studies however have not replicated that finding because when they looked at it and they took out some uh sort of what we call these um covariates or these confounding factors and I can bore you with what that principle is it removed that result and all of a sudden the prefrontal cortex went back to seemingly being nonactive they did find an alternate result what they found is that the electrical activity of the brain when you go into a lucid dreaming State seems to be a bit more frenetic a bit more active versus non-lucid dreaming states of electrical brain activity and if that's the case if the cortex which is already active is forced to become even more frenetically active when you are in this lucid dream state is that part of the reason that when you wake up from the lucid dreaming and you go about your day your brain just doesn't seem to be at the same operating ability because it's being fatigued above and beyond it's like saying I do a standard workout and I always go to you know one or two reps before failure but now as I'm lucid dreaming I am constantly going to complete muscle failure and then the next few days if you go and do a workout and I've been listening you and I have been trading workouts I don't want to do an Andrew hubman workout trust me you are this man is mine are short short and sweet this I I'm well let we'll work out at some point together but it's it's almost as though then no big surprise that after you do a legs day if I were to wake you up the next day and say you're back doing legs she said I can't do that I'm toast I'm host my legs are done and that's what we think could perhaps explain why you get that fatigue does that make some sense makes very good sense and you know in the absence of of better language to put to it I've long thought that one of the best things about sleep is that we are not engaging our frontal cortex that much in sleep um and as we talked about in an earlier episode The frontal cortex during waking is responsible for things such as the suppression of reflexes I mean it has to do that according to context of a situation it's a lot of work um and the frontal cortex does a great number of other things as well but I think one of the most wonderful things about sleep is that we get re release and um a break from all of that analysis of duration path and outcome you know what's how long is something going to take what path is it do I need to take in order together what's the outcome going to be all that analysis of things past present and future it's work it's it's mental it's mental work and I think that if if you tell me and I think you just did that lucid dreaming involves any kind of um encroachment of duration path outcome type of analysis into my sleep my personal preference is going to be to not lucid dream I'd rather just have very robust perhap you know dreams of different kinds and try to make sense of them once I wake up but it's so tempting though isn't it because like you I've had those experience I remember an amazing dream where I was snowboarding and I'm I am a below average snowboarder and all of a sudden I was just taking jump and I was doing all sorts of X game you're sha white I was it was unbelievable and I felt so and I was so happy in the moment and I remember waking up and just thinking firstly I'm sad I'm waking up right and second that was Sublime and all I want to do tomorrow night is go back and now I'm going to switch my snowboard out for a dirt bike and I'm going to do the dirt bike X Games version of it and going to be doing all sorts of Superman can't get greedy with Mother Nature know know she body slams you I get it I know if people out there are are you know enjoying it or wanting to do that um and by the way I didn't answer I'm so sorry your um red light question which is if you wanted to do it how can you do it if you're not doing it already there are in fact two scientific methods that have been developed one of them actually has a vague whiff of relationship ship to the light device although that's one of those things where if you know if a friend sent it to me or a random person said oh Dr I've seen this in the back of a magazine do you think it works I would just say please go and spend your $199 on something that is going to yeah I think I was about 11 or 12 years old I think it cost something like I $10.99 or something which at the time for me was a lot of money but I had a paper rout I had a paper route back then and I had a little little bit of of a a disp I income but um it was cool cuz it was it was probably one of my first experiments I've been running experiments since I was a kid but but I I think self experimentation can be fun provided you can see that but sorry coming back to your red light the two methods one of them is something called the mild technique which stands for the pneumonic induction of lucid dreaming m i l d pneumonic just meaning a memory based technique induction obviously what we're trying to induce something and what is it we're trying to induce lucid dreaming and it's a very simple technique which is that you consistently rehearse before bed this notion that I will remember my dreams and I will instigate control in my dreams and you do this and it sounds just so hokey and non-scientific sure enough you do this over and over again the probability that you will loci a dream increases I think the better one maybe the more effective one is called the reality testing method and it was probably made famous in a brilliant movie if you haven't seen it everyone should watch it it's called Waking Life and it is an amazing Richard linklater uh the director it just for the philosophy alone in it it will blow your mind it's exceptional but it's a beautiful tretis on dreaming and lucid dreaming and in that they describe a method where during the waking day you are constantly perhaps you can set an alarm and you're constantly reminded to go over to let's say the wall and flip the light switch on and off on and off on and off and sure enough what happens the lights go on and off why because it's the real world and it complies and it's complicit with the laws of physics so you do this time and time again and you start to train yourself that at unique moments throughout your waking experience you always go over and you test some version of reality and it or it could just be I'm going to press my hand into something solid and this table is resisting my hand right now as I'm pressing and I just keep doing that and then at some point it becomes routine enough that you start to do that same thing when you are dreaming but now when I press my hand against the table or press my hand against the wall my hand goes straight through the wall or I flip the light switch on and off and the lights do nothing and all of a sudden that's my cue to say I'm not awake am I I'm I'm dreaming and therefore at that point I gain Lucidity and it increases the probability so those are the two methods that people have used and statistically scientifically they do seem to have some degree of success I love it I love it I personally I'm going to opt to not encourage lucid dreaming because I'm and myself because I'm I'm working on getting my sleep deeper and longer uh through the night with uh fewer waking episodes we will get that we will get there using the tools described in the previous and this episode of the uh of the series that we're doing here my sleep's been excellent at times pretty good at other times and and lousy at others which I think makes me well qualified um to talk about tools for sleep because I feel like I've come at it from every level of of performance very much and by the way um Shield swort in hand I'm right there by your side we'll we'll make it happen don't worry well thank you uh truly okay so sadly we are nearing the end of this six episode series and here we are in the sixth episode however last night before leaving the studio I decided to put out a word on social media on X AKA Twitter and on Instagram asking people what questions they have about sleep and I made it very Broadband you know I said ask anything you want about sleep Matt Walker will will do his best to answer and of course we had thousands and thousands and thousands of questions um and we're grateful let's push on through till dawn which completely violates every one of the six EP I'm they'll benefit we'll we'll struggle however we were able to um bin those responses into most frequently Asked uh most frequently liked Etc and so while we can't ask every question of you uh what I thought would be fun and very informative uh for the listeners is to ask 10 of the most popular questions um and fingers on buzzers no confering here we go and these are questions for which I I think there are practical answers um and so we'll do this not in Rapidfire Q&A but in uh let's just say a bridged format and then um perhaps we have you back another time um to uh answer more of the the questions before we get into these questions I will say that many of the questions that were asked uh of the uh by the audience in those comments um were in fact answered in the earlier five episodes of this podcast series with Matt Walker as well as the one that that we held today on on dreams and lucid dreaming so if you don't hear the answer to these uh to your question here and you have a burning question chances are your question was answered in a previous episode and all of those episodes are um time stamped in a lot of detail so people can navigate quickly to the topics most of interest to them so without further Ado questions from the audience first question is about best practices for managing rumination and negative thoughts when trying to fall asleep meaning if somebody is ruminating and they're having negative thoughts when they're trying to fall asleep what should they do in order to get past that and fall asleep short circuit you need to Short Circuit that situation and the way that you can do that is through a variety of methods there are multiple methods for short circuiting rumination the first I would recommend and it's something I practice meditation but really all of these that I'll describe are about getting your mind off itself that's the biggest problem regarding anxiety and sleep onset insomnia which is what I think this person is describing so meditation allows you it's either guide Ed and you're speaking about what you should be doing with your breathing or relaxation uh guided meditations all of those stop your mind from being able to play on itself and go through that Rolodex of anxiety you can do breathing techniques you can listen to sleep stories you can do your own type of body scan anything that you can you can do and something we described which is seems to be a quite effective method is taking yourself on a mental walk close your eyes and a walk that you know intensely well with Vivid 4K detail replicate that to the L I left foot on the first step down the steps take a right at the driveway up I go walk up the hill look to the left the bay is out there it's 5:00 p.m. the sun is starting to set that level of detail and usually when you do any one of these things the next thing that you remember is that you're waking up in the morning because you are able to Short Circuit that would be the best advice terrific and I must say the other night I woke up in the middle of the night and was having a little bit of trouble falling back asleep and I used this mental walk approach and it and it worked um oh very very well so thank you I um the next question is what is the best position to sleep in best body position best body position is probably the absence of the worst that would be your back and it's ill advised mostly for people who snore when you are on your back the likelihood of you you snoring and that Airway collapsing entirely and you having what's called a hypoxic event where you stop breathing entirely is significantly higher than if you sleep on your side or on your front so I would say that for most people if you know that you don't snore if your partner says I don't hear you snoring that's partial confirmation that you do not snore if you are curious and everyone should be everyone should be curious as to whether they snore I would say download an app and we can link to it I have no affiliation with whatsoever I pay my money I think it's like Pennies on the dollar it's like $2 a month or something and it is called snore lab so the word snore and then lab and you download it and it's an app and it is uh something that you install on your phone and then you say start recording and you place your phone face down and it listens to you all night and it records your breathing nothing more can't know what you're doing or saying don't worry there's privacy but it assesses your breathing and then it will show you a distribution of your snoring throughout the night and it categorizes that snoring from quiet no snoring to mild snoring to moderate to Epic and it literally is like a RTO shock and you will see very clearly if you are snoring or not wor still and impactful most is that you can go to those spikes when you are snoring and you can replay it and it is quite frightening to hear yourself struggling for breath if you see a confirmation of snoring by way of that snor La go and see your doctor that is the best advice 80% of people who have sleep apnea or snoring or in sensation of breathing are undiagnosed right now and it will take years off your life and when you get treated it is transformational patient once told me when I got treated with with my sleep app device I felt like I was 10 years younger it was almost as though and I'll remember it to the day I die it was almost as though someone came along and wiped a fogged glass clear and I could finally see that was the trans so my advice is if you think you are snoring stay away from back sleeping from sleeping on your back from sleeping on your back and even if you don't suspect you are a snorer just download this app you get a couple of nights for free just do it for a couple of nights consistently and then ask also by the way if you take on board alcohol and you have mild snoring it is very clear I would be highly surprised if on the nights that you drink you don't get a significant increase in your score of snoring terrific the next question is why does my body wake up at 3:30 a.m. and I'm presuming their mind as well no matter what time I go to sleep so to that question and we will have spoken about this before my first response is how do you know it's 3:30 and their response is because I look at the clock that's the first problem take all clock faces away from your sight when you are sleeping it is only going to reinforce it the second is that 3:30 can sometimes or if it's a consistent time it's not there's no sort of special thing about 3:30 it's just for this person people wake up at very specific times quite reliably so part of that is because they're going through very reliably timed sleep cycles and every time we finish a REM sleep period we wake up but it's normally very brief and the reason is because we've been in paralysis and the body needs to move so we wake up we make a postural shift we move in our bed just slightly and then we go back to sleep it happens to us all for some of us we will wake up and then we will stay awake and that's why it seems to be so religiously timed to certain specific moments in our night but this other sort of individual mention no matter what time I go to bed I seem to always wake up there that to me smells of a suggestion of reinforced learning that you've woken up a couple of times you've checked the clock and now you have taught your brain very very quickly that I always wake up at 3:30 in the morning and lo and behold what happens is that you start to do that more frequently the more frequently it happens the more times that you check the stronger that memory Association becomes the more likely it is to happen remove the clock face from the bed room terrific uh can we Bank sleep or catch up on Lost sleep it's a great question you you can and you cannot Bank sleep and it is directional so what we found is that for certain things such as let's say um an immune um vaccination or learning in memory if you are sleep deprived let's say the night after learning a specific task and lots of people have done this so you are deprived the first night after learning and that first night we know is critical for consolidating saving those memories but then the next day I don't test you in the way I would normally do instead I give you a full recovery night of sleep or maybe I give you two full recovery nights of sleep and then I test you do you show any evidence of a memory consolid consolidation benefit and the answer is no you don't in other words if you don't sleep the first night after learning you lose the chance to consolidate those memories so there sleep in that sense is an all in nothing think phenomenon if you don't snooze you lose in that regard and there are other examples of that downstairs in the body that is what happens when you go into a debt and then you try to pay it back with later credit and it fails you can't seem to do that with sleep so in that sense sleep is not like the bank in that direction you can't accumulate a debt and then let's say at the weekend after short sleeping during the week see if you can pay off that debt at some lat pointed time it doesn't work like that so for example if I deprive you Andrew hubman of sleep tonight let's say it's an 8 Hour opportunity and then tomorrow I give you all of the recovery sleep that you want and then on a second night third night fourth night do you sleep longer those subsequent nights yes you do but you only sleep back about 50% about four extra hours in fact if you look at the data it's usually less it's usually around two so only about 25% of the eight hours that you lost so you are all always running a debt and if that's the case if you can't truly pay back your sleep debt and you're constantly running that short sleep cycle you are it's like compounding interest on the loan it just escalates dramatically and that's why I think we see that short sleep really does predict ill health outcomes and more an early mortality the later and later in life that you go however there is a different form of sleep banking I told you that here you're going into a debt and you're trying to pay it off with credit later what if you had the inverse let's say that you are a a doctor or a nurse or um you are working in the emergency services and you know that you have two nights where you're on nights and it you're going to be probably very busy and you're not going to be sleeping well for the next two nights and that's going to be next Monday and Tuesday and I'm Curr L on Wednesday in the week prior there is something that has been demonstrated called Sleep banking which is where I know I'm going to go into debt so I sleep longer and I create credit to begin with and then I spend that credit as I go into debt and it seems to lessen the impact of that debt it doesn't remove the impact entirely but it does lessen it so here it's the inverse I'm not going into debt and then trying to pay it off later I build up credit and then I can spend that credit with debt so there is a form of sleep banking that seems to be present but it's not the Sleep banking that most people think about does that make I know it's very confusing but I tried to be clear about made it very clear that you can um buffer some of the Sleep loss that you anticipate um but there's no there's no retroactive saving of of what you lost that's right um what are some of the best practices is for getting back to sleep after waking up in the middle of the night there I would say there are several things first don't try too hard because trying to get back to sleep and become frustrated is very much like trying to remember someone's name sleep is just like this that the harder you try the further you push it away and as soon as you stop up all of a sudden that name just pops back into your head and it's the same way with sleep now previously I've said you don't want to spend a lot of time awake in bed because you learn the association that your bed is the place of wakefulness and every time you come in at night you're always wide awake and you don't know why despite having fallen asleep watching television just 20 minutes earlier the other suggestion however is most people don't want to get out of bed it's dark it's cold I get it I understand it the other thing to do in this situation is enjoy the concept of rest so wouldn't it be wonderful if in the middle of your working day someone said look just come away from your desk now and here is a beautiful calm bedroom it smells very nice nice dim light I would like you to lie down no need to fall asleep don't fall asleep just lie down on the bed or on the couch and just rest for the next 30 or 40 minutes just have a wonderful good old rest that sounds lovely and if you are struggling to fall back asleep and you've listened to me and the idiocy of what I've been describing over the past six episodes you you could start to get very stressed and say gosh well sleep is doing this and this and this and and I'm now and it's been 20 minutes and I can't fall back you just get more and more stressed instead take a different approach at that point instead of if you all the techniques that we've spoken about getting your mind off itself and we list them just now and we've listed them in a previous episode if none of those are working and you just can't catch it don't worry just say to yourself you know what tonight is not my night and he told me it's okay and it really is it's it's fine tomorrow night is going to be a better night tonight instead rather than trying to force myself to sleep I'm just going to lie here maybe with my eyes open I'm just going to rest I'm just going to enjoy and not stress I'm just going to enjoy a good old rest in my bed and once again the next thing that happens is that the sun has emerged it's bright in your room despite the blackout curtains and your alarm is going off because as soon as you relaxed out of the state of trying sleep came back in a resplendant didn't way terrific someone asks quote I used to be a great sleeper but as I've gotten older and then they mention that they're 65 currently I find that I wake up much earlier than I did previously and it's difficult for me to get more than six hours of sleep what do you think is going on and what are some remedies the first question I would want to ask is how do you feel on 6 hours of sleep and we can go from there if you are imper and you're struggling during the day and this person sounds as though they are unhappy with that 6 hours then we can start to have a conversation what would that conversation sound like I want to understand perhaps the reason that you can't get back asleep and we'll begin these techniques that we've spoken about for trying to get back to sleep let's say that you've gone to bed at 10:00 and you normally would like to wake up at 6:00 but you're always waking up at 4:00 and there's just nothing you can do at that stage you just don't feel the sleepiness over you weighing you down and there's no amount of these methods are going to help you you just have to get up we see this a lot in older adults sleep late in the night is very fragile much greater probability of them waking up in the second half of the night and the last quarter it's also miserable because most older adults the Cadian Rhythm shifts earlier I told you that as we go through our teen years our Cadian Rhythm shifts it gets sort of pushed into the the future and we like to go to bed much later and wake up much later and then into older adult sort of into well adulthood it drags back a little bit and we find our sweet spot but then as we get older it starts to regress back to what happened when we were children we want to stay up late but we can't we go to bed so early and we wake up early some regression happens as we get older by the way it's the reason that there is the quote unquote early bird special in Florida where a lot of people retire it's the early bird special because most people are to bed by you know 9:00 p.m. and they want to be eating starting to eat at 4 p.m. so how do you deal with that one way is you can use one of the four methods the four sort of macros of good sleep that we spoke about Q qrt quantity quality regularity timing here I would say see if you can delay your bedtime as best you can if your bedtime is 10: and you would like and you're normally waking up at 6:00 but you're consistently waking up at 4:00 start trying to go to bed at 11 p.m. push push push as hard as you can until you are so sleepy you sleep and then you will it will take a couple of days to build up that sort of remembering of from your brain and the de that to begin with you'll go to bed now at 11: and you'll wake up at 4: again and things are even worse but after a while you're building up this pressure to sleep and all of a sudden you're going to bed again at 11: but your brain thinks I have had four nights of now just 5 hours of sleep this I'm not doing this anymore I'm going to sleep through until 5: and you can keep moving your schedule later because when older adults are waking up at 4:00 and they can't get back it's also miserable because the rest of the world is asleep and the people they want to engage with have a social life you know call the kids uh speak with their grandkids they can't do any of that so it's a very difficult situation if those things don't work you can also speak to a board-certified sleep medicine clinician cbti cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia which you we've spoken about in this episode is also effective for older adults to help them stay asleep if that doesn't work and you don't like to think about a psychological treatment there are some medications people think I'm probably a bit anti-m medication because I've been very vocal about classic sleeping pills but there are some sleeping medications that I think do show promise I'm not anti- pharmacology by any means one of them that's been shown to be effective for older adults is something called dopin and and trazadone 2o although there is some sort of push back a little bit by the community against trazadone and there's a new class of drugs that we've spoken about in a previous episode called the Doras the jeel orexin receptor antagonists d r a small s so I've spoken about three there trazodone dopin the Doras by the way I'm a scientist not a medical doctor this is scientifically descriptive not medically prescriptive tesone has perhaps been used more so if anything to help people who strug to fall asleep doyin if you look at the data is a medication that's much more helpful for keeping people asleep and including in a especially it seems for older adults and there it's lower dose doxin I think if you look at the data 3 milligrams and 6 milligram doses have been effective you can get it in pill form although usually not in those Doses and you have to end up cutting pills in half because it comes in 12 milligram there is a liquid solution that is provided and there I think the standard dose starts at around half a milliliter so you get a little syringe and it's a 1 mm syringe and you suck up that um half a milliliter and then you just put it in a drink in the last half an hour before bed it's tasteless and it helps you stay asleep so there are a variety of different things you can do just go try for rest and just give yourself the chance push your bed to a later time point you can also try cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia and you can speak with your physician about some sleep medications terrific there were a good number of people that asked about sleep and menopause um one question was quote since entering menopause I have not gotten a good night's sleep in years um I think this question dovetails with the previous question I mean it could be age related right could be directly related to menopause um so are you aware of any specific treatments that you haven't covered in the course of this uh Q&A that are unique to menopause I think the answer you just gave um to whom ever asked uh the question about you know how to get more sleep or better sleep as one has gotten older should probably handle the answer to this question but what of the um men and paa's specific requirements for getting um better sleep it is a huge problem in um premenopausal and perimenopausal uh women and of course women going through uh menopause it's principally because of what we call the vasom motor symptoms of of menopause which is to say these hot flashes where you just get EX sort of really for the body at Le quite extreme increases in temperature you get so hot and don't forget in our um episode two we spoke about how you need to regulate temperature and there's a very beautiful and complex relationship between temperature and sleep and we said you need to stay cool to stay as sleep but here is a situation where when you're asleep you're not staying cool you're doing the opposite you're getting warm and that is the adversarial thermal situation for staying asleep and so individuals wake up and then they struggle to get back to sleep I would say and we know the reasons why too some of the other issues with sleep are problematic it has to do with some of the sex hormone changes and uh I think I've myself have released a a podcast on this um specific issue and I won't go into the mechanisms as to why I'll speak about the treatments one treatment which is non-medication based is trying to make your bedroom cool but also using these smart mattresses now I've spoken to Mato the CEO of eight sleep another fantastic product and he has had a huge amount of feedback from menopausal women saying that that cooling mattress has been very helpful for their vasom motor symptoms so that's one method you can go down the the other is a medication method and here I need to be very careful I'm going to speak about bioidentical hormone replacement therapy for menopause now there is a lot of controversy again I don't have a horse in the race I would simply say if you want to think about this you have done a fantastic podcast on female health and female reproductive health I know our friend Petra Tia has got a very clear stance on female hormone replacement therapy and the absence of fear one has to have around the risk of breast cancer and if you listen to him he will excise or at least he has disabused I think many people of the belief that that is a concern but it's a very personal choice it's a woman's choice no one but a woman can decide but I would say that when women have gone into bio bioidentical hormone replacement therapy one of the things that benefits is also sleep because it brings back under control some of the these symptoms it reinstates some of the uh renormalization of aspects of um reproductive hormones and those are things that can promote sleep which when they become absent through menopause are causing sleep disruption great someone asks what does it mean if I can remember my dreams conversely what does it mean if I cannot remember my dreams does this have any reflection on my Sleep Quality well some of this was addressed during today's episode but maybe um just to give a a short recap um response uh how would you respond to this so I would say that just because you remember your dreams or you don't remember your let's say you don't remember your dreams many people will ask me then does that mean that I don't get REM sleep or I don't get enough REM sleep no absolutely it doesn't there seems to be no correlation between how much REM sleep that you're getting and whether or not you remember your dreams that's I think Point number one point number two is that there doesn't seem to be a strong correlation between you remembering your dreams and the quality of the waking day that ensues as a consequence of that dream remembered sleep from the night before versus dream nonrem remembered the only time that we've got a little bit of data comes on to what we've spoken about today which is Lucidity which is a different sort of oneup level of dreaming there maybe there's some unrest sleep argument but for the most part I would say do not worry if you're not remembering your dreams it doesn't mean that you are not Dreaming by the way I've got a wacky Theory it doesn't mean that you are also not storing those dreams and being influenced by them there is something called implicit memory and it was long sort of held you know these versions of you go into a movie theater and for very brief milliseconds of periods of time you're shown images of Pepsi cans or Coke cans and then during the intermission you track people's purchasing of soda and sure enough they will buy more Pepsi see if they get flashed sort of so we can actually embed implicit information into people and it changes their behavior they have no recollection of the memory but it's clearly there and it's clearly influencing the behavior what does this have to do with dreaming I have a theory of dreaming where people and I told you most of us forget most of our dreams and we think when we forget those dreams have gone they've evaporated from our brain what if it's not the case have you ever had that experience where you are waking up and you know you are dreaming and you just cannot capture it and you think it's gone that's it I've forgotten it and then 2 days later you're in the shower you're looking at the shampoo bottle and the label all of a sudden just unlocks the memory of that dream and it comes flooding back as a neuroscientist that tells me an important thing that memory is in existence but previously it was unavailable this is the difference between availability versus accessibility the memory was available able but you'd lost the IP address to go and retrieve it available not accessible now if most of our dreams are still always quote unquote implicitly remembered but we always fail to have accessibility those memories arguably according to my theory are always available they're always in our brains we just don't have conscious accessibility to them that doesn't change the fact that our dreams may shape huge amount of our Behavior implicitly and to me that's a wild crazy Theory and someday when I retire I'll do the study and try and disprove it anyway love it what are the key supplements for sleep and I just have to say that's a huge topic that that's an entire episode Into You and I should probably do intellectual jazz on that at some point yeah we should do that but um let's um constrain the question a bit um for sake of time um what if any supplements do you personally take or recommend to people um with the understanding that many people perhaps do not need supplements all right we never want to give the impression that that's the first lined um approach to dealing with sleep issues get your sunlight get your Darkness get your qqr right all of that if it's mysterious to you all of that as in the previous episodes of this of this podcast series um but assuming that someone wants to explore this supplement space and uh what do what do you recommend what do you take and please here I'm going to encourage you to not take into consideration at all what I've ever said about supplements for sleep because I think it's actually most useful if people get a uh a tapestry of opinions um please I'm just going to say that outright I don't say maybe you you could say a little bit more about those that you would recommend and and I think they're going to probably overlap because I already sort of know some of them but sure um the recommend again I just want to say that um never take anything or remove anything from your regimen without talking to your doctor first but uh and all always always make sure that you're doing all the behaviors correctly first but um and there's so many of them you know don't eat too close to bedtime get your morning sunlight on and on you know um but the supplements that I recommend when people ask and for supplement recommendations specifically are magnesium 3 and yep um it's more or less interchangeable with magnesium bisglycinate it has a slight sedative property a lot of people are deficient in magnesium anyway um and this is Magnesium taken about 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime the other one is appenine which is a essentially a derivative of chamomile yep um and then the third is theanine which is known to have a a mild uh anti-anxiety uh component to it um the one caveat is that theanine can be problematic for people that have very vivid dreams it can often people say that it makes their dreams even more Vivid and so if you suffer from that or it's waking you up then I suggest leaving out the theanine actually recommend people start with just one thing and then see how it affects them and then and then um bring more in I'll put a link in the show note captions to the dosages that were contained within a zero cost newsletter about sleep rather than listof dosages here and can link to that in the show note captions those are the main three and then there's one other which and I use those by the way um most every night before sleep and it has improved my sleep dramatically the other thing that I sometimes use is 900 milligrams of inositol um which for whatever reason has I find again this is anic data makes it easier for me to fall back asleep when I wake up in the middle of the night especially if I haven't eaten very many starchy carbohydrates in the days preceding I try and some starches after hard training and things of that sort but sometimes if I'm on a lower carbohydrate regimen then I find it extra difficult to sleep so I'll throw in some um some anoco um I will say there have been nights where I forget my supplements and just fall asleep and uh and so you know it's tough to say exactly what each of those is doing and in what combinations you always need to think about how much disposable income somebody has again get your behaviors right get the dos and don'ts that Matt described during the course of this podcast series write and then consider supplementation but yeah that's pretty much what I rely on yeah I like what you're saying um both the philosophy of it too because the things that we've spoken about the qqr and all the different methods they are a log order magnitude greater in terms of how they will cause correct your sleep than probably any supplement effect that I know of to go back to your um magt mag 3 and8 I think there is some evidence definitely interesting evidence it was more so in older adults and were able to show increases in the total amount of deep sleep I think it was somewhere around about um 15 to 20% although that's the relative percent difference if you look I think it was only about six or seven minutes of total deep sleep but there is some evidence there the evidence by way of you've heard the story of that magnesium is good for sleep it's principally derived from evidence of people who are magnesium deficient and when you make them magnesium normative they start sleeping better that's a very different question than saying I am magnesium normative I am in normal ranges and then I add to it how do I expect any greater benefit that's like me saying you know you're at an oxygen saturation of 99.9 and I'm going to give you pure oxygen it's not going to move you above 100 you're already at ceiling whereas if you are at 85% and I give you oxygen you're going to get a lovely benefit from that so but I like mag 3 and8 um because it is based on the evidence the only one that does cross the blood brain barrier people have said well then why do I get a benefit from things like the other one that I would speak about is probably um slow mag because it can be tough on some people's tummy and it's a coated uh form of magnesium that doesn't necessarily cross the bloodb brain barrier but um magnesium I would say want to focus on would maybe be magnesium chloride that seems maybe Petra has released a podcast on this too that seems to be I think an effective one for bio bioavailability but if it doesn't cross the blood brain barrier how can it be affecting sleep because sleep is of the brain by the brain and for the brain one of the reasons is because of muscle relaxation so if you're to tense in your body it feeds signals of stress to your brain and if you're stressed as we've spoken about you're not going to sleep well so I think there could be indirect effects of forms of magnesium that do not cross the blood brain barrier again assuming that you are magnesium deficient I think epogen um chamomile has some good evidence valaran root unfortunately if you look at the state the data it doesn't seem to hold up in terms of any sleep benefit whatsoever probably two that I would add to that list the first is glycine and here we're talking about doses of maybe 1.5 to two Gams of glycine has quite a reliable robust literature now it's not randomized control Trials of a level of a drug because these are supplements you don't get those studies but it does seem to have quite a reli will benefit based on what I've seen in the literature the final one I would say which has very good data to support its action is something called phosed sarine phosph serine and again I've got no association with any supplement company whatsoever but this has been reliably demonstrated to Tamp down the cortisol response now that data you've got to be careful if you look at it and read the studies which I have it's principally in athletes and they use an athletic performance intervention to Brute Force cortisol to go up and then they use this medication and it brings it back down but it is reliable I bring this up because we spoke about in our one of our episodes insomnia patients as they're trying to fall asleep cortisol is coming down just like it is in all healthy people and it drops low just as we're about to fall asleep but in insomnia patients it spikes back up again and then it does in the middle of the night so here is a medication that one could try to try to temp down that cortisol specifically as you're going into sleep and that may be of helped too so those are the only two that I would give with the same caveat that get everything else straight stop worrying about buying supplements and thinking it's going to be a quick fix get the basics in place and then we can think about fine-tuning you for the final couple of percent optimization that you get from supplements terrific answer the final question h of this Sixth and final episode of this podcast series on sleep with Dr Matthew Walker I'm so sad I don't want to leave I don't want to stop speaking about we can always do another I would love the literature changes it evolves it um we can do another and another is the following if you could give just one tip for getting better sleep what would that be regularity just keep things regular if you get regular sleep a lot of things will start to take care of themselves and after that if they don't we'll have another conversation and we'll go back to the other three keys the other three of the four macros of sleep quantity quality and regularity as I've spoken about in timing and then all of the other protocols that we've mentioned but start with regularity get that straight and I would also say you're timing to the r and the T of qqr T figure out your chronotype get good with your chronotype as best you can and then get regular if you do those two things sleep in synchrony with your chronotype rather than against it and you are being regular weekdays and weekends you will get a long way to getting better sleep fantastic well I'll put one in if you could give just one tip for getting better sleep what would it be I suggest you listen to all six episodes of The hberman Lab podcast guest series with Dr Matthew Walker about sleep and ways to improve sleep because episode one covers the biology and the basics of how to get better sleep and what sleep is episode two gets into the more advanced tools although I think they are tools that everyone I know they are tools that everyone can and should consider episode three gets into the power of naps caffeine food and the timing of those oh so powerful episode four gets into the role of sleep in learning memory and creativity what's more interesting than that episode 5 we discussed sleep and its impact on emotional health and mental health and today we were discussing dreaming and lucid dreaming and here is where I get to say Dr Matthew Walker thank you oh so much oh so much for giving us a absolutely worldclass grand tour of this incredible aspect of Our Lives that we call sleep and in doing so also making it extremely clear extremely actionable at every step and very very thorough in a way that really honors the interest and intellect and just real sincere interest in this topic on the part of the audience so I could not think of a single better person for this series than you alive or dead fortunately you're alive and I just want to say on behalf of myself everyone else here at The

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Casey means Dr Casey means did her undergraduate degree at Stanford University and her medical degree at Stanford University School of Medicine she is one of the world's foremost experts in metabolic Health today we discuss how metabolic function and dysfunction impacts our health in particular we discuss mitochondria which are involved in energy production within our cells and the various things that we can each and all do to ensure proper mitochondrial function which is essential not just for things like body composition and physical and mental energy but also our ability to regulate hormones blood sugar and much more we discuss how exercise even simple exercise like walking as well as sleep as well as more vigorous exercise and in particular nutrition including the types of foods we eat the timing of food intake and the sources and quality of those Foods impact are mitochondria and other aspects of metabolic function we also discuss how particular micronutrients within specific foods can directly impact mitochondrial and metabolic Health Dr means explains how mitochondria inflammation and reactive oxygen species which are the byproducts of metabolism in our cells can combine to create conditions of obesity as well as ways that we can manage those things or even reverse mitochondrial inflammation and reactive oxygen species dysfunction in order to reverse obesity reverse diabetes and enhance our health in Myriad Ways by the end of today's discussion you'll have a clear picture of the cellular processes that occur in the brain and body that underly metabolic disease and metabolic health and most importantly you'll have a very clear picture of the actionable items that we can each and all carry out every day and every week in order to ensure metabolic Health proper mitochondrial function and indeed that can also body composition and overall feelings of well-being I would also like to share that Dr Casey means has a terrific new book coming out I know it's terrific because I've read it it is entitled good energy the surprising connection between metabolism and Limitless Health if you're interested in the book we provided a link to the book in the show note captions before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science Rel tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Maui Nei venon Maui Nei venison is the most nutrient-dense and delicious red meat available I've spoken before on this podcast and with several expert guests on this podcast about the fact that most of us should be seeking to get about one gram of quality protein per pound of body weight every day not only does that protein provide critical building blocks for things like muscle repair and synthesis but also for overall metabolism and health eating enough quality protein each day is also a terrific way to saave off hunger one of the key things however is to make sure that you're getting enough quality protein without ingesting excess calories mauii venison has an extremely high quality protein per calorie ratio such that getting one gram of protein per pound of body weight is both easy and doesn't cause you to ingest an excess of calories also Maui Nei venison is absolutely delicious they have venison steaks they have ground venison and they have ven bone broth I personally like all of those in fact I probably eat a Maui Nei venison Burger pretty much every day and occasionally I'll swap that for a Maui Nei steak and if you're really on the go they have Maui Nei venison jerky which has 10 gram of protein per stick at just 55 calories if you'd like to try Maui Nei venison you can go to mauii venison docomo to get 20% off your first order again that's mauw venison docomo today's episode is also brought To Us by eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity now I've spoken many times before in this podcast about the critical need to get sleep both enough sleep and enough quality sleep when we do that everything our mental health our physical health performance in any sports or School Etc all get better and when we're not sleeping well or enough all those things suffer one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is that your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3° in order to fall and stay deeply asleep and in order to wake up feeling feeling refresh your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3° one of the best ways to ensure that happens is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and with eight sleep it makes it very easy to do that you program in the temperature that you want at the beginning middle and end of the night you can even divide the temperature for two different people if you have two different people sleeping in the bed and it tracks your sleep it tells you how much slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep you're getting it really helps you dial in the correct parameters to get the best possible night sleep for you I've been sleeping on an eight Sleep mattress car for well over 3 years now and it has completely transformed my sleep for the better if you'd like to try eightsleep you can go to 8sleep.com huberman and save $150 off their pod three cover eight sleep currently ships in the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by Aeropress Aeropress is like a French press but a French press that always Brews the perfect cup of coffee meaning no bitterness and excellent taste Aeropress achieves this because it uses a very short contact time between the hot water and the coffee and that short contact time also means that you can brew an excellent cup of coffee very quickly the whole thing takes only about 3 minutes I started using an aero press over 10 years ago and I learned about it from a guy named Alan Adler who's a former Stanford engineer who's also an inventor he developed things like the aobi Frisbee in any event I'm a big fan of Adler inventions and when I heard he developed a coffee maker the Aro press I tried it and I found that indeed it makes the best possible Tas in cup of coffee it's also extremely small and portable so I started using it in the laboratory when I travel on the road and also at home and I'm not alone in my love of the Aeropress coffee maker with over 55,000 f-star reviews Aeropress is the best reviewed coffee press in the world if you'd like to try Aeropress you can go to Aero press.com huberman to get 20% off Aeropress currently ships in the USA Canada and to over 60 other countries around the world again that's Aero press.com huberman and now for my discussion with Dr Casey means Dr Casey means welcome Dr Andrew hman thank you so much for having me really excited to talk to you today about all things Health one of the things I love so much about your work is that you really give people a sense of agency through knowledge and actionable tools which is very near and dear to my mission and my heart but to kick things off let's talk about metabolic function and dysfunction I think most people hear the word metabolism and they think okay the burning of energy maybe they think about ATP maybe they think about calories in calories out that sort of thing but what are we talking about when we're talking about metabolic function and dysfunction because these are really important concepts for everyone to understand yeah I think you're exactly right I think that when we hear the word metabolism the first thing that comes to most people's minds is my weight do I have a fast metabolism or do I have a slow metabolism or something like basil metabolic rate and I think what's really important for people to realize is that metabolism is actually the foundation of all Health it is the core foundational pathway that drives all other aspects of health and it's also the core foundational pathway that's truly getting crushed in the modern American World and underlying nine of the 10 leading causes of death in the United States today it's really quite relevant to everyone and the spectrum of metabolic rooted disease is vast and actually really relevant to most Americans the latest research from American College of Cardiology suggests that 93% of American adults have suboptimal metabolism and we can go into what that means but fundamentally when we're talking about metabolism we're talking about how we convert food energy to human energy so we take in a astonishing 70 metric tons or so of food in our lifetime and that is potential energy it's energy from the environment that's outside of us that through our metabolic pathways gets converted to a currency of energy that can then be used to pay for essentially Every chemical reaction inside our body and the bubbling up of all of those chemical reactions is our lives and so when metabolism is not working properly it's essentially creating underpowered cells and like any City or factory or machine not having adequate power will lead to dysfunction and the reason that the metabolic spectrum of disease is so vast is because we have over 200 cell types in the body and underpowering in different cell types is going to look like different symptoms because underpowering in a asite is going to look different than underpowering an ovarian thica cell or an endothelial cell it's going to look different but the core foundational process that is dysfunctional can actually be the same and I think the biggest blind spot in Western healthc care and actually the reason that Health outcomes are actually getting worse every year in the United States is because fundamentally we are ignoring metabolic health and metabolic dysfunction we are laser focused on the downstream symptoms that result from metabolic dysfunction in different cell types and we spend all of our energy uh focusing on those symptoms playing wacl with them and really ignoring that underlying foundational root cause of metabolic function and what's so fascinating to me and what I saw in the Health Care system as like a Super Subs specialist as an ENT surgeon is that you know the more we specialize in health care we have over a hundred Specialties now that we've just like invented in the Health Care System the more we specialize in health care the sicker we're actually getting so the more we do technological innovation in all these different Specialties the sicker we're getting and I think what what the real nugget there that that everyone really needs to understand is we've bought into a system where we value specialization and this is the game in Western medicine but while we've done that what has happened is we have the worst chronic disease epidemic and the lowest life expectancy of any High income country in the world and the reason is because in that specialization were focused on the downstream manifestation of underpowering of cells the the cell specific symptoms and not the metabolic function itself so really our chronic disease epidemic in this country it is a metabolic dysfunction epidemic and underpowering epidemic and that is the biggest blind spot in health care and I think a focus on metabolic function as the center of our health care System it's a completely new paradigm for health that is urgently and I cannot overs say it enough it's urgently needed we know we're not in the right Paradigm right now when we have a hundred isolated Specialties and yet 85 to 90% of the conditions in those Specialties if you go to the science and look at the real physiology is metabolic dysfunction so that's kind of the landscape of what metabolic dysfunction is and how it's kind of creating a a big blind spot in the Health Care system that really represents an outdated way of categorizing disease that unfortunately is killing us I would say yeah thank you for that I have um several Reflections and a question uh first off the the analogy that comes to mind is an assembly line that's constructing let's say an automobile and it sounds like 80 to 90% of the automobiles that are coming off that assembly line are not working well tires aren't on line engines isn't working well transmission isn't working a bunch of issues and no Factory no car manufacturer would tolerate that nor would the customers but we're tolerating that in ourselves it sounds like many people are and then accepting the fact that then a bunch of other businesses are going to crop up like the business that aligns the tires the business that goes and repairs the Pistons and and essentially when you talk about these multi Specialties that have evolved in the in the medical care system they provide an opportunity to go and fix the problems or try and ameliorate the problems but really what we need to do to make this analogy uh much briefer than it otherwise would be is just to go further up the assembly line figure out whether or not the hardware is correct the software is correct and where the hardware and software are becoming deficient in this um in this analogy where we are the automobile that's essentially coming off the conveyor broken and the good news is and I know this because I've read your book and because I follow your work very closely the good news is that we each and all can take matters to some extent into our own hands collaborate with healthc care providers yeah and repair metabolic dysfunction essentially make us metabolically functional so um the question therefore is I think most people when they hear metabolism they think energy yep and when we hear energy we think ATP sometimes but typically people think about mitochondria right the PowerHouse of the cell so to speak um so you've talked about the trifecta or the the big three mitochondria inflammation and oxidative stress as three critical factors underlying metabolic dysfunction and I'm presuming those are also the Avenues to address in order to create metabolic function because ultimately what we want of course is an optimistic picture that we can actually take some control that we have some agency in all of this which I believe we do so if you would could you get us all on the same page about you know what are mitochondria and what they do why are they so important then we can turn to inflammation and oxidative stress yes absolutely so the mitochondria or are the structure within the cells we have 40 trillion cells and each cell might have a handful or many thousand mitochondria and they are the magical part of the cell that does that conversion process of food breaking down uh and then converting to energy to translating it to a currency of energy our body can recognize and So currently what's happening is that our environment the environment that our cells exist in across every single facet of our life over the past 50 to 75 years has changed rapidly you look at how our food system has changed from whole real food in good soil to Industrial food our sleep habits have changed we're sleeping less it's very fragmented our movement patterns have changed we're sitting 80% of the waking day our time in nature has changed we actually are indoors As Americans 93% of a 24-hour periods that totally changes our relationship with light we have 80,000 synthetic toxins in our food water air personal care products home care products we live a Thermon neutral existence now with our thermostats there's no real swings in temperature unless you're in intentionally trying to um and then our emotional health is very different we are very much exposed to lowgrade chronic stress triggers so across food sleep movement emotional health toxins light and temperature things are not what they once were and it's changed in the blink of an eye I mean the light bulb was created in 1806 this is like 0.04% of human history that we' even had artificial light so things have changed and the the unique thing about all of these Chang in our environment is that each one of those pillars each of those changes in our environment synergistically directly hurts the mitochondria through different mechanisms The Chronic low-grade stress the sitting the ultr processed nutrient devoid food even the the blue light at nighttime all of it through different core biologic mechanisms synergistically hits this part of the cell the mitochondria so we have the food coming in but we're not doing a a job of converting it to an energy form we can use so we have these underpowered dysfunctional cells because of mitochondrial dysfunction caused by our environment and of course what happens if you've got energy substrate that you can't process it's going to be stored and that's of course why we have an obesity and overweight epidemic that's affecting close to 80% of American so wild it's it's just we talk about obesity like it's the problem obesity is one branch of a tree that that's rooted in this mitochondrial dysfunction that's caused by our environment and just to back up a little bit to just sort of share kind of maybe like how I sort of started thinking about that you know I I had trained as an ENT surgeon and I was at Stanford Medical School and I I was so fascinated by this idea of like the way that we're defining the diseases we're treating in these in in like a specialty like ENT is like I I saw sinusitis day in and day out and we'd have these patients on the table that we'd be literally drilling into their skulls to suck out sinus pus and that's like the treatment for sinusitis and the way we diagnose the patients is we say like okay this patient has sinusitis if they have facial pressure purulent pus you know nasal discharge um nasal obstruction and low sense of smell so if they have these symptoms then they have this disease but when you actually go to the science and you actually go to the studies of like what is actually happening to create this what you find is a lot of papers about mitochondrial dysfunction because Chron you know sinusitis is a chronic inflammatory condition where the cells are essentially sensing some threat and then they mount this immune response that creates swelling and then you get pus buildup but we confuse the the pus buildup with the disease which is actually happening inside the cells and so you start looking at PubMed as a as a clinician through a slightly different lens of like what's actually happening in the cells and what you find for almost every chronic disease we're seeing in the US is that you will find a lot of papers on how the mitochondria are dysfunctional lower ATP generation in a lot of these cell types and then what does that do and this gets your question about chronic inflammation oxa of stress well when you've got that dysfunctional mitochondria let's say in a nasal mucosal tissue that is a cell that can't do its job that is a cell that's underpowered and what could be more threatening to the body than a cell that can't do its job so interestingly those cells will initiate a whole process which is called the cell danger response um it's work that's been done by Robert navio at uh UCSD where basically they understand the mitochondria is not working properly this is of course caused by the environment and they will actually release extracellular ATP which is not really supposed to go outside of the cell and that creates a massive innate immune response saying like I'm underpowered I need help my mitochondria is broken this is the cell releases ATP outside of the cell usually the concentration of ATP is a million times higher inside the cell so releases it almost as a neurotransmitter a purogen neurotransmitter that massively activates the immune system to come and help but the immune system comes and is like not much we can do for you here because the problem is not something that the immune system can help with like grabbing a bacteria and licing it or you know taking care of some cells infected with a virus the problem is outside the body it's the environment so you end up getting this tornado of dysfunction of mitochondrial dysfunction caused by the environment leading to the cell danger response which leads to innate immunity and then on top of this you get the oxa of stress which is the third piece of the trifecta which is essentially these mitochondria trying so hard to do their work but they're not working properly so they create damaging metabolic byproducts called oxid of stress free radicals that cause more damage so this is happening in the nose it's happening all over the American Body because of our environment so you've got these tornadoes of interrelated physiology of mitochondrial dysfunction chronic inflammation oxidative stress which if you start going to the research as a clinician who's focused on symptoms and confusing those for the disease and look at what's the pathophysiology of arthritis what's the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's dementia what's the pathophysiology of type2 diabetes obesity fatter fatty liver disease polycystic ovarian syndrome erectile dysfunction it all traces back to this Trifecta that no medication or surgery you obviously can't operate on oxidative stress you can operate on the downstream symptoms so that's the real secret that I really feel like we need to reorient the Healthcare System around since 90% of health care costs go towards treating the downstream symptoms of these and for every marginal dollar we're spending on treating symptoms we're getting s the rates are going up because they're doing nothing to actually affect that Trifecta but to really make it simple I like to think of this Trifecta of what I call Trifecta of bad energy Trifecta underlying metabolic dysfunction of chronic inflammation mitochondrial dysfunction oxidative stress as chronic inflammation is biochemical fear its response to a threat mitochondrial dysfunction is kind of like rolling blackouts it's not enough power and the oxid of stress is like wildfires so it's kind of what's funny to me a little bit is like what's happening inside the cell is almost like what's happening like in our society it's like this is like living in California it's like blackouts fire fear and that's literally what's happening inside our cell because of the environment and uh again the optimistic news that you alluded to is that we actually have tons of tools and tests that can actually help us understand our level of metabolic health and even give us hints about inflammation oxidative stress and mitochondria dysfunction and it's very easy easy to improve if we know what we're actually focused on well that's reassuring and we're definitely going to go there um I appreciate the analogy to living in California I've lived here my entire life I have been outside of California but um perhaps the only thing you left out besides rolling blackouts fires and what was the other one fear and fear is high taxes the taxes the health debt on on the on the body so in any case not to be too dark and pessimistic well that's the healthare cost I maintain great hope and and still a lot of love for California you know pretty great it's got It's Great aspects and it's not so great aspects and I can say that as a lifelong California resident um there are other wonderful places to live a couple of uh questions first of all about places to live you've been talking a lot about in the United States are some of the same issues with metabolic dysfunction occurring outside of the United States I would imagine so y any country where we've exported the standard American diet and some of the other Norms of Western living are starting to see the same rat uh of of chronic disease but like it is worth not mincing words here of all high income countries in the world the United States has the worst chronic disease rates and the lowest life expectancy and our life expectancy is going down and we spend about twice as much on health care than the second highest spending country in the world so we are we are abjectly failing and that failure is predicated in our Cult of siloing conditions into different you know different Specialties and not focusing on this root cause and I want to just be super clear like there's a war being fought right now to get us to believe that siloing is the way because as you alluded to siloing is profitable if you can convince doctors and people that they 10 different symptoms are separate things then they're going to 10 different specialist off office meanwhile 75% of American adults are overweight and obese some of the highest in the world um a full 50% of American adults now have pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes 50% 30% of teens have pre-diabetes 40% of Americans have a mental health diagnosis cancer is set to reach 2 million cases this year in 2024 highest ever in recorded history Alzheimer's is going up fat liver disease is affecting 40% of adults 18% of teens autoimmune diseases skyrocketing infertility is going up at huge rates all these things are going up all at once in the US and yes in many of the other countries that are eating our diet um and there's no sign of it slowing down and so that's really if you look at if you look at the research through this this different lens you'll find that all of those diseases Trace back to metabolic dysfunction caused by our environment that no that no shot pill or surgery can really address unless we unpack the environmental piece scary picture I'm glad that but hopeful but hope exactly I'm glad that you are um creating Solutions and and I should say and just remind people I said this in my introduction but you know you're talking about siloed medical care you're talking about the kind of standard medical system but let's not forget right um I happen to be a faculty at Stanford you did your medical training at Stanford are a medical doctor right I mean you have MD and are highly trained you were an ENT your nose and throat doctor so if anyone would be familiar with the industry and the practice and the educational system around this it's you so uh you're not speaking outside your bwick so before we pivot to Solutions yeah I know people are eager to hear Solutions but in order to understand how to best apply those Solutions I do think it's worth drilling into um some of the issues here just a little bit more you talked about underpowered cells yeah you've also alluded to the fact that most people are consuming enough and probably excess amounts of caloric energy yes so is it the lack of mitochondria or mitochondrial dysfunction that's at the root of the problem the analogy I come up with is you've got um a power plant that can convert incoming power line to um Power that can be distributed to a community yeah the community in this analogy being the organs and cells of the body yeah there's plenty of potential energy but there's something about the power plant that is inefficient or dysfunctional they shorts they circuitry that's just not working such that the energy that the community can benefit from the cells and organs of the body is just not there so it's not a lack of input it's a lack of conversion and output and the consequence of this we see in the form of excess adapost tissue and all the Downstream effects it's not just aesthetic it's really all the downstream effects of visceral fat subcutaneous fat Etc what is it that would improve access to energy and energy utilization in cells is it simply a matter of getting the mitochondria to function better or is it that one can actually create more mitochondria this is the key question for how we can get healthy and it's really about creating capacity in the body to turn more potential energy to usable energy as opposed to taking that potential energy and shunting it to a storage form it's all just like I think about everything visually and I'm like you got the circular cell from high school biology textbook inside are all the little mitochondria with the squiggly lines inside and it's just like there's X's through those mitochondria so instead of you know after glycolisis and you've got the pyate instead of going through the mitochondria it's being shuttled into something else and I I mean this is fundamentally the the cause of insulin resistance because when the body senses that the mitochondria can't do that conversion process the cell basically says because I can't convert this I don't have the capacity to convert it to usable energy I'm going to take the substrates and I need to block them I mean got to turn them to basically a storage form which inside the cell could be toxic fats like ceramides and diog glycerol and I'm also going to block the cell from taking any more substrates because can't do anything with them that is fundamentally a root of insulin resistance so the body says okay we're going to block the ability of the insulin receptor to transduce its intercellular signaling pathway we're going to block it and when that insulin binds we're not actually going to allow for glucose to come in so essentially insulin resistance is the cell compensating for the mitochondria being broken and telling the insulin receptor that it it you know that it's not going to be functional and so you don't get the glute for you don't get the glute receptors on the cell membrane to allow the glucose to come in so that's that's insulin resistance again we talk about that as the problem but the problem is actually inside the cell leading to that you know so that's why just giving someone insulin isn't necessarily answer we have to increase mitochondrial capacity to let the flow happen through it to energy which then trickles up into relieving a lot of these problems so to answer your question what we really want to do to increase our metabolic capacity from a first principal perspective it's we need to make more mitochondria we need to get each mitochondria to be more functional and we need to have each more functional mitochondria processing more energy substrates it's it's really that simple and the beauty is we can do all of those things if you actually break down like what it what those three things mean it means promoting mitophagy the recycling of o old mitochondria to to new mitochondria it means promoting mitochondrial biogenesis it means increasing the oxitive capacity of our individual mitochondria it means improving mitochondrial Fusion which is actually when mitochondria come together to form long chains of mitochondria that are more efficient so there's like a lot of technicality to like what it means to print more mitochondria have them each be more efficient and have each one do more work but that's really what we want to do and that's when it just kind of gets into the simple Habits Like There's simple things we can do for each of those things for mitophagy you know we can focus on various types of like endurance exercise and uh high-intensity interval exercise there's compounds like Ethan a that promote mitophagy um when we talk about improving our you know oxy of capacity this is things like the Sprint workouts we want to build more mitochondria this is resistance training literally telling the body to make more so but first principles it's how do we get more of these working better do doing more work every day and then we think about you know you look at the data on walking and it's like people who walk more than 7,000 steps a day have a 50 to 65% lower chance of dying in 10year follow-ups and it's like yeah because walking is literally a glucose disposal signal so you're just simply asking it's not a great biogenesis signal it's not a great mitophagy signal but it's a great disposal so if you're doing lifestyle habits that do one of those three things which we can of course go into more you're improving the cell's capacity to um do that conversion process better I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 by now most of you have heard me tell my story about how I've been taking ag1 once or twice a day every day since 2012 and indeed that's true I started taking ag1 and I still take ag1 once or twice a day because it gives me vitamins and minerals that I might not be getting enough of from Whole Foods that I eat as well as adaptogens and micronutrients those adaptogens and micronutrients really critical because even though I strive to eat most of my foods from unprocessed or minimally processed Whole Foods it's often hard to do so especially when I'm traveling and especially when I'm busy so by drinking a packet of ag1 in the morning and often times also again in the afternoon or evening I'm uring that I'm getting everything I need I'm covering all of my foundational nutritional needs and I like so many other people that take ag1 regularly just report feeling better and that shouldn't be surprising because it supports gut health and of course gut health supports immune system health and brain health and it's supporting a ton of different cellular and organ processes that all interact with one another so while certain supplements are really directed towards one specific outcome like sleeping better or being more alert ag1 really is foundational nutritional support it's really designed to support all of the systems of your brain and body that relate to mental health and physical health if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs with your order Plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman there's a lot of great science and a lot of um great stuff related to testing and assessment of one's metabolic Health that we should get into and will get into but since we touched on lifestyle and because we've been talking about the sort of dysfunctional dark side for a bit maybe we could just touch on some of the lifestyle factors that you just mentioned um because I do think it's important that people really start to feel into their sense of agency and here we're talking about um things that are relatively low time investment certainly don't have much Financial cost in the sense that they could be done in gyms and with fancy equipment but they don't require that um again I I want to point out that these are not like strict prescriptives but if you had a magic wand and because you are interested in the health of humans um let's talk about a few of these things that can improve um glucose disposal um and mitochondrial function uh mitophagy the removal of of dead or dysfunctional mitochondria so they can be replaced um let's talk about the walking one first you said 7,000 steps a day I don't track my steps um what are we really talking about there we talking about taking the stairs and trying to walk as much as possible maybe we like if we were going to just give like a really crude prescription you're a doctor so you can prescribe things um what would you tell people to do like how many short walks per day is is it like three is it five is um what are we talking would say up I mean at at least three I would say aiming for more than that is good though there's so so to sort of just give a sense of the picture of walking if walking were a pill it would be the most uh impactful pill we've ever had in all of modern medicine um there was a paper in jamama uh 6,300 participants followed for uh 10 to 11 years and the people who simply walked seven th000 steps per day compared to less than that had in up to 70% lower risk of all cause mortality in the follow-up period so not causality but it's it's pretty incredible they've done follow-up research with slightly different numbers showing again though like many thousands of people uh in the study followed for about 10 years 8,000 to 12,000 steps per day was associated with 50 to 65% lower uh all cause mortality and this has been played out in many many studies showing about a 50% reduction in Alzheimer's uh dementia obesity type 2 diabetes depression cancer gastric reflux just all across the board and I think the key thing is that it's not about the steps it's about the fact that muscle contraction is medicine when we contract our muscles even in a very like lowgrade way like walking or doing a couple air squats you know we're activating ampk and we are essentially causing that cell to have a stimulus to push glucose channels to the cell membrane most of the time the glucose channels are like in vesicles ins in little bags inside the cells they're not on the cell membrane so of course that's going to keep the the glucose in your in your bloodstream not being processed by the mitochondria so when we think about steps it's a proxy metric for just moving more throughout the day so let's take two people you have a person who's walking for one to two minutes every 30 minutes throughout the day maybe they're exercising at the end of the day or the beginning of the day maybe they're not that person is stimulating glucose channels to be at the membrane all day now let's take another person who works out really hard for one hour in the beginning or the end of the day they feel great about it they've checked that off their box but they're sitting the entire rest of the day yes they have gotten the benefits from the exercise but for a lot of that day those glucose channels are inside the cell not doing the work they could be doing so I think about these little teeny short walking breaks or push-up breaks or air squat breaks every 30 minutes or so throughout the day as me essentially inside the cell pushing the glucose channels the cell membrane to make them constituently active um it's totally different physiology and it's so easy so it's not about the steps it's about muscle contraction regularly throughout the day and and this has been shown out in actually more clinical research which has taken there's been several studies two that I think are fascinating where they basically took two groups and they said okay we're going to have you walk 20 minutes before each meal three times a day 20 minutes after each meal so that's also three times a day or for like 2 minutes every 30 minutes throughout the day so these are three separate groups either 20 minutes before I either 20 minutes after or 2 to 3 minutes every 30 minutes all added up to 60 minutes of walking or light jogging a day I'm kind of paraphrasing two different studies that showed the same thing one was jogging one was walking but it was basically chunks versus short walks every 30 minutes throughout the waking day the groups that do the short movement regularly throughout the day even though the total time is the same across all the groups have significantly lower 24-hour glucose level averages 24-hour insulin level averages they are metabolically healthier and I believe and the research mechanistically has shown that it's because we're constitutively putting this these channels at the membrane to take up the substrate use the substrate so this is not in uh to to replace exercise but I think it's a reframe I think the concept of exercise is something we're really very wedded to in our Western culture and you look at more like the blue zones and the centenarians and it's like they're kind of moving is built into their everyday life so we've taken movement out of our everyday life as these knowledge workers as we've been industrialized and then we think that exercise replaces that all day movement but biochemically it does not so I think a big part of kind of digging ourselves out of this chronic disease mess and creating capacity for mitochondria is finding ways to take a lot of the activities we do now seated and just find a way to do more of them moving standing or walking or if that's tough you really need to sit at your desk all day then every 30 minutes taking 2 minutes to do some just light movement Flex those muscles get the glucose channels at the membrane get the mitochondria active so and I think another fascinating stat is like our gym memberships in the US have doubled since the year 2000 and obesity has gone up in the same period so there's some mismatch between our obsession with exercise and our actual outcomes that we're seeing and I think it's that we have not actually rebuilt constitutive movement into our daily lives very interesting because I think a lot of people are now working out so to speak doing resistance training which I think is terrific ter used to be such you know such so restricted to Niche subculture stuff like bodybuilding preseason football military Etc and now it's a more ubiquitous uh for everybody men women young old that's terrific same thing with things like yoga and cardiovascular training I mean I it like to study the history of exercise culture and it wasn't but in the' 60s when you know jogging was considered kind of like whoa that's like a really esoteric Niche culture thing so A lot's changed um I love the prescriptives you gave because it's just very straightforward a couple of short walks um it just makes so much sense um and I love the visual and I hope people will really hold it in mind so I'll reiterate it the the um translocation of these um energy utilization stores vles as you call them these little packets from the center of the cell out to the cell surface where then they can be Evol involved excuse me in metabolic processes and the utilization of energy in ways that um otherwise they wouldn't and glucose disposal being a big part of this so I have heard that a short walk after a meal will reduce blood glucose in a way that's really dramatic huge amount 30 35% just taking a walk around the block after meal that's definitely a prescription I think everyone should do because the research is so strong on it is that building in simply a 10minute walk around the block or a dance party in the kitchen moving your muscles for 10 minutes after a meal can drastically reduce your glucose response because you're just bringing all those channels to the membrane you're taking up the glucose you're using it it's a whole different physiology than sitting on the couch after a meal that's very high impact it's high leverage if it's after a meal so highly recommend that and the levels data and clinical data has shown that out time and time again whenever I go to a city like New York when I am forced to walk more I I always just feel so much better we also know that the optic flow that one experiences with walking has some interesting effects on the lyic pathways and quieting of some of the anxiety and stress related Pathways um this links up with things like EMDR although there are factors that are separate from EMDR basically moving through space um not outer space but walking through space with optic flow has a certain um anxiety reduction function in the brain which they beautiful data there in my opinion um okay so that touches on walking you did mention higher intensity exercise so let's um keep it within the cardiovascular realm for now so um getting heart rate way way up you know getting breathing hard for you know some minutes um each week maybe a couple times per week um seems that's a good way to increase mitochondrial function and mitochondrial number is that right yeah so you take sort of each each type of exercise we've got walking we've got resistance training we've got high-intensity interval training we've got endurance training and then we've got sort of more like zone two uh so we've got these different flavors of how we get our heart rate up how we get the blood flowing what we signal to the cells and each one actually has like a slightly different impact on the mitochondria when we think about biogenesis we're thinking mostly like endurance exercise and really um more of that zone two and like that is really going to be a stim inside the cell to print more mitochondria when we think about improving mitochondrial Fusion high-intensity interval training is really really good for that when we think about resistance training it's like that's like muscle hypertrophy we're going to be creating more muscle cells and we need more mitochondria for those so each one has kind of a different impact and I think this is where honestly I think the regular guidelines that we have even by our government you know actually make a lot of sense it's like work every major muscle group three times a week in a distance type training and then work to get 75 to 150 minutes of moderate activity so 75 minutes of strenuous activity or 150 minutes per week of moderate activity so that actually makes a lot of sense 80% of Americans are not meeting those very basic guidelines and 20% of Americans don't get any physical activity really at all activity for the average American is 3,000 to 4,000 steps per day which is less than 2 miles so we are not even close to even even meeting the basic recommendations that are out there but I think those are pretty reasonable resistance training two to three times a week most major muscle groups and working to you know get the get the heart rate up moderate level uh for 150 minutes a week or strenuous for 75 minutes a week those are going together to be potent stimuli for biogenesis mitophagy mitochondrial Fusion for increasing antioxidant enzymes that are going to protect the mitochondria from that oxa of stress um and the one that's just actually not in there in the in the sort of the basic recommendations for Americans is the walking and I would just absolutely add to that at least 7,000 steps per day based on what the the data is showing which honestly would probably take less than an hour total to do if you if you break it up throughout the day it's just a few minutes a day so that right there are going to be like a big multifaceted set of signals for increasing mitochondrial capacity in different ways terrific what what are your thoughts on um under the desk treadmilling I I don't own one of these but and I try and get walks and I definitely do my three resistance training exra uh sessions per week different muscle groups on different days so it ends up being each muscle group is hit directly once and indirectly a second time but I like to do a long hike once on the weekend a run in the middle of the week that's 30 maybe 35 minutes and then some V2 Max really short workout 12 minutes total where basically I'm just going for um you know the feeling that my uh heart is going to jump out of my chest and I'm going to get going to die from gasemy of air but luckily thus far I haven't died nonetheless um the total time commitment isn't that great but I find that I'm at a desk a lot and I have a standing desk is it wise to get a treadmill to treadmill under the desk seems like it would be one of the best things one could do I'm a massive fan of under treadmill desks because genuinely I believe that if we if we move more of our daily activities that we're doing seated indoors to Outdoors moving it would it would it would radically change the health of the United States with real physiology underneath it so there's actually been research on underdesk standing desk that is pretty interesting small studies but they you know took a handful of people I think it was around 10 um in a workplace environment and they had them use under desk treadmills for two and a half hours uh per day during the workday so not a lot at very so speeds for uh two weeks and people lost on average 2.6 lb of fat and put on 2.2 lbs of lean mass wild in a very short period of time the study makes a somewhat wild claim that if this were extrapolated to a year we anticipate that we could see a loss of 44 to 66 pounds assum assuming it's line near progression exactly which is not which is not the case folks but I that's why I'm saying it was it was a pretty but that was there in the discussion and but I think that short period is quite interesting um so that's that's pretty significant and that's just for two and a half hours a day so I think now that they're about $150 on Amazon these underd dust treadmills I think for anyone who's a knowledge worker it's a good thing to have at your house and the way I use it is like I basically just force myself to start my day on the treadmill desk and I say to myself if I don't like it after 5 minutes I'll sit down if I need to sit but I'll start and just see how it feels and then an hour goes by and I've forgotten I'm even on it is that right so you're able to work without thinking about having to to um to treadmill I am putting it at such a slow speed I think I'm usually walking at like one mile per hour I mean it's very very glacially slow I do put my aura ring on my second toe when I do this because otherwise it doesn't count my steps because if your hands are your desk they uh they it won't count your steps because the AA Rings measuring hand accelerometry yeah but um it it it's incredible how even at a 1.0 one mile per hour speed after two to three hours you're easily going to get six seven 8,000 steps and then throw in a couple other short walks throughout the day and you're you're getting there easily so it's just a it's just a great way to build back in what modernity took away and that unfortunately is unavoidable that that regular movement for good physiology so I'm a big fan of them and the data suggests that for a couple hours a day they can actually have a have an impact on body composition which I think is is a great easy inexpensive thing for people to do but if you if you don't want to buy one like just set those timers and uh and build in the walks you know throughout the day outside terrific yeah I'm a I'm a fan of getting walks when I can I also I wonder your thoughts on there was a study not sure if you're familiar with it um published at the University of Houston where they looked at what they called Solus push-ups um which all the gym goers are going to roll their eyes um imagine sitting down and raise pressing your toe against the ground and raising your heel so kind of like seated calf raay but no weight right under the desk and this study had some remarkable claims and conclusions um which included as I recall that the activation of this muscle the Solus which makes up about 1% of the body's total musculature um involved caused rather a disproportionate use of blood glucose so it mobilized blood glucose in a good way um and the idea was if people would it's not just bouncing your knee but would actively push their toes against the ground and raise their heels as they were seated and doing work that somehow there would be a positive effect on metabolism and blood glucose utilization I talked a little bit about this on social media and a few other podcasts and and it was interesting to see that sort of attacks that I got like people really didn't like the idea um that this was any different than so-called neat non-exercise and um activated thermogenesis so it's known that people that fidget a lot or or move around a lot burn a lot of calories this actually goes back to some really beautiful work um several decades or more ago from Rothwell and stock who talked about like the fact that animals and people who fidget a lot burn a lot of energy they tend to be thinner they tend to have lower adapost tissue stores um and it's because they're just burning a lot more calories and this is actually what um people who suffer from anorexia which is by the way the most deadly of the psychiatric condition so it's um we're talking about true anorexia are encouraged not to do because um they either do it spontaneously or they learn that it's a very efficient way to burn calories and that's not what they need but many people do need to burn more calories so um bounce in the knee that thing that drives everybody crazy if you're not the one doing it um Solus push-ups uh what are your thoughts about this in that study we don't have to pick it apart in detail but I thought it was kind of interesting it's all coming back to just moving the body as much as possible during the day Contracting muscles Contracting mus Contracting muscles it's medicine and I I find the concept of neat just endlessly fascinating you know because we we kind of come up with this term non-exercise activity thermogenesis and the data is really good about it like it's basically shows that this is a a prime potential intervention for the Obesity epidemic and it all goes back to the cell like it's a it's essentially a stimulus that's telling the body to stay metabolically active as opposed to keeping all those metabolic pathways you know dormant during the day um and I think that it just it is funny though that like we have these acronyms for basically like this is just the way life was a hundred years ago if you look at like the 1800s Almost 100% of Americans lived on a farm basically like pre-industrialization pre- urbanization most Americans not 100% but close lived they grew some of their own food they lived either on a farm or had a large garden now that number is less than 1% so like movement was just buil into everything we did and and you think from there like what has happened like we were outside we were moving our activities of daily living involved movement and if you just take the grocery example then it moved to like okay maybe farmers markets and sort of like you know outdoor open air markets then it's supermarkets then it's you know now it's literally buying food online with the click of the button and now some people aren't even doing that they're literally on the food delivered to them with Uber Eats so at every level we've taken away movement from everyday life and now we have sort of an acronym to like bring it back in but really it's about just you know giving the body stimulus stimuli that the cells have been entrained to expect throughout all of human history and building the back into our Modern Life so I think neat it's incredibly important and I think it also brings up this point that like is so critical which is like I really think our way out of this chronic disease epidemic and even for people who are listening don't have a chronic disease any real chronic symptoms we're dealing with and just the fact that we're not feeling as good as we could like the way out is pretty simple like it's it's some of these basic things like walking more throughout the day moving more throughout the day getting outside you know eating clean unpoisoned food the the a lot of these things that have the best data are so simple and I think it's like really important to just always remember like the game and the industry it's all about how complex can we make it like specialization talking about some of the minutia but like at the end of the day all the simple habits that we know are healthy like fundamentally improve cellular biology and like some of these things like the neat like the walking like it's emblematic of the fact that um some of the simplest Solutions are the ones that are by far the most effective and I think I think the biggest misconception in healthcare right now is that the way out and the way to get really back to to True incredible health is complicated like it's it's really not that complicated we we've got to move more you know throughout the day that's one of them and you know on each pillar that we touched on earlier food sleep all of this you know when we talk about the simple habits that know work the reason they work is because they all positively impact the mitochondria they positively impact oxy of stress they positively impact inflammation so yeah I love it I love Simple Solutions that hit multiple cellular Pathways that can make everybody healthier I'd like to just take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors insid tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals now I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact our immediate and long-term Health can only be addressed that is can only be measured with a quality blood test now one issue with many blood tests out there is that you get information back about lipid levels hormone levels metabolic factors Etc but you don't know what to do with that information with inside tracker they make it very easy to understand your levels and what they mean and specific actionable items that you can undertake in in order to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimal for you insid tracker also offers insid Tracker Pro which enables coaches and health professionals to provide premium and personalized Services by

again that's insid tracker.com huberman I'd like to talk about assessment blood tests in particular um I remember in college I was just very curious about blood testing and I had read a little bit about it but it was really hard to access um I actually went to the Student Health Center and said you know can I just get um like my lipids measured some hormone stuff measured I was in great health I just want to do that and they're like no like what's the issue you know why why why would you do that now it's very easy to find places that will do blood tests but there is some cost often um and nowadays thanks to your efforts your innovative and Engineering efforts and the efforts of others there are ways to measure what's in your blood blood glucose in particular um with continuous monitoring and with um snapshot monitoring so um let's talk about blood tests what what do you think are um the three to five things that basically everybody if they can should know about what circulating in their blood I'm I'm imagining LDL HDL this kind of thing I guess apob is a big uh favorite of our our friend Peter AA um fasting blood glucose continuous blood glucose postmeal Etc just kind of evaluating how exercise food Etc impacts blood glucose and then I'll leave the other categories open because my my point here is not to answer the question for that's what comes to mind you've got you know you've got the big ones so this this is key is that every single person listening I hope after this episode will go to their health record or send their doctor a message and at least get the following test and the first seven that I'll mention are very basic and people might take umage to them because obviously there's a lot of debate about like what's everyone's favorite lab test but I think about it as like what are the basics that everyone should know and then what's like the next tier up that are easy to access and are cheap that'll give you a lot more richness but which you still might have to kind of fight your doctor for so the first few that you will not have to fight your doctor for and are often free on an annual physical and literally Define metabolic syndrome are fasting glucose fasting triglycerides HDL cholesterol hemoglobin A1c total cholesterol waste circumference and blood pressure okay sorry I hate to interrupt and my audience hates it even more but I'm going to just could you just explain what each of those is and what it what it corresponds to yes great thank you and and I will say first of all the reason I'm choosing these it's not it's not even my own choice really it's it's two reasons one is that the two studies over the past 5 years that have shown Us in large populations that the vast majority of American adults are metabolically dysfunctional use those biomarkers so I think because of that it's important to know them and the two studies that I'm referring to are one from UNCC in 2018 which showed that based on those biomarkers 88% of American adults are have suboptimal metabolism and then a follow-up study from the Journal of the American College of Cardiology from last year show that that number has gone to 93.2% of American adults are suboptimal in their metabolism and these are the metrics that they used and they're very basic if you had to pay out of pocket they would be less than $100 so let's talk through them why they're great is because together they give you kind of like a tapestry of what's actually happening inside the cell if you choose to look at them that way if you read The Tea Leaves of them are the doctors often if they see all these lab tests it'll be an electronic health record we've all been through this experiment experience they'll come up on the screen and there will either be like a green orange or red color next to it like it's high it's low it's borderline and the doctor will basically it's very algorithmic oh you know your LDL is high we need to bring it down oh your glucose is high we need to bring it down oh your blood pressure is high we need to bring it down but what I'm inviting people to do is understand a little bit about each test and then read the Tea Leaves of what it's telling us about our mitochondria so let's start with fasting glucose so f in glucose when you look at these studies that I'm referring to they call Optimal less than 100 so to define whether you were in that 88 or 93% you had to essentially be in the their their optimal range for all biomarkers not on medication so I'll quickly run through what their ranges were my ranges for optimal are tighter than these but fasting glucose less than 100 triglycerides less than 150 HDL above 40 for men or 50 for women hemog glob1 C less than 5.7% total cholesterol to HDL ratio less than 3.5 to 1 waist circumference less than 35 in for women or 40 in for men and blood pressure less than 120 over 80 if those things were in those ranges and you weren't on medication for blood sugar or or blood pressure or whatnot you were considered optimally metabolically healthy that's now 6.8% of Americans um all of these biomarkers are easy to change in one to two months I would say with simple lifestyle habits could you remind us what hemoglobin A1c is I think most people are familiar with HDL cholesterol being the quote unquote good cholesterol and LDL being the bad cholesterol and as I say that I know I'm going to get dog piled oh totally I'm not sure that I adhere to that I'm not sure I don't adhere to that I'm not sure about a lot of things but I am sure that most people think of them that way um so just as a yeah to stay functional here we we'll frame it that way for now with with the caveat that that might not be the whole story isn't the whole story but um triglycerides fat in the blood fatty stuff but so key to understand about the triglycerides it's not PE we don't want to confuse triglycerides with eating more fat triglycerides are a storage form of excess carbohydrates in the blood so this is why it can tell us something about and I know you and you and Rob lusting talked about this at length butan yeah I mean one of the things that's really tricky gosh is that the the language around nutrition and health is complicated because people hear the word fat they think body fat but then they also think the macronutrient fat we just need more words to better parse totally the reality in biology we call the two major groups of of people lumpers and Splitters lumpers like to lump everything together it oversimplifies and complicates Splitters like to split everything give a name for everything individual name for everything it complicates and so there's a middle ground right there's a there's a land of reasonable people and nomenclature and unfortunately that does not exist on the internet nor does it exist in any one specific subfield of medicine or science I mean so much of the confusion out in the world is because of a lack of adequate language right in order to explain okay so um the triglycerides are a reflection of excess carbohydrate intake and how it's helping us with that tapestry of understanding the trifecta of bad energy is that if you think about it let's just go back to that cell and that Poe mitochondria that's being absolutely decimated by our environment uh and its capacity is low okay so that mitochondria is like I can't process glucose or fatty acids to ATP very well so I'm going to block their entry into the cell so now you've got glucose rising in the bloodstream so okay fasting glucose that was one of our envir markers if that's going up that is a little bit of that tapestry of maybe something's going on inside the cell that's blocking the entry into the cell so it's rising the bloodstream okay well where's all that the this the body does not want lots of glucose floating around in the bloodstream because it can literally independently cause endothelial dysfunction which is basically blood vessel problems it can cause oxidative stress in the bloodstream it can cause glycation which is sugar literally just sticking to things we the body doesn't want that glucose high in the bloodstream so it converts it to triglycerides to be stored in a storage form of energy that's a key point that I think is helpful to understand is that the body it's always trying to like kind of keep things in the right range so it'll convert things so then triglycerides a picture in your blood of glucose being high and triglycerides being high is very much should signal to everyone when they look at their Labs that there's probably something going on inside in inside the cell that's blocking the cell from being able to use and process it's a sign of mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic overnutrition too much substrate not enough processing glucose is going to go up Tri are going to go up and so so then if you kind of squint and read the tea leaves it's like huh I think metabolic dysfunction and what's fascinating is that the travesty in our healthare system is that a patient might go into the doctor and their fasting glucose is 99 one point under what we'd consider the normal range and their triglycerides are 149 one point under what we'd consider the normal range from these things that doctor might say to that patient you're totally fine both glucose and triglycerides are normal but that's just really problematic because they're on the upper end of normal for both of those and so really what that would say to me as someone thinking about the mitochondria is like this person is definitely metabolically dysfunctional they're on the highest end of normal for both triglycerides and glucose there's something there's definitely insulin resistance going on here I would much rather see that glucose at 703 and that triglyceride at 50 which to me would say oh this cell's processing through energy great and things are moving through and we're not backing up in the bloodstream we're not converting to triglycerides so that's where really optimal ranges get in but but so that's so that's glucose and triglycerides why if those are starting to creep up it's a sign that something is happening metabolically and then when we look at some of the other biomarkers so hemoglobin A1c is really so that's a marker that's looking at how many of the hemoglobin molecules that are in the red blood cells that carry oxygen how many of those hemoglobin molecules have sugar stuck to them and that's glycation so you're looking at glycated hemoglobin and you can imagine that if the concentration of glucose is higher over time more glucose is going to stick to red blood cells and that's going to create a higher percentage of glycated hemoglobin so that's why that lab is represented as a percentage so less than 5.7 is what we want you want those cells nice and smooth and slippery smooth no sugar stuck to them causing dysfunction um and because blood cells last for about 9 to 120 days hemoglobin A1c is giving us a basically a snapshot of average blood sugar levels over 9 to 120 days and if that average is higher again probably a sign that cells are rejecting glucose from the cell and it's causing to rise in the bloodstream and then just talking about one other biomarker in that that we talked about which was blood pressure people might say well how does blood pressure relate to like what's going on inside the cell you know in the mitochondria and whatnot and a really the fascinating link is that when that cell becomes insulin resistance which again is a compensatory mechanism for mitochondrial dysfunction the insulin is going to rise in the blood because the body's insulin resistant so the body's going to turn out more insulin to try and overcome the insulin block to drive the sugar into the cells so insulin levels rise well insulin is one of the key activators of nitric oxide which is the molecule in the blood that dilates and relaxes blood vessels and so when we become insulin resistant and we're not responding to that insulin signal we end up getting less nitric oxide activity so this is how kind of looking at even these very basic very cheap biomarkers through the lens of basic cellular physiology we can start to see man my body might be like underpowered I might I might have a mitochondrial issue here so that's a few of those tests that we really want to shoot for terrific and um thanks for bringing up blood pressure again it's sort of um comes across to many people as old school right but when atio was here um one of the several times he was here he he really pushed on blood pressure is such such a key metric right I mean obviously if blood pressure is high you're getting less nitric oxide through for whatever means here uh vessels and capillaries are constricted um cells aren't able to use the energy that's coming in there's excess energy there's buildup of metabolic waste there's all this stuff and now we can start to see the picture yeah it's trying to emerge and as you mentioned um briefly these markers can be put into healthy range or maybe even fantastic range in a very short period of time so we'll talk about um how to go about that um in terms of getting a basic blood test is you're a physician what's the secret code um I'll give away one that um a former guest who's also an MD shared which is oftentimes if you ask your physician for a blood test they will say well unless there's a particular need or you're um struggling with something they won't give it to you but if you have a shift from Baseline in a symptom or in a number that can help all the Physicians are going to come after me now with I guess with stethoscopes um uh I'm willing to Stand My Ground um if you want a blood test it's often useful to mention that there's 's been some Market shift um you want to be honest right but some Market shift in sleep in lifestyle in how you feel standing up sitting down I'm not trying to you know lace people's minds with ideas to to uh create narratives here but um oftentimes where Physicians are resistant they'll be more amendable if they understand that hey like something's changing and the patient saying something's changing it actually would be irresponsible of them to not give the blood test so there you go um Bring It On MDS so yeah truly and I think the nice thing about the again very basic tests and there are so many other tests that I talked about in my book and that you've talked about on your podcast apob uric acid fasting insulin hom IR hscrp liver function tests ggt all these other tests that are great that can really tell us more about mitochondrial dysfunction oxidative stress chronic inflammation but the ones I'm mentioning are the ones that you will not have to fight with your doctor about like the the the everything I just mentioned like the doctor should order on an annual physical and it's really about us learning to act like read the Tea Leaves of what they're saying and not look at them in this algorithmic way but like how together if they're creeping up or if many of them are a little bit high like we need to focus all of our energy on improving mitochondrial capacity basically and and bring those numbers down which we can do very very quickly once you start getting the mitochondria moving through more of those substrates a lot of them will just naturally come down now in the book I give scripts to literally talk to your doctor with because you are going to get push back often if you ask for a fasting insulin I would say probably I mean even though doctors are waking up a little bit like maybe 85% of people are going to have their doctors say they won't order that for them so I actually think there's a huge benefit I hate to say it but like going outside the system this is where I think innovation has been valuable there's a lot of like amazing companies doing direct to Consumer lab testing so you can basically avoid the hassle and some of them are very affordable there's um function health is a company that's doing 110 biomarkers including all the key metabolic biomarkers for less than $500 and they'll do it twice a year so you don't ever have to and then they do interpretations um insid tracker uh next Health levels is doing labs and so there's a lot of this springing up because I think people are sick of fighting with their doctors to get a a crumb of information about their health and it's it's it's we should probably be testing these I would say three to four times a year um and the beauty is is that like I think a lot of what keeps people down in the health world is that they're confused about what to do there's a lot of noise there's a lot of different strategies you know do I do you know paleo keto carnivore vegan Mediterranean do I do hit or Zone 2 or Ecentric it's like there's so much noise and the beauty with having a plan for understanding your biomarkers regularly is that you can cut through all the noise try a strategy see where you stand re retest in a few months and see if you're moving in the right direction you don't have to trust your doctor you don't have to trust me you don't have to trust anyone you can literally trust your own labs and I I I say to people like if your labs are optimal and the ranges I just mentioned are not optimal like we you want to actually get to better than all of those if you want to be optim if your if your key metabolic biomarkers are optimal if you feel absolutely freaking incredible and you have no symptoms then you're probably doing the right strategy whatever that is vegan keto whatever like and and exercise and your lifestyle because that is showing that your cells are fundamentally working properly so I think that's just a really empowering message and now there's phenomenal companies that are cropping up to basically help allow people to do this on their own schedule which I think is really the future of health and actually will help lessen I think some of the intensity of the diet Wars you know because it's like people can just say like I trust my strategy I know I'm doing what's right for me cuz like look at all my biomarkers and I feel great you know so yeah what used to be the before and after um you know pre-diet exercise post- diet exercise um photos on social media are now starting to also include numbers which is kind of interesting I mean obviously these aren't randomized control trials but it's cool to see people posting their numbers yeah of things that are not just related to Aesthetics but are um or body weight but are related to health metrics yeah uh it's it's it's fun I think it it speaks to um a more scientific or at least a more quantitative approach to things and I think it's inspiring for people um thanks for putting those scripts in the book that people can refer to um let's say that um I go in for these blood tests I do the basic 7 and I find that my fasting glucose is a little high my triglycerides are a little high my LDL is a little high um maybe a few other things are okay so I'm kind of in the you know not in the Red Zone but I'm in the like I should probably pay attention to these things what are some of the things that one can do in order to try and move those needles in the right direction um I know we talked about walking in movement before what are a few others and maybe we could start to touch into Nutrition a little bit and then we'll pivot to um insulin and blood glucose I think on the highest level it's about running through what are the science-based things that we know in our environment can lead to metabolic dysfunction and take honest stock of how those factors are playing out in your life and then choose a few to start moving in a different direction so the ones that I think are ones that we can really control um and that are we know based on the science are impacting our mitochondrial and metabolic health is the food the Sleep the movement the emotional health the toxins our relationship with light and our relationship with temperature and your journey to Optimal metabolic Health might be totally different from mine because I might really need to focus on the food and the sleep and the emotional health and you might really need to focus on the toxins and the light and the movement and so it's a lot of it is actually taking stock on where the levers are in your own life where are you crushing it and where is there a lot of room for improvement so Step One is knowing like that those are the thing those are the things in our environment that we need to to basically improve to have to give our CS the best capacity and then of course checking your biomarkers to make sure your interventions are working but but food I think is one that is like totally unavoidable of those pillars those Seven Pillars food is one that most of us are getting wrong and that we really actually have to get right to improve our metabolic health for a lot of reasons I mean our bodies are basically 100% molecularly made from food that's so wild it's so wild every time I think about that I kind of like blows my mind like babies are 3D printed from food basically inside a woman's body it's it's wild to me and then what's so cool about the body what brings me just immense awe every day is that like we have this conception in our Western world that the body is like a thing that we're with throughout our life because we kind of look the same and we like age slowly so it's like Casey is a thing and Andrew is a thing but the body is actually a process the body and there's this amazing dos statement like life is a process not an entity I love that no I'm sorry to interrupt I'm just I I always you know wish that if people could understand that um with Biology and health understanding the nouns and the names is important but it's verbs it's verbs verbs verbs if you understand that things are processes or processes depending on who you are and where you live in the world um it all becomes so much more tractable yes and it's so much more hopeful because if I'm a process if you're a process then every every day we're eating we are changing the process whereas if you think you're a thing then there's no hope cuz I'm just I'm Casey and that's who I am and I have this disease you know and I think so much in our language actually of healthc care both are Western sort of despir nature like we don't really have a lot of curiosity with with process but even like the ideas the way we talk about disease I have diabetes you know and I I and and we don't even talk about diabetes cures which now a lot of people are curing their diabetes we call it remission like it's this thing that's a part of you and I think I just love this idea of like we're evolving every day and food is so important because again we take in 70 metric tons of food in the lifetime two to three pounds per day one metric ton per year on average and that is like the printer ink that's the 3D printer ink to create tomorrow's version of oursel which is molecularly different than the Casey of today that's a hopeful message because if we can give the body food which you know I think we again our our conception of food I think is very limited um food is the molecular building blocks of the body it is the cell signaling functional molecules that tell our cells what to do they act as transcription factors epigenetic modifiers um cell signaling pathway intermediates and it's also of course the substrate to change what the microbiome does and the composition of the M microbiome which is basically a pharmacy inside our bodies to create different molecules that can affect our health so food is certainly a calorie is a calorie from the concept of thermodynamics but from the concept of molecular information it has three massively important parts that are unavoidable for creating cellular health so I would just say that that is the pillar that we can drill be happy to drill into of like what do we really do to you know build build as much metabolic Health as possible yeah I want to focus now if you're willing on food not just macronutrients proteins fats and carbohydrates not just calories although that as well but things like timing things like fasting um and micronutrients which I think is a a highly underexplored topic so with respect to food um gosh I feel like we've all been exposed to pretty much every variation of you know it's it's all calories in calories out and by the way I believe in the laws of thermodynamics um so yes total caloric load matters total energy expenditure matters without question within the framework of not consuming excess calories there's a lot to explore however um I can just say for myself for what it's worth I'm not very hungry until 11:00 a.m. noon or 1 I'm okay not eating until then and just you know water electrolyt and caffeine does me just fine I can exercise Etc but once I start eating I I really enjoy eating and I mostly like the proteins I like Meat and Fish and eggs and I like cheese and vegetables and carbohydrates and fruit and all of it I like all the stuff and I I tend to like single or few ingredient Foods I just naturally do so I've been lucky in that way but I know a lot of people like sandwiches processed foods things that are combinations of ingredients what do we know about about kind of uh I don't want to say optimal but if one we're going to explore different ways of eating for sake of adjusting these biomarkers in the right direction and improving metabolic health is there kind of a a generic jumping off point would most people for instance be wise to um cut back on the total number of sugars or the the total amount of sugar rather and perhaps reduce the amount of carbohydrate and replace it with some lean quality protein I mean are there generalizations that we can make or is it really all just about not getting excessive calories and trying to get those calories from the most nutrient-rich sources well just Drilling in on two things you just said there so one thing you said that was interesting was that you're lucky that you like all of those foods and then the second thing was is it just about not getting excess calories but I think what's interesting about both of those is that I would argue that the reason you like those Foods is because you have given your body enough whole real foods that now everything in your biology neurobiologically your reward circuitry your microbiome your satiety hormone threshold all of these are now basically creating a situation in which you like those foods and then the caloric thing fits into that because the reason we're eating excess calories the reason chronic nutrition is happening and the reason we are quite literally in the United States eating ourselves to death for the first time in human history is because we're not eating real food and we're eating 60 to 75% of our calories of ultra processed nutrient depleted foods that fundamentally don't give our cells what they need and a real premise that I think is so important to realize is that our cells are brilliant and if the cells aren't getting what they actually need to function properly they will drive you to eat until they get their needs met unfortunately because the ultra processed food is designed to be highly addictive and it's devoid of what the cells actually need for good function we end up eating ourselves into a grave and now almost 80% of Americans are overweight or obese close to 50% of the country is obese we literally gloss over this as a culture it has become so normal in such a short amount of time but I always think about the fact that like there are really no other animal species in the world that have obesity and chronic disease epidemics and they don't have social media they don't have experts they don't have PubMed they don't have the FDA they don't have the USDA they don't have any of it and they have somehow figured out a way to stay at a healthy weight and to not get heart disease and it's because they're eating real food that meets the needs of their cells and so I think to just boil that down the root cause of the problem is that we have a toxic food supply that's no longer filled with the molecular information that our body needs to know to be satiated and to function properly and so through the complex biology of satiety hormones and neurobiology and microbiome function we are driven to eat so so so much more so truly the jumping off point for anyone on the quest to Better Health is to eat as much real unprocessed food from good soil as possible and of really of any dietary philosophy they want truly I I think if someone's eating real unprocessed food from good soil who is you know plant-based or who is keto they are going to have such a higher chance of meeting their body's actual fundamental needs and the good thing about biomarker testing is they can track for themselves if they are having good cellular function with that strategy there's been studies that have panned this out you know we we know that the mor Ultra process food you eat the higher risk of obviously obesity but also chronic diseases are but then of course there's an amazing study from Kevin Hall just recently where he basically locked people up at the NIH and he for two weeks he had them eat Ultra processed food and for two weeks he had them eat real food and people ate 7,000 more calories in the two week period uh when they were eating Ultra processed food versus the unprocessed food they were locked at the NIH I've been to NIH quite a bit um I don't it's it's great for a day job or a day visit I don't know that I want to be locked there that sounds like a that sounds like the Stanford Prison prisoner experiment I say this tongue and Chic and with such admiration for what he had to do but I think it's so amusing that you know we have this totally Franken food toxic food system that's that's largely Ultra processed and it took amazing Kevin Hall to basically do an NIH you know funded study where people what I say by locked is that they were impatience at the NIH and every had ad Li you know unlimited access to food during each of those two week interventions so it was two weeks of ultra processed food two weeks of unprocessed or minely processed food and they could eat whatever they wanted as much as they wanted in both groups and then they would weigh every single bite that was left on their trays so they knew exactly exactly how many calories they ate and literally just giving people this Ultra processed food which is devoid of what our bodies need and and therefore will drive people to eat more they ate uh 500 calories more per day for a total of 7,000 calories more in that two weeks and they gained about two pounds and then lost two pounds in the unprocessed Group which makes sense of course because a pound is about 3500 calories and so we have to do these kind of crazy studies just to prove what we kind of know is true which is that this Ultra processed food environment that's cropped up over the past 50 years is an experiment that has failed it has failed you know close to 45% of kids are overweight or obese now like it's not working and that really is uh the root cause so I think a lot of food is about quality and how do we actually really meet the needs of of the cells so that our satiety hormones get secreted and we naturally stop eating because just telling people eat less calories but eat whatever you want that's just doesn't work we have to inspire the body to not want to eat excess calories which we do by stimulating satiety hormones you know helping the microbiome support that process and then change our reward circuitry which is done with nutrient-rich the most nutrient-rich food we can possibly get and that's why I mentioned the soil because our food is drastically dep depleted of nutrients so when we look at that 70 metric tons of food we're eating in the lifetime it's just fasting you that's that's the information for our body what it's going to be built from how it's going to function well right now 60 to 75% is ultra processed so we slash the value because the ultr processing just like slashes the nutrients we slash the value of that 70 metric tons and then we have crappy soil because our industrial agriculture system which means the the food in some cases has 70% less of key micronutrients in it so that 70 metric tons what's actually useful for our body becomes so much smaller so what we want to do is basically expand and the value of that substrate we're putting in the body and that means real food unprocessed from good soil meet the needs of the cells naturally don't be hungry maintain a healthy weight um and you know something I talk about is that we could I mean we could talk about nutrition the biochemistry of nutrition all day but in my review of sort of the biology and the biochemistry like there's five main things I think we can strive for in our food that can really help meet the needs of our cells and and when it really comes there are obviously more things our body needs but if we strive for these five things we will ultimately I think eat a really healthy diet and that is fiber Omega-3s adequate healthy protein a good amount of probiotics and high antioxidant sources and if we build our diet around knowing a few things in each of those categories that we really love and stock our kitchen with it and make our meals a mixing and matching of each of those components and we get a good amount of those we will give the body a lot of what it needs to have mitochondrial Health reduce chronic inflammation reduce oxy of stress it's interesting for me to take a step back from nutrition as it's typically presented and think about the brain the hypothalamic circuitry that drives hunger and satiety and things like that and to map that on to what I've heard and I I believe to be true based on my view of the literature which is that we are largely meaning these circuits in the brain make us largely amino acid foraging machines because we need those amino acids in order to carry out metabolic processes and reconstruct any tissues that need repair and and Recovery not just from exercise but just daily turnover um removal of waste Etc um so we're foraging for amino acids unconsciously we're foraging for micronutrients and of course we need macronutrients we need enough energy from proteins fats and carbohydrates or some either combination of the three I feel like I'm sort of in the dying category of omnivores right I'm neither you know I'm not meat-based and I'm not uh plant-based I'm omnivores I think most people are omnivores actually but uh omnivores aren't discussed quite as quite as much as um the other categories at least not on social media but that you know we're we think of ourselves as getting hungry and wanting to eat um and I think eating the foods some of them I listed off before like Meat and Fish and eggs and vegetables and fruits and some I do like starches like you know rice oatmeal some pastas some sourdough Breads and things I love butter who doesn't love butter um of course none of that stuff in excess olive oil but if one looks at kind of that um Buffet of of options you realize you can get some high quality amino acids you can get some high quality lipids you um probably want to get more of them from olive oil than from butter but you can get the micronutrients you need provided those food sources are healthy now contrast that with a highly processed diet or even a minimally processed diet and you can get the taste you can get the macronutrients you can get the calories but you don't meaning the brain doesn't really have a sense of it can't directly map taste calories micronutrients on um onto one another and so you can imagine that the neural circuits and here I'm it's a little bit of hypothesizing SL conjecture but that the neural circuits responsible for hunger and satiety would get immensely confused by what's in a highly processed food right a Snickers bar if you like sweets tastes pretty good but it's unclear what's in it except sugar except some you know it's got a certain Snickers bar taste right but if the circuits of the brain are really trying to drive us to get amino acids and micronutrients um for bodily health and repair well then highly processed and even moderately processed food has just got to be pure confusion I'm sorry to go long here but it reminds me of the of an idea I had once where like imagine if you took a pill that in greatly increased the level of dopamine norepinephrine acetylcholine and serotonin all at once that's polypharmacology and it might make you feel a certain way maybe good maybe bad and then afterwards you'd probably have a bit of a crash from as the drug wore off no doubt you would but let's say you wanted more of that feeling you wouldn't really know what to go look for because you don't know what what was in it because it's poly pharmacology so I feel like Pro highly processed food is polypharmacology whereas when you are eating foods that create a more pure experience of micronutrients amino acid content calories and taste those four things map to one another that intuitively we can start to understand oh I like this food and it's good for me and this is enough of it right I don't know anyone who of reasonable size that that eats like four ribeye steaks you know they eat one I me I'm sure there's some freaks out there that do that but you know one you know even small piece of quality meat is very satiating yeah you will self-regulate because the body like every other animal in the world is exquisitly designed to regulate hunger on a very intuitive level if we eat natural food it's you know it's I think it's almost ridiculous to talk about calories and isolation because the reason we're eating more calories is because we're eating ultra-processed food and so but I love what you just said Andrew about the brain and the poly faracy I think that literally is it's I've never heard that said and I think it's like processed food is like poly Pharmacy of food it is the definition of processed food which I know you talked about with Rob lusting the Nova four criteria is literally it's breaking down Foods into these constituent parts that were never meant to be separated from each other like the endosperm of a wheat kernel separate from the brand and the you know the germ um and then take that and like a little science experiment pair it up with all these other individual components and synthetic chemicals that are made in a factory and put them together to create this thing that the body I I I truly think our insatiable hunger again we're eating ourselves to death in the United States that's the reality our insatiable hunger and our chronic disease epidemic fundamentally is a lot of it's It's Mass cellular confusion and when you think about what chronic inflammation is chronic inflammation is biochemical fear on the cellular level well when you put this stuff into the body that's never seen before obviously that's going to generate some confusion and you know you could you could trace that back to what that really means with leaky gut and you know all the sorts of the real physiology of that but um there's a wonderful book that is called the end of Cravings by Mark shatzer he also wrote the Dorito effect but he talks a little bit what you're talking about which is ideal that processed food is actually the ultimate sort of food um based variable reward so in the way that it in like things that I mean I'm speaking the expert here but things that the body can't predict what the outcome is going to be are going to kind of get you in that dopamine motivation pathway and that's actually what processed food is doing is it's every time we eat a different ver we think we're eating a tortilla but it's like completely different than all the other weird tortilla Ultra process tortillas on the Shelf so every time we eat tortilla and our brain is this incredible prediction machine and as it's coming towards our mouth we're predicting what the load is going to be but we have no idea is it a Coke Zero is it a Diet Coke with Aspartame is it is it a regular Coke it all tastes the same but the nutrients that our gut are totally different so we end up actually triggering the motivation Pathways because of process food representing a variable reward whereas every time you eat a ribeye your body is pretty much getting a similar thing each time and so the prediction um matching is going to be more conducive to uh getting off the motivation treadmill for more which I think is so fascinating um but I think backing up a little bit one one concept I have for food that really helps me is really thinking about the body's always trying to help me be satiated and trying to help reduce my Cravings I literally just have to give the body what it needs I have to stimulate the body in a way that it will serve me in giving me satiety hormones to basically regulate my hunger and again with visuals I think it's so helpful I think about these cells lining our small intestine that literally have nutrient sensors like and literal receptors on the cell membrane in the luminal side of the gut that's facing all the food that are just sitting there like waiting to bind with these things in our food that will stimulate the cell to make the satiety hormone that poof effortly makes us not hungry gets rid of that grip of attachment to Cravings that all of us are so plagued by and like I think you know we have this intense conversation happening in society right now about gp1 analoges and OIC and mjara and all these things gp1 Agonist but like you know we rarely talk about the fact that like we have nutrient sensing cells of the gut the L cells of the gut that when stimulated appropriately will make glp1 and when stimulated the way they want to be will secrete hordes of glp1 for us and so how do we actually think about just literally giving the body what it needs to stimulate the society hormones and the processed foods aren't giving us those things you know the things that are goingon to um stimulate those cells well well the things that will I mean this is kind of fascinating if you don't mind going down a little road talking yeah please with the gp1 conversation I feel like so missing from the conversation is the idea that like from a first principles perspective there's three ways our body could make more gp1 we make more cells that make it l cells of the gut each of those cells makes more glp1 and importantly we can also inhibit the inactivator of gp1 which is an enzyme called dpp4 so gp1 actually gets rapidly degraded by dpp4 in the body so if we can figure out how to inhibit dpp4 we can raise our glp1 levels what is dpp4 it's an enzyme that breaks down gp1 said that and I missed I apologize so fascinating and so how often have you seen in the headlines oh here's some strategies to inhibit your dpp4 never because OIC is is you know on track to be the highest grossing Med in human history and just like we talked about in the beginning of the episode the whole industry this4 trillion dollar Health Care industry is desperate for not us to not understand how to do the things that drugs could do for us so when we look at those three first principles approaches of how do we make more L cells get them to produce more glp1 from each L cell and then inhibit the breakdown through the inhibition of dpp4 for the first one we know that short chain fatty acids which of course are the byproduct of microbial fermentation of fiber in the diet stimulates the differentiation of more L cells in the gut so more short chain fatty acids more L cells can we translate that into support the gut microbiome eat more fiber eat more fiber and um we had Justin sonenberg from Stanford on a world expert in gut microbiome and he was a big proponent of based on work he's done um with Chris Gardner and others at Stanford so happens of ingesting one to three servings of low sugar fermented foods each day things like sauerkraut kimchi again low sugar variety is probably best yeah maybe not you said not kombucha yeah cuz that's going to be like the highest sugar of the fermented foods which people often go to but now soda cly the sauerkraut you can actually make your own sauerkraut Tim Ferris had a great recipe for this in the 4our chef you have to be careful because you know that you can create some unhealthy ferment you have to do it the way he describes so check out the the recipe it's online um or you can buy sauerkraut and the brins um drinking the brine off the sauerkraut or off um seems to be good for the gut that's such a great point which is that ultimately we want the short chain fatty acids which is the the the medicine that the the microbiome are making for us through the microbial fermentation process and we can basically do that in three ways one is we can eat more fiber which is prebiotics we can also eat more polyphenols because we're now learning that the microbiome actually processes they ferment polyphenols from our which is basically you'll find those in colorful fruits and vegetables um spices teas cocoa things like that so fermentation of polyphenols and fiber to short chain fatty acids which then we absorb um and then like you just said in a fermented food the bacteria in that food will be making short chain fatty acids by fermenting the food in there and then if we drink that we're getting the short chain fatty acids directly so that's the kimchi sauerkraut uh Greek yogurt kavass which I'm obsessed with which is like low sugar Kucha it's like made with fermenting beets basically good stuff it's such good stuff uh miso natto so that's one that has been shown to differentiate more L cells in the gut we also know that people with 2 diabetes have much fewer L cells in the gut and it's hard to know what the causality is there but I think a safe assumption is like if we keep our blood sugar under better control and sort of stay out of that diabetic range it probably lends itself I don't know what the chicken in the egg is there but blood sugar stability more L cell differentiation and then actually ginsing has been shown to um to improve l l cell differentiation so that's just sort of one one set of things and I don't think the dose on sing has been has been settled but um very high antioxidant component plant when we look at actually stimulating more glp1 you've talked about your remate I think having like a a mild effect on glp1 but there's actually a lot of other things um in the literature protein of course Very potently stimulates these nutrient receptor cells and specifically like veiling and glutamine seem to have a potent stimulatory effect on glp1 so you're find that and like meat and turkey and eggs and things like that what are your thoughts on supplementing El glutamine it's controversial I know that some people do it um in an effort to relieve leaky gut but that's but there aren't any randomized control trials for that so the um depending on one's stance on what's required for uh uh kind of a threshold for for adopting something you know some people say that's crazy other people really swear by supplementing El glutamine maybe it's through this this route of increasing um L cells um that some of the gut relief might might exist I guess we'd have to explore it so that's speculative folks um so this is interesting these are ways to increase the cells that then make glp1 so fiber Prebiotic probiotic fiber and fermented antioxidants lowering blood sugar Jin saying so those are kind of the L cell ones the actual secretion of more glp1 the one of the most potent ones and the study that looks at this like the bar graphs are very clearly statistically sign significant lots of asteris is actually thids thids tell me more about thid thids are so fascinating thids are actually a structure in plants that are part of the chloroplasts so you know chloroplast and this also is fascinating because chloroplasts are basically the plant version of mitochondria essentially and thids are a molecule in the chloroplast and there's actually been research that shows that when you eat about 100 gram of spinach which gives you five grams of straight thyo covid over 12 weeks daily it led to a a significant increase in glp1 and again I don't remember the exact it was two or threefold higher um secretion so this is in part so so so that's a direct stimulatory effect of the the L cells and so this is this equates to 3.5 ounces of spinach a day which is like nothing so just getting ra spinach or cooked spinach I think I actually I don't think it actually it might have said in the methods but I I would imagine raw because you want to get those undenatured thids in the gut so just kind of another actually thids do a lot of other interesting stuff they inhibit lipase in the gut and so actually help more fat get down to the distal small bowel and promote satiety so this is one of the reasons why you talk about oh the people who eat all these healthy foods and greens they're less hungry it's like it's biochemistry like there's stuff happening in there that is making the hunger signals go down through things like inhibiting lipase you know in improving gp1 secretion so other things for gp1 secretion the thids also Fiers has been shown specific amino acids so high protein foods things that involve a lot of veine and glutamine uh green tea and specifically the uh elic the EC um ecgc that uh is one of the compounds in green tea that's been shown to stimulate glp1 curcumin um so there's several things that are all in that like food you know basically things you would associate with a healthy diet but we actually know they stimulate glp1 so I you know those are all things I try to include in my diet and the last one is inhibition of dpp4 and that one there's just actually when you look at the research there's some kind of random foods that tend to inhibit dpp4 um black beans Mexican oregano other forms of oregano Rosemary guava and um I wrote this one down because it's a word I hadn't seen very much before I started digging into this but mtin which is found in berries cranberries and peppers and and Swiss chards so all that is to say ultimately many of us are gripped by cravings and the idea of have you know just sort of not being constantly driven to eat more which I would argue that about 80% of Americans are feels really hard to overcome but a lot of it is literally just communicating to your CS in in a clear way through food to help you be satiated and the science can show us how to do this and a lot of it comes down to eating essentially what you were talking about how you eat omnivorous protein um healthy sources with nutrient you know density and lots of colorful fruits vegetables um spices herbs things like that um so yeah yeah it's interesting um again these aren't randomized control trials nor are they peer-reviewed studies but I have a few friends who I've known for most of my life who really struggled with their weight uh carried a lot of excess weight and we starting to suffer health issues um in their even their 30s but in their 40s I'm 48 so they're my peers and so they're about that age range and they've all done extremely well meaning they lost a tremendous amount of body fat are terrifically healthy now by way of basically restricting their uh food intake to proteins so fish and meat eggs fruits and vegetables they basically just cut out starches and um but I don't think it was the starches per se I think it was the satiety that comes from eating high quality protein fruits and vegetables and from limiting the number of Highly processed foods and actually the toughest thing for all of them was to um stop asking me or themselves rather like can I include this condiment this this you know and what's interesting is all of them now seem to really enjoy eating Foods in their more pure form and I'm not somebody that like pushes on this on my friends they just come to me and say like how do I lose 50 lbs with um without having to exercise it all off you know um as the only source of of of weight loss they they all exercise as well but um it's just so daunting to try and lose you know 20 30 40 lbs and to do so quickly and then to keep it off cuz they've all had the experience of going on a diet and then you exercising a lot then um the point here is that I really think there's something powerful about that relationship between taste macronutrient value micronutrient value and um satiety yes I think there's really those powerful associations because the brain is such an associative machine uh one thing that I should have um said before um and I know most people are familiar with OIC yeah um and its commercial names are I forget what the the um OIC is commercial name and munaro and movi and yeah got it um is that glp1 acts more or less as an appetite suppressant um powerful appetite suppressant so um many millions of people are now taking uh gp1 analogs is that right I think there were over 20 million pres scripts in the United States wow last year is it expensive it's it's $20,000 per year does insurance cover it typically uh right now insurance is covering it for indications um but there is a allout assault uh from the pharmaceutical industry to essentially classify obesity as a genetic disease and a chronic disease in order to be able to feed this medication more into the insurance pathway and essentially get more taxpayer dollars to pay for this medication um and it is extremely expensive and it's on track to be the highest grossy medication in history because uh it's now being recommended for people with obesity type 2 diabetes and then the American Academy Pediatrics recently has talked about giving this to children as young as 12 as part of the first line for overweight um and you know I think really it's such a travesty based on the conversation we've had because what OIC does not do in any way shape or form is impact the toxic environment that we're living in that's hurting our mitochondria losing weight is different than improving mitochondrial function and mitochondrial dysfunction is the root cause of basically every chronic illness and symptom that's torturing American lives today and so in many ways it represents like the ultimate Band-Aid for an environment that is not changing um and when you think about what we could do with $220,000 per year and it's a weekly injection so say well per person like oh it's and it's a medication that is intended to be taken for life because when people come off this medication many people are gaining back all of the weight or even more weight afterwards and then there's been conversations Peter Tia is waiting on this about loss in lean mass you know part of the weight loss is disproportionately muscle and so there's a lot of concerns about it um above and beyond its ability to lower the number on the scale that uh we should all be very alert too because um you know the reality is is that the 40 trillion cells in our body are in an environment in the western world right now that is not conducive to core biologic functioning and there is obviously no shot that can mitigate the multi-front assault on our biology that ultimately generates a body that's immensely profitable for those 100 Specialties of healthcare so you know we're living in this this Matrix and this game of you know a devil's bargain between a $4 trillion doll Healthcare and pharmaceutical industry and a$6 trillion dollar processed food industry that all want us to think that you know the answer is found in a shot and we don't need to change anything about our lifestyle but of course you know these simple habits that we're talking about eating real food moving walking Etc getting out in the sunlight um rapidly can inrease our mitochondrial capacity and um you know are just the most disruptive thing that we can do you know in our culture today is is learn about metabolic health and improve it and um it's it's just interesting to see what's happening in the media with sort of the assault against these empowering habits and very in favor of uh a medication like OIC and then when you trace you know unfortunately incentives there a huge percentage of these Outlets that cover you know OIC as a miracle drug their bills are paid by Pharma 60% of mainstream media advertising budget is Pharma and so you know I just I just say that because I think um it's it's a scandal um that we give so much air time to these medications and not to simple metabolic habits that can make us feel you know so incredible and and really change our core biology so walking exercise eating minimally processed or nonprocessed Foods um you also mentioned temperature yeah very very interested in that but uh before we we go a little bit further down the path of what one can do in terms of um having agency over their metabolic Health um I just feel obligated to just entertain the possibility presumably somebody who's really struggled with their weight a long time um maybe because of excess Cravings you know challenges in regulating their appetite or whatever we don't know what the reasons are um maybe they injured their knee and they can't exercise I mean this happens right um at least not yet um take a GP analog like OIC loses some weight probably loses some muscle also one would hope that that would give them the sense okay now I can move my body better I'll start exercising eating better as well I think that I have to imagine that there's a middle case condition where people are not just relying on Pharmaceuticals and not just relying on um behavioral uh routes uh to improve metabolic Health but can do both right I mean that and one would hope they are if if they're already taking these meds or is it the case that when people have a pill or an injection or a potion that gives them the effect that they want that they just remain sedentary I think we have to look at history here I mean you first of all there have been other weight loss medications throughout history that you've talked about in the podcast like the fen Fen and then there was another one I think even before that that made people their temperature go up that you talked about so the two these are I used to work on thermal regulation as an undergrad so uh fenfen was eventually banned because it caused some cardiac issues I believe it was a stimulant F Flur me so um sorry it's not Fen Flur me it alone it's a combination of things that's why it's called Fen Fen um and then um dinitrophenol right which was um based on the observation that workers in ammunitions factories were being exposed to this stuff and losing a lot of body fat and weight um it actually made its way into the sports Community it's highly deadly highly deadly just don't even don't even look it up it's highly deadly don't because the moment people start looking it up they started thinking about dabbling the way the internet is now dinitrophenol um and I think it has to do with with um sort of uh processing of the of mitochondria I think this is happening in the the electron chains in mitochondria so anyway or free electron look it up excuse me um the bottom line here is that um there have been plenty of drugs mostly stimulants used to help people lose weight and um or that have acted directly on the mitochondria it has not worked out well historically it just hasn't and I think that I'm not just going to lump it's a different mechanism so I don't want to lump it in with past weight Lo loss drugs however if you look at the trends throughout history the medicalization and pharmacology towards chronic issues has been an abject failure I cannot I don't know of and I'm sure people can correct in the comments but of a single chronic condition for which the explosion of the pill to treat and manage that condition has lessened the rates of that condition the more ssris you prescribe the more depression we have the more met Foreman we prescribe the more type 2 diabetes rates are going up the more OIC is being prescribed obesi is going up you know this is on Wall Street they're not this is on track to be a blockbuster drug and they're not assuming the rates of obesity are going to go down that wouldn't actually make sense for the business mod model I mean these are being talked about at the JP Morgan Healthcare conferences do you think they're thinking that this is going to plummet no like there are I can't think of very many chronic conditions for which the explosion of the medication has reduced the frequency of the disease that's really something to think about um and the reason is because of exactly what we started this conversation with they're not actually truly impacting or healing the root cause physiology in some cases they're worsening that root cause physiology like they are inducing oxidative stress they may help with the symptomatic management um but not actually reducing that Trifecta that we talked about in the beginning and so why do we have reason to believe that medicalizing obesity and not actually getting at the root cause which has to be impacted by multimodal gent gentle nudges in our daily life habits and environment that that's actually going to reduce the rates of the conditions so no that's very helpful okay so I'll then return to the other question about temperature uh what are some things that can do with temperature and by the way as I do this I I can't resist any longer uh Casey Dr means brought me this jar of blueberries people that know me know that I um I'm a driveby blueberry eater so if there's blueberries out on a on a table I'm going to take some I've never eaten during a podcast but I'm going to now so um I'll try and chew quietly do you want some sure okay um um I love blueberry Beres and um no I don't eat them one by one so I'm but I'm going to try and eat them quietly so we'll keep them here in the middle for the time being and I'm going to eat them by the handful just cuz I got hungry and and you mentioned berries earlier and it triggered a a neural circuit for me so what about temperature people that know me or even that just listen to the podcast know that I like the cold shower thing cold plunge thing I don't do it every day I don't do it after resistance training workouts for at least 6 hours and mostly keep it on days separate from the resistance training because there are some data that can inhibit hypertrophy and strength um adaptations but I like it I like it feels good um I feel great afterwards for many hours and I I believe there are some health effects and um I'm willing to weather the storm uh of of naysayers because more and more data keep emerging that that's the case um not all the data are spectacular yeah one paper on this actually was just retracted we need to do an update um to an episode to um it's not work from my lab but I still think that there's a lot of really terrific work on um deliberate cold exposure what's the deal with temperature and mitochondria so no one has basically described this better than you I feel like on your on your platform but I think about it very very simply throughout human history humans have really in so many different parts of the world been exposed to hugely fluctuating temperatures like if you look at the Sahara Desert or like a regular day in Colorado it's like you can go from let's talk about s deser you can go from 30° to 110 degrees in the span of one day and like even the concept of indoors is like a relatively New Concept in human history four walls you know insulation then Central Heating and Cooling that's like the last 50 75 years in most homes and so this idea our cells have evolved to respond to Big swings in temperature that very recently we have totally pulled away and I think that when I think about the mitochondria and increasing their capacity I'm thinking about well how do I use different energetic signals in my environment to essentially get the mitochondria to do better work and we can think about all the different types of energies that we're exposed to solar energy thermal energy acoustic energy mechanical energy you know food energy like there's there's that's basically what our environment is right and thermal energy is a big one of those we can speak to our mitochondria with the Lang of thermal energy and say hey it's cold outside we need you to print more of yourselves or work harder such that we can create heat inside the body to respond to this stimulus and so that's kind of the framing that I use for it and like you know this data is hard to know if it's totally accurate but like our population is is Cooling and some I think it was Data Stanford actually that was showing that like our temperature has gone down like 2% or something like that in the last 100 years and that fundamentally is mitochondria not working as well as they should research has shown we're making less ATP in a lot of our cells and that's you know function of mitochondrial dysfunction one fun fact I don't know if you knew this but uh the body makes about 88 pounds of ATP per day for like the average American so we're constantly making it we're constantly recycling it in this like you know like basically make it use it make it use it make it so fast that like we essentially don't change our weight but but it's kind of and of course as it's being broken down HP to ADP we release heat and so I just think of cold as like one of the tools in our tool belt to talk to the mitochondria to say make more heat and in a world in which our mitochondria Under Siege I think it's a valuable often very inexpensive one that can we can use of course it does not supplement or replace food sleep exercise but I think it can be a very valuable tool to stimulate you know through that signal to to basically make more heat and you know we know of course it can help and it the data you know is is mixed but like incre increase Brown fat which is like mitochondrial dense fat and have it do more work and whatnot so ultimately Brown fat is mitochondrial dense fat and we want to you know help promote that so that's how I use cold and then on the heat side you know just fascinating how that's kind of acting to help metabolic Health um through the activation of the heat stck protein some of which have you know the ability to upregulate antioxidant defense systems and quell some of that wildfire that we talked about that can hurt our mitochondria so um I put them lesser on my list um but you know because we just can't we can't avoid the food and you know the sleep and and the movement but I think it's a great tool that we can use I love it and I will just point out that the reason the brown fat is Brown at all is because of the density of mitochondria it's literally Brown down the microscope this is not the kind of fat that um is subcutaneous although it you know it sits around the scapula neck upper back there's other um pockets of it on the body too and such an interesting tissue um yeah I don't know why deliberate cold exposure is so controversial I think it's because people who don't like it and frankly no one likes getting in it the the best part is getting out and how you feel afterwards but I think it um nothing grates on people uh like deliberate cold exposure if they don't like deliberate cold exposure and there's no requirement for it but I think it's a very interesting stimulus and I think there's also a very interesting relationship between light and temperature because in most areas of the world as days get longer meaning more sunlight available temperatures go up um and nowadays we can really divorce ourselves from all this like day lengthening and shortening temperature fluctuations which is not to say that we should all be running around in a minimal amount of clothing Outdoors but there's just such beautiful data from Dr Susanna soberg work um showing for instance that deliberate cold exposure then leads to one feeling more comfortable at cold temperatures because you become a you know a essentially more of a furnace more more more Brown fat anyway we could go on and on but I think it's um yet another lever of of of autonomy in terms of taking control of one's Health as you said um not as critical as food intake and quality amount and maybe timing as well um speaking of timing what are your thoughts on fasting and then of course movement and exercise yeah the way I conceptualize the idea of fasting obviously this is one where we we need more work right because the word fasting is so limited there's so many different parts of this but skipping breakfast for me would be that or or skipping dinner sometimes I'll skip dinner sometimes I'll skip breakfast right um I think that some of the most interesting data that I've seen has been about if we reasonably compress our eating into daytime hours during the heart of the dial cycle when we are supposed to be eating so essentially matching our chronobiology with our Behavior which you know we are dial organism so we kind of need to respect that like when we do that and we compress it in a moderate way our metabolic health is better and so some of the studies that have looked at this one that was interesting was and I think very hopeful for people is that if you take all the food all the calories that you're going to eat and eat them in a sixh hour window versus a 12-hour window totally same amount of calories exact same food this is a controlled experiment people who eat the same amount of calories in a six-hour period are going to have much lower statistically significantly lower glucose uh 24-hour glucose and insulin levels compared to people who just space it out over the course of a 12-hour period and it makes sense because if you're spacing that food out over the course of 12 hours that is a different biochemical millu in your body throughout the day it's kind of similar to The Walking you know it's like you are then stimulating insulin several more times you are exposing the bloodstream to insulin and glucose just more throughout the day um and giving the bloodstream less of an opportunity to sort of be clear from that glucose and that insulin and so compressing our eating Windows seems to be helpful uh for for metabolic health and it's a bang for your buck right like you can eat the same amount of food you just have to eat in a shorter period of time so for people who want to eat you know a lot maybe just consider compressing it into daytime hours six to eight hour window yeah for me six is tough the one meal per day thing is tough I have friends like Lex Friedman that do the one meal per day I end up eating so much food at that meal I experience a lot of like kind of like mechanical distress it's typically later in the day I think an 8 to 10 hour window has worked well for me most most days um I know as soon as we talk about intermittent fasting which is what or Tim restricted feeding same thing which is what we're talking about right now I'm sure somebody's going to call up the um there's been a study that's been circulating about a um massive increase in cardiovascular risk in people doing intermittent fasting in particular the six-hour feeding window I just want to point out we study as far as I know I could be wrong but as far as I know that study is still in abstract form it's not yet peer-reviewed yeah it's like the fact that um studies that haven't been peer reviewed aren't even close to being peer-reviewed are um are being like put out there as news stories is is really problematic because um I can tell you as somebody who sat on the editorial Boards of many journals for many years I still sit on a few reviewed countless papers I've submitted and had to deal with reviews on countless papers the fact of the matter is like until the reviews are done the revisions are made like that paper may never see the light of day and it may end up in a journal that you is barely worthy of a placem it might end up in a high tier high quality Journal but it might not so because there was quote unquote a study done means very little but it means especially little maybe nothing until it's peer reviewed absolutely and the methods were very poor in that study it was a recall based study I think for two days of of recall of people's diets which is notoriously very bad in terms of accuracy so yeah and I think I'm not in any way suggesting that a six-hour window is the optimal window I'm just sharing the data that suggests that compressing the window uh seems to have a favorable effect and I certainly don't do six hours but I think when you look at what the average American is doing which is the average American has 11 eating events per day and 50% of Americans eat over a 15h hour window per day I can recall those because I remember when I was writing the book I I was like that's a long time 15 hours and 11 events and and every time you're doing that you're going to be stimulating this glucose in the bloodstream explo exposing the blood vessels to that glucose you're going to be turning on all the pathways with insulin to basically store it or you know and it's so it's it's strained for the body and so I think giving the body times intentionally to allow insulin to come down and to allow glucose to come down what that does is it generates metabolic flexibility it gives our body an opportunity to have space to use accessible glucose and then convert into using stored fat but be and that ultimately is metabolic flexibility the ability for the body giving the body opportunities to use glucose but then have times when there's not high glucose and Insulin around to actually get into the fat stores and I think one of the reasons why we have such a massive overweight and obesity you know rates in the country is because with the way the culture of eating right now 11 eating events per day eating over the course of 15 hours per day I would imagine the average American body is rarely if ever tapping into their fat stores for energy and a meaningful way because we always have glucose available to the body if you think about again the stats about ultr processed food um about 70% of the the items on the shelves in the grocery store Ultra processed food and those ultr processed foods are built on refined added sugars and refined added grains so we're just we very rarely give the body the opportunity to rest and and move into fat burning and that's where compressing the eating window can be valuable um obviously people have talked about this before but fasting can be a stress for the body especially if your body's not used to using fat for energy and so it's something to ease into and go slow but I think if you're slowing down enough to really hear what your body's signal are saying you can kind of know whether I think your fasting is working for you or not I I can tell I've got too many other things going on I haven't slept well lot of stress I can tell that fasting is kind of making me jittery and not feel good versus if I'm really if I have good capacity I can feel that it's actually making me feel really incredible and so tune in with your body obviously and you know you can check your biomarkers if you have a CGM on you can see what's happening to your glucose if you have a ketone monitor you can see what's happening to your ketones and really actually track which I think makes fasting actually even even more fun I'll mention one other piece of data that I think is actually really kind of fun as well with timing of eating um there was a study that looked at people who ate the exact same meal at 9:30 a.m. or 8:30 p.m. so basically after dark essentially in the part of the dial phase when we probably shouldn't be eating versus early in the morning 9:30 um and the glucose and Insulin responses for the same meal at 8:30 p.m. were significantly higher than when eating at 9:30 a.m. and so again banging for your buck it appears that eating in that earlier part of the day when we're active and our chronobiology is set up for metabolism and activity we have a a lower glucose and insulin response there's also some evidence that melatonin um which is secreted you know as we get closer to sleep um has somewhat of an effect on impairing our insulin sensitivity transient and so we may actually just be not absorbing the glucose from those meals effectively later at night so I tend to kind of move a little bit more a little bit more low carb I I would say throughout the day based on that data and what I've seen on my continuous glucose monitor basically just higher spikes for the same meal later in the day so why not just kind of move it up earlier very interesting something I'll I'll definitely try I tend to push my carbohydrates to a little bit later in the day for sake of sleep um unless of course I've done resistance training which I do three time I aim to do three times a week and post resistance training I try and get some start carbohydrate in me um just to replenish glycogen and that's um then tends to reduce my carbohydrate craving later in the day I love bread and butter bread and olive oil pastas and the other day I found this Argentine place and I love the steaks there but they had Mii that it took everything I had every neural circuit in uh that releases Gaba inhibition to my brain to not order three of those ORD it was so good but you can walk after the no yeah sure I'll allow myself to do those things I'm not super restricted but again I to eat high quality foods by the way these blueberries are amazing um I need to figure out where you got those cuz they're just Tangy enough um I'm doing everything I can to just not take the jar and funnel them into my into my mouth um yeah I think you know if if we're looking at blood sugar blood glucose and Insulin um and as as long as we're talking about that I I did use a levels tracker and yeah full disclosure they're a sponsor of the podcast regularly and I I learned a ton I'll tell you tell you what I learned I I learned that um indeed my blood sugar goes up after I eat um that certain foods although the foods that did this surprise me um certain foods tend to spike my my blood sugar um quite a bit um grapes that shouldn't be surprising um Foods food order was very powerful for me I know that the dayon food order are a little bit mixed and it's controversial but um I like to eat like the French I like some soup then I like my entree I like the salad at the end that turned out to have the steadiest um and lowest rise in blood glucose for me and then across time I also found that um I love hot sauna I go um so hot with the sauna that I've been accused by Rogan and other people I'm going to turn myself into a brisket um but um after the sauna my um blood sugar spikes presumably because I'm a bit dehydrated and it's the concentration of blood glucose is that is that possible does that make sense it does make sense but also the heat can affect the accuracy of the sensor itself ah okay so that could be it too but yeah basically what it allowed me to do is make a few adjustments in terms of foods that I eliminated or eat less of food ordering within a meal and I find that I'm very susceptible to um if I don't include enough fat dietary fat in the meal then my blood glucose spikes even if it's just like tuna right but by including olive oil and other things it really blunts it and of course here we're doing correlative um anic data but for me I felt far better when I included a bit more fat um and when the food order was adjusted the way I mentioned before always including a little bit of fiber really helped it and that makes sense right slow the absorption of the food presumably um so I I found that it was a very valuable experiment for me again this isn't an advertisement it just so happens I did this and and really benefited from it um what are some other things that one can learn from continuous monitoring of blood glucose what are some things to watch for that might signal a problem and what are some fun things that one could do to explore an experiment because I like to explore an experiment yeah well I mean a lot of the things that you just naturally learned are the things that have been shown in data and and like you said some of this data it's like small studies small groups of people but for instance adding fat and fiber to meals has a significant and repeatable impact in populations on lowering gluc response uh fat probably in some part due to slowing uh gastric emptying and actually slowing the diges process so the rise in the bloodstream is going to slow down and then fiber both for that reason but also because fiber can in a sense create like a mesh sort of blocking the absorption of some of the glucose that's in the meal so literally kind of actually preventing you from absorbing all of the carbs and we've actually seen that in the levels data set that the more fiber people include with their meals we see essentially a direct relationship with lowering of their their glucose excursions which is really exciting because fiber is something that you can add to meals very easily I put basil seeds chia seeds hemp seeds flax seeds on a lot of my food at this point because it's essentially a little bit of fat a lot of fiber uh and it's kind of just helps you kind of get more from your from your meal um so what you can learn so I think step one the way I think about a glucose monitor first of all I'll say the purpose of the glucose monitor is not to have to game the system and get flat glucose the purpose of the glucose monitor is curiosity it's to start to understand how it's essentially an MRI for how all of our different dietary and lifestyle strategies are creating this readout of glucose in our body which I think can be really interesting and in a world where so many cards are stacked against us with diet and lifestyle and where there's a lot of confusion about what's right for us that can be like very helpful in actually reducing the confusion and the cognitive load of our choices we know that keeping your blood sugar through the course of a lifetime in a low and healthy range so I don't mean up and down spikes during the day but keeping your blood sugar healthy throughout the course of your lifetime is probably the best thing we can do for longevity staying insulin sensitive staying out of the diabetic range and so one thing that the glucose monitor does for us is just us more uh awareness and agency into like what the trends of our glucose are over time as opposed to a literally one Daya Point snapshot once a year in the doctor's office which is what the majority of us are used to um I really love the idea that people who are able to wear glucose monitors every now and again maybe once a year maybe more than once a year they know what their glucose is and so they're never going to walk into to a doctor's office and have a bomb dropped on them about pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes because you have the data which is ultimately I hope the world that we can move towards for a lot of biomarkers so you can see Trends over time which I think is very valuable one thing that's fascinating in terms of early prediction of metabolic disease is that you can see how long it takes your glucose to come down after a meal so in a normal healthy insulin sensitive body even if the glucose goes way up it should come way down very quickly because the insulin is buying to insulin receptors and the glucose is getting taken up and it it'll lower what is quickly over the course of it should be down by two hours but from what I've actually seen in our like most insulin sensitive people and also in research that looks at young healthy populations you should basically be spiking and coming down Spike about 45 minutes and come down hour and a half 90 minutes to two hours but if this is after sorry after last bite after last bite although it's hard to kind of exactly but yeah is over I would say about 45 minut to go up to the and then start down very quickly now if you to see that glucose is going up and then trailing very slowly back down to normal maybe taking more than two hours three hours that is going to be one of those early indicators of potential insulin resistance your body's not clearing the glucose but that's not a metric that we use in standard practice at all and I've actually seen myself very insulin sensitive my insulin is like 2.5 and you know if I don't sleep and I am stressed and I have been sitting my glucose will take way longer to come down I have become transiently insulin resistant so I think that's just fascinating to see that so looking what that ultimately the metric that we call that is area under the curve you want a low area under the curve a you see after a glucose Spike so you want to spike and come down quickly that's going to be if you shade the area under the curve it's a small amount if you go up and then Trail off for two to three hours um that's going to be a lot of shading under that curve and high Au is associated with insulin resistance basically another thing that you can see um is essentially glycemic variability and glycemic variability GV is a metric of how spiky your curves are fasinating paper out of Michael Schneider's lab uh at Stanford in 2018 called glucotype reveal new patterns of glucose disregulation totally Landmark study but basically they put continuous glucose monitors on non-diabetic individuals who by standard criteria of diabetes do not have diabetes and he showed that on a CGM a continuous glucose monitor you have these low variability people that are pretty much flat throughout the day with little teeny little teeny Rolling Hills after their meals you have moderately spiky people and then you have very spiky people who are going up down up down up down up down when you correlate those different patterns of glycemic variability in non-diabetic people you find that the spikier they are the worse their biomarkers are metabolically across the board insulin triglycerides Etc so basically they're they're showing signs through variability of underlying dysfunction that you would never know from a standard test those are the people who I imagine are probably going to go on to develop diseases and yet based on standard criteria their doctors telling them that they're fine that they're all the same so he also showed in that study that non-diabetic individuals when you have a CGM on are going into the diabetic range and the pre-diabetic range a fairly significant amount and we would never know that if you weren't um if you weren't actually tracking like a movie of the glucose so that's so glycemic variability um area under the curve those are two things another really interesting thing you can know from a CGM is Dawn effect so Dawn effect is basically a term in the literature for how high your glucose Rises right when you wake up in the morning I don't know if you noticed this when you were wearing a CGM but some people notice that the second they wake up their glucose jumps up 5 10 20 30 points What's Happening Here is that the cortisol Awakening response to actually get you to wake up and get out of bed that cortisol can cause you to dump a bunch of glucose from your liver because it's basically saying stress hormone cortisol we got to get up we need glucose to fuel the muscles let's dump a little glucose so it's it's normal but what the research shows is that magnitude of dawn effect is correlated with insulin resistance so the more the dawn effect you're getting I think it can signal maybe the more stress you're under the more cortisol you have floating around how big your cortisol Awakening responses but also if you imagine if you're dumping all that glucose from your liver and your cells aren't taking it up well because you're insulin resistant that that response that Dawn effect is going to be higher so I I don't have the numbers right in front of me but typically I I would want to see a dawn effect I think of like less than 10 points so you wake up and you you may very well see a rise this is absence of any food yet and you do not want to see that going up 20 30 40 points um some people see a little bump again with caffeine in the morning because it's more cortisol and so that's another thing that standard stuff would never tell you so those are kind of some of the looking at early predictors of metabolic dysfunction more of the fun stuff is like actually just figuring out like how is food affecting your body and this is where people really enjoy it and like figure out like oh my God this food that I thought was healthy is actually not you know serving me and actually a lot of people I think who are trying to make healthy choices my boyfriend like he when we started dating he started using levels his healthy snack he worked in Venice would be to go to Moon Juice and get oh gosh I I don't want to throw Moon Juice on the bus here but he would get tasty stuff they do but he would get this green juice that was sweetened with dates and it was like $9 and this was like the healthy choice and he saw the second he put on levels that it was causing a huge Spike like 50 60 70 points and then he was crashing um and he was actually trying to make a good decision so now he's he's swapped his snacks out for more like you know grassfish cheese and some flax crackers and maybe like a venison stick or something like grab and go stuff that isn't spiking as glucose but I think it can help people figure out like which foods are doing what I want them to do and which maybe aren't um and same thing happened for so many of our members with oatmeal unfortunately oatmeal instant oatmeal is one of the biggest spikers in our data set for breakfast and a lot of people are making that choice because they think it's heart healthy and in many people it's actually causing a big GL glucose Excursion and crash and then in some other people it's not and so it's it's really helping with um what are the sneaky spikers and then where's the biochemical individuality and there was a phenomenal paper out of um uh um Israel that from from cell about seven years ago called uh personalized Nutrition By prediction of glycemic responses it made big waves but it basically showed that you and I could eat the same handful of blueberries and have totally different glycemic responses so the idea of glycemic index as like a certain amount of food with a certain amount of glucose causes a certain glucose rise it it kind of debunked that and that matters because repeated sustained glycemic variability over time is not good for our health we want to choose the foods or balance the foods that are going to keep us relatively more stable um so that that's that's very helpful just understanding your personal respon to food and then what are the lifestyle strategies you can use sleeping better walking after meals more resistance training cold plunging breath work that can actually serve to modulate the food environment to actually reduce the glucose spikes and people find that all of those things can positively impact glucose spikes especially the walks after the meals but um to fascinating to see a lot of women especially like menopausal women in our community who find that their glucose pattern are getting worse because estrogen's dropping and that's going to you know really take a hit on insulin sensitivity they start resistance training glucose comes kind of right back down so because of the monitor they can feel more confident in the intervention they've chose to do to help with metabolism that kind of creates a virtuous cycle so um so those are some of the big things those are big can I mention one more I'm so I know I love I just I could obviously talk about this all day I think fascinating but this is just one more that I think is fascinating because this was a paper in nature from last year that talked about and this might actually be one of the most valuable things to people which is that again talking about Cravings we all want to get off the craving grip this paper in nature showed that essentially when people Spike their glucose with high carb High starchy Foods they'll often have a big crash afterwards and the reason for that is because a big spike leads to a lot of insulin secretion and then you soak up all the GL glucose and sometimes you can actually go below your Baseline so a small Spike usually won't lead to a crash but a big spike often will that's called reactive hypoglycemia postprandial hypoglycemia a lot of people think they're dealing with hypoglycemia when in fact what they're really dealing with is that they're spiking their glucose too high and then they're crashing I see and the paper showed that the extent of postmeal dips the crash after the spike was pred predictive of 24-hour energy intake and cravings for carbohydrates and this makes sense if you crash low that is a signal to your body we have to get our glucose back up and it it will drive you to eat high energy foods carbohydrate rich foods and Cravings so one of the best things we can do I I believe from my personal experience from Members experience and with some data to support this is that one of the adjuncts we can use to monitor our to manage our Cravings is actually to like lower the the the extent of our spikes so that we crash less and so that was a fascinating study looking at CGM data that's interesting so the cgms can reveal things not just in the immediate meal period but can relate to sort of Downstream uh consequences yeah again I found it to be tremendously useful I'm so glad you mentioned sleep by the way I'm going to resist the temptation to Rattle off 20 studies showing that oh god um you know even having um too much bright light in a room while one is sleeping at night even dim light which is you know I don't want to scare people into thinking they have to sleep in complete darkness although an eye mask can be can be great um can alter uh morning blood glucose levels in I believe it was adults and kids as well this a study in proceedings in the National Academy of Sciences uh I have to go back and check if it included kids but um pretty striking and then it's there's something very clear about the fact that when people get the early night sleep of four to 5 hours but then don't get the dominating um you know last hour or two of sleep in the morning that resting blood glucose is is altered it's so interesting to think about what's going on in sleep there's at least one paper that I'm aware of where they had people breathing into a tube during sleep to measure what sorts of um met metabolism they were undergoing and it's interesting during a full night's sleep um all of us seem to transition between um different forms of metabolism I'll send you this paper it's really it's really cool and I'll put a link to in the show note caption such that at one portion of the night where met we're rely more on let's just call it sugars for the sake of Simplicity other times we're more Ketone dominant there's a a market shifts in metabolism throughout the night it's almost like the brain and body cycle through all the different modes of of metabolism throughout the night and then almost like a rehearsal of the metabolic pathways if you know we can anthropomorphize a bit here but then if um sleep is truncated it clearly has an effect on daytime uh fuel regulation um just so interesting so um getting sufficient sleep getting quality sleep is is absolutely key there's a lot for people to pay attention to but you've given us a lot of tractable avenues for people to do that um that are mostly behavioral there's a few don'ts but mostly some dos yeah yeah we haven't mentioned that um you know you don't need to even perhaps belong to a gym it's like and with the cold uh exposure thing I always say you know if anything it'll save you money on the heating bill so um there's a there's a literally NE potential negative cost there um I think levels and other cgms are really interesting and value um to experiment with what sorts of other stuff is going to soon be monitored in our blood because for instance I would love to know continuous hormone levels lipid levels blood blood sugar levels I mean are we moving past um just blood glucose and are are there soon to be other um things in these monitors so that when we and by the way if you haven't used this it's really cool you just take your phone you scan it over the the sensor and then it basically gives you a chart graph of of what's going on in your bloodstream and now they're all the latest gen of each of them are all Bluetooth now so no more scanning which is kind of nice and the answer is yes there're are several different um analytes that we're going to be able to track and uh Abbot which is one of the three main manufacturers of cgms has announced that they're they have a new product called the lingo which is going to actually be able to measure ketones lactate and alcohol um continuously which is pretty interesting from like a metabolic comprehensive metabolic standpoint different sensors for each not all in one so I think we'll have to like polka dot ourselves if we're tracking all those things um and then Dexcom which is the other main company that makes cgms has just announced they're coming out with an over-the-counter nonprescription version of a CDM CGM called the Stell later this year so there's exciting things happening in the industry and I I really do think um continuous monitoring it's it's going to expand to a lot these other things that you're talking about hormones Etc and I mean it it it really needs to I think that um you know snapshots of dynamic system are just never going to really be able to give us a full picture on what's going on and um what we really want to be able to do to dig our way out of this Health Care crisis I think is is empowerment individually and understanding how this rapidly changing environment is affecting our own biology so we can make the targeted choices to hopefully change the environment to be more conducive to Cellular health and continuous monitoring is a closed loop bio feedback that can that can help us with that decision- making and and essentially predict failure of the system rather than wait for failure of the system before we do something about it so yeah I think lot's coming down the pipeline love it yeah let's talk a little bit about mindset this is a really interesting topic that you included in your book we've had guests come on and talk about growth mindset stress can be enhancing mindset I'm big on mindset um because I'm interested in how our cognitive reframing or cognitive framing can just change the way our biology works and vice versa of course um but you talk about mindset in a certain context and one of the um favorite passages around that that I really enjoyed was the relationship between kind of like trying to control everything and nature you know like and uh and how uh getting into nature uh itself um can be valuable for us so maybe touch a little bit on mindset if you will and um yeah what are your thoughts on nature literally getting out of doors yeah so I think I think that mindset and more broadly than mindset I think psychology and our relationship specifically with fear and control I think they're probably the most underrecognized thing that is impacting the metabolic Health crisis the chronic disease epidemic there has been data that's looked into this we know that there's studies showing that loneliness impacts mitochondrial function and that loneliness is a risk factor and stress is a risk factor and these things and something really fascinating actually with the CGM data is that many people who wear a CGM I don't know if you saw this but when you feel stressed it actually has a diabetogenic effect it literally causes our blood sugar to go up when we feel stress and that can be a fascinating um unlock for people to realize I kind of feel like I'm okay right now but my body is telling me something different it's telling me that biochemically I'm actually releasing energy stores from my liver glucose to fight some threat that you know I wasn't really aware of so there's there's we definitely understand there's this link here but but it's certainly not made its way into clinical practice so the way I think about it is that what we know about the cells and especially the mitochondria is that the mitochondri more than the PowerHouse of the cell they actually are a part of the cell is constantly tracking resources and threats and are basically modulating energy resources based on that and the threats can be anything they can be a virus they can be and this is all coordinated through this thing called the cell danger response it can be a virus it can be a toxin in the environment it can be lack of micronutrients for the electron transport chain that it needs to do its function it can also be psychological threats because of course our psychological milu translates through nerves and hormones and neurotransmitters and our microbiome to affect our cellular biology throughout our whole body our cells hear every single thought that we're thinking through biochemistry and when a cell and a mitochondria are getting the message that there is a threat or something to be afraid of they are going to change metabolic function towards defense alarm threat response and away from repair homeostasis build building essentially thriving so our and and and I think what's really maybe the most unnatural thing about our modern world you know the food of course is unnatural 70% is ultra processed but we also have this device in our hands literally with us all the time streaming fear inducing media into our brains and eyeballs every waking moment of the day if we let it so we're glued to our screens and our devices and right now essentially the traumas and fears of eight billion people all over an entire Globe are now ours to process and our cells and our mitochondria there is no escaping it they are going to respond to that and so I think a big part of the metabolic Health conversation is how do we create a sense of safety in our bodies no matter what is happening out out side of our bodies and this can come down to every person's Journey will be different for this because the things that cause a sense of threat or fear for any two people are going to be different and I think some of the main categories is one unresolved childhood trauma like something that I think is getting a lot more talked about these days but like what's embedded in our nervous system these limiting beliefs and memories that are really wired that create a sense of hypervigilance in US sort of all the time what's coming in through our devices our phones our computers the media that we're exposed to that's constantly giving a fear signal and I think on a broader level a big Western one that we don't talk about is literally like existential feel of fear of mortality we have a very Des spiritualized very uniquely death fearing culture like you look at other cultures Eastern indigenous the stoics they all had intense curiosity about death we talk about the cycles of life there's this real engagement with it that we are so afraid of in the in the western system to the extent that our entire healthc care system actually I think you know we've built it around like we're not going to we're we're not going to help you thrive we're just going to do whatever we can to make sure you don't die like that's it's built in everywhere and so we've got the devices we've got the childhood trauma we've got the fear of mortality we have a very poor system of mental health care in the culture and I think that through all these things Americans are getting crushed mindset and psychology wise and that is a big big trigger of our mitochondria essentially diverting resources towards defense threat and alarm rather than homeostasis building repair so again it comes back to taking really honest stock of what are the true fear triggers in our lives across those and others and creating a sense of safety in our minds and bodies no matter what the external world looks like which may mean putting boundaries up to you know the media doing the therapy doing the different modalities what I believe and I talk about in the book getting back to the question about nature is one of the best things that we can do is actually literally just go outside and I it sounds so simple but one of the most astonishing stats I literally found in researching this entire book was that the average American is spending 93.7% of their time indoors wild 93.7 that's in a car or in a building so we are locked in these cages staring at fear inducing media and our mitochondria are like what like what I don't know where to channel my energy it's just I it's short circuiting I think so many things happen when we go outside as you know I mean even what the vision system is doing to our anxiety levels we are getting sunlight which of course for uh for you know complex reasons is very helpful for our metabolic Health separately entrains our you know chronobiology and uh you know light light from the sun as an incredible regulator of our mitochondrial function um but it also it's our best teacher you know when we're out nature and we really look at how beautiful the world is and the cycles of nature we see the cycles of you know the the seasons and we see the awe of the sun and the trees and just this all this Alchemy that's happening outside of us we see you know spring to Summer to fall to winter we see the tides moving in and out everything's in phases and I think when we reflect and meditate on all the cycles and the polarities in nature night and day cold and hot new moon you know quarter moon full moon you know all these things it's actually it it entrenches on a subconscious and conscious level that there is a fundamental Harmony and pattern to the world we're living in that is bigger than us and that is fundamentally good and beautiful um and we are locked inside of the Four Walls of our house I think we get very scared we get very controllable and the system wants it that way because when we are scared and when we are existentially afraid we will literally do anything we will buy anything do anything watch anything that will in some way ameliorate that pain that we're feeling and we will take any pill we'll get any surgery anything that makes us feel like we're controlling this seemingly outof control situation and that's what drives us into all the dopamine Loops you know the the social media the process food the porn the gambling the alcohol all of it it's all to amarate I think ultimately fear and I think yeah I think by actually really just spending a lot more time try and get that 93.7% down to like 50% spend as much time as you can outside we know that people who spend more time outside are metabolically healthier and I think it's for pleotropic reasons but I think one of it is that it is the ultimate convincing of abundance and fundamental abundance in our world and of awe which I think is really the antidote to fear and that has a profoundly soothing effect on our psychology um and the sense of scarcity that drives a lot of the decisions that actually make us unhealthy it's fundamentally rooted in in scarcity and I think also when we realize we are part of nature again going back to that doubt statement we're a process not an entity realizing like you know all the trees around us and we take that walk even in a city we see all the trees all those plants all those leaves are making the oxygen that process that that literally let us do oxid of phosphorilation and that sun and that leaf on the tree the sun's energy is literally being stored in the carbon carbon bonds that the plants are generating in photosynthesis that ultimately all metabolism is is unlocking the potential energy stored from the sun to create the human energy that lets us love and move and live and think and do all the things we love to do and then it just becomes so obvious like of course we have to like eat real food and of course we have to not poison our soil with pesticides and of course we have to like you know care about the environment and we have to get outside and move and we have to be in the sunlight during the day because we are the environment we are a process that's constantly in Dynamic conversation with it and um I think I think a lot of people will find that their health gets a lot better if they spend radically more time outdoors and I think a lot of people might say well I can't I work on a computer and I'm like you know Rome is burning like we're sick as hell right now we need to get creative like move your computer outside take a walking meeting open your mail Outdoors chop your vegetables on your balcony at your apartment like we we have to find a way to connect back with our source understand that the world is abundant and harmonious uh reent the belief in our connection with nature and then let all of our dietary and lifestyle strategies stem from that sense of gratitude and awe and that will lead us right where we need to go which is um a really I think joyful experience of our health Journey um that's rooted fundamentally in connection rather than us being siloed from all of this which going back to the beginning of the conversation that's fundamentally what's wrong with the Healthcare System it's silos and we have siloed oursel from all of the life-giving things in our environment and that has ultimately leted us to be very very very sick and we've just I think we got to go back outside so that's one of the things but there there's many other things we can do to change those our relationship with fear but um we can't change the world as a whole but we can change what happens inside our body in terms of how we respond to it and for our mitochondria we have to we have to create a sense of safety in our bodies for our mitochondria to do the work we need them to do for health I love it and I love it for many reasons I I think um it was my I know it was my friend and former guest on this podcast Rick Rubin who several times early in our friendship he said um Back To Nature the only truth um and I asked him what he meant by that and you know cuz Rick can be a little bit um cryptic sometimes um not always but sometimes and what he was saying is you know it's a real thing you know you can immediately feel the connectedness between The Human Experience and um life of other types plants animals you know sunlight the circadian rhythms and the and the rhythms of the of light and dark um because they impact us so powerfully I mean if if there were ever a force in the world that impacts how we feel it's the Circadian rhythm it's the rising and setting of the sun it's um the impact of light and dark and then all the other things that you talked about today um I can't help but reflect on kind of your take on kind of what a lot of not all but a lot of U modern society attempts to do um it attempts to do a lot of good things too I believe I'm a Believer in technology um but that it if I were to translate it sounded like um what you were saying is that it gives us a sense of loss of control by instilling fear like we don't have control and then um there are a number of let's just call them programs in the world um that then sell back the illusion of some sense of agency little by little right a temporary agency and then puts you back into the cycle and there's something about going into nature which just um removes one from all of that at least temporarily gives you a more basic understanding of the relationship to self and things around us even just looking being able to see it to a distance we know is powerful for the the brain reducing anxiety we know being outdoors for 2 hours or more per day reduces myopia nearsightedness this is independent of all the other effects of of uh circadian rhythms Etc anyway and on and on so I second and third and um and uh here here all the um all the statements you made before I also just have to say I I really appreciate how you are able to tackle the cellular biology the molecular biology the macroscopic things that we can all do walking resistance training um cold exposure sleep um high-intensity interval training um and make make a case for each and all of those as it relates to the underlying biochemistry and weave all that together in a way that then uh you beautifully wrapped into this idea of connecting to Nature and not divorcing ourselves from Modern Life but really looking at the ways in which certain components of Modern Life are really making us sick not just the the behaviors not just the dos and the don'ts that it's kind of imparting on us but also so kind of the psychology around it it's uh that it is quietly but powerfully oppressive is is the message that I'm getting and that we have to take a stand against it and the way to take a stand against it is to do what are very um basic and fairly easy to access things making better choices about food timing quality amount exercise and on and on so so I'm running long in my response to your much more eloquent description of mindset uh but what I want to say is on behalf of myself and everyone listening I so appreciate we appreciate the work that you're doing to be a medical doctor specialized in one of these silos and then to take a step out and say nope not me I'm going to do what I see as best for the greater good in terms of giving people tools giving people a sense of agency and autonomy to take control of their health this is in some ways a heretical idea um but luckily the numbers of folks like you are growing and you're a real leader in this field um by example and by the incredible work you're doing with technology and information sharing love love love the book I did go through it um front to back um I haven't tried the recipes yet but thank you for bringing the blueberries I'll try the recipes um at least one of them and um I just want to thank you for sharing what you do and um for continuing to do what you do we we need it and we appreciate it so thank you thank you thank you for joining me for today's

Title: Dr. Matt Walker: Improve Sleep to Boost Mood & Emotional Regulation | Huberman Lab Guest Series
Published: 2024-05-01 12:00:31 UTC
Description:
This is episode 5 of our 6-part special series on sleep with Dr. Matthew Walker, Ph.D., a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley and the host of The Matt Walker Podcast. In this episode, we explain the connection between sleep and mood, emotional regulation and mental well-being. 

We explain the role of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in processing emotions and emotional memories and why sleep deprivation causes agitation, impulsivity and emotional reactivity. 

We also discuss why sleep disruption is a hallmark feature of PTSD, anxiety, depression, suicidality, and other psychiatric conditions. 

We explain protocols for improving REM sleep and other sleep phases in order to harness the therapeutic power of quality sleep to feel calmer and emotionally restored.

This episode describes various actionable tools to improve sleep for those struggling with mental health or mood and those wanting to bolster their overall state and well-being. 

The next episode in this special series explores dreams, including lucid dreaming, nightmares and dream interpretation.

[Music] welcome to the hubman lab guest Series where I and an expert guest discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today marks the fifth episode in our sixth episode series all about sleep with expert guest Dr Matthew Walker today's episode focuses on the inextricable link between sleep and our mental health for instance a specific stage of sleep called rapid eye movement or REM sleep is critical for removing the emotional content of our previous days memories and in doing so provides a sort of therapy within sleep that allows us to feel emotionally restored when we wake the next morning we discuss what happens when you are deprived of REM sleep to a small or greater degree and we discuss how to improve the quality and quantity of your REM sleep in order to ensure mental health we also discuss science-based protocols for reducing rumination and negative thoughts before sleep the information shared by Dr Walker in today's episode is sure to be critical for anyone that is either struggling with mental health issues or who simply wants to bolster their overall mental health before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity many times on this podcast we discuss how in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually needs to drop by about 1 to 3° and in order to wake up feeling maximally refreshed and energized your body temperature needs to heat up by about 1 to 3° eight sleep makes it very easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment so that it's easy to fall and stay asleep and wake up feeling refreshed I started sleeping on an eight- Sleep mattress cover several years ago and it has completely and positively transformed my sleep so much so that when I travel to hotels or airbnbs I really miss my eight sleep I've even shipped my eight sleep out to hotels that I've been staying in because it improves my sleep that much if you'd like to try eightsleep you can go to 8sleep.com huberman to save $150 off their pod 3 cover eights sleep currently ships to the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means plenty of the electrolytes magnesium potassium and sodium and no sugar as I mentioned before on this podcast I'm a big fan of salt now I want to be clear people who already consume a lot of salt or who have high blood pressure or who happen to consume a lot of processed foods that typically contain salt need to control their salt intake however if you're somebody who eats pretty clean and you're somebody who exercises and you're drinking a lot of water there's a decent chance that you could benefit from ingesting more electrolytes with your liquids the reason for that is that all the cells in our body including the nerve cells the neurons require the electrolytes in order to function properly so we don't just want to be hydrated we want to be hydrated with proper electrolyte levels with element that's very easy to do what I do is when I wake up in the morning I consume about 16 to 32 ounces of water and I'll dissolve a packet of element in that water I'll also do the same when I exercise especially if it's on a hot day and I'm sweating a lot and sometimes I'll even have a third element packet dissolved in water if I'm exercising really hard or sweating a lot or if I just noticed that I'm not consuming enough salt with my food if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element spelled LM nt.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that's drink element lnt.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by betterhelp betterhelp offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online I've been doing therapy for over 30 years initially it was a requirement for being let back in school but I decided to keep up with that therapy because Ed the therapy has three essential components which are excellent rapport with the therapist support from the therapist and valuable insights from the therapist that we wouldn't otherwise be able to arrive at well then it's a terrific way to improve our mental landscape both our emotional state and our behaviors better help allows you to find a therapist with whom you have those three key components and it also makes it very easy to schedule again the sessions are carried out entirely online and even if you're extremely busy or traveling a lot or have a lot of family and business obligations better help allows you to access those therapy sessions regularly so that you can constantly improve there's just oh so much data supporting that quality therapy can improve our mental health and the overall landscape of our lives in fact I view quality therapy as important as physical exercise and I know many others do as well there certainly aren't a replacement for one another but if you're doing physical exercise meaning resistance training and cardiovascular training and you're doing regular quality therapy of the sort that better help can provide well then you're essentially doing as much as anyone possibly can to improve your mental health and physical health if you'd like to try betterhelp go to betterhelp.com huberman to get 10% off your first month again that's betterhelp.com huberman and now for my conversation with Dr Matthew Walker Dr Matthew Walker welcome back Dr Andrew huberman Delight to be back during the course of this series we've of course been talking about sleep and you've talked about the biology of sleep ways to improve maybe even optimize sleep you defined what optimizing one's sleep actually is talked about learning and memory creativity caffeine naps food exercise and so much more today I'm excited that you're going to teach us about the relationship between sleep and emotion regulation but also mental health mental health challenges but I sometimes like to remind people that mental health includes the word Health it's not all about mental illness it's also about how to improve one's Health as well as ways to combat certain forms of mental illness or challenges so to start things off maybe you could just give us the basics of the relationship between sleep and emotional states or one's ability to regulate their own emotions this is an area of work that we've been uh interested in and doing a lot of research on for about 20 or so years now and I would say that probably the most striking statement I can offer upfront is the following in that 20 years of research we have not been able to discover a single psychiatric condition in which sleep is normal and to me it has taught me everything that I need to know about this very intimate bidirectional relationship between your sleep health and your mental health and you're right to emphasize that notion of mental health because we're not just going to speak about some of the sort of challenging aspects of sleep and psychiatric disorders but we'll speak about some of the benefits that sleep can provide when you get it to turn the tables and we move in the direction not of Mental Illness but we move in the direction of mental Wellness so I'm excited sort of make sure that I I don't fall prey to that stepping back still though what about this relationship between just sleep and our basic emotional regulation and our emotional stability I'm sure everyone has seen the example or had the example as a parent of that parent holding a child and the child is crying and they look at you and they say well they just didn't sleep well last night as if there's some miraculous parental knowledge that bad sleep the night before equals bad mood and emotional reactivity and regulation the next day and some years ago now we were fascinated by this but we couldn't really unearth basic science that would help us explain what was going on and why that was so clearly the case so we did an initial study where we took a group of healthy people no signs of psychiatric illness or emotional instability and we gave them a full night of sleep or we sleep deprive them and then the next day we put them inside of a brain scanner and we showed them a whole range of emotional visual images is ranging from very neutral all the way up to quite unpleasant and negative and we were looking at how the brain was reacting to those emotional experiences with versus without sleep and the structure that we'd initially focused on was a structure that you've spoken about before called the amydala and you actually have one on the left and the right side of your brain and the amydala is the centerpiece region for the generation of emotional reactions both positive and negative but here we're focusing on that aversive that negative aspect and when we looked at that structure in people who are sleep deprived what we saw relative to the people who'd had a full night of sleep was a 60% 60 60% increase in amydala [Music] responsivity under conditions of sleep deprivation that is quite a striking amplification in fact we to that date with all of us that these on sleep and sleep loss had not quite seen an effect size within the brain that was that was that big sorry to interrupt but just to make sure that everyone's on the same page so people are being shown images with varying degrees of emotionality including images that are known to evoke negative averse emotions as we call them in the laboratory um could be feelings of fear anger disgust revulsion what whatever negative veilance was it the case that sleep deprivation increased the activity in the amydala to such images by 60% only for the aversive images or for let's say a neutral image um presented to somebody who has had plenty of quality sleep um let's say it is I'm making up the units here gives us two out of 10 units of Amal activation this isn't the way Neuroscience is done but for sake of discussion is it the case then that that neutral image would provide a you know a six out of 10 a level of activation or was it only for aversive images so the way we did the analysis first was we used almost a a correlation approach so we sort of told the brain Imaging analysis to say look here are the the ratings of these pictures and they go from very neutral to increasingly negative and aversive and show me what in the brain is reacting to that curve that gradient curve and sure enough you've got the magnitude overall was 60% but it's a very interesting point that you make because worthy amydala started to respond and that res responsivity started to hook up in the activation and the sort of aggravation Direction was much earlier in the curve of emotionality in other words things that previously when you've had a good night of sleep do not feel particularly emotional started to become rather emotional when you were not getting sufficient sleep so it heightened the sensitivity of the initial triggering of the emotional response and then the more emotional it became the more separate those two sort of reactivity curves became from the Amala when you had sleep versus when you had not sleep or had not slept I should say to us then the question became well why why is the amydala so reactive and controlled when you are absent sleep and we did another analysis and what we found was that there was a structure in your frontal lobe and the frontal lobe just sits directly sort of if you think about your eyes and you go directly up your in your frontal lobe and it was a particular part of the frontal lobe the middle part that sits right between your eyes something that we call the medial prefrontal cortex and what we found was that with a night of sleep the med Al prefrontal cortex was strongly connected to the amydala why is that important it's because that part of the your frontal lobe is very good at acting like a control rational mechanism on your deep sort of you know it's not Neanderthal but your deep emotional brain centers but without sleep we found that that connection had been severed and so it was almost as though without sleep you become all emotional gas pedal and too little regulatory control break and so you couldn't modulate those emotions anywhere near as effectively now some people may say well hang on a second you that was a total night of sleep deprivation and that's not really relevant for me because I I don't sleep enough I know that from all of the previous episodes that uh I've gone through here hopefully if you've listened to them but I'm usually maybe getting five or 6 hours of sleep is this really relevant so we started doing that study we wanted to say Let's do an what we call an ecological study more of a real world sleep restriction rather than total deprivation and we were about halfway through that study when a wonderful Japanese research group essentially published the study that we were doing and what was great is that they did it even in a more rigorous way and essentially what they were able to do is replicate exactly what we'd found but now by putting people on sort of less than 6 hours of sleep for five nights and sure enough you got the same response so that was very clear to us that there is some sensitivity there's a reason why you become so unbuckled emotionally when you are not getting sufficient sleep it's the reason that you have almost this sort of erratic pendulum like sort of responsivity when you're not getting sufficient sleep that notion of I just snap dot dot dot or you apologize and you say look I am so sorry I just bit your H off I just haven't been getting enough sleep and so we could start to understand what in the brain was happening when you didn't get sleep it such an important finding uh for a couple of reasons that maybe we can explore um previously on the podcast we had a guest um doctor he's a neurosurgeon Matt McDougall he's the lead neurosurgeon at um neurolink yeah he came up through Stanford works on deep brain stimulation Etc and I love his description of what the prefrontal cortex does it jbes perfectly with the way you describe it which is he said the main function of the prefrontal cortex is to say to specific brain areas under specific contexts so um the sh of course is a you know his way of describing neural inhibition so quieting of neural activity in certain brain circuits under certain conditions because there are conditions under which you want your amydala activation to be very robust you know fast and um there's time for uh you know protecting oneself maybe even certain situations for Swift violent action to protect your family Etc but the prefrontal cortex seems to be able to hold it in mind so to speak what the context is under which that would be appropriate versus when it would be inappropriate a great example of that people can think of if all of a sudden a gun is pointed in your face you would want your amigdala to react if it's in the real world but if you're at the movie theaters and you see a gun pointed in your face your igula doesn't really react as much why because you're prefontal cortex understood the word that you describe which is context but in some ways it seems as though you become almost regress to this more basic fundament mental Elemental you know emotional brain and the Red Mist descends and you really can't see much more because your prefrontal cortex seems to be absent you become very reflex driven and we don't want to um go too uh far a tangent of on prefrontal cortex but one of the most beautiful descriptions of prefrontal Cortex I ever heard was also from a colleague Eric nudson at Stanford who's now retired does beautiful work on neuroplasticity and he described how when people or animals have lesions to certain regions of the prefrontal cortex they become stimulus-driven machines such that you know if you if you go like this to a you know to a puppy or to Baby they'll look to the snapping finger but at some point you know we all learn that you know there must be a reason for us to follow the snapping of the fingers in different locations in space but with a prefrontal damage people and animals just become like machines whatever stimulus is there they Orient to and this has implications for ADHD Etc one of the things that I want to um ask about to take us back to the specific relationship between sleep reduced medial prefrontal activity and emotionality is this feeling when we're sleep deprived that certain things just great on us a bit more you know I had this experience recently unfortunately there was a night where I didn't get much sleep at all and then the next day I was on a phone call and the person I was talking to I I I'm quite fond of but they were they had a lot of energy and they were talking they were kind of coming at me with a bunch of stuff that they wanted to and it just felt like you know it was grading on my system and I knew because I was sleep deprived that you know they were entirely well-meaning and so you just kind of resist but it's incredible how cold water loud noises uh requests of our time things like that become very irritating and they grate on us yeah when we're sleep deprived whereas when we're rested it's like oh yeah okay they're you know talking kind of faster kind of loud okay somebody is requesting something else I'll put it in my list or maybe I'll the Ator or you know the the uh cold shower that you know feels like got to get over this threshold to get into like when you're rested you're like all right let's do this right you know maybe even let's go I I'm excited for it but when you're tired o it is as if the um the brain is fighting for any sense of Peace it can possibly get and that peace is interrupted by almost anything and everything it is a grim situation and we've certainly heard that from you know patients and individuals it's almost as though the world that they are experiencing they look at and they say you know what you're in an 11 and I need you at a seven right now it is just too much and this comes back to that result that we described that when the amydala crosses the threshold and says okay things are getting emotional things are getting unpleasant I'm going to be responding negatively in an angry way or a fearful way that starts much earlier so the threshold for triggering your emotional aversive reaction is much lower and that's why the person's voice when you hear it first normally if you had a great night of sleep you'd say gosh you know what today I really love your energy it's it's really it's so infectious versus a day when you're not sleeping you just think I just I'm lifting my earbuds out of my ears I don't know if I can take this much longer and so that was where we were able to manipulate sleep one way which is to say I dial sleep down and then I look at the emotional brain and you can see this ramping up of the emotional reactivity in these basic kind of gutur all centers but then we wanted to do the inverse we wanted to instead see if we could insert sleep back in in other words manipulate sleep and dial it back up could you get a disapp ation in the emotional reaction and here we decided to throw a second ingredient into the equation not just simply looking at your emotional reactivity but we wanted to look at emotional memory now in a previous episode we've spoken a lot about sleep and memory but there we were speaking about really quite neutral memory textbook like memory fact-based memory emotional memory is very different and if I were to ask you you Andrew cast your mind back to some of your earliest childhood memories or your team memories and if anyone listening were to do that my guess is that almost all of the memories that you recall are memories of an emotional nature positive or negative why is that it's because one of the functions of emotions when it comes to memory is to R flag and prioritize that experience that memory as being Salient because it's emotional and that instructs the brain that this information in particular is very relevant to us as an organism why because the rest of the brain is shouting at me this is emotional so there is something very privileged and very special about an emotional memory like a red flag that tags it for priority in the brain but something I started to notice when I would read the data both the neural data and the subjective data on emotional memory led me to get very interested in what happens with emotional memories over time because what you will hear is that if I were to ask you you know recall an emotional memory just try to remember it my guess is that now at the time of recollection much later on you are not having the same regurgitation of the same visceral emotional reaction that you had at the time of the experience what that sort of turned a light bulb moment on for me was that somewhere between the initial experience and the later recollection of that emotional memory the brain has done a very clever trick it has divorced the emotion from the memory so now when you come to recollect that emotional memory let's say days later or even months later in some ways it is a memory of an emotional event but it is no longer as powerfully emotional itself as it was at the time of the experience right and I started to wonder is that time or is that time asleep so we did a study and we had people experience these emotional memories sort of essentially make emotional memories and they were doing it inside of a scanner and then we gave them a night of sleep or even a nap and then we brought them back or we just had them learn those emotional memories in the morning and then bring them back after an identical amount of time to try to soften those emotional memories but without sleep and we put them back in the scanner and we were able to look to see when you come back later in that second session is your emotional and you recollect those experiences and you relive them is the emotional reactivity at that second session any different to the first session and is that different if that time elapse has contained a full night of sleep versus you've just been awake and what we found is that in those people who remained awake across the day having had those emotional memories essentially implanted implanted sounds a little bit sort of Big Brother I don't mean it that way but they'd learned them the amydala was just still as responsive as they were recalling and reliving and reexperiencing those emotional memories but in those people who had the same amount of time to process the memories but had had a full night of sleep we saw this incredible emotional amydala dep potentiation and what that taught me was that the sleeping brain was able to almost detox the emotional memory it is think about it like um an informational orange that the emotional memory Has This Bitter emotional rind around it and then you've got the informational orange in the middle and what sleep was doing was stripping the bitter emotional rind off the informational orange so that then when you came back the next day again it is now a memory of an emotional event but it's no longer triggering that strong visceral reaction in other words and we described this Theory as something called overnight forgetting which is that when it comes to an emotional memory you both sleep to forget and sleep to remember respectively which is that you sleep to remember the information the memory of the experience but it is no longer emotional itself and from there we built a biological model of exactly how this works because when we looked at the Sleep group who'd had that full 8-hour opportunity we asked the question because we'd measured their sleep what is it about that sleep that seems to provide this form of it's almost overnight therapy how is it doing that what stage of sleep is doing that and sure enough what we found was that it was REM sleep rapid eye movement sleep associated with dreaming and the greater the amount of REM sleep the greater the amount of emotional depotentiation the greater the amount of sort of emotion detox that you got the next day and one of the fascinating things that we didn't um quite mention in uh the episode where we described what is sleep and we described the different stages including RAM and we spoke about the brain changes something utterly unique happens during REM sleep levels of a brain chemical called noradrenaline are completely shut off it is the only time during the 24-hour period when you see the complete cessation of neur adrenaline in the brain and of course neur adrenaline is associated with many different functions and you've elegantly described them one of the functions is that it's associated with emotional responsivity and the focus and that sort of strong um sort of emotional energy and people will know we speak about it has two names noradrenaline or norepinephrine same thing us UK but people of course are familiar with the sister chemical in the body called adrenaline upstairs in the brain we can think about noradrenaline and during REM sleep neur adrenaline is completely shut off this stress Associated neurochemical it's not only associated with stress but it's associated with lots of things but stress included is noradrenaline shut off in the brain and body during uh rapid eye movement sleep no it's not it seems to be specifically within the brain that there is this blockade of noradrenaline and serot goes down too whereas another chemical called atile choline which is another neurotransmitter that ramps up in the brain so if there is a brain chemical that seems to be underlying REM sleep or dream sleep it seems to be acetal choline and in fact in some parts of the brain you can see almost a 30% greater amount of acetel choline in some brain regions than when we're awake yet on the other hand when we think about noradrenaline and serotonin they are both shut off so the stress related chemical within the brain is Switched Off during REM sleep however if you look at other parts of the brain the memory related centers of the brain such as the hippocampus that we've spoken about before and the amydala that I just mentioned too those are very active during REM sleep so we laid out this biological model that is almost beautiful that REM sleep is this perfect condition for emotional overnight therapy where you can re activate and re sort of experience and reprocess those emotional memories but you're doing it in a neurochemically quote unquote safe environment that allows you to strip away the emotion from the memory I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens and is designed to meet all of your foundational nutritional needs by now I'm sure you've all heard me say that I've been taking ag1 since 2012 and indeed that is true now of course I do consume regular Whole Foods every day I strive to get those Foods mostly from unprocessed or minimally processed sources however I do find it hard to get enough servings of fruits and vegetables each day so with ag1 I ensure that I get enough of the vitamins minerals Prebiotic fiber and other things typically found in fruits or vegetables and of course I still make sure to eat fruits and vegetables and in that way provide a sort of insurance that I'm getting enough of what I need in addition the ad adaptogens and other micronutrients in ag1 really help buffer against stress and ensure that the cells and organs and tissues of my body are getting the things they need people often ask me that if they were going to take Just One supplement what that supplement should be and I always answer ag1 if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer you'll get five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman in some ways it does resemble behavioral desensitization therapy whereby under the care of a qualified you know psychiatrist or psychologist somebody will um be encouraged to recall in a great degree of detail some very difficult maybe even traumatic event um and through repetition and of course through the knowledge that there's support in the immediate environment that will allow them to um you know safely move through that experience you know should their their heart rate go up they're sweating profusely having trouble getting the words out there very unfortunately common features of trauma and and negative memories but the idea as I understand is to repeat the recall many times often in that safe environment such that eventually what was initially a really terrible event remains a terrible event but the emotional load of that event is removed from the person's sort of neural understanding of the event the way I've heard it described is what starts as a tragic traumatic story eventually becomes a kind of a sad boring story boring to the person who's saying it meaning it doesn't evoke as much autonomic arousal exactly and in some ways that's the perfect description of this overnight therapy process that it becomes a memory that is no longer triggering an emotional reaction and in some ways that's what you want if you go back to my description from an evolutionary perspective I told you that one of the functions of emotions is to red flag and prioritize the memory at the time of learning to say that it's important that's a very adaptive process it helps us prioritize which things we really should be focusing on and remembering but it's not not adaptive for you to hold on to that emotion long term once you've started and there has been some suggestion in the literature before we were doing this work that maybe one thing you can do with trauma and Trauma memories is sleep deprive individuals the very first night after the trauma because we knew at the time sleep is important for memory and what you would like to do and it's very similar to that movie Sunshine Spotless Mind I always forget the Eternal Eternal Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind thank you I didn't see the movie but I hear it's good yeah and what they try to do is Target in the brain these you know difficult painful experiences and just excise them from the brain and that was the suggestion could you pop those memories out of the biography of that individual and save them the trauma I would argue that's not really what you want to do because let's say that I am um I have a trauma experience where I was walking home at night from The Sleep laboratory late at night and I was coming down the kind of an alley to take a shortcut and someone sticks me up with a gun maybe some violence I don't want to remove that memory I would like to remove the trauma response associated with that memory but I would argue for me as an organism it's still very important for me to remember that that alley was associated with a bad experience and I should forego going down that very same route again I want to hold on to the memory the information I want to let go of the emotion I want to sleep to remember and I want to sleep to forget and I'll come on to why I think that's relevant to PTSD when we perhaps speak about that condition and it's very very relevant but coming back to REM sleep we looked back in the literature to see if we could find signs that REM sleep had this relationship with even just your basic emotional reactivity and there was some wonderful work by a gentleman that you will know from Stanford probably one of the founding fathers of modern day sleep research a gentleman called William DeMent yeah who passed away a few years ago he did um might have been one of the people who coined the term rapid eye movement sleep but I don't think he was the one who discovered it correct he was not but he was well up there in terms of understanding both sort of what its term was and also what its function was he Legend as he was very early on this was probably in the 60s he would take individuals because we didn't really have the first published report of these two types of sleep of REM and non-rem until they collected the data or found the data in 1953 it was published in 1954 so in other words we discovered that you know even up to then prior to then we just thought sleep was sleep we didn't have any knowledge that the these different stages so in the same year that um Francis Crick you know un unveiled this incredible helical structure that was called a DNA strand we also discovered the different stages of sleep but in the 60s then William DeMent knowing that there were these two types of sleep and knowing that there was something that was going on with REM sleep were people were dreaming and he would be waking people up from these different stages and found that it's far more likely to for people to report a dream he wondered what the consequence would be if you selectively deprive people of this stage of sleep of dream sleep so he brought individuals into his laboratory and every time they would go into REM sleep they would go into the room they would wake them up have them do some mathematical problems for 2 or 3 minutes and then put them back asleep and they go back into nonr and then as soon as they went back into REM they would wake them up again and the first night they would have to go into the room maybe six or seven times still brutal for the uh for the person in the experiment not not too much fun and but by the end of the 5 days or six days I think they were going back into the room something like 17 18 times why because the people were building up this growing REM sleep debt and the Brain had such a hunger for it that by Night five of no sleep all it wanted to do was rock it into this thing called REM sleep and start devouring it with high volume but that wasn't the interesting part the interesting part was the consequence to these subjects they were all well adjusted perfectly normal individuals by about day three of selective R sleep deprivation they started to show signs of paranoia they started to believe people were out after them they started to have hallucinate ations and delusions and by day five they were bordering on having you know aspects of quite severe psychosis and so what all of this research has taught us in some ways is that it's almost as though REM sleep and again it's hyperbolic is the difference between sanity versus Insanity it's the thing that separates those two and there's a wonderful quote from an American uh entrepreneur called e Joseph Cosman and for all of the years of work that we've been doing in this field and I I've spilled so much ink over this including in the the book he summarized it in a single sentence the best bridge between Despair and hope is a good night of sleep and that's exactly what the data is demonstrating in terms of basic emotional brain function so a powerful link there and um I think it's appropriate therefore if we explore a little bit about what the link actually consists of um in a way that will provide people a a kind of a a compass for when they're feeling a little bit less emotionally regulated or if they would like to improve their levels of emotion regulation uh this is going to be a little bit of an exploration but uh you may recall this is an exploration that you and I had some years ago when we were talking about the Rel relationship between rapid eye movement sleep and emotionality and here you've described that the medial prefrontal cortex normally plays this kind of sh role uh this suppressive role over the amydala under conditions where there is something to consider is it averse is it not averse how averse is it right um but in terms of what we know about stress and emotion you the autonomic nervous system this incredible system that balances sympathetic meaning alertness arousal sometimes called the fight ORF flight system and parasympathetic activation sometimes called the rest and digest system it's the balance of the two that dictates one's emotional state and alertness um level of stress Etc and I've always imagined the autonomic nervous system the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system as sort of a seesaw yeah but on this seesaw sits us right and we can move back and forth across this seesaw but there's an component of the Seesaw that um in my mental model um which is the hinge how tight the Seesaw is meaning how easily or how challenging it is to tilt the Seesaw to one or the other side and I don't know if the mechanism has been discovered but I feel like what happens under conditions of REM deprivation or sleep deprivation that is sleep deprivation but you've beautifully described how it's REM deprivation in particular that can do this that the hinge becomes loose but the hinge doesn't become loose toward us becoming more parasympathetic and relax there's an asymmetry there it's as if the Seesaw now wants to flop to sympathetic activation until we're so exhausted that we just disappear into sleep so the question is this and maybe all we have here is is uh opportunity for speculation but is there any understanding of what the hinge might be and how sleep would adjust the tightness of that hinge and if people are following this what we're really trying to get to is you know you described a neural circuit mechanism within the brain but is this for instance the gating of the release of epinephrine adrenaline and cortisol I mean is that I could imagine that's regulated by the brain but when we're deprived of REM sleep that process becomes less poorly gated and then we just will punch out a bunch of adrenaline in response to you know a phone call from a close friend that you adore but is their voic is just a little bit loud and like H this is rough yeah Etc do we do we understand the nature of the hinge we do a little bit and it's something that we started off trying to test with one specific um belief and then we were beautifully course corrected by the data we thought that the hinge was going to be once you were sleep deprived and you started to slide down into that fight or flight Branch the more sympathetic and away from the the par sympathetic that the hinge would get ever tighter the further into that sympathetic stress related fight ORF flight dip that you had and there you would stay it wasn't quite that simple what we found was that when I challenge you or put you either under a very simple cardiovascular challenge let's say I'm just having you grip a bar for a long period of time or we have you under some other maybe even if it's a um an exercise regiment when you are in a sleep deprived State and you are largely inert and not interacting with the world you actually are in a more strong parasympathetic State it's almost as though you do not want to interact with the world per se and this comes on to motivation we and others have found that one of the earliest and strongest effects of a lack of sleep is just absence of motivation I don't want to interact with the world I don't want to be social I don't want to learn I don't want to exert effort I don't want to exercise I just don't want to do much of anything however when you provoke me and you force me to interact or there is a very strong emotional event that I experience I go all the way over into the strongly sympathetic so it's almost as though we had the prediction that it was going to be a very tight hinge and the screw was tightening the more sympathetic you became it was much more that you were in this sort of parasympathetic State this sort of non-motivational state and the the hinge was so loose however that even just the tiniest flick of a challenge whoosh you went straight over to the sympathetic there was no sweet spot of a tightening where you were nicely balancing between those two states and this comes back to something else that we found that's you switching flip-flopping back and forth between parasympathetic and sympathetic I spoke about the emotional reactivity to negative aversive events but that's only one half of what we call the affective veilance domain it's not just that you can have negative emotional reactions of course you can have positive emotional reactions so we did a sister study to that amigdala study and we asked rather than showing you increasingly negative images and how your amigdala would respond much more strongly to those as we provoked it we then started to show you much more positive rewarding images and because one hypothesis would be that you just simply slide down the scale and you move towards more negative and away from more reward-based reactivity or you could imagine that it's both that when you are sleep deprived you are equally excessively reactive to both of those domains and what we found was that it was the latter that you were very abnormally reactive overreactive to negative events but you were equally hyper sensitive to very reward-based stimuli and this fits beautifully with what we know from sleep deprivation you are much more impulsive you are much more reward seeking you are much greater in terms of your sensation seeking and your addiction potential when you are not getting sufficient sleep is significantly higher and sure enough when we looked in the brain many of these dopamine related circuits that you've described before were overactive when you were under slapped and so I bring this back because it relates to your seesaw sort of analogy yes you can think about the Seesaw from with sleep deprivation from a sympathetic parasympathetic you can also think about it from a positive versus negative veilance and once again our hypothesis was that you're just going to slide down into the negative and you're just going to be less responsive to the rewarding positive it was the opposite you were abnormally and excessively sensitive to both of the those domains which you could argue is perhaps the very worst of all adaptive responses absolutely as an organism you don't want to be non-reactive emotions are powerful and we've spoken about the benefits you need to have emotions to be a functioning human being or organism in the world they are designed to adaptively help us survive but you can't go to the extremes that's maladaptive rather than adaptive but that's where you go when you are sleep to Pride it's this loose hinge and you become very very erratically and extremely reactive from a neural perspective yeah my understanding is that um you know sleep deprivation definitely increases impulsivity and addictive potential it's um yes so best worst of Both Worlds in this case and and given that um now would probably be an appropriate time to just um cue people to some of the things that they can do to improve or maximize their rapid eye movement sleep this was covered in detail in episodes one and two um and to some extent in episodes uh three and four as well but they're in reference to um to other things um learning memory creativity the role of naps Etc and I'll refer people back to this um beautiful formula uh q qrt that it's not just about getting enough sleep it's about the quantity indeed but also the quality QQ regularity and timing of sleep and knowing one's chronotype that is the best time to go to bed and the best time to wake up in the morning for them is going to be critical here and and I can raise my hand I'll raise both hands in fact uh metaphorically and say that when I've gone to sleep early and woken up early so for me 8:30 9 p.m. and then waking up at 4:35 a.m. which for me matches my chronotype uh it has served as a powerful anti-depressant effect and when I've gotten an equal amount of sleep but going to bed too late for me that is you know midnight 1 a.m. and sleeping in until 8: or 9:00 a.m. um I always carry a low-level depression um fortunately not something that needed to be uh medicated but uh it's it's a striking effect in the positive direction when obeying qqr and in in the negative Direction when not so maybe just for because we can provide some links to um those segments in the show note captions but maybe just um for people that are here now um if we were going to list out you know two or three things that one can do to try and maximize um the quality and quantity of REM sleep uh without going on too much of a tangent but um at the same time we do want to highlight that addressing that Q qrt formula um for ourselves is going to be critical so maybe so for REM sleep um yeah you know in the domain of exercise temperature Etc are there any kind of quick quick bullet points that we can refer people to I would say just to keep it high level and and brief the single best way cheapest non-pharmacological way that you can enhance your REM sleep is to just sleep an extra 15 or 20 minutes later into the morning don't try to put if I tell you this is about by the way this is about the the quantity the your sleep opportunity don't try to add that 30 minutes or 20 minutes if your goal is to increase real sleep at the start of the night at the front end instead take that desire that I've offered you of adding just 20 minutes or 25 minutes of extra sleep now to the last part of your night wake up that sort of much later 20 25 minutes later that's the REM sleep Rich phase so if people go back and listen to episode one we'll describe to you exactly how the different stages of sleep unfold across the night and they're not evenly distributed it's not as though you get just as much REM sleep as well as deep non-rem sleep in the first half of the night as you do in the second you get most of your deep sleep in the first half and you get most of your REM sleep in the second half and particularly in the last quarter of the night and this leads us to understand that the later into the morning hours that we go the greater the hunger preference and The Taste desire there is of your brain to start sampling from the finger Buffet of all of those different stages this thing called REM sleep and the later that you sleep into the morning the more of that REM sleep that you will have and many people will have experienced this at the weekend where they have this pattern that we don't Rec recommend based on the qqr T um QQ our regularity go to bed at the same time wake up at the same time what we see often in society is something what we call social jetl where you're short sleeping during the week and then at the weekend you're out with friends or you're out sort of on the town you go to bed late and you wake up late and maybe you're doing that by 2 hours maybe you're normally in bed by 10: p.m. during the week but now at the weekends you're going to sleep maybe 12 12:30 and you're waking up 2 3 hours later on a Saturday and Sunday and then the problem with that parenthetically is on Sunday evening you've now got to go back to work the next day so you have to push yourself back to 10:30 or 10:00 whereas you were going to bed let's say at 1 a.m. on Friday and Saturday night that's a 3-hour Time shift and people are doing that very frequently that's the equivalent of you and I flying back and forth from Los Angeles to New York every single weekend in terms of oaan Rhythm and it's brutal on it but this is separate from this notion of your timing the final part of the Q qrt and by pushing your timing a little bit later into the morning when you wake up you will experience more REM sleep and as I said when people sleep later they go to bed later at night and they wake up much later in the morning at the weekend I strongly suspect that if they paid attention they would say at weekends I always dream more I always can remember my dreams and they're more intense it's not because there's something magical about how your memory recollection of Dreams operates on Saturdays and Sundays it's because you've slept in later you've gone into that REM sleep Rich preferential phase in the morning and therefore you've increased your REM sleep so I would say that that's probably the easiest way that you can start to modulate REM sleep so that's a terrific do and um I think we can probably summarize the the top don't as uh don't drink alcohol because it abolishes REM sleep alcohol and THC are both very potent ways that will remove or obliterate your REM sleep and we spoke about this in the episode on um on THC when we discussed this I think just yesterday I got a very long email and you know I'm sure you get lots of emails from um from delightful people in the public and a Gentleman just saying you know I was using cannabis for probably about 7 years and then I watched um or listen to some of your content and I stopped and I just had this explosion of dreams and I was never recollecting any of my dreams before but now they came back and goodness were they Vivid they were Rich they were and I could not believe it and that's REM sleep and that's because during the kind use by way of the THC not the CBD you've been blocking that REM sleep you've built up that pressure just as we described in the dementi these and then when you finally do take away the agent that is blocking the generation of REM sleep the THC all of a sudden your brain doesn't just go back to having its standard amount of REM sleep and dreaming it has that plus it tries to get back as much of it as it possibly can by having what we call a REM sleep rebound and that's why people when they they stop using they end up having this intense real sleep by the way to your point about reward and um addiction sensitivity with sleep deprivation one of the things that we um we did in a collaboration gosh this was years ago when I was at Harvard with Carl Hart who I think you I don't know if you colia yeah Colombia you know him yeah he's fantastic researcher very interesting man too um and what we found was that a lack of sleep was not only predictive of your addiction potential but when you went into a clinic to abstain and trying to come off some of those and here we were looking at cocaine um addiction a lack of sleep was a strong predictor of your abstinence and you falling off the wagon and going back to you so sleep is so critical not just for um maintaining or pushing you away from that addiction potential but once you are addicted and you're trying to abstain it gives you that lift of altitude to try to resist falling off the wagon and when sleep gets short that's when you become vulnerable again probably because your reward circuitry becomes enhanced and all of a sudden you just cannot resist the temptation anymore I want to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor insid tracker insid tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA a to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals now I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason the many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term Health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test the problem with a lot of blood tests out there however is that you get information back about metabolic factors hormones Etc but you don't know what to do with that information with inside tracker they make it very easy to understand your results and they also point you to specific directives that you can follow in the realm of nutrition exercise supplement a even

their full amplitude uh motivation um learning as we also covered in a previous episode but also to stay out of those um irritable emotional traps of life um and to be a regulated person calm and and joyful person um it stands to reason to uh minimize alcohol and cannabis use unless there's some I don't know medical reason why uh someone should otherwise but the the real take-home message here is get as much rapid eye movement sleep as possible and don't do anything to inhibit it yeah get as much sleep so focus on all of those four uh macros of sleep quantity quality regularity and timing and notice that if you want to try to optimize some of those that emotional reactivity and balance you may want to slightly over index on your REM sleep in that regard and one easy cheap way of doing that if you can lifestyle permitting an and again of course I understand everyone is has a life to live and pressures but that's the way that if you were to ask me can you do it and do it simply yes you probably can great but you touched on trauma a little bit already but um now would be the appropriate time I think to talk about PTSD post-traumatic stress disorder which um I think we can use the definition of PTSD and Trauma that the great Paul kti a former guest on this podcast who also did series yeah an incredible man what a what a what a mind on him and what a generosity of of sharing information in clear ways about mental health as he did in the four episode series on Mental Health here and he's been on other podcasts as well wrote A M marvelous book on trauma Paul defined trauma as some event that is aversive that changes the way that our nervous system works such that we function less well in the future it's not that every negative event every uh negative emotion Associated memory is trauma I think that's a a misconception um but there are things that happen to people um or that they observe happening to other people so there's you know first person trauma third person observational trauma Etc and these can be single events multiple events you know sadly this stuff happens um it can be neglect so sometimes it's the absence of an event right which becomes the traumatic event that fundamentally rewire some component of neur neural circuitry such that we don't function as well in terms of relationship to anything work food sex sleep relationships uh Baseline levels of emotionality and on and on so what is the relationship between sleep and post-traumatic stress disorder specifically I think some of what we've covered already certainly touches on this but PTSD seems to me that it it might be its own unique case it is because if you look at the diagnostic criteria for PTSD firstly you see sleep disturbance and as I said right at the top of this episode there is no major psychiatric disorder where there isn't some mention of sleep problems in its diagnostic criteria but something else was intriguing about PTSD that compelled me to think about it and then create a theory around it it's not just sleep problems it's also nightmares and specifically repetitive nightmares in fact repetitive nightmares form part of the diagnostic criteria for you to receive a diagnosis of PTSD that's how reliable they are and as I thought more about this model of overnight therapy this notion that sleep and particularly REM sleep provides a form of emotional first aid PTSD stood out to me as something think that I had to return to to explain why because if you think about PTSD and a veteran it is the perfect example of the process that I described of emotional deep potentiation failing because what I started to realize is that in PTSD there is this trauma experience and then perhaps what's happening is that sleep the brain goes back to sleep that night and says okay please do your elegant trick of stripping away the emotion from the memory and it fails so then what happens the next night the brain comes back and says I'm sorry but I still got this very emotionally charged memory please do your elegant dissipation depotentiation of the emotion from memory and it fails again almost like this broken record that was so indicative of these repetitive nightmares and then when you looked at PTSD I told you that REM sleep is a time of this remarkable decrease in noradrenaline but if you look at PTSD patients they actually have heightened levels of neur adrenaline and also in the body adrenaline as well in sleep in sleep and also when you look just as a basil State as well so there's something not quite right with the noradrenaline story in REM sleep in PTSD patients so I had just published this paper and I was up um at a conference in I think it was Portland and I presented the theory that or the data that we had on healthy people and I put forward this theory of um of PTSD and then later that afternoon a psychiatrist came on uh the stage called Murray Raskin and he was working a lot with PTSD vets and he describe data which I couldn't believe it's one of those moments Andrew where you're at a scientific conference and I think it happens maybe once in a career if you're lucky all of the hers on the back of my neck stood on Sharp end because he was saying we've got this data and we don't quite understand it we've been treating our veterans for blood pressure for hypertension using a generic drug called prasin and prasin blocked the um adrenergic response in the body because you're trying to sort of Tamp down that sympathetic activation in the body beta blocker so it's an it's an alpha adrenergic antagonist not a beta blocker so it's not a beta blocker but it's blocking the adrenergic system and so and it's a you know it's a generic pretty cheap drug but it turns out that it crosses the blood brain barrier so it doesn't just stay within the body it goes up into the brain and he said we don't really understand it because I've been giving patients this medication and it works to a degree but something else happens they come into the clinic and they say Doc I'm not having those nightmares anymore they seem to have gone away and these patients seem to start to show signs of resolution so all of a sudden I had had a model a clinical model that was in search of data and he had data that was in search of a theoretical model I couldn't believe it because it's exactly what I would predict which is that if neur adrenaline is too high in PTSD you're not processing and stripping the emotion from the memory so it keeps coming back over and over like this repetitive nightmare but then if you block and help bring back down that level of neur adrenaline to that which would be seen in a normal healthy person in other words completely blocking it or all of a sudden the emotional memory gets the chance to be processed and you finally start to get symptom resolution so we couldn't believe it he flew down to Berkeley we spent several days together we went out to dinner we just could not stop talking he subsequently did some incredible work in this area and presin went on to become the um an FDA approved medication for PTSD and repetitive nightmares that was approved by the Veterans Administration Bravo and so no it's not me it's all all of his work no you can't no this to me is the uh scientific collaborative um conceptual equivalent of the old rees's um peanut butter cup commercials for those of us old enough to remember it's two people running toward one another on the beach one with a jar of peanut butter one with a with a piece with a bar of chocolate and then they crash into one another and then they both you know share in the Delight of the the chocolate peanut butter combination which is an amazing combination um but here a far more um important example uh because it's led to a clinical relief in in patients with PTSD um so I'm not making light of that at all but um this is one of the reasons to go to Scientific meetings seriously this is one of the reasons why scientists need to talk this is one of the reasons to do podcasts is it is it uh Fosters hybridization of ideas which um is Central to to new discoveries um and in this case a clinical Discovery I I have a question about um this notion of blocking norepinephrine um in the brain and body um you know on the one hand it seems that during rapid eye movement sleep we know we're paralyzed um or we are paralyzed that's a fact of rapid eye movement sleep the um the brain is recalling memories often in in great detail sometimes through symbolic representation SpaceTime is disrupted it's either faster slower so because you're dreaming um and it seems that there's something powerful about being able to replay the memories and yet divorce them from certain neurochemical uh release in the brain and body to essentially uncouple them and then to me it makes perfect sense why taking a a drug that would reduce the amount of sympathetic arousal in sleep would help especially PTSD because you said with PTSD sort of an invasion of the noradrenaline response into rapid ey Moon sleep that is inappropriate so does that mean that rapid eye movement sleep in people with PTSD is not truly rapid eye movement sleep it's as if it's been abolished and replaced with something that's kind of pseudo waking stress invaded you know it's like a zombie REM um and it's not good is that is that is that correct it seems to be an and you can look at this in terms of the electrical activity of REM sleep the electrical brain waves of R sleep in these patients and you're right it doesn't seem to be of the same electrical quality but what was interesting in Marie Raskin studies when he started to treat patients with the pricin and Tamp down that noradrenaline one of the other things that returned back to normality was not just that the symptoms dissipated their REM sleep started to return with a greater amount and so I think it fits very well with this notion that whatever REM sleep that was going on may not necessarily have been electrical or neurochemically identical to normative REM sleep but when you assisted the system with a chemical to bring it back into normality REM sleep was gifted back to the brain and emotional resolution started to unfold now I should note that there have been um a number of studies that have replicated the finding some Studies have not though and so we still need to understand exactly why this is the case and there are other therapies that we'll probably discuss in a later episode on dreaming that are as if not more effective than that drug therapy for repetitive nightmares that is a psychological intervention rather than a pharmacological intervention and that seems to be very effective too in 2017 as my laboratory was starting to explore some studies on humans on fear and Trauma I visited a a trauma Addiction Center on the East Coast um the guy who runs it will be a guest on this podcast in the future an amazingly talented uh trauma and addiction therapist by the name of Ryan Suave and there it was that I learned about Yoga Nidra non-sleep deep rest and here's why they were taking heroin addicts gambling addicts sex addicts alcoholics people with what they're call behavioral process addictions and substance abuse addictions um and every morning after they woke up the first thing that they would do was 1 hour of non-sleep deep bre you know placing people into this linal state and I asked why and um and Ryan said this is especially important to do with um addicts when they arrive in inpatient recovery in the first week and um even more so in the first three days because typically they are badly sleep deprived and in addition to that many of them are just not good at getting and staying asleep at night without the use of pharmacology or in some cases their behavioral addictions depending on what it what it was and so it was a a kind of a self-directed relaxation training of sorts uh first thing in the morning that in addition um perhaps could compensate partially for some of the sleep deprivation that they no doubt were experiencing when they arrived it's also novel environment and sleeping novel environments can be challenging so uh there is as far as I know no uh randomized control Trials of of this practice uh yet but there are a good number of um clinics and treatment centers that are now employing non-sleep deep breast AKA Yoga Nidra um for 30 minutes to an hour first thing upon waking um as one of the you know core components of treatment for helping people get and stay sober I think it's absolutely fascinating because that morning time period as well can be for those who are struggling with sleep especially difficult and you and I have spoken on this podcast series about sort of Awakening at night or later in the morning when you really want to be asleep and it's just a struggle to get back and as you noted there he was saying they often come in underslept and my suspicion is that they're probably getting sleep at the front end in part because they're heavily medicated but self-medicating in terms of helping their sleep but then of course because they are asleep they can't continue to medicate so which part of sleep is fragile it's those morning hours and therefore if you have something that is a compensatory tool that is not going to be the trigger of saying just get back into bed get under those sheets and sleep you know sleep doesn't work like that sleep is not something that we do sleep is something that arrives to us with us and if it's not you can't force it and it's not it's a little bit like someone's name in fact quite the opposite that the harder you try to remember the further you push sleep away and when you stop it all of a sudden comes back but I love this idea of inserting something like that as a compensatory tool and that's why I think you and I have discussed um openly here in fact on this series at some point we're going to collaborate and we're going to look to see exactly what is happening electrically at High Fidelity mapping inside of the brain when we are going through these linal states and what is the benefit of that is it a very similar benefit for sleep and it's fascinating because it's Poss possible that what we find at the level of the brain is that it's not sleep like it's something else like maybe it's just a lional state like and what's also interesting is that it provides seemingly many of the benefits of sleep but it's not sleep in other words you can arrive at the same destination of mental and physical health through two different routs one thing called Sleep one thing called these lional states or they both op operate on the same Highway in terms of mechanistic transaction benefits there's so much that we need we could stay here all all night and all day hopefully not all night well well we will absolutely do those studies and um because I think that people are in desperate need of zero cost tools to try and um access the the the replenishment and Recovery that comes from sleep and when sleep is available to us when we can access it that's going to be the best option there's no question but then some of these tools um in theory and in practice provide a a portal to get better at sleeping as well so I was going to say one of the other things I I'd be fascinated for us to do is not just look at that model of what happens in the morning but can we use that for people who have the opposite insomnia problem which is that I can't fall asleep and we spoke about this in a previous episode of tools and techniques and methods to help you fall asleep could this be one of them where you just start to help move yourself into this Lial State you take the stress off one of the things I hear so much at the center when people come in and they say I've just I always struggle to sleep and you go into depth and it's because they their mind starts to roll it X through that anxiety of what I need to do and what I should do but also then the the later it gets and the the absent the Sleep becomes the more stress they get not just about the next day The more stress that they get about this thing called not being able to fall asleep and if there's something a practice that you've taught someone that says that's okay I know this place and I know this situation and there's a tool I have and it's called this ainal state and if you were to train people on that sort of that method is it a way that they finally can then cast themselves off and it's the it's the bridge not necessarily just between Despair and hope but the bridge between wakefulness and sleep so put it at the back end at the end of the day rather than the front end a lot for us to discover there and um you know at risk of of uh being hyperbolic I mean what what would be more useful than a zeroc cost non-pharmacologic tool for people to get um the rest and restoration they need and to get better at getting the ultimate form of rest and restoration which is sleep yeah and it you know I love the Paradox of it that non-sleep deep rest allows you to go into sleep deep rest right it is after all a transition or Lial State maybe this will become the the stage before stage one of sleep who knows who knows we Define off stage in criteria that's right okay so speaking of challenges sleeping because of one's concern AKA anxiety about the importance of sleep what about the relationship between sleep and anxiety meaning many people in the world experience low-level anxiety or have a low threshold to what could be a full-blown anxiety or panic attack but more often than not is this feeling of being tired and wired or um having a a quick uh you know prepulse startle as we call it in our business a nerd speak for um you know kind of a reactive um to input anxiety and I don't think there's any clean definition between anxiety stress um and PTSD these run along a Continuum and they PSD is an anxiety disorder it's one of many right they these things braid together in a way that it would be a waste of our time to try and disentangle those um but many people have anxiety that is anywhere from minor to debilitating um but that is separate from PTSD although people with PTSD can have anxiety so what do we know about the relationship between sleep and anxiety and perhaps we could frame this in the context of the qqr you know um I'll just toss out a question that perhaps highlights what I mean is it possible that somebody's getting eight hours of sleep a night which for them meets their quantity requirement in the um the quality is relatively high but it's not as high as it could be because the regularity and timing of their sleep isn't great is that person going to be more prone to anxiety than somebody who's really matched to their chronotype and is still getting enough sleep no one's done the head-to-head comparison where you kind of do the how I going do the Coke Pepsi Dr Pepper Sprite QQ RT challenge between all of those what we do know is that if you look at each one independently qqr T quantity quality regularity timing if any one of those is off it's very difficult not to see a coexisting anxiet disorder or increase in anxiety or a mood disorder and I think to me anxiety is part of that class of a broader class that I would call mood disorders it's relevant that we make that distinction at least in my eyes and I know some people may disagree because mood and anxiety are different than emotions and many of us Clump them together the way I think about the difference is the following time scale emot ions are short punctate events that usually last anywhere from seconds to too many minutes mood States however like anxiety or depression those operate on a slightly different time scale from minutes to hours to months to years and so it's very unlikely that we can experience an emotional reaction that from a sort of a chronometry point of view lack lasts for 2 years but you can certainly see someone who has a mood State abnormality of depression that lasts for several years or who has been chronically anxious for several years and I'll come back to why I think that distinction is is relevant for a second to your point though about the relationship with sleep here again it's a very strong bidirectional relationship and I would say that probably in the last eight or nine years we've been doing a considerable amount of work can sleep in anxiety rather than just sleep in basic emotional reactivity what we found is it's very strongly bidirectional that if you have anxiety it's very difficult to sleep and if you are having difficulty sleeping it's very likely that you will increase your anxiety but before we really unpacked that we started with a a very basic study similar to those we've described we took a group of people and we were very careful to make sure that they had um completely normative levels of anxiety they showed no signs of an anxiety related disorder and by the way anxiety disorders are it seems one of if not the most common of all psychiatric conditions just to put it in context for people listening and these individuals no signs of anxiety disorders whatsoever they were normative and then we had them go through a full night of sleep or we then sleep deprived them and the next day we were measuring their anxiety and in those people who were sleep deprived we were actually measuring the level of anxiety every hour so we could almost get this timelapse photography of what happened to the anxiety state as it unfolded across the sleep deprivation period it wasn't a linear response that the more and more hours that you were awake Beyond 16 the more exponential that rise in anxiety became so it wasn't simply a linear dose response curve it was an exponential meaning that there was this hockey shaped swing up and in fact by the next morning compared to when you'd had a full night of sleep those individuals were so anxious that almost 50% of the participants in that group who had no signs of anxiety before had a level of anxiety that was so strong that they would reach the diagnostic threshold for having an anxiety disorder and that was simply by way of the absence of sleep but again that brought me back to this notion of this is a good experimental tool for us scientists to understand what is the benefit of sleep when it's present and the absence of sleep when it's not by taking sleep completely out of the equation by way of total deprivation but of course that's not real life so we did a slightly different study here what we did was we tracked individuals essentially in the wild as it were just going about their daily lives and we had different sleep tracking monitor uh monitoring equipment on them so we were tracking their sleep from one night to the next to the next to the next and from one day to the next to the next we were tracking their level of anxiety and what we found here was that even small perturbations in their sleep from one night to the next to the next accurately predicted the increase or decrease in their anxiety from one day to the next to the next what was the critical ingredient here well in the first experiment I'd essentially manipulated both quantity and quality the two qqs of the qqr had removed the quantity of sleep and also they had no quality of sleep why because they had no quantity of sleep but when we looked at that day to day to day night to night toight study it wasn't quantity that was the best predictor it wasn't shortening of quantity that determined next day increases in anxiety it was quality the worse the quality was night to night to night the worse their anxiety became so that started to lead us to think a lot more about what is it regarding the quality of sleep that seemed to offer when it was present what I would describe as an angio itic benefit in other words it's lessening anxiety a lack of sleep is an anxiogenic it's going to produce anxiety what in sleep is anxiolytic we started off with a hypothesis that was profoundly incorrect we thought well for emotions which are these short bursts of um of affective state it was REM sleep that seemed to be the Principal ingredient well wouldn't that be the case for mood States well here with anxiet it wasn't it was deep non-rm sleep and we couldn't get away from it and so what we found was that when we looked at the sleep in the laboratory and asked what was predictive from the night before so you measure your anxiety the night before and then we measure it the next morning and basically we calculate a change score has your anxiety the next morning increased stayed the same or decreased and then we correlate that with the different stages and what we found was that the electrical quality of your deep nonrem sleep was very much predictive of your dissipation of anxiety overnight and this helped me realize gosh it's much more complex these are beautiful surprises you get from research when you you have like you have this hypothesis and you look at you see REM sleep no signal of predictive relationship with anxiety and I say of course because I'm idiotic rerun the analysis just go back to Raw data and you know the r sleep signal was so strong rerun the analysis and you get exactly the same result it's deep non-rm sleep great okay then what is that deep non-rm sleep doing to help dissipate the anxiety but here again was a commonality with emotion what we found is that the greater the amount of Deep non-rm Sleep the greater the re-engagement of your frontal lobe was the next day and that was predicting the dissipation of your anxiety the next morning so we really started to understand this sort of critical bidirectional relationship but it was a very complex one that yes anxiety can disrupt your sleep and yes disrupted sleep can predict your next day anxiety but it wasn't the same stage of sleep that we thought before it was the the opposite it was deep non-rm sleep what we've come to realize is that deep nonr sleep in part seems to be almost shifting you from that sympathetic State over to the parasympathetic state it seems to engage that nice rest and digest it seems to reduce your heart rate it seems to drop levels of cortisol and we think that perhaps is a resetting brain body literally an embodied mechanism by way of Deep non-r Sleep helping you just relieve that anxiety pressure so it does come back to your question which is yes quantity if I manipulated quality if I manipulated regularity or timing manipulate any one of those I can change your anxiety but the story coming through here if anything was that it wasn't quantity it was quality I told you that from one night to the next to the next the quality of your sleep that we were measuring was predictive of your anxiety and then when we bring you into the laboratory and we look at the electrical activity of your brain I also mentioned in that episode on the first episode another way we measure quality is not just subjectively what's going on or objectively what is the efficiency of your sleep is it filled with lots of Awakenings which was the measure that we used in the day-to-day study and night to night study but we looked at the electrical quality of your sleep once again it was quality that was predicting it it's something about getting good continuous sleep that is replete with this deep non-rem electrical brain activity that provides an angiolytic benefit to your brain the next day and I think it's strategic CU so many of us deal with anxiety and some of us would prefer not to necessarily be on medication or even look to that well here again is a strategic tool think about your sleep it really does seem to be a buffer for anxiety along those lines maybe you can just recap a few of the things covered in previous episodes that are known to improve the quality and quantity of Deep nonm Sleep um I can think of a couple but I'm you're the expert here um not rush to judgment on that one well I think it's an established fact uh which is why you're here um so let's um perhaps list a few of those off in the domains of you know exercise temperature Etc what what what would you place in that you know is there top three like three greatest hits for uh for improving deep non-rem sleep for uh because of its important relationship to anxiety management or reducing anxiety I think there are the first thing I would tell you is that regularity is going to be key here when you are giving your brain the signals of regularity it understands exactly how to instigate that that deep sleep and that's one of the two qualitative measures of sleep that I spoke about so QQ the quality the second Q I spoke about it's regarding the continuity of your sleep and the electrical quality of your sleep regularity is probably best for the continuity of your sleep if you're very irregular with the timing of your sleep your brain almost doesn't know you know are we on are We off are we on and we off and your sleep can become quite fragmented because it's confused based on regularity when you give it regularity sleep starts to become more stable more stable means that it's less likely to be littered with Awakenings meaning that it's better quality of sleep in terms of electrical quality of sleep we did mention this um in a prior episode when we spoke about sort of food and exercise exercise seems to be one of those things that's very good at improving the quality of your deep sleep and here I'm talking about the electrical quality of your deep sleep try to make sure that you're physically active to a degree and and I think this is a protocol and I think it's a meaningful protocol but to go so to the extreme where I would to say you need to do at least 32 and a half minutes on a spin bike at this wattage or you know we can't prescribe quite at that point you know scientific prescription not MediCal and so I would say exercise is one then we spoke about another which was temperature and we said that getting your bedroom cool seems to be a way to promote the increase in deep sleep so these are two dos which is get regular get cool the don'ts we've already spoken a little bit about too one of the things that I probably didn't mention enough with alcohol not only does it seem to compromise your rapid eye movement sleep but it will fragment your sleep it will make your sleep more unstable and an indirect consequence of that is alcohol is going to be in highest concentrations in your system after drinking in the evening with sleep in the first four to 5 hours now that depends on how quickly you metabolize it and how much you've had but let's assume some degree of standardization in other words I said that alcohol will not just block your M sleep it will fragment your sleep makes your sleep more vulnerable to you waking up well you're especially vulnerable in the first four or so hours because that's when alcohol concentration is highest in your system and therefore the first 4 hours can also fall prey to the greatest culling of your sleep quality and if you're removing or restricting some of that quality in the first four hours what type of sleep are you principally restricting you're restricting deep sleep because we've said deep sleep comes in the first half dream sleep REM sleep in the second half so don'ts would be try to stay away from you know excessive alcohol in the evening we also know that Al alcohol is associated with longer term chronic anxiety and the tragedy is that it's often used as a way to blunt the anxiety because alcohol is a sedative and it can help just alleviate take you know take the edge off but it's a short-term quote unquote win for a long-term loss because overall it will increase anxiety levels so I would say those are some dos and perhaps a don't if you want to try to optimize your sleep quality quality including the Integrity of your sleep and also the electrical quality of your sleep terrific I think um because so many people struggle with anxiety ranging from mild to severe anxiety the tips you just provided are going to be immensely beneficial and in addition to that the previous four episodes that we've recorded for this series each and all include tools that is protocols for improving the Q qrt aspects of sleep so um all the more reason for people to uh dig into those and and to glean the the gems that you've laid out for people because they're they really are very actionable and um you know most all perhaps even all of the tools that we've discussed in those episodes are zero cost they require a little bit of time investment some um thought and consideration but they're not really that difficult to implement they just require a little bit of um being one's own scientist of self and being your own own Corner when it comes to sleep and another lowcost method that we um mentioned was not just temperature in terms of keeping your room cool but warm bath or shower before bed I mentioned improved sleep but one of the things that improves most is deep non-rm sleep so there's another technique get your room cool to go into but warm up to cool down to fall asleep which then keeps you cool so that you stay asleep and you'll get more deep sleep very fantastic although it's a terribly um uh unhappy topic suicide is a is an important topic for us to to cover here um you know I can think of few things more tragic than suicide um and yet sadly it U it accompanies certain uh psychiatric conditions I think um people with manic bipolar have a 20 to 30 times greater um probability of suicide than others but you know suicide accompanies major depression anxiety PTSD you know again it's it's um a tough topic to to get into um but an important one to get into what is the relationship between suicidality and sleep um and I suppose we could look at this from the perspective of to what degree does sleep deprivation um correlate with suicide or attempted suicides and what sort of inoc ulatory effects does um sleep provide towards suicide unfortunately we don't know much about the second part of the question which is how can sleep be used as a risk mitigating tool when you know that there is the risk of suicide in place um there's been a number of people who are doing this work including my colleague Allison Harvey again at uh the University of uh of California Berkeley and Sher Johnson who's also there too I would say though that the first question is is quite answerable which is what do we know firstly about how a lack of sleep can impact suicide some of the earliest data that we found were associational relationships what we found is that short sleep or poor quality of sleep predicted three things it predicted suicidal ideation meaning that you had thoughts of suicide bad sleep seemed to predict suicide attempts and then tragically more recent data a lack of sleep predicts suicide completion and what makes me think more causely about it and we've been trying to get some grants and we've failed to do so so far to do more of this work because I'm I'm just so compelled by it and you're right it's one of the most tragic situations those sleep relationships aren't simply happening at the same moment in time what I mean is that the sleep disturbance that we see precedes the onset of having suicidal thoughts it precedes the onset of suicide attempt and it precedes the suicide completion so what this has been teaching me is I've been looking at the data and we've looked at a little bit of our own data sleep disruption when it comes to suicide is almost the canary in the coal mine it's almost like a tragic crystal ball that when you see that sleep start starting to dismantle it is a foreshadowing sign of a very dark series of events that will unfold in other words could we now start to think and this is one of the things that we want to do is sleep a biomarker is sleep disruption I should say a biomarker for upcoming suicide risk before it begins the idea of finding a biomarker or collection of biomarkers for SU side I think is one of the more important missions of Neuroscience Ai and mental health uh generally there's a brilliant young researcher up at the University of Washington named Sam golden he's um spent a lot of his career studying animal models of um aggression um and rage um and of course some forms of suicide are thought to be forms of self-directed aggression and rage it makes sense um some forms of suicide perhaps are different I don't think we quite understand what suicide represents in the brain just yet and I think they're having spoken to Paul kti and and others about suicide um it's clear that there are unfortunately many paths to Suicide there's in one brain State nonetheless um Sam's laboratory has been developing tools that help people with Suicidal Tendencies or people who have had suicidal ideation or plans in the past um with these AI based tools where it detects changes in their voice in their sleep patterns and in a few other metrics that I don't recall that together become very good predictors of um later suicidal ideation so the idea here is that um people who are prone to Suicide um often don't realize that they're drifting that way until it can sadly be too late so um the point here is uh a biomarkers are key B these biomarkers are being developed uh C AI is critical but that according to Sam um changes in sleep patterns is absolutely Central to these algorithms for allowing people to detect their own um potential for suicide I think it's it's critical and we've thought about this when we started to see these sleep signals that were preemptive that were almost precognitive in the sense of of prediction occurred to me that we're at the stage of technological Evolution that if we get consent to many individuals who become suicidal are they are interested in some degree of support and we often but of course some people will just recoil and go into themselves and that's that's when things can get very problematic as well but it would require some degree of consenting that if you have a history of suicide adiation in the past what if you were to be able to consent and say I would like to risk mitigate and you have a wearable like a watch and that watch is connected to your phone and there is a signal that can come from your watch that dials a series of phone numbers in order of preference and when your watch starts to detect that your sleep has this one the things we really want to understand is what is the specific signature of sleep abnormalities it's not just that your sleep gets short but is it that your sleep gets long and then short and then long and then short but it constantly has poor quality of sleep and the regularity is all over the place but the chronotype timing is still in place what sort of specific pattern of those things is the Hallmark that is most predictive of suicide let's say that I can come up with that algorithm finally and then we can implement it into a watch or a tracking device of some sort and when it starts to see that pattern it's constantly pattern matching and it starts to see that across whatever number of days we say if you see this across six nights or across 13 nights this is serious it then triggers that phone to send a message to those individuals who the designated support carers and those people then reach out and start to say how are you doing would you like to have a phone call can I come over can I make you some food and I'd love to have a chat with you can you find a way to bootstrap a condition where you constantly then otherwise become asocial or antisocial and lose all support network so that would be the the sort of the grandiose idea the other thing that's very interesting is that we could measure their activity and their wakefulness at night and the reason I bring this up is some great work by Michael peus and U Michael grandner who've looked at suicide um both attempts and suicide completion across the 24-hour period it's not constant it's not that you see suicide ideation and suicide attempts and completion in a distributed manner equally across the 24-hour period when do they principally occur they occur in the late middle of the night and there's this almost a four to five hour period you know somewhere on average and again it's just an average somewhere between let's say 1 a.m. and 4 a.m. which it turns out to be right at the lowest dip of your Cadian Rhythm and it could be Cadian Rhythm but I also think that there's something about of course the night ESS when no one else is around around and it is just you bad point number one second as we've spoken about before on this episode negative thoughts are 10 times worse in the darkness of night than they are in the light of day and third at that point if you're awake you're not asleep and we know sleep is providing this balast to your mental health so on all three of those counts you see this very strong spike in suicide ideation suicide attempt and also suicide completion in this bewitching hour in the middle of the night there's a final piece in the suicide story though that is only just emerging if you are not getting sufficient sleep you are somewhere between two to three times more likely to go into that suicidal state which is a very significant number however when people started to measure another factor of sleep and particularly dream sleep which was the dream content itself it became even more predictive and we've not really seen this very much in psychiatric conditions but what they found was that instead of using your sleep disruption or your lack of sleep as a predictor of your suicide risk we use nightmares as a predictor of your suicide risk that predictive value that risk went from about two to three times more likely to somewhere between 5 to8 times more likely there is something special going on with bad dreams and specifically nightmares that is even more predictive than this physiological thing that we call Sleep itself and we'll probably come on to maybe some of the reasons why dreaming and particularly nightmares in the next episode on dreaming could explain exactly why that is but it's a new finding I don't think we can say much more about it now but it is one of the most I think novel findings in the psychiatric sleep story that now dreams have come above and beyond simply sleep itself as a predictor of mental illness and specifically a form that will take your life tragically very quickly when I think about depression I immediately associate that with excessive amounts of sleep after all it's called depression but what is the real link between major depression which is you know the classical um you know signs of you know mala's um one of the Hallmark features also being a uh a lack of optimism about the future or Andor ability to sense into the future that's what it's not the only criteria um when Dr Carl daero the great neuroscientist that he is was on this podcast and of course he's also a practicing clinical psychiatrist I when we were talking about depression he mentioned that another Hallmark of major depression is people waking up at 2: or 3:00 a.m. and not being able to fall back asleep um this just seems like a recipe for disaster all around um that the very condition that you're trying to perhaps amarate with additional sleep is preventing you from sleeping it's like I couldn't imagine very cruel is a whole a whole lot of things more diabolical um in terms of the sleep sleep science so what's the relationship between sleep and depression and how how should one um untangle that like seemingly gordi and not it is like the other conditions bidirectional that depression can disrupt sleep very much and disrupted sleep can trigger depression depression is interesting by the way some people have conceptualized it as being different to anxiety based in some ways on memory which is that when you think about anxiety people consider anxiety a disorder of the future that you are constantly worried about what's coming up in the future I I didn't do this today so I need to do that tomorrow and then I've got that other thing next week or I'm fearful of going out to see them tomorrow I just I'm fearful of taking that flight tomorrow it seems to be so much about prospective future whereas other people have suggested depression is the opposite it's about rumination of the past I went through this event I had this bereavement I had this painful divorce I just can't get over my past now I don't necessarily know if that's entirely true but it it is interesting in the sense that both of those abnormal prospection worry of the future and abnormal retrospection sort of ruminating on the past seem to disrupt sleep before um you continue I just wanted to drill into that that idea just a little bit because I think it's a really interesting one worth exploring again I'm no psychiatrist but I have heard and I've experienced the I've had a depression I think it's my understanding is it's normal for um people to experience a major depressive episode at some point in their lives could be situationally triggered or not but that um for others Unfortunately they have repeating major depressive episodes and hopefully some people go through life never having had a depressive episode but as I recall that one of the more Salient um thought patterns was that I used to have something that somehow was lost and I couldn't quite figure out what it was it was this curring feeling of right like things were on track and then they got off track but not being able to to tack the uh progression from on track to off track to one particular event it was this sort of sense that like I had something that them was lost now fortunately for me it eventually lifted uh and you know it didn't get um dangerously bad um but I I've had some close friends who've gone through individual or several major depressions and I I hear this like this idea that they had they had it or they think something was there that then they lost so I think I I agree with well if you think about the word that you just used had is about right it's it's about it's the past right right it's past tense right and then if if we apply the criteria that is is indeed part of the criteria for determining if somebody has major depression which is a lack of optimistic outlook on the future one can see how one could be very much stuck in the present and focused on the past and you know just stuck in that spin cycle um anyway we're not here to um to uh decide what depression is or isn't in every case but I I'm I'm not a psychiatrist either right but but I think this distinction between anxiety being about the future in a way that disrupts one's present and depression being about often the past in a way that disrupts one's sense of the present and the future um makes a lot of sense it's just a a nice um not nice it's unfortunate but it's a um it could be a useful a useful contextualization yeah thank you and I to your question though about sleep it's it's been a little bit interesting with depression firstly what we know is that depression will disrupt your sleep and make your sleep shorter and it comes back to um your comment from uh from Carl from Carl di we often see that patients will have problems staying asleep they wake up in the middle of the night they can't get back to sleep it's problematic and therefore their sleep duration and their Sleep Quality decrease however on the other hand there is an interesting question by the way of can you get too much sleep which I should probably come back as there's a whole episode to do on that probably but one of the places where we see quote unquote too much sleep is in the depression literature and it's a condition that we call hypersomnia in other words increased or excessive degrees of sleep hypersomnia here but a a great PhD student at Berkeley looked at the data um Kate Kaplan who's a fantastic um cognitive behavioral therapist now and a clinical psychologist looked a little bit at the data and others have looked at this too when you examine what people were asking those patients where there is this conclusion that patients with depression can sleep too long really what they were asking in those studies was what time you go to bed and what time do you wake up and there what you clearly find is that people with depression will be in bed for significantly longer periods of time and the inference there and you could argue almost the conflation is that if you're in bed for longer then you're sleeping for longer and therefore depression is a condition of hypersomnia but when people looked at this a little bit more in a nuanced way and asked a different question what time did you go to sleep and what time did you wake up that hypersomnia phenomenon is nowhere near as strong as you would have been led to believe otherwise from the what time did you go to bed and what time did you wake up and I think part of the reason comes back to depression as a condition when you think about depression one of the aspects one of the features is that you're depressed to the point where you just don't want to interact with the world and what better place to spend if that's your mentality than this thing called bed I just don't want to get out of bed I'm just going to stay here and lie in bed I'm awake I'm not asleep and so we don't quite know yet if depression is a condition that is associated with long sleep we certainly Know It's associated with short sleep and disrupted sleep or that is masquerading as this thing called hypersomnia but when you really look at the data it's not quite so clear that was the first peculiarity in depression that there could be this Paradox of yes long sleep but also not enough sleep too short sleep one of the earliest findings in depression and sleep and has been quite well replicated is a change in REM sleep but now it wasn't necessarily that individuals who had depression slept or had excessive amounts of REM sleep they had a little bit more what was interesting is that when that REM sleep emerged during the night was much earlier and in the first episode I was telling you that when you your head hits the pillow you go down to the light stages of nonr then into the deeper stages and then maybe after about 50 60 70 80 minutes you'll pop up and you'll have your short REM sleep period but that first REM sleep period in people with depression seem to have been called up by the brain abnormally or not much earlier so it's what we call REM sleep latency from the moment that you fell asleep what is the time what is the latency of the first arrival of REM sleep and that REM sleep latency was significantly shorter in those people with depression Ram sleep was arriving earlier now it's hard because you can argue and this is these are the most dangerous hypotheses you can argue both sides of it you can say well perhaps that's because Matt you also spoke to me that REM sleep may be important for some aspects of the emotional brain and when you are depressed the brain knows that REM sleep is required and it calls it up on the menu of the series of dishes that you're going to be served earlier on in the night because it's needed more significantly the other and that's the adaptive theory the other is the maladaptive Theory which is that arriving with your REM sleep too early does not do your brain good things and therefore it's some abnormality of emotional processing the data that's interesting there is that if you look at some anti-depressants many of them will either delay the onset of REM sleep or they will reduce it significantly now there's a huge debate about the efficacy and the utility of anti-depressants and I I don't have a horse in that race and I don't know know enough about that literature to comment I would simply say though that it's at least intriguing to me that some medications that are commonly prescribed as anti-depressants will alter specifically rem's sleep and push it later or try to reduce it down and that would fit with the maladaptive hypothesis that this arrival of REM sleep so early in depression and perhaps having a little too much REM sleep isn't optimal and when you push back against that with pharmacology I.E anti-depressants you seem to get some degree of resolution or reduction in the depression symptomatology again I don't think we've we clearly understand that the another strange thing that is has been often cited to me many times about sleep and depression is a literature that suggests that if you deprive people of sleep which time and again in this episode we've said leads to bad outcomes for mental health it does exactly the opposite in depression that if you sleep deprive a depressed patient you get a resolution of the depression and that is the claim that's often made to me now it is a very clear set of data in the literature but there are two potential concerns with it the first concern is that not all patients respond to sleep deprivation in fact if you look at the data it's somewhere between 30 to 55% of patients will be responders to sleep depravation the other proportion of those patients don't respond or if anything get worse when you sleep deprive them and then the question is well how would you know and right now and there have been some brain Imaging studies some pet studies done way back at UC irine U and other locations where they were trying to say is there something about the metabolic activity of your brain that can predict if you're a responder or not sleep deprivation because at least then we would know who should we push through this quote unquote treatment and who should we not because it's going to be bad for them that's the first issue and we don't have a clear understanding the second issue is that as soon as those patients with depression sleep after the deprivation the anti-depressant benefit goes away and they go right back to being depressed again so yes it's a mechanistic interesting process what is it about sleep deprivation that could alleviate depression and I'll explain why I think it can but it's not a sustainable one it's not a clinically viable one why would it have that effect if it does well you and I discussed earlier in this episode that when you are sleep deprived not only does your emotional brain become much more responsive to negative things also becomes much more responsive to rewarding positive things and one of the interesting things that I think people mistake about depression they just think that when I'm depressed I have sad mood I have negative mood that's not entirely true one of the principal features of depression is something that we call anhedonia which is an absence of having the ability to have honic responses in other words you can't get pleasure from normally pleasurable things it's not an issue about sliding down to the negative it's the absence of being able to experience the positive that puts you on a track towards depression and what you and I discussed earlier in this episode is some of the work that we've been doing where when you sleep deprive individuals but you show them very rewarding based stimuli they become much more reward sensitive and perhaps this is why patients will respond to sleep deprivation with depression because they're too far away from that positive end of the spectrum they're not reward sensitive enough they don't get a positive good feeling now if you're someone who is healthy and you're sleep deprived you go too far in the reward direction and you become vulnerable to reward and sensation seeking but if you're depressed and you're shifted to sort of away from that and sleep deprivation brings you back closer to a normative reward-based reactivity maybe that's the reason why you get this anti-press present benefit and why when you start sleeping again you take away that enhanced reward sensitivity and you lose the anti-depressant benefit so I think we still don't know enough about depression and sleep yet if you were to ask me of the four quantity quality regularity and timing which would be ideal I would say all four are definitely players but timing may have some of the best evidence because it's not just about sleep when it comes to depression it's also about your circadian rhythm that if you are not aligned with your natural chronotype your natural 24-hour Rhythm Cadian misalignment when you fall out of synchrony with your natural chronotype is a strong predictor of depression so if there is an actionable item first it would be to say from a big picture perspective understand that sleep is one of the least painful available options for you as a no cost to try to stabilize your mental health now I'm not suggesting that all psychiatric conditions are Sleep Disorders that's not true and I'm not suggesting that you should stop simply at the place of getting your sleep straight to help with your mental conditions not at all I am saying however that if you do get your sleep straight it's only going to help and may help quite a significant amount based on the data but when it comes to depression I would say of those four qqr T there's very strong emerging data that Cadian misalignment not matching your chronotype to the time when you are sleeping and the time you are awake is one of the strongest factors so if you want to say I can't do all of them Matt I can't do all of this Q qrt nonsense just tell me one of them to start with I would say don't worry we'll get to the three others let's just start with getting your timing right let's understand what type you are take the um go online you can take one of these tests the um meq the morningness eveningness questionnaire you can just Google it it's free you can we'll provide a link to it in the show note caption that's great um understand what type you are and then try to understand based on what time I'm currently Awakening sleep is it matched is it mismatched and if it's mismatched try to see what you can do with your lifestyle accommodating of course to match that things will more than likely start there getting better along those lines um and if I may uh I'd like to just mention a recent study that I think dovetails with what you just said beautifully and seems highly actionable to me this was a study published in um nature mental health which is a relatively new Journal um but it involved exploring the light exposure and dark exposure patterns of I believe it was more than 80,000 individuals I'll have to go back and check that but what was interesting is that um when they looked at light exposure in particular sunlight exposure and they looked at Darkness exposure across the 24-hour schedule what they concluded was that there was a near linear relationship between the amount of light that one gets in the morning and throughout the day and reduction in mental health challenges at the in terms of depression PTSD there were a few others some of the effects were less robust for certain psychiatric conditions than they were for say depression what was equally interesting is that Darkness the absence of light turned out to be as important a variable as light during the day Made Simple if people tended to be in dim or dark light at night they experien reductions in their suicidal depressive anxiety and PTSD symptoms independent of how much light they were getting during the day so what this says is get as much light as one can possibly and safely get in their eyes by the way in the morning and throughout the day and then do one's very best to be in very dim or dark environments at night yeah and even goes so far as to say that if you didn't get sunlight during the day then you would be especially well off being in a very dark environment at night and it's independent so don't worry yes it's always good to get that daylight but what that paper also teaches us is that because those things can be independent you can still get some benefit even if though you've not made it good on your daylight during the day getting that Darkness at night is still going to be beneficial and I should probably resolve what some people may think of as confusing we spoke about for example suicide risk and it being highest in that in the the depths of the Darkness at night I think what's clear from that paper comes on to one of the fundamental conventional tips that we spoke about in how to optimize your sleep not just an unconventional but the conventional which was I told you we are a dark deprived society and we need Darkness at night to help keep our sleep regular so the sort of the the r in the Q qrt and I think there in that paper the inference of course is that if you're getting dark at night it's going to give you a nice sleep onset signal so that you are asleep at night in the darkness and that sleep at night in the darkness provides this beneficial you know sort of not immunization but at least pallative help to certain psychiatric conditions we're not suggesting that Darkness at night if you're awake at night however is beneficial that seems to be not beneficial um but it was such a a great paper and very elegant in how it dissected the independent nature of these things which fits very well with I think your mission in part in life both as a scientist and as an educator which is how can I curate information gather it together and give you some type of actionable boots on the ground feet in the trenches advice as to what to do it was a great paper um so thank you for bringing it up yeah I only wish I had done that study but I'm so glad that others did one thing that's been helpful to me to um encourage uh more darkness and dim light at night uh for myself in my home environment is to think about uh artificial photons coming from artificial sources as sort of um empty calories and how sunlight provided one isn't getting a burn and you know people debate uh you know how best to do that physical barrier everyone agrees on certain sunscreens are are safer than others some are very safe some are perhaps less safe in any event the point is that trying to make one's home environment dark at night is in my mind now uh akin to trying to avoid eating sugary uh you know non-nutritious calories at night as well it just lends itself to a a um just overall feelings of well-being improved sleep and of course improved daytime wakefulness and then getting sunlight even on uh through cloud cover in one's eyes early in the day and as much as as safely possible throughout the day and if one can't get sunlight getting light from Bright artificial sources um seems to be the best alternative um but I think there's this asymmetry of Light Dark requirement in the same way that I think most everyone agrees that eating during one's active hours of the day is going to be the best way to go as opposed to eating during the Ina less active hours of of the late night and um and certainly prior to sleep such a good point and since it's only you and I here and no one else watching and witnessing this I am thoroughly going to steal that phrase of junk light and help educate people because that's a perfect description it's like empty photons yeah you've all heard of junk food well there's something called Junk light and if you get you know your whole foods during the day just like you get your whole kind of encompassed light during the day that's great but then if you start binging on junk light at night it's profoundly deleterious to your sleep and everything that sleep depends on it's lovely so when people hear me in future um public spheres talking about junk light you know where it came from I will give you full credit it's a delightful statement because I I may have I may have lifted from somebody else inadvertently um we all stand on the shoulders of other Giants that's right or other Twitter accounts or something like that well I place myself firly uh underneath a pedestal but yes we all try to stand on those shoulders of giants well wherever you place yourself the the information that that uh emerges from you and that emerged today is absolutely spectacular uh you know I can't think of topics U more interesting and important then emotion regulation anxiety PTSD suicide sadly depress all all these things are are tragic challenges that but they are a real part of of Life some argue even more so nowadays perhaps even because of um the Advent of so much artificial light and smartphone use in the middle of the night who knows it's um I think it's reasonable to assume it's at least one variable today you've provided a ton of depth of understanding about why sleep and these mental health and emotional states are linked just a really clear logical framework for both the non-rem sleep and and REM sleep and how it impacts mood and and reactivity during the daytime and also some really actionable tools um to improve one's mental health and emotion emotionality excuse me um and in addition to that we'll refer people back to episodes 1 two 3 and four all of which include tools to improve every aspect of sleep and to really really nail down the QQ art T that quality do you put quality first or quantity quantity quantity I'm just making sure that Q qrt to really nail down the quantity quality regularity and timing of sleep um we can no longer consider sleep just uh 6 to eight hours or get your nine hours or get your um get your seven hours clearly there are other variables involved and you've made those variables very clear to us and you've given us the road map to plug in the best variables for ourselves so thank you Matt ever so much thank you for allowing me to both um voice and narrate the important story of sleep in mental health it's something I'm immensely passionate about both from a personal perspective but also from a professional um research perspective thank you for this opportunity well again thank you Matt and I'm very much looking forward to the sixth installment in this series on sleep which is about a topic that everybody is fascinated with which is dreaming I know you're going to tell us about dreams and what they mean perhaps what they don't mean uh we'll get into dream interpretation of all things lucid dreaming and much much more so I really look forward to that discussion in episode 6 thank you for joining me for today's episode with Dr Matthew Walker to learn more about Dr Walker's research and to learn more about his book and his social

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today is an askme anything or AMA episode but before I get to answering your most frequently asked questions I'd like to make an exciting announcement as you may know being a subscriber to the hubbin lab premium channel allows you access to the fulllength amas otherwise you can just listen to the first 15 or 20 minutes or so of these amas now you may also know that a significant portion of the proceeds from the premium channel go to fund important research on humans to benefit mental health physical health and performance when we started the premium channel we had a one- forone match with tiny foundation and that's great that means for every dollar that hubman lab premium channel contributes to research tiny Foundation matches that dollar amount and I'm very excited to announce that we now have a three to1 doll match with the Hub lab premium channel philanthropy that means for every dollar that we would contribute to research three more dollars are matched to that dollar that's a fourx amplification of the funding to benefit important studies again on human beings for mental health physical health and performance and of course as those studies are completed and published we will be sharing with you the information and how it can benefit all of you so for those of you that are already huberman lab premium channel subscribers thank you and for those of you that are considering becoming premium channel subscribers please keep in mind that 3 to1 $1 match that greatly amplifies your subscription if you'd like to subscribe to the hubman Lab

subscription model that is a one-time payment and again you can find that option at hubman lab.com premium for those of you that are already subscribers to the premium channel please go to hubman lab.com premium and download the premium subscription feed and for those of you that are not hubman Lab podcast premium subscribers you can still hear the first 20 minutes of today's episode and determine whether or not becoming a premium subscriber is for you so without further Ado let's get to answering your questions the first question is about scheduling Fitness that is how to ensure that you get sufficient number of resistance training and cardiovascular workouts per week in order to best benefit your immediate and long-term Health now I did episode of The hubin Lab podcast all about what I call a foundational Fitness protocol the foundational Fitness protocol is the one that I've followed more or less for the last 30 plus years and it certainly is not the only protocol that works out there but it's a schedule that most people can adhere to over time and that checks off the boxes for what the current research tells us we need in order to maximize our cardiovascular health to maximize our neuromuscular health and to do so with a minimal time commitment now I've already put together and I provide a link in the show note captions for the foundational Fitness protocol in the form of a PDF which spells out which workouts are done on which days what the various workouts look like including sets and Reps what options you have in terms of cardiovascular exercise I personally like to run but you could also use a rower you can use a stationary bike there's a lot of optionality inside of the foundational Fitness protocol and by the way the foundational Fitness protocol is available to all of you completely zero cost you don't even need to sign up for our neural network newsletter although you can if you like and again you can find that by following a link in the show note captions or simply going to hubman lab.com going to the menu tab scrolling down to newsletter and then you can scroll down to the foundational Fitness protocol you can view it online print it out again doesn't cost anything and there's no barrier to entry meaning you don't need to do anything to access it you can just look at it or download it or print it whatever you like the basic structure of the foundational Fitness protocol is three resistance training sessions per week and three cardiovascular training sessions per week and then one complete rest day now that might sound like a lot to some of you but in fact none of the workouts is particularly long I think the longest workout in that entire foundational Fitness protocol is about 60 minutes maybe 75 minutes if you're moving slowly through the gym because somebody else is in the way or because you're you know checking your phone a little too often as we all sometimes do that sort of thing but the basic structure is as follows for me the foundational Fitness protocol starts as day one on Monday but you could start it as day one on any day of the week frankly so day one for me is to train legs so that's quadriceps hamstrings and calves and tibialis work the front of the shin uh for those of you that uh don't know I'm a big fan of doing tibialis work then the next day is a complete day off during which you could do if you wanted something like deliberate heat or deliberate cold exposure or both but you don't have to it's just nice to have a complete day off after training legs because if you train legs properly often times it can be a bit tiring and the next day you're recovering then the following day is either a cardiovascular training session of about 20 to 30 minutes of say a jog at a slightly more rapid clip than one would consider Zone 2 cardio Zone 2 cardio is where you can carry out a conversation so a little bit faster than that or if you're not feeling like your legs are recovered enough to do that you could do the resistance training work on that day the resistance training work that falls in the middle of the week is Believe It or Not torso I know that's for some of you that are into more kind of bodybuilding type routines training your entire torso on one day might seem like a lot but really that day just involves some pushing so some overhead shoulder press type workouts or dips maybe some bench presses if that's your thing as well as some pulling so some rows and some pull-ups or chin-ups things of that sort again all tailored to you so that you're not doing anything that aggravates any pre-existing injuries and you're not going to do anything that's going to induce injuries okay so there's some pushing and pulling maybe a little bit of neck work if you need some additional neck strength that sort of thing so with legs on Monday rest on Tuesday that falls either on Wednesday or Thursday depending on how recovered your legs were then the next day which for me typically falls on a Friday is a high-intensity interval training session although really it's just about V2 Max it's about getting maximum heart rate where you're breathing really really hard and that's a very short workout the total duration of that workout is anywhere from 8 to 15 minutes total so for me it involves getting on an airdine bike those are those bikes with some resistance cuz there's a fan although you could do this on a row or basically anything where you can exert yourself to get your heart rate way way up and breathe very very hard where not going to injure your muscular skeletal system you're not going to do any soft tissue damage so you need to figure out what that is for you again the PDF explains how to select that for me it typically means getting on the airdine bike and pedaling very hard for about 20 seconds then resting 10 seconds 20 seconds hard 10 seconds rest 20 seconds hard for a total of about eight Cycles by the end of which I'm breathing extremely hard my heart rate is way way up and then I'll just shower and head about my day and then the following day which typically for me falls on a Saturday although again we're going to talk about flexibility and how to build flexibility into the schedule the Saturday workout is typically things like biceps triceps some calves maybe a bit more neck work and some abdominal work excuse me so basically small body parts that can recover pretty quickly and that workout typically takes only about 45 to 50 minutes maybe 60 minutes maximum and then the following day which is of course Sunday is a day in which I try and get outside and move as much as possible so I'll typically do the longer Sunday cardio workout as either a rock so a backpack with a weight in it by the way if you don't own a ruck sack you can just put a you know a gallon water a jug in there full and then you know drink it as you go it'll lighten as you go or you could get a weight vest if you have the resources to do that there's some great weight vests out there um a varying weight uh you can uh throw a kid on your shoulders if you got a kid that wants to be carried on your shoulders um you can do it alone listening to an Audi book listening to music or in total silence I've done all these various versions by the way you can do it with family members or with friends I'll sometimes do this with my significant other one of the great things about this long Sunday workout is that it's extremely flexible in terms of how social you are or uh whether or not you do it in isolation whether or not you do it on concrete or on dirt it's very versatile for instance if I have friends over and I want to spend time with them but I also want to get outdoors and do this workout and if they're interested in getting some outdoor movement as well we'll all just head out for a hike and if they are less fit than I am or intend to move more slowly well then I'll throw on a you know a 10 or 15 maybe even 30 lb um backpack so that I get a good workout out of it and if they're faster than I am and they're the sort of person who you know is a triathlete I've got some friends who are triathletes and they want to move at a really fast clip well then I'm not bringing any weight pack and I'm just going to ask them to you know uh wait up for me because I'm going to have a hard time keeping up but I'll have to really push myself as I go along so a lot of Versatility I don't measure my heart rate during any of these workouts by the way that's not my preferred way to do things I know other people like to measure heart rate as they go I find it's just really nice to get out once a week if possible out ofd doors and just move my body as much as possible so that I head into the week knowing that I got some really terrific outdoor time in nature while benefiting my cardiovascular system and often while socializing with important people in my life as well okay so that's the summary of the foundational Fitness protocol and one thing that I really like about it is that the total time commitment is actually not that great if you step back from it you realize there's you know a brief 12-minute workout there's an hourong weight training workout there's a long hike sure but then there's a 20-minute jog it's really not that much time when you consider the overall benefits to one's Health now one very important feature of the foundational Fitness protocol is to build some flexibility into it you know the way I described it up until now was okay Monday legs Tuesday rest Wednesday cardio Thursday torso Friday high-intensity interval training VO2 max Saturday small body parts biceps triceps calves Etc Sunday long slow distance cardio but in reality sometimes I have to travel on a Monday so I don't have the option to train legs that day in which case what I will do is either slide that workout to Sunday meaning I'm doing both long slow distance cardio and the leg workout or I'll slide it to Tuesday which is typically a rest day however sometimes I'm traveling on a Monday I don't have access to a gym to train my legs properly so what do I do do I skip leg day no I don't skip leg day typically unless I'm sick or I'm extremely sleep deprived or there's some other major stress in my life what I'll typically do is I will plan for it by training my legs on Sunday or if I don't have access to a place where I can train my legs properly on Sunday I'll just shift it to Tuesday okay now the question always becomes if I were to move that leg workout to Sunday just by way of necessity because I'm traveling on a Monday do I also do the long slow distance work that I typically do on Sunday and the answer is yes if I'm well rested so if I'm well rested and well fed I'm not feeling like I'm fighting off any kind of illness and I have the time what I'll do is I'll train my legs in the gym on Sunday and then I'll head out for I don't know an hourong walk in the neighborhood or something like that so I'm probably not training my legs hard and then going hiking hard all day although I've done that before but then I'm sure to rest completely the next day which is Monday now what if I move the leg workout to Tuesday do then I take Wednesday off completely well for me the way I train legs is typically with a lot of intensity so if I'm going to train legs typically the next day will be a complete day off no matter what but that's not always the case I think as long as you're not moving your workouts around constantly it's perfectly fine to train your legs really hard on a Tuesday because you have to because you couldn't train them on Monday and then on Wednesday rather than go out for a jog I might train torso and I might back off on the intensity a little bit and then I'll take a day off I will say that anytime I do resistance training workouts two days in a row I make sure that I take a complete day off the following third day just for sake of recovery I'm not somebody that recovers particularly well from any form of exercise I find that if I train longer than 90 minutes especially with resistance training if I crank up the intensity too much I tend to get sick or I tend to stop making progress with my resistance training sessions so the basic takeaway here is it's perfectly fine to slide a resistance training session such as legs forward a day or back a day okay so I guess back a day would be from Monday to Sunday or forward from Monday to Tuesday but then you're going to want to make some adjustments accordingly so that you don't get sick or you don't overtrain and that sort of thing now let's say that I train my legs on Tuesday then I do torso work on Wednesday and then I take the next day completely off so I take Thursday completely off well then Friday rolls around and I haven't done any cardiovascular training that week except for the walk that I did on Sunday what am I going to do do I do my V2 Max and a 30-minute jog sure that's what I would do I would combine the two cardiovascular workouts that I normally do in the middle of the week by for instance going out for a 20 or 30 minute Jog and then at the end doing some V2 Max work such that by the end of Friday I'm caught up with that cardiovascular training and then on Saturday I would just go right ahead and do those small body parts training and then on Sunday I would take a hike and that sort of thing so basically what I'm saying is the foundation Fitness protocol provides a scaffold of Ideal what you would do if you had a completely non-negotiable mindset where you said okay Monday's always legs Wednesday is always this Thursday is always that so basically what I'm describing is trying to achieve optimal right training certain things on certain days doing certain things in certain ways that wasn't meant to rhyme by the way but the reality is we all have travel we all get run down we all have lack of sleep at times we have stressful episodes in life so for me the best solution to that is to basically allow any one workout either resistance training or cardiovascular workout to slide back or forward by one day which means sometimes doubling up on workouts for a given day to make sure that I check off those boxes of getting three resistance training sessions per week and three cardiovascular training sessions per week again for the cardiovascular training sessions it's a long slow distance it's a moderate 20 a 30 minute cardiovascular training session and then it's that shorter VO2 max cardiovascular training s and sometimes doubling those up on the same day so that I make sure that by the end of the week I've achieved what I want to achieve which is I've trained my legs I've trained my torso I've trained my arms any small body parts that need additional work for balance or stabilization or aesthetic reasons you get that in but also that you get the base of the long slow distance endurance you get the slightly more intense or rather faster cardiovascular training session and then you get your heart rate up up up at least once per week doing that high-intensity interval training now as I describ this I realized that I might be taking what a few minutes ago was fairly simple in design and making it more complex why well some people feel that as soon as you introduce flexibility into a schedule you remove of course the non-negotiable aspect of it and then people get really confused are they overtraining are they under trining is it okay for instance if you can't train Monday Tuesday Wednesday to then just train Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday I think everybody is an individual everybody needs to modify their schedule Accord according to the demands on their life and their particular Fitness needs but I will say this I've found having tried many many different Fitness schedules many many different combinations of resistance training and cardiovascular training that the best solution is to find what you can do on a consistent basis and to try and do that as many days and weeks of the year as possible with the understanding that sometimes you're simply not going to be able to meet that schedule which is why you allow for this sliding back and forward of individual workouts doubling occasionally two workouts per day in order to stay on schedule but and this is very important also allowing yourself to sometimes just skip a training day yes I said it so sometimes just skip a training day you're feeling a little rundown it's late in the day you don't want to drink caffeine to train because then it's going to throw off your sleep well I'm the first person to say you know Skip torso training day and then maybe on small body parts day which for me falls on Saturday instead of just doing biceps triceps with some isolation exercises make sure you do a few chins pull-ups dips and things like that to make sure that you hit those torso muscles as well skipping a workout every once in a while is not going to Crater your entire fitness program it's simply not that said for sake of physical health and for sake of just feeling good about your commitment and follow-through to your fitness regimen you should try on average to make somewhere between 85 and 95% of your workouts and if you schedule things well and in particular if you leave your phone out of the gym uh if you're able to do that I know sometimes we need the phone to communicate with people or the potential to communicate with people if people need to get a hold of us but if you can leave your phone outside of the gym you'll be amazed at how quickly you move through these workouts likewise with your cardiovascular training sessions now one important feature of flexibility that I haven't talked about yet is flexibility within a day so for me just personally again this is my personal preference this is by no means Dogma I prefer to get my workouts done first thing in the morning so I like to get up hydrate get some electrolytes in my system get some caffeine in my system if I'm going to work out that's right I said it I do believe if you experience a crash in energy in the afternoon delaying your caffeine by about 90 minutes or so after waking could be very beneficial I know there's some controversy around that but almost everybody that tries it finds that that's the case again no obligation to do that it's just a suggestion to you know perhaps experiment with if you have an afternoon crash but for me and I think for most people if you're going to workout first thing in the morning and you like caffeine before a workout drink caffeine for first thing in the morning that's certainly what I do if I'm going to work out that day I like to have my workouts done before 9:00 a.m. and ideally before 8:30 a.m. so that I can move into my workday however there are days where that simply doesn't happen and then the question is is it okay to move a workout from its typical time like for me 7:30 a.m. or so to the afternoon and the answer is yes there's simply no reason why that's not okay it's not going to cause a significant diminishment in performance if anything that data point to the fact that for sake of physical performance and output workouts in the afternoon are probably more beneficial I don't know about that result I mean that's certainly what the data say I know for me I'm most alert and have the most amount of energy first thing in the morning and so that's when my workouts tend to be best but if I can't make a workout in the morning I'll sometimes do it in the afternoon around 2:00 or 3 p.m. making sure however that I don't consume so much caffeine before that workout that it's going to disrupt my sleep now there's another feature of training which is like sunlight like meals like socialization physical exercise provides an entrainment mechanism that is a predictive mechanism for your so-called autonomic nervous system that makes it such that at a given hour of the day that you normally train so for me around 7:30 a.m. or so you'll notice that there's going to be a peak in physical and mental energy that's right if you work out at a given time pretty consistently your autonomic nervous system will start to anticipate that timing and you'll start to feel an increase in energy around that time that is not an imagined thing it's a real thing it's a short-term entrainment as we call it this is something that I'll probably visit in a future full length episode of The hubman Lab podcast but what you'll notice is that around the time that you normally train or run or whatever you want to call it you start to feel an increase in energy and you can leverage that by going ahead and training but if you don't have the opportunity to train then I do think it's a good idea to still get that training session in at a later time during the day if you have the opportunity otherwise you may have to slide it to uh the day before or the day after as we talked about a few minutes ago or you may have to skip entirely the point here is that it's always going to be best to complete the workout if you can complete the workout safely and without disrupting your nighttime sleep I think that's really the biggest takeaway I personally am not going to compromise sleep and my overall health in order to get workouts in every once in a while I'll force myself to wake up especially early meaning I'll cash out a couple hours of sleep that I would normally get so I normally get up around I don't know 6:00 a.m. or 6:30 kind of depends on when I went to sleep but sometimes I'll give up 2 hours as sleep to get a workout in in the morning if I'm going to fly that day I will sometimes do that however if I'm very fatigued if I've been exposed to colds and flu I'm feeling kind of rundown then I won't do that I'll prioritize sleep most of the time I prioritize sleep but there are those occasions in which I'll prioritize the workout each and all of us have those options and my suggestion is to really look at things on a Case by case meaning you as an individual and on a daily basis taking into account what happened the day before how stressed you are how much sleep you're getting how much Expos exposure to colds and flu and to pay attention to how hard you've been training recently you know if you're on a family vacation and you want more time with family are you really going to compromise time with family in order to get your workouts in I think that would be probably a bad idea you know if I'm honest I think um you want to prioritize social life that's super important but then of course you don't want to prioritize social life to the detriment of your physical health so it's all a bit of give and take and what I've tried to describe here is again a recap of the foundational Fitness protocol the places where there's some flexibility you can move workouts back a day or forward a day if you like you could double up if you like especially if you're getting great rest and you're well fed Etc and you can also move the workout up or down in the day depending on how much energy you have how much sleep you've gotten and of course how you know rigid you are with yourself some people are just really rigid they are completely in the non-negotiable stance they get their workout in no matter what because they feel as if they don't then they're going to be grumpy or they're going to fall off schedule other people like me try to get the workouts done I would say anywhere from 85 to 95% of the time I get those workouts done occasionally I skip them typically because life stress travel or some sort of low-grade um illness you know a cold or a flu or something of that sort I get those pretty rarely but they do happen so that's really how I answer this question of how to build flexibility into one's fitness schedule I should also mention that I'm a big believer in periodization so I will do four-month blocks of training heavier with the weights so that's in the 3 to 5 repetition range then another 3 to four month block will follow where I'm training slightly less heavy so I'll typically be using anywhere from 5 to 8 repetition range and then for the next four month block I'll be using somewhere between 8 and 15 repetition range every once in a while I'll mix it up so that you know if I've been training heavy a lot I might do a lighter workout or if I've been training lighter I might do a heavy workout again not super rigid I personally find that by being strict and rigid about the scheduling about the Reps and the sets etc for most of the time meaning about 85 to 95% of workouts and across the year that things just work out great you'll make constant progress without having to drive yourself and everybody else crazy with uh extreme rigidity and compulsivity around training and then of course you can enjoy those days off you can enjoy the flexibility in your schedule because yes physical fitness is wonderful but unless you're an athlete especially a professional athlete really physical fitness is about being able to lean into other aspects of life with more Vigor at least that's what it's about for me and I think that's what it's about for most people thank you for joining for the beginning of this ask me anything episode to hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these ask me anything sessions plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the huberman Lab podcast standard Channel and premium tools not released anywhere else please go to hubman lab.com premium just to remind you why we launch the hubman Lab podcast premium channel it's really twofold first of all it's to raise support for the standard hubman Lab podcast Channel which of course will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length we are not going to change the format or anything about the standard hubman Lab podcast and to fund research in particular research done on human beings so not animal models but on human beings which I think we all agree as a species that we are most interested in and we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health physical health and performance and those protocols will be distributed through all channels not just the premium channel but through all channels hubman Lab podcast and other media channels so the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place if you'd like to sign up for the hum lab premium

Title: Protocols to Strengthen & Pain Proof Your Back
Published: 2024-04-29 12:00:19 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I explain how to strengthen and build a stable, pain-free back and how to reduce or eliminate existing back pain. I explain the anatomy and physiology of the spinal cord and vertebrae, intervertebral disks and nerve pathways, and the abdominal and back muscles that together can be leveraged to stabilize the back. 

Then, I describe protocols: “McGill’s Big 3” exercises, a highly effective psoas stretch, abdominal stabilization, breathing techniques, and protocols to reinforce essential supports for the back, including the neck, pelvis, feet and toes. 

I also explain how you can reduce and potentially eliminate back pain and sciatica using a specific type of bar hang, “cobra push-ups,” medial-glute strengthening exercises and more. 

Back pain greatly impedes one’s ability to enjoy daily activities; this episode provides zero-cost, minimal time-investment protocols to improve your back strength and stability and allow you to move through life pain-free and with ease and mobility.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today we are discussing how to build a strong pain-free back having a strong pain-free back has numerous advantages not the least of which is you're not in pain as well as the fact that you can carry out your daily activities any exercise or Sports you might play interaction with family members like picking up a kid leaning down to get things out of a cupboard or reaching up to get things out of a cabinet without any pain and back pain is one of those things that even if minor and certainly if severe severely impedes our ability to do most everything even to just sit still or lay still and one of the things about pain in particular back and neck pain is that it also has an effect on our emotional self it makes us more irritable it makes any activity even the mundane activities that much more distressing to carry out so during today's discussion we will talk about how to amarate pain however pain as a general topic was already covered on this podcast with an expert guest Dr Shawn Mackey who's a medical doctor at Stanford he's actually the director of our pain clinic and on that episode which we provide a link to in the show note captions he talks about the various ways to address pain everything from pain medication to epidurals to electrical stimulation and importantly the biopsychosocial model of pain whereby our thoughts and our perceptions about pain actually influence the severity and the duration of that pain so if you're interested in pain and the treatment of pain per se I highly recommend that episode today we will certainly talk about ways to deal with back pain ways to reduce it and perhaps even eliminate it alt together but we are also going to talk a lot about how to pain proof your back and how to build a really strong back not just for pulling things because the back muscles are involved in pulling things but also just for generating a really strong stable core strong spinal Erectors making sure that your pelvis and your spine are interacting correctly that your shoulders neck and Spine and pelvis and even your lower Limbs and feet are working together in the proper manner to make sure that you have the strongest and most pain-free back possible so what I'm going to do is first I'm going to describe a bit of back anatomy and physiology I'm going to talk about the neuromuscular components as well as the spinal and disc components I promise even if you don't have a background in biology I'm going to make this all very accessible to any and all of you and then I'm going to go into the 10 or 12 specific things in particular six things that take very little time that require no equipment no purchase of anything whatsoever and involve a very minimal time investment that will allow you to build a really strong pain-free back what's covered are protocols from three of the world's for foremost experts in back pain but also back strengthening and building resilience into the back so they include a medical doctor expert in back strengthening and Rehabilitation a PhD researcher who has spent decades researching The Spine and ways to strengthen the core and Spine and a world-class PhD physical therapist who is expert not just in the spine but in fact in the movement Rehabilitation and strengthening of the entire body they are the MD Dr Shawn Miller the PHD Dr Stuart Mcgill and also the PHD Dr Kelly starett I provide links to them and resources that they provide in the show note captions and indeed I plan to host all three of them separately on the huberman Lab podcast as expert guests in the not too distant future before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the General Public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is arero press arero press is like a French press but a French press that always bruis the perfect cup of coffee meaning no bitterness and excellent taste Aero press achieves this because it uses a very short contact time between the hot water and the coffee and that short contact time also means that you can brew an excellent cup of coffee very quickly the whole thing takes only about 3 minutes I started using an aero press over 10 years ago and I learned about it from a guy named Alan Adler who's a former Stanford engineer engineer who's also an inventor he developed things like the aobi Frisbee in any event I'm a big fan of Adler inventions and when I heard he developed a coffee maker beero press I tried it and I found that indeed it makes the best possible tasting cup of coffee it's also extremely small and portable so I started using it in the laboratory when I travel on the road and also at home and I'm not alone in my love of the Aeropress coffee maker with over 55,000 fstar reviews Aeropress is the best reviewed coffee press in the world if you'd like to try Aero press you can go to Aero press.com huberman to get 20% off Aeropress currently ships in the USA Canada and to over 60 other countries around the world again that's Aero press.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by ju ju makes medical grade red light therapy devices now if there's one thing I've consistently emphasized on this podcast is the incredible role that light can have on our biology and of course I'm always telling people that they should get sunlight in their eyes as soon as possible after waking on as many many days of their life as possible for sake of setting circadian rhythm daytime mood focus and alertness and improv sleep now in addition to sunlight red light and nearin red light has been shown to have positive effects on improving numerous aspects of Cellar and organ Health including faster Muscle Recovery improved skin health and wound healing even improvements in acne or that is removal of acne reducing pain and inflammation improving mitochondrial function and even improving Vision itself what sets you apart and why it's my preferred red light therapy device is that it has clinically proven wavelengths meaning it uses specific wavelengths of red light and near infrared light in combination that trigger the optimal seller adaptations personally I use the ju handheld light both at home and when I travel it's only about the size of a sandwich it's very convenient to use I also have a ju whole body panel and I use that about three or four times a week if you would like to try ju you can go to jv.com huberman ju is offering an exclusive discount to all huberman lab listeners with up to $400 off select ju products again that's ju jv.com huberman to get $400 off select ju products today's episode is also brought To Us by waking up waking up is a meditation app that offers hundreds of guided meditations mindfulness trainings yoga needer sessions and more I started meditating over three decades ago and what I found in the ensuing years is that sometimes it was very easy for me to do my daily medic meditation practice I was just really diligent but then as things would get more stressful which of course is exactly when I should have been meditating more my meditation practice would fall off with waking up they make it very easy to find and consistently use a given meditation practice it has very convenient reminders and they come in different durations so even if you just have one minute or five minutes to meditate you can still get your meditation in which research shows is still highly beneficial in addition to the many different meditations on the waking up app they also have Yoga Nidra sessions which are a form of non-sleep deep rest that I personally find is extremely valuable for restoring mental and physical Vigor I tend to do a yoga Nedra lasting anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes at least once a day and if I ever wake up in the middle of the night and I need to fall back asleep I also find yoga NRA to be extremely useful if you'd like to try the waking up app you can go to waking up.com huberman to try a free 30-day trial again that's waking up.com huberman okay let's talk about the back the back for many people simply means the spine the Bony stuff that runs down your middle now of course your spine doesn't just run down your middle you've got your cervical spine up near your neck don't ever forget that your neck is the upper part of your spine you've got the thoracic spine which is essentially through you know in insects we think of the thorax remember that from biology class in middle school or high school but through your region here you know basically down from the neck through the chest and then you've got your lumbar spine which is the part right below that and then you have the sacral spine which is the area of the spine that is in the pelvic region and then of course there's the bottom region of that which is called the coxic spine which is the very lowest part of the sacral region of the spine now of course that's the Bony stuff and if you've ever seen a spine on a you know a skeleton of any kind or a drawing of a skeleton you know that it's a bunch of segments it's a bunch of bony segments it's important to understand that the back is made up not just of bony stuff but it's got stuff in between which are the discs the discs are the soft tissue that sit between the vertebrae right the vertebrae of the bones and those discs have some durability to them they're they're not easily squished but they can be squished that is they can move they're a soft tissue that allows for mobility of the Bony stuff so you've got basically bone disc bone disc bone disc bone dis and it's those discs that allow for movement of the spine from side to side and it actually allows for some compression along the length of the spine as well what sometimes today I'll refer to as vertical compression but actually vertical isn't the correct anatomical term so in anatomical terms we talk about anterior posterior we talk about rostral coddle which is just different language for anterior posterior I'm going to try and avoid using fancy nomenclature as much as possible but the point here is that those discs allow for movement of the vertebrae but keep in mind that the vertebrae and the discs have a whole down the middle they look like donuts basically they're not perfectly round like donuts but for the time being just think of them as Donuts right some are bony donuts and others have more pliability to them but there's a hole down their middle why well within that hole is a long snake like piece of the nervous system called the spinal cord which is the neural stuff the neurons now within the spinal cord it's not just neurons nerve cells okay neurons means nerve cells it's also glea which are another cell type that provides yes support to the neurons but also do some really important things on their own like clearing out of metabolic waste they actually regulate communication between neurons if you've ever heard that the Gia are just glue and that's actually the Latin translation of Gia glue it implies that they're not doing much actively that they're just sort of a passive participant keeping things together the glea are really doing important things as well but keep in mind that the spinal cord is this long snake like process of the nervous system that extends down through the vertebrae and down through the discs or if you prefer you can think about the long snake like process of the spinal cord and then around it all along its length you have bony vertebrae disc bony vertebrae disc bony vertebrae disc going all the way from the neck region down to that coxic region within the pelvis now the thing about neural tissue is it's very soft it's very fragile and one of the reasons we have vertebrae is to give the spinal cord some rigidity and protection from damage and that's really important because the spinal cord this long tube of neural tissue that sits inside of the vertebrae and the discs it's central nervous system tissue CNS tissue and as CNS tissue it does not regenerate after injury okay maybe a tiny bit in certain conditions and in very young people but if the spinal cord is damaged typically there's a lot of scar tissue that forms but there is no renewal of the neurons that are damaged so it's very important that the spinal cord be protected which is one of the reasons why it is encased by those vertebrae and the discs now the other thing to understand is that the spinal cord is indeed a snake-like extension out the back of the brain so the brain and spinal cord make up what we call the central nervous system the CNS we just talked about that a moment ago but now I want you to think about the brain your brain of course is encapsulated within the skull the cranial Vault there are only two pieces of your brain that reside outside of the cranial Vault they are your neural retinas that line the back of your eyes I know many of you have heard me say this before but it's so cool that I can't help but share it again and again which is that you have two pieces of your brain literally your central nervous system that were extruded out from the cranial Vault during development while you were in utero this happens in the first trimester when you were in embryo that line the back of your eyes like a pie crust and those Linings of the back of your eye like a pie crust are made up of three layers of neurons and a bunch of GAA and they are your neural retinas they are two pieces of brain that literally look out into the world and are activated by what by light by sunlight by edges and objects by the photons in the outside world and that's what gives rise to Vision so starting at the front of your head and working down through the spinal cord we can do this very quickly to give you a complete picture you've got your neural retinas that line the back of your eyes they are central nervous system they are brain they communicate with the rest of your brain through the optic nerves then you got your brain you got the brain parts that respond to hearing the brain parts that allow you to think imagine learn remember Etc and then at the back of the brain you have the brain stem and then extending out from the brain stem you have the spinal cord this tube like neural structure that extends down through the vertebrae down through the discs all the way to your pelvic region now why am I telling you all this Neuroscience if we're talking about strengthening the back why am I talking about the spinal cord why am talking about neurons in the brain well just as your brain has the cranial Vault your skull to protect it your spinal cord has the vertebrae to protect it and the discs to protect it but the discs allow for some movement of the spinal cord in fact quite a bit of movement if you just lean forward in your chair you lean back arch your back or you twist to the side your spinal cord is actually twisting in that way okay this would be Ain to your brain actually moving within the skull it can move a little bit but it doesn't move nearly as much as your spinal cord does so your back has of course many functions it's there to stabilize your body it's there to provide stiffness in order to be able to move your limbs in very Dynamic ways we're going to talk about back and core stiffness as such a key feature of having a strong back when you hear the word stiffness you probably think well that can't be good I don't want a stiff back ah but you actually want to be able to generate rigidity within your core and spine in order to move your limbs to throw a ball or to do a martial arts Punch or to even dance gracefully or even just move up some stairs without falling so basically when we talk about the brain and spinal cord as extending down through the vertebrae and through the discs we're doing that to set up the other piece of this whole story which is that the neurons that reside in the spinal cord in particular what we call the ventral spinal cord which if we're going to imagine this in kind of more real world terms they're sitting in the part of the spinal cord it's kind of on your front Okay that that's facing uh the front of the world there are neurons there called motor neurons neur the motor neurons themselves what we call the cell bodies reside in the spinal cord in the so-call ventral Horn of the spinal cord you can look this up if you like although you don't need to know that and they extend little wires that we call axons out to the muscles and through the release of neurotransmitters they allow our muscles to move our flexors to flex like our bicep our extensors to extend like our tricep could think quadricep hamstring calf abdominal muscles all the movement of those muscles is controlled by neurons that reside within the spine cord some of the movements that we generate are unconscious movements especially movements that are required for breathing although you can consciously take care of your breathing as well right you can breathe unconsciously you're always doing that even in sleep or you can take conscious control of your breathing you can generate limb movements consciously or you can generate limb movements unconsciously typically once you know how to walk and you get up and you walk across the room you're not thinking right foot Left Foot Right Foot left foot all of that's handled by motor neurons and what are called Central pattern generators in the spinal cord and to some extent the brain stem but the commands for specific deliberate movements that you're thinking about especially when you're trying to learn a movement or you're trying to be very deliberate in a movement those come from what are called upper motor neurons in the brain they communicate with lower motor neurons which then communicate with the muscles okay so that's one neural outflow pathway from spinal cord out to muscles some of it's conscious some of it's unconscious and then there are the neural Pathways from skin from the tendons and insert of the muscles onto bone within the muscles that register how much stretch are on our muscles and those are the soall sensory inputs that come into the dorsal part of the spinal cord the part that is facing toward our back and that sensory information tells our spinal cord which then informs our brain whether or not our limbs are extended too far and about to snap or whether or not a muscle is loaded too heavy and is about to be pulled off the bone and in that case the brain and spinal cord have these magnificent mechanisms to shut down the neurons so that you know we drop the load so that we don't overwhelm the muscle and rip it off the bone or we don't stretch our limbs too far now keep in mind that the neurons within the spinal cord that communicate with muscles or the neurons that innervate as we call it the skin or the tendons or different parts of the body and go into the spinal cord those little wires those axons literally leave the spinal cord and they go out into What's called the peripheral nervous system now a big source of pain in back pain is when those nerve Roots as they're called they're little bundles okay bundles of nerves are sometimes called fices sometimes called nerve Roots the nomenclature kind of depends on where you are in the nervous system but I'll call them nerve roots or bundles of nerves those bundles of nerves are sometimes impinged on they're physically pressed on by say a bulging what's also called a herniated disc the discs can sometimes bulge out from the side of the spine a little bit too much okay Maybe by compression from the overlying vertebrae maybe from some inflammation we'll talk about the various sources today and often times the source of back pain or neck pain or even pain in the pelvic region is because of a compression of the nerve roots that are going into and out of the spine okay so when we talk today about back pain and when we talk today about building a strong back we need to focus on two major themes one is the extent to which those nerve roots are free and clear of any physical pressure from say Hern ated discs from compressed vertebrae from inflammation in those regions maybe all three and what we're really trying to do when we talk about relieving back pain often is creating space creating room for those nerve roots to travel in and out of the spine for those messages to come in from the periphery the skin the tendons the muscles Etc up into the brain because the brain needs that information to know where our limbs are still needs to keep us safe as well as the nerve Pathways traveling out of the spine that control our musculature for deliberate movements unconscious movements and so on and so much of what you'll hear about today when thinking about how to build a really strong pain-free back is about creating the kind of stability around the spine so that we can engage in the different limb movements that we need to but to do so in a way that doesn't create compression of those nerve Pathways now with all that said it's really important to also understand that not all of back pain is neural in nature now technically all pain is neural in the sense that it's a perception okay if you listen to the episode with Dr Shawn Macky which includes a deep description of the biopsychosocial model of pain it will tell you or I'll just tell you now that indeed pain involves a lot of different things it involves psychology it involves prediction it involves history it involves inflammation it involves a lot of things and yes ultimately it's neural it is the firing of nerves that create the perception of pain and your perception of pain is also the firing of neurons in your brain and spinal cord however what you'll also learn today is that there are many things that you can do including creating stability of your feet your toes believe it or not the position of your pelvis your neck your chin all these things as well as the spinal erector muscles in your lower back as well as your abdominal region your so-called core all of those things combine to create a millu for the spine and back to function at its best so if now you're getting overwhelmed you're thinking my goodness we have to learn about the entire body's physiology and anatomy in order to understand back pain and strengthening to some extent that's true but really all we've said so far and all you need to know or keep in mind that is is we have the vertebrae the Bony segments that surround the spinal cord in between those we have the discs the soft tissue that also have a hole through them the spinal cord travels through that so that the vertebrae can move so that we have some pliability and Mobility our spine forward flexion so your chin closer to your belly extension your chin back and away from your belly sort of arching of the lower back you can twist to side to side to some extent you have all that stuff and through the middle is the spinal cord and the brain and then you have sensory information going into the spinal cord from the body from the muscles from the skin and then you have motor commands going out the bottom of the spinal cord so literally traveling out past those vertebrae and discs out to the muscles to control those muscles for involuntary and voluntary movement if you can understand that and you can Envision it just a little bit even just a little bit you're going to be able to think about all of the various protocols that we talk about next in the most functional way meaning as you learn about and hopefully incorporate the various protocols for strengthening and pain proofing your back that you'll occasionally think back to okay it's my spinal cord that I'm bending in my lower back region I'm allowing the discs to kind of move forward and they likely are kind of bulging out a little bit they're not necessarily herniating let's hope not but they're bulging a little bit in that direction then back in the other direction and if you happen to have herniated that is bulging discs which many people do in fact I've had that I've got a sort of an L3 a kind of Lumbar 34 bulge that got activated a few years ago I'll tell you what allowed me to very quickly fix that permanently with no medication no surgery whatsoever and it was extremely debilitating there's some simple movements that one can do if done in the proper direction and in the proper way that can allow you to push that bulged that herni disc back under or I should say closer to the spinal cord okay moving it from the kind of bulging out from between the vertebrae to closer again toward the center point of the spine by doing that one can take pressure off of the nerve roots that are traveling out to the muscles and in from the skin and other sensory information coming into the spinal cord and allow yourself relief from back pain and then by building up stability in the abdominal region the lower back region you can create a nice firm core that will allow you to protect all of that with plenty of space so the nerve roots are not impinged and then of course by focusing on some of the stabilizers that exist really distal which means far from all of that further from all of that such as the feet literally how you position your feet the ability to spread your toes believe or not as a way to provide support for your back not just when doing exercise but also at rest there are some things you can do about neck positioning strengthening of the front of the neck strengthening of various muscles again that involves no equipment whatsoever that allows you to have a pain-free strong back both at rest and during movements of different kind different Dynamic sport movements like tennis or golf Etc as well as if you're into it resistance training if you're putting yourself under heavy loads all of that painfree and moving through life with a tremendous amount of mobility and versatility now before we get into the specific protocols and exercises for strengthening and pain proofing your back it's worth mentioning something that really was first told to me by Dr Stuart McGill again he's going to be a guest on this podcast Dr Stuart Mill is a world expert in spine physiology and anatomy and he's worked with a lot of athletes but his work is not specific to athletes it's really for the everyday person as well and in discussions with Stu he raises some really important points first of all if you have back pain you need a proper assessment and diagnosis it's really possible for me in this format to try and diagnose your back pain or for you to try and diagnose your back pain that would just be irresponsible of both of us there's just so many things that are specific to each circumstance for instance some people get back pain or neck pain or both because of overuse of certain motor patterns maybe they are Avid golf players and they're always swinging a certain way with one foot forward that's typically the way it works and they built up some strength in certain Pathways both muscular strength and neural strength but they have a weakness in the opposite side muscles and nerves and they need to rehabilitate those in order to eliminate the back pain other people have an injury right they have a spinal compression injury they don't just have a herni disc they have a ruptured disc often time ruptured discs need surgery I don't want to give the impression that all back pain can be resolved without surgery there are cases where surgery is necessary okay so it's very important that if you have severe back pain or persistent back pain and you're not able to alleviate it with non-surgical methods that you talk to a back expert perhaps even a surgeon there are cases for epidurals for painkillers for you know different types of rehabilitative approaches but Dr Stu Mill has also pointed out that there are a number of things that any and all of us can do by just self assessing that I think are appropriate for today's discussion that relate to whether or not we are likely to have a thick spine or a thin spine okay this isn't a psychological feature at least not to my knowledge but if you look at different body types you know what in the old days used to be called the Ecto endo and momor body types okay this nomenclature isn't used quite as much anymore but just to kind of return to it the ectomorphic body phenotype is one in which people are typically kind of light Bon meaning thinner wrists smaller knees smaller ankles so not really thick bones and thick wrists so as the ectomorph these are people that tend to be pretty thin sometimes referred to as people that have you know very low body fat less muscle mass although that's not always the case just think lighter thinner skeleton versus myomorph which tend to be people with kind of thicker wrists thicker knee joints have a thicker overall and then endomorph which was at the time used to describe people that are carrying more body weight in the form of body fat I don't know how often the endomorphin type um language is used anymore but what Dr stmill has pointed out is that people in general tend to be more ectomorphic or myomorph they tend to be more thick through the Torso or thin through the tors so they tend to have thinner wrist or smaller wrists as compared to their age matched sex matched counterparts okay but in general so these are generalizations people who have thicker wrists generally are going to have thicker spinal segments okay in terms of the circumference of the spinal segments and discs whereas people with smaller wrists smaller joints smaller ankles are going to have thinner spine so thinner vertebrae thinner discs between them and so on now neither is good or bad they are just different and they create a situation where people have different needs in order to build a strong pain-free spine so for instance people who have thick spinal segments so these are people who tend to be more Barrel chested thick through the Torso maybe thicker wrists and ankles and knees have thicker spinal segments and therefore may not need quite as much buildup of the musculature around their spine in order to handle vertical loads okay compression along the spinal length because they have those big thick spinal segments and discs it's not to say that they don't need to do any spinal strengthening they do but they are generally going to be very stable along the I'm calling it the vertical axis but along the length of the spine those people perhaps not surprisingly are not going to be as Mobile in terms of the twisting and bending of the spine meaning spine Mobility along the different axes apart from that vertical axis that I was referring to along the length of the spine but twisting and bending is going to be harder for them now at the opposite extreme you're going to have people with smaller RIS smaller ankles smaller knees and they in general are going to have a thinner spine meaning vertebrae and discs that are smaller in circumference and they are not going to have the capacity to sustain as much vertical compression along the length of the spine as somebody with thick spinal segments but they are going to be more quote unquote bendy if you will now that doesn't always mean more flexibility what I'm referring to here is a capacity or a potential for the ability to generate movements in which the spine is twisting from side to side with more ease than would be the powerlifter so imagine at the extremes the thick torso and spine of the powerlifter of the shot putter somebody like that versus the spine of say the yoga teacher the dancer they have these smaller wrists smaller pelvis smaller knees Etc but they're going to have more ability to twist themselves their spine so imagine just kind of like bending over to the side a little bit while looking up the spine is going to do that very easy easily as compared to the person with a thicker torso in spine these two distinctions and here I'm really making them polarized distinctions and in reality there's a whole distribution of thick spine very thick spine moderately thick spine thin spine ultra thin spine and so on but at these two extremes you can start to imagine that each of those spines each of those backs probably has different requirements in order to make it strong and pain prooof depending on the activities that those people are engaged in now of course a thin spine person can decide to powerlift that can be very good for them and indeed one of the things that somebody with a thin spine should do according to Dr Stu Mill and I'll reiterate this several times today is build up the musculature around the spine so that they can stabilize that otherwise bendy spine along both the vertical and side to side axis so they don't injure it they want to make it strong as well as the person with the thick spine who can tolerate heavy loads around one axis but maybe needs to generate more mobility of that spine so that they don't go reaching for glass up in the cupboard and all of a sudden they have compression of a nerve root coming out the spine because they just Twisted it to the side by about 5 to 7° both groups have specific needs meaning specific protocols that they can emphasize to a greater or lesser degree in order to strengthen and pain prooof their spine so while we can't do an assessment of spinal pain and your exact needs for your particular body type in this kind of format through the tunnel of the internet you can take a look at yourself or just think about yourself and think oh do I tend to have thicker wrist knees elbows Etc am I more of a you know kind of thick torso person or do I tend to be someone who's more Li who's more you know small wristed somebody who can move from side to side with a lot of ease but probably can't handle as much what I was calling vertical load along the length of the spine and some people have a kind of mixed phenotype not purely Ecto not purely myomorph I can say that about myself I have fairly long limbs in fact I have like almost sort of like Gibbon arms I have this kind of really long reach so more kind of um ectomorphic um arms and at the same time I have a short torso and I am fairly thick through the circumference of my torso I've always been like that even before I started doing any kind of resistance training my legs are somewhere in between okay so I don't have small knees or small ankles they're kind of moderate in that way my wrists and my arms probably a bit more ectomorphic not strong ectomorphic phenotype but then my torso is a short torso and it's kind of thick through the circumference that's just the way that my genetics landed me into the world you have genetics that landed you into the world in a particular way you can take a look at these kind of external phenotypes about joint size and kind to do an assessment just thinking about it and by doing that you'll be able to know which protocols which we're about to talk about you may want to emphasize or deemphasize in order to best strengthen and pain prooof your back so a good analogy that Dr Stuart McGill offers when thinking about this thin spine versus thick spine thing is if you think about a willow tree which has essentially a a thin trunk and thin branches relative to say an oak tree or redwood tree the willow tree trunk and branches can bend to quite a considerable degree without breaking so it's just very bendy from side to side but they are thin and they can't sustain a lot of vertical pressure a lot of loads from top to bottom or else they'll simply collapse they might not snap to the point of breaking but they will definitely Bend to the point of not being able to bend back as opposed to the trunk and branches of a full-grown oak tree or redwood tree which are very thick and very strong and can sustain a lot of loads from top to bottom along this vertical axis but if they Bend even just a tad too far from one side to the next they're going to snap and essentially break off so while that analogy isn't a perfect one to explain the situation with thin spines versus thick spines I think it gives you a mental image of the general situation for which some people who have the more Willow like spine probably need to build more musculature around the spine in order to stabilize it but probably don't have to do quite as much work in order to generate more side to side flexibility as opposed to people who have a thicker spine who probably don't need to do quite as much work to develop the musculature of the spinal Erectors of the abdominals it's not to say they don't need to develop those at all they do but that they don't need to do quite as much work to build the musculature around the spine in order to stabilize it for vertical loads but they perhaps want to do more work aimed at generating more flexibility in these planes of motion from side to side and at different angles you know relative to the vertical axis and again most people don't fall at either extreme of Willow like or Redwood like most people are going to fall somewhere in the middle and as I mentioned before many of us including myself have a sort of combination of more Thin musculature and Thick musculature depending where in the body you look I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 by now most of you have heard me tell my story about how I've been taking ag1 once or twice a day every day since 2012 and indeed that's true I started taking ag1 and I still take ag1 once or twice a day because it gives me vitamins and minerals that I might not be getting enough of from Whole Foods that I eat as well as adaptogens and micronutrients those adaptogens and micronutrients are really critical because even though I strive to eat most of my foods from unprocessed or minimally processed Whole Foods it's often hard to do so especially when I'm traveling and especially when I'm busy so by drinking a packet of ag1 in the morning and often times also again in the afternoon or evening I'm ensuring that I'm getting everything I need I'm covering all of my foundational nutritional needs and I like so many other people that take ag1 regularly just report feeling better and that shouldn't be surprising because it supports gut health and of course gut health supports immune system health and brain health and it's supporting a ton of different cellular and organ processes that all interact with one another so while certain supplements are really directed towards one specific outcome like sleeping better or being more alert ag1 really is foundational nutritional support it's really designed to support all of the systems of your brain and body that relate to mental health and physical health if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs with your order plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com SL huberman so now let's discuss the protocols that allow you to strengthen your back the first three of these Protocols are the so-called McGill's big three named after Dr Stuart McGill who again has done a tremendous amount of work in the research and practical realm and has developed a number of different protocols for strengthening and depainting the spine but has distilled down three specific protocols that everyone I spoke to in the PT community in the MD Community for those that specialize on spine and in the sports Community as well as people who don't play sports but are simply interested in having a healthy spine for sake of daily Mobility all agree are extremely useful for everybody to carry out now the one caveat is that Stu Mill himself has told me that he doesn't want the big three to be viewed as the Beall end all of back strengthening and Pain Relief by no means is it exhaustive to do just the big three so I'm also going to include a bunch of other protocol calls that are gleaned from other practitioners and that Dr McGill often offers himself in his books and I'll certainly put links in the show note captions to his books and again he'll be a guest on this podcast but for sake of clarity and simplicity The Big Three are as follows the first is called the curl-up the curl-up is in many ways a replacement for the situp most people are familiar with ab crunches and sit-ups where you lie down typically people will bend their knees although not always they'll often put their hands behind their head or on their chest and then they'll essentially sit up to contract the abdominals turns out that if you have back pain and even if you don't that is probably the least efficient and perhaps even the worst thing that you can do for your back pain and if you think about the discs that sit between those vertebrae remember those soft tissue discs that allow for some mobility of the spine well if you Happ have a disc that's bulging even slightly that is it's herniating it's getting pushed out from between the vertebrae and it's impinging on a nerve and there's some pain if you are crunching you can imagine that's essentially bringing the vertebrae together in the front of that sandwich that is vertebra disc vertebrae and what it's going to do is it's going to have that disc bulge out even further it's going to herniate even further and impinge on those nerves even further so what's required in a situation where you want to strengthen the back or try and eliminate or reduce pain of the back is a way in which you can strengthen the abdominals because the abdominals and the abdominal wall is very important for stabilizing the spine and you want a stable spine that's a very important point but you want to do it in a way where you're not adding to the herniation of the disc in any way so the curl up is an excellent exercise for people who have back pain and who don't have back pain to strengthen the abdominal wall and it's done as follows you lie down you put one knee up meaning one leg is bent the other leg is extended you put your hand both hands below the lower portion of your back so in the arch of your back and you actually want to maintain the arch of your back that's one of the reasons your hands are there the head is in a neutral position okay so your chin isn't tucked toward your chest the chin is in a neutral position and this is important your tongue is on the roof of your mouth this is something I talked a little bit about in my description of neck exercises in a previous video we're going to get back to this but tongue on the roof of the mouth often puts the head into a safe default position it also allows for breathing in particular nasal breathing to be done very easily so you got your tongue on the roof of your mouth the mouth is typically closed and then what you do is you raise your elbows off the ground and then while maintaining that small of the back you're going to just raise your upper chest you're going to lead with the upper chest not with the chin and head although of course the head will follow you're going to raise the upper chest meaning raise the upper torso so the head's going to move forward and you're going to Exhale and contract the abdominals for anywhere from 8 to 10 seconds okay so you get a very strong contraction of the abdominals but you're not doing a full situp you're only coming up maybe about I don't know somewhere between 5 to 10° so your back is coming up the head is coming up and the chin is not moving towards the chest it's staying in a neutral position you're going to repeat that so meaning you're going to go up contract for 8 to 10 seconds you're going to contract the abdominal walls if you want to Exhale you can usually get a stronger contraction of the abdominal walls and then you're going to go back down and relax on the floor maybe rest 10 to 30 seconds maybe a minute and then repeat okay so that's the basic movement and then you would switch to the other side meaning you're then going to extend the leg that was bent you're going to bend the other leg and you're going to repeat in terms of sets and repetitions typically the best way to do this is to do anywhere from three to five sets starting with 10-second contractions done five times for the first set so it' be 10sec hold then relax 10-c hold then relax doing that five times maybe four times but five would be ideal that would be one set and then on the next set you're going to do four repetitions meaning four 10-second holds with rest in between and then on the next one three on the next one two and the next one one 10c hold or so these are just rough guidelines you certainly don't have to do quite as long holds as those if you can't do those you don't have to do all of those sets if you find you're fatiguing one of the advantages however of doing these brief 10-second holds and really focusing on the contraction of the abdominals hard or as hard as you can and then releasing is that as opposed to doing a long hold just trying to hold as long as you can and building a lot of endurance in the abdominals when you repeatedly contract a neuromuscular connection you build the pathways you basically allow the pathways that can engage those strong muscular contractions to a greater degree than if you're trying to just statically hold that particular position for a very very long time like 30 seconds or 60 seconds or longer okay now there are a bunch of different variations of the curl up you can do the curl up with the extended leg elevated slightly to make it harder you can do the curl up with your elbows positioned closer to the ceiling so you're you're really lifting your elbows and arms far off the the ground as opposed to having them just hovering right above the ground there a bunch of different variations of these we include links to a few short videos in the show note caption so you can see the different variations of the curl up has me doing these on the floor in my uh typical street clothes so you don't need to get into workout gear to do these and I should mention that the curl up is something that you can do every day if it occurs to you and if you have the time it's something that you would certainly benefit from doing every day but it's also something that even if you do once or twice a week for for even just a couple of sets you're going to see some benefit in terms of strengthening your back and probably relieving some pain of your back as well the other terrific thing about the curl-up is if you have back pain and doing the curl-up doesn't aggravate it you are most certainly doing things to strengthen the musculature around the back that's going to help you avoid more back pain as you work through the different rehabilitative practices that hopefully you're doing with a PT or with a excellent MD who specializes in back pain relief as the pain dissipates you're going to be building up the musculature of the abdominals that's going to then further protect your spine especially if you're one of those people that has a thinner spine that needs more muscular support around the spine in order to support it just as a final note about the curup two of the most common errors that people make when doing the curl up is to make it more like a situp and generate a chin to chest movement first and let the chest follow you really want the chest to lead and keep the head in a neutral position tongue on the roof of your mouth try and breathe through your nose and if you find that you can't do the big exhale as you bring it up to the top don't worry about it it's perfectly fine to hold your breath as you come up and then just maybe release a little bit of air to enhance the uh intensity of that abdominal contraction the second exercise in the mill big three is the side plank I confess and I don't know why I hate doing side planks I don't know why I hate doing side planks I just hate doing side planks which tells me I should do side planks so I've started doing some side planks recently after talking to Dr Mill I'm fortunate that right now I don't have back pain I haven't for a while I'll talk about how I alleviated my back pain but I spend a lot of time as a 48-year-old thinking about having a strong spine being able to jump off things and land with confidence all the sorts of things that set one up for both healthspan and lifespan as has been taught to us by Dr Peter AA some of you may know Dr Peter AA because he's been a guest on this podcast he wrote The Incredible Book outlive and he talks about how having a strong spine having the ability to break Falls by virtue of training your ability to jump down things and step down things with confidence is essential to offset the aging process so I've decided I'm going to do side planks I'm going to embrace the uh spine strengthening exercises that Stu Mill has put forward as the big three and that includes side planks so how do you do side planks well most people think that a side plank is just getting on your side essentially on the floor then putting one arm down and stacking your feet on the other side and trying to make yourself as stiff as a plank as you possibly can and while that is C only one way to do it most people find that they are going to get the most in terms of strengthening their spine and preventing back pain and maybe even alleviating back pain if they build up through a set of incremental steps making sure that the form on each of the steps is absolutely perfect so the way to really start doing side planks and if you think you can already do side planks to assess whether or not you're doing them properly is to start with knees slightly bent so maybe at about a 30 or 40° angle so you're on your side your knees are bent the feet are stacked you're of course going to push one arm down although many people find that putting their hand in a fist as opposed to a flat hand is going to be best I don't know if U most of you are aware of this but anytime that we generate a fist in either hand it sets in motion a number of different neural Pathways that allow for a firmer contraction of muscles not just within the fist but elsewhere in the body okay if um you've ever heard the great teachings of Pavo susulan who I hope to have on this podcast as a guest he's talked about how if you were say to try and squeeze a metal bar or think about just trying to give your friend the firmest handshake you possibly can you're having that handshake squeeze competition if you make a fist with your other hand you're actually going to be able to generate a harder contraction of the shaking hand okay of the squeezing hand and this is because of the way that we have these bilaterally U wired uh nerve to muscle connections and the fact that neural activation on one side is related to neural activation on the other side and so forth but basically what you're going to do for the side plank in order to generate the strongest and most efficient side plank for strengthening and hopefully depainting your back is to get on the side Bend those knees put the hand down in a fist position okay then you're going to push the hips off the ground so the upper body is indeed in a plank position then you're going to raise the hips up and you're going to have to put some considerable effort into pushing the floor away from you that's really the key here pushing the floor away from you now if you find that you can do that and you can hold that position for a good 8 to 10 seconds with a strong degree of rigidity so you're not quaking and you're not feeling as if the hips want to collapse down to the floor something you really want to avoid especially if you already have some back pain or even a subtle back injury you want to make sure that your your spine is straight okay and that those hips come off the ground and you're really in a plank position right no Bend if you find that you can do that and it's fairly straightforward for you well then feel free to then extend your feet out further put the top foot on top of the other foot and out to the front Okay so you're not stacking the feet right on top of one another we just shoe on top of shoe but you've got or foot on top of foot if you're doing this Barefoot or in socks but you've got one foot in front of you for some stability and then you're generating that long side plank pose and holding that for 8 to 10 seconds then pause for 10 maybe 30 seconds if you have to and then repeat again again all that part of one set just as we talked about for the curl up previously so you're working through the progression from bent legs to straightening your legs if the top foot is placed in front of the other foot with legs straight and that's something that you can do for say anywhere three to five repetitions of those 8 to 10 second holds which make up one set well then you have the option to make the whole thing more difficult by doing a sort of roll forward where you actually take the part of your shoulders which is on the side of your free arm so the hand that is not pressing into the floor and you rotate forward so that your chest is now aiming toward the floor maybe not to a full push-up position but maybe close and then back again to the side plank what you're doing there is you're activating some of the musculature that is for rotation of the spine okay and as you do that you're getting closer and closer to a front plank and of course front planks are also an excellent way to generate spine stability most people can do a front plank by resting on their forearms why start with a side plank well there are a lot of different reasons for that but what you'll realize is that when you're doing a side plank you're actually only really loading half of the spine maximally the other half of the spine is not being loaded maximally because it's the side of the spine that's that's up and of course that's a reason why you want to do these on both sides of your body right so what's the sets and repetition scheme that's going to work here well if you're like me and you loathe doing side planks and you find that they do take a lot more effort than perhaps you would like either psychologically or physically then for me what I've been doing is one set consists of three 10c holds I've been doing these with knees bent although I've now progressed to the point where I can do one foot over the other and resting that top foot um across the bottom foot so leg straight doing that for three 10-second holds to make up one set and doing that for two or three sets on one side of my body two or three sets on the other side of my body so slightly different than as I described for the curl up where it was descending repetitions where you know the first set you're doing five 10c holds next one 4 10sec holds next one 3 2 1 for the side planks I don't like them enough that I just prefer to do two or three sets of three 10-second hes on each side although I'm starting to enjoy them just enough that I might progress to the kind of what's called reverse pyramid where you go five five 4 3 2 1 this sort of thing increasing the number of sets and again I have a link in the show note captions that shows you how the side planks are done in these different variations I should mention that the most common mistake was side planks is letting the hips sag so if you don't push the floor away from you enough if you're not stable enough through the foot contact with the floor or the leg contact with the floor if you're doing these with knees bent even if you go to leg straight and you consider yourself very very strong in the side plank if the hips start to Sag you can imagine based on what you now know about back Anatomy right the spinal cord being this um kind of snake like extension out the back of the brain with the vertebrae as segments and the discs in between them if that's sagging well especially if you have an issue with a disc bulge and some impingment on one of those nerve Roots either coming into or out of the spinal cord you're going to get into some trouble meaning it's going to cause some pain or at least some aggravation so the goal is to get that spine really straight as you're doing the side planks regardless of whether or not you're doing that with knees bent or you're doing it with legs straight in fact that's the reason I went through all of that Anatomy earlier so that as you're doing these exercises whether or not it's the big three or the other protocols I'll talk about you can really Envision the major components of the spine that are getting engaged okay it's not just about the abdominals and the obliques and the lower back of course it's about all of that that's what you're exercising but you're also getting the neural engagement within the spine you should think about the vertebral segments the discs the fact that those nerve Roots need to run in and out of the spinal cord outp pass the Bony and disc material and to do that without impingement so as you do these movements can be very beneficial to think about the different anatomical features of the back including spinal cord vertebrae discs nerves Etc but mainly those and as you're doing that you'll not just be strengthening your back you'll also be strengthening your learning of neuroanatomy so the last of Stu Mill's big three again Stu kind of cringes every time people say okay it's just Mill's big three and that's back strengthening and Pain Relief and he always just kind of I can tell it pains him uh no pun intended because he knows and it's true that there's a lot more involved in strengthening and pain proofing the back but always good to have a great place to start a simple place to start and something that's really tractable without equipment or any cost and so we're very grateful that Stu was willing to kind of resist his temptation to be um Beyond nuanced and thorough which he always is and offer us the curl-up the side plank which we've covered and now the third which is the bird dog the bird dog as some of you may know is where you get into all fours on the ground you extend one arm forward and you extend the opposite one leg backward okay so if you're down on all fours and you extend your right hand in front of you you're going to extend your left leg behind you now there are a couple key things about this one is again have the extended hand in a fist why because you want to generate a strong neural contraction so that you don't forget and in fact facilitate keeping your upper body parallel to the floor so no tilting from side to side as best you can and you also want the neural activation to allow you to then Engage The Lift of the leg in a way that's also very strong and stable okay so nothing floppy no leaks as they say a key point is to make sure you don't raise the leg too high you're not trying to Arch your lower back in fact what you want to do is raise the hand in front of you generate that fist it can even just be out in front of your your eyes at first maybe a little bit higher and then the leg that's extending toward the back feel free to either point the toe toward the ground or if you want to extend the toe a little bit like you're doing a little bit of calf raise in the air right pointing your toe that is that's fine too but don't get that heel up too high or even the upper thigh up too high that you're getting a really big arch in the back the idea is to Envision one long line between the extended arm and fist all the way back across the midline because it's to the opposite leg and to the foot behind you again it's about creating a strong stable reach a strong stable lift of the foot but not too high and this is very important with the hand that remains planted and the knee that remains planted pushing the ground away from you okay that's as important as is the lifting of the arm the clasping of the Fist and the raising of the leg in all of these movements the pushing of the ground away from you the resistance to gravity is as important as whatever movement you happen to be doing again this is a terrific movement for strengthening the spine that most people can do because you're only working one half of the musculature on either side of the spine okay there's of course activation of the musculature on the other side to some degree in order to balance things out but by emphasizing only one half of the musculature a you can really focus on the contractions again you can really put a lot of Mind into the pushing the the floor away you can put your mind into where fist is and your foot is and of course you can generate the kind of hard contractions that are really going to strengthen those lower back muscles as well as the upper back and shoulder muscles that are required for generating stability of the spine again that's really what this is all about again it's going to be maybe three to five repetitions of 8 to 10 second holds for one set done for repeated sets maybe for a descending number of repetitions where you're going five holds four holds three holds two holds one hold all of that being done repeatedly and with the greatest amount of of intensity and focus so that those nerve Pathways can be engaged over and over again very easily generating a lot of strength of contraction that then of course carries over into your exercise activities and even just your passive activities throughout the day and even stability of the spine while at rest which is something that we're going to talk about more as we get into some of the other protocols now of course with the bird dog exercise you also need to train the opposite side of your body so after doing say two to five sets of those two to five repetitions of eight to 10 second holds on one side you're going to want to switch to the other side and do the same thing or you could alternate you could do right hand extended left leg extended do one set then switch to the other side left hand extended or I should say left fist extended uh right leg extended do those repetitions call that one set and then shift back to the other side and so on and so forth really depends on how much time you have how frequently you're doing this throughout the week again right now I'm striving to do all of stum Mill's big three at least once a week maybe twice a week I know many of you will say oh that's pretty wimpy you know you should be doing this every single day or five times a week well I have a busy schedule just as many of you do and it's something that I'm trying to incorporate more and more typically at the end of a workout although some people decide to do this at the beginning of a workout right now fortunately I'm not dealing with any back pain knock on wood but it's something that for many people who have back pain they find that if they do it this at the beginning of a workout it allows them to then move into the workout warmed up and to avoid a lot of the back pain they would otherwise experience with that said I want to be very clear that if any of these movements exacerbate your back pain then you should definitely avoid doing them and of course if you have back pain you should be working with a licensed professional to figure out how to treat that back pain you may very well need pain meds Andor surgery I don't know because I don't know your specific circumstance but for most people who are just trying to strengthen their back who perhaps are dealing with a little bit of nagging back pain The Big Three are often very very accessible meaning they don't exacerbate back pain and in many cases they alleviate it sometimes partially sometimes completely there are a lot of wonderful anecdotes out there of people who have benefited from doing the big three in all of those categories now again we have a link in the show note captions showing how the bird dog exercise is done there are a couple of variations that you can do to make it harder one is to draw boxes with the extended Fist and the extended foot that's actually a coordination issue too for some people so some people choose to do a box with their hand maybe they do it clockwise then they do it counterclockwise some people choose to do the hand and foot moving in a box together meaning simultaneously sometimes they'll alternate foot then hand this sort of thing any kind of movement that you're doing with the extended Fist and or foot is going to add some degree of difficulty to this but you want to make sure that if you're going to add those movements those progressions that you're keeping the pushing away way of the floor constant throughout and that you're keeping your torso parallel to the floor as you go now when I say parallel I realize that as you do an extension of one fist or the other fist as you kick out that back leg it's going to be near impossible for most people to stay perfectly parallel to the floor what you're trying to do however is to make sure that you're not rolling from one side to the next you're trying to make sure that you don't get tilted onto the stabilizing shoulder hand side okay so that's what's really important you can also if you really want to make it difficult you can start to take the extended hand fist that is and reach back and then touch the knee that was a few seconds ago extended so you can do that in kind of a kind of reaching back touching the knee then ex re- extending the leg you do that for one side both sides Etc again there are a number of different progressions that um I do in the video I must say these are challenging for me especially doing more than three sets after you've contracted your muscles really hard in the way that you're supposed to for these exercises in the three you're not going to have the sort of fatigue that you experience after sprinting or after doing heavy deadlifts or something of that sort but it's a certain kind of fatigue that prevents you from performing the movements properly and so the whole point here is to perform the movements properly to build a pattern what sometimes called an engram but basically it's an activation pattern of nerve to muscle and the resulting limb movements that allow you to do the movements perfectly so don't be in a big rush to do tons of this stuff right out the gate be in a rush to do as much of it it as you can perform properly and consider it a progression and something that you're going to keep up not just for a week not just for a year but it's something that you're going to do for the rest of your life even if that means doing it just once a week or once in a while learn the movements properly that's the most important thing and of course I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the common mistakes that people make when they do the bird dog one is people often raise that front fist way too high okay they're reaching for the sky or they're kicking way too high in the back they're generating a sort of bow shape from extended fist to Extended back foot that's not good you really want to raise these things up as stiff straight levers while also maintaining as much as you can parallel to the floor stance and pushing the floor away this is about generating strength of contraction and I know the word sounds bad but rigidity it's about generating stiffness in the spinal muscles and in the abdominal muscles and in the upper back muscles and the other muscles that are requ requ ired for this and when I say stiffness I don't mean a lack of ability for the muscles to move once you're in sport or once you're about your daily activities what I'm talking about is an ability to generate a really firm muscular contraction so that those nerve pathways are strong so that you can stabilize the spine in any number of different dimensions and planes and orientations as you embark on your daily activities sports activities Etc that's what all of this big three stuff is about it's about strengthening the musculature of the abdominals of the lower back of the shoulders and everything that connects it neurally again these are Pathways it's something that I should have said earlier and didn't which is we often experience pain in a given location like lower back pain or pain in the lower back and down the hip into the leg but pain is always the consequence of a pathway being irritated or a pathway being activated and in order to strengthen the components around the back to strengthen the components of the back to avoid pain you want to work Pathways and so the big three that stum migil has developed is really about generating the kind of muscular strength and stability the neuromuscular activation patterns and doing it in a way that is generally safe for most people to perform to get the strongest and most painfree back possible and what I just described might sound like a lot of exercise it's actually something that if you decide to just include one or two sets of each of those curl up side plank bird dog you could complete in anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes again if done once a week or twice a week whereas a warm up before you know weightlifting or at the end say a cardiovascular training session maybe even while watching TV or listening to a podcast or something of that sort it actually doesn't take that much time at all and of course doesn't require any equipment and it can be done essentially work or street clothes I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors plunge plunge makes what I believe is the best self-cooling cold water plunge over the last decade and especially in The Last 5 Years there's been an increasing amount of excitement about cold water plunging for sake of mental health physical health and performance and that's in large part because one of the most robust effects of cold water exposure are big increases in Adrenaline also called epinephrine and dopamine so while some people do cold water plunging in pursuit of increasing metabolism or reducing inflammation it's really those big increases in Adrenaline and dopamine that lead to those long- lasting increases in alertness and feelings of well-being not just in the seconds or minutes after the cold plunge but indeed for several hours afterwards I've been using a plunge for several years now typically first thing in the morning or after cardiovascular training I do agree that doing cold water plunging after a workout design to generate hypertrophy or strength gains is not a good idea but doing cold plunging at the other times of day can be tremendously beneficial I use the version of plunge called the all-in ice bath and plunge now also makes saunas that get up to 230° fah I love how the plunge ice bath and sauna can both be controlled from an app on my phone so that if I'm headed home I can turn on the sauna and it'll be hot when I arrive so if you would like to try a plunge ice bath or sauna you can go to plunge. comom huberman to get $150 off either product again that's plunge. comom huberman okay so before I get into some of the other protocols for strengthening the back which largely center around building strength into the stabilizing muscles and parts of the body that allow the spine to move through different planes of motion safely I want to talk about two protocols that one can use to alleviate back pain that many people find beneficial now all this goes back to this thing about vertebrae dis vertebrae right that's the alternating sequence along the length of the spine and again the vertebrae are bony tissue so it's hard stuff the discs are a softer all right it's got some durability to it but it's a softer tissue but it allows for pliability of the spine because it's a soft tissue so imagine an Oreo cookie something that um I'm not a fan of eating um I don't like the way they taste and I'm told uh they're probably not good for us but in any case if you like Oreos or you don't it's a good analogy here where you've got the two cookies and the cream Center so the two cookies are analogous to the vertebrae here and the cream Center is analogous to the disc if you squeeze the cookies evenly from top to bottom the cream Center is going to move out towards all sides along the full circumference right so all the white stuff is going to move towards the edges more or less equally if you squeeze just on one side right the cream filling is going to move out toward one side if you squeeze on the other side cream filling and move out toward the other side and of course if you were to crush the cookies from top and bottom or even just the top cookie or the bottom cookie the cream filling is going to go up and through that will be equivalent to the rupturing of the disc along that Dimension okay why am I mentioning this well as I said before a lot not all but a lot of back pain has to do with compression or impingement of nerves at some point along a pathway sometimes multiple points along a pathway and one of the most common sources of back pain is when those discs are bulging they're herniating and they're impinging on a faasle of nerves a bundle of nerves so two of the things that many people find beneficial when they're experiencing back pain are first if you can find a bar or something that you can hang from but don't worry you're not going to have to actually hang in a full dead hang position if you don't have the strength for that or even if you do the idea here is to get your arms overhead onto a bar you're holding on to the bar and your legs are going to drape down and your toes are going to be in contact with the floor so we're not talking about a dead hang here okay which actually requires that you engage some muscles that can actually aggravate back pain what you're doing here is you're going to hold on to the bar you're in more or less a hang except that your toes are supporting you or your feet or sometimes your heels are supporting you what you're trying to do is get lengthening of the spine basically what you're doing is the opposite of pressing down on those spinal discs and you're going to do that for anywhere from 10 to 30 seconds you're not going to twist okay you could imagine how twisting of the spine could be bad depending on where the Bulge is and which nerves are being impinged what you're trying to do is just create length along the spine to relieve some of that disc bulging which is impinging on the nerves again without knowing the source of your back pain it's impossible to know whether or not this will help or it won't but many people get some degree of Pain Relief by doing this of course you need to be cautious in how you do it you don't want to hang for a long time if you don't have the strength to do that while trying to find the distance to the floor with your toes you're going to want to progress toward this very carefully but this is something that many people find beneficial it's also the kind of logic behind you know inversion tables and these um kind of look more like um kind of chair apparati where people uh have designed chairs that then can invert so that people can relieve some of the pressure on their spine I've personally never tried those inversion chairs I did used to have an inversion table that I had out on my deck in the morning and I like to you know lock my ankles in and and invert on that thing it was kind of fun keep in mind if you're going to do any kind of inversion you are going to generate intracranial pressure if you're somebody and I feel obligated to say this because I'm a vision scientist and I worked on glaucoma for a number of years which is intraocular pressure if you have glaucoma or you're predisposed to glaucoma you're going to increase ocular pressure if you're inverted in that way or anyway so keep that in mind you would want to avoid that in those cases but for many people just generating some degree of lengthening of the spine by hanging from a bar or from some other physical object that's sturdy while keeping your toes or your feet or your heels in contact with the floor so you're just kind of lightly touching there so you can keep that going for anywhere from 10 to 30 seconds and then just kind of relax let go you walk around a little bit and then repeat doing that two or three times many people experience some degree of pain relief from doing that for all the reasons that now should be logical and obvious to you based on your understanding of spine anatomy and physiology that we talked about earlier and the general theme of just trying to relieve compression that is herniation of the discs now what about reversing herniation of the discs okay so this is something I'm very familiar with and I have an anecdote here that of course just relates to my experience so it certainly doesn't carry over to everybody but it's an experience that I've shared with a number of people who've also experienced lower back pain to some degree of success and the story goes as follows a few years ago when I was in Seattle giving a talk I decided to go to the gym that morning and I did an exercise which was not a deadlift it wasn't anything spinal really it was kind of a reverse bench dip that I do for my triceps I've always enjoyed doing these I've always um been able to do these completely painfree but that morning I got ambitious and I put a couple um plates on my lap in order to do them and I don't know exactly when it happened but as I was doing these bench dips with the weight on my lap something felt like it quote unquote went in my back something something felt off I I don't know what happened but it felt like a little kind of like a little pull or something of that sort and when I stood up felt okay and then as I started to walk around a little bit more and went through my workout I thought uhoh something happened back there this is not good and what essentially was happening is I was experiencing pain on my kind of lower and mid right side of my back down the hip so intense pain at the hip socket and down the leg kind of what some people might describe as classic s Attica or something similar to that I thought oh goodness this is not good as the morning progressed I was having a harder and harder time not walking walking was okay but if I sat down and then I need to stand up it was incredibly painful and I thought oh no this is it I really did something bad to my back so much so that I was literally bent over at about 20 or 30 degrees walking back to the Space Needle in Seattle cuz we were giv the talks um up in the one of the rooms there I don't know if it was the top room one of the rooms at the Space Needle and I could barely walk up to the Space Needle I was just you know hunched over it was miserable now eventually what happened was I was able to fly home I was in a ton of pain I started reaching out to colleagues of mine that work on the back that understand pain they were suggesting painkillers I personally like to avoid taking painkillers unless I have to take them and I basically don't take them I might take an aspirin every once in a while but I really like to avoid taking painkillers that's just me I don't judge those that need painkill but basically in talking to Medical colleagues I thought okay maybe I'm going to need a corticosterone shot maybe I'm going to need to just weight it out and keep in mind that a lot of back pain does relieve itself if people just wait it out and avoid the movement or movements that caused or exacerbate that back pain this is something really important to know a lot of back pain will just relieve over time but I wanted to stay active so I started reading online as one does and I even started doing some abdominal strengthening exercises at the time I wasn't aware of the curl-up and instead what I was doing was some crunches so I was doing sit-ups which you guessed it made things way way worse for the obvious reasons it was actually causing more of bulging of the discs that were impinging on those nerves bulging out the I guess it would be the back side of the back the posterior side of the back at the time I didn't really understand dis anatomy and vertebral anatomy in a way that would tell me that the sit-ups were going to cause that problem but they were making it worse and worse eventually I cross P with a PT who said absolutely stop doing any abdominal crunching just stop you're making it much much worse he explained to me that the discs were bulging at about the L3 L4 region you look up where that is and then it was impinging on the nerve which was causing the pain both in the back at the hip socket down the leg what did he suggest I do he suggested that I do essentially the opposite of a situp basically that I lie down on the floor with toes extended legs together and then do essentially a push-up while keeping my hips in contact with the floor so you might think of this kind of as an up dog or a cobra pose in yoga um although not so much extending the head looking up at the ceiling but keeping the head in a neutral position and then doing anywhere from 8 to 10 repetitions of those and then holding the final repetition for as long as I could until I started to Quake a little bit and then relaxing onto the floor what was remarkable is that from the very first set of those that I did I started to experience some degree of pain relief not total pain relief but some degree of pain relief and what he suggested I do and what of course I did was to do those essentially Cobra push-ups or I don't know really what to call them again it's hips in contact with the floor toes pointed back legs straight pushing back essentially what he was having me do was to try and work that disc bulge back into the more vertical alignment of the spinal column I realize that's not the exact nomenclature so all you pts and chyros and physios are probably cringing at this point but for the common listener what we were trying to do was get the cream of the Oreo cookie from stopping to squeeze out from the back of from between those cookies and back under those cookies so to speak and what I found and this was just remarkable was that within two maybe three days the pain was almost completely gone almost completely gone which was to me just staggering no pain medication I mean prior to this I was thinking oh goodness I'm going to need corticosteroid injection I'm going to have to take pain meds I might even need surgery I mean I was compl completely debilitated now of course we don't have the control experiment where I didn't do these exercises and I did nothing so we don't know how fast it would have relieved itself had I just done nothing so that's an important caveat to all of this and again this is just my experience but the reason I'm sharing this experience is not because I necessarily think that you should be doing these same exercises to relieve a disc bulge and the pain that results from it but to give you a sense of how the disc bulging and the impingement on the nerve is very often the cause of back pain and you want to absolutely avoid doing anything that exacerbates that disc bulge so in my case it meant avoiding doing any crunching because that would send the cream from between the two Oreo cookies further and further out impinging on the nerve more and more and more creating more and more pain rather to try and push things back by doing a spinal extension by doing creating an arch in the lower back by doing these essentially uh Cobra push-ups from the floor and when talking with this PT again and telling him gosh the back pain is essentially removed this is amazing I'm back to exercising walking running in the very same week he said yes indeed some people have so much back pain that they can't even do the Cobra type push-up they need to just go to a wall and actually just put their hands on the wall standing about six inches or so away from the wall and then just push their hips towards the wall okay yeah I acknowledge kind of an odd visual there but pushing their hips towards the wall while keeping their you know arms bent and their torso you know anywhere from 6 to 12 in from the wall and then eventually progressing to be being able to do these Cobra type push-ups or up dogs whatever you want to call them on the floor I again will provide a link in the show note captions of how these are done I found these to be tremendously beneficial not just when I have back pain because yes indeed couple years later I did something else in the gym I wasn't training particularly heavy and that same L3 L4 thing started again and I started doing these right away and it resolved it right away okay so clearly it works for me but one of the things that's really been key for me is to understand that I have a propensity for a disc bulge a herniation in that region I now know what direction the disc bulge goes therefore which exercis is to avoid because they exacerbate that herniation of the discs and which exercises to emphasize because they help alleviate the herniation of that disc and this is why a little bit later I'm going to talk about some of the protocols that you can incorporate into your resistance training things like posterior chainwork like glute ham raises Nordic curls and things of that sort that if you're like me and you're prone to slight herniation of the discs in the direction towards the posterior side right that it's very important to build up the musculature that surrounds those discs so that one can avoid herniating them further so again this is my experience you if you have back pain I would hope not but if you have back pain it might be a herniation toward the anterior side of your spine right it might be herniation in the direction of spine flexion and so therefore you need to do different exercises the point is that you need to understand what the origin of the pain is but I also offer this story because I've known several people one of whom is in my family who experienced back pain fought they need to get corticosteroid injections actually got those injections got some degree of pain relief which is not surprising but then the pain came back okay it turns out they had a herni disc in the same kind of area and general category of posterior you know cream of the cookie going out the back right towards the back as I did thought that my anecdote about the herni disc and these you know push-ups and these wall push-ups and pushing one's pelvis towards the wall was kind of goofy and you know wasn't really Medical but what's very interesting is when they then traveled to Europe to Scandinavia for the summer living there their Scandinavian and spoke to a physician there the instruction from that MD that physician was not to do corticosterone injections or to get surgery but you guessed it to do exactly the same exercise izes that the PT in the United States suggested to me now why do I raise this well the last thing I want to do is get into a debate online about whether or not one profession like PT or Cairo or MD Etc is better than the other I realize there's a range of talents there are mediocre Terrible Bad excellent and superb practitioners in all these categories by the way um that's clear uh to me and hopefully to everybody else right you can't look at an entire field and say good or entire field and say bad there's going to be a range of quality of practitioners in any of those fields but when it comes to back pain we are at an interesting point in history where depending on where you are in the world depending on the traditions of the medical practice in the area in which you live certain forms of relieving back pain are going to be looked at as more esoteric than others so that's the other reason I offer this anecdote this family member of mine and a couple friends who've experienced back pain of a similar nature have all now Incorporated these um Cobra push-ups uh up dog type approaches to some degree of success or another it is true that one of them had a badly enough herniated disc that they did need surgery so surgery sometimes is needed of course but it's been remarkable to me to see how much I and others can relieve their back pain and strengthen the particular areas and aspects of the body that then can avoid further back pain and I'm quite happy to say that I've had essentially zero back pain now that I've Incorporated the right rehabilitative exercises as well as the right strengthening exercises which include The Big Three that we talked about before and the ones I'm going to talk about next I realize that when a lot of people hear about back pain they immediately think of sciatica and somebody who's always carried his wallet in his back right pocket I'm often told hey you're going to get sciatica if you carry your wallet in your back right pocket um well I always take my wallet and put it in my front right pocket when I sit down or at least I try to remember to so I don't think that's the cause I'm certainly somebody who's had quote unquote sciatica now sciatica's most commonly thought of as tingling pain or numbness or some combination of the three in maybe a little bit in the lower back in the glute region in the hip and down the leg especially now relieving sciatica involves a number of different approaches and I'll probably have to do an entire episode about sciatica and other nerve pathway pain specifically but for the time being a lot of sciatica is caused by exactly the sorts of things that we were talking about thus far the herniation of the disc the bulging of the disc and the impingement on the nerve and when that bulging AKA herniation is occurring within the lower lumbar region of the spine often times it will impinge on a nerve or nerves that innervate the various regions I just described so the glutes the hip down the leg and sometimes will activate pain tingling or numbness in areas which are not innervated by that nerve there's something called referred pain where you're experiencing pain in one part of the body due to an impingement or disruption of a neural pathway or other pathway or inflammation elsewhere in the body so we're not going to do a deep dive on sciatica right now suffice to say that a lot of the symptoms of sciatica fall under the umbrella of what we're talking about today which is back pain and strengthening the back in a way that can help you avoid back pain and indeed sciatica as well much of what I just spoke about in terms of my own experience with lower back pain could be thought of as sciatica because there was a lot of pain in the hip I almost felt as if the hip socket was in pain and there was some um pain not shooting down the leg but kind of in the outer uppermost thigh for me some people experience it all the way down to their toes even numbness tingling or pain within the foot so it really depends on the degree to which those neural pathways are impinged but the principles are the same which are if you are experiencing lower back or related pain in the hip the leg the buttocks Etc you really want to figure out is there a bulging also called a herniated disc if so which direction is the herniation likely occurring is it out toward the back of the spine is on one side you really want to understand where that herniation and bulging is occurring so that you can do the proper exercises to work that bulging to push essentially what I'm referring to in analogy as the pushing back of the cream between the two Oreo cookies back between those two Oreo cookies so that you can give some relief from the impingement on those nerve roots that are no doubt causing the flare up of back pain or what some people experience and call sciatica okay so thus far we've largely been talking about different structural features of the back things like vertebrae which are bony the discs Etc that can impinge on nerves and cause pain and while pain is certainly neural there are a number of things that exist from literally toe to head that allow our back to move through the various planes of motion in the ways it needs to to carry out daily living to carry out Sport and that if we strengthen certain things even very distal very far from the spine we can allow for more mobility of the spine strengthening the spine and indeed even pain relief within the spinal Pathways now the protocols we're about to discuss were shared with me with Dr Shawn wheeler sha wheeler is a medical doctor who has an incredible knowledge of back pain back relief and back strengthening by no means can I exhaustively cover all of the knowledge that he shared with the world I'll provide links to some of his work in the show note captions I intend to bring him onto the podcast as a guest but the Hallmark of the protocols I'm about to share with you you is the following we have muscles that are constantly actively engaged in order to stabilize our spine which again is a good thing you want a stable spine and we have muscles that are not actively engaged but for which we can engage them either voluntarily or we can train them to be more engaged when we're not thinking about it so involuntary engagement but we have an entire set of musculature that is constantly actively engaged in order to stabilize our spine which again is a good thing and we have musculature that can potentially stabilize our spine if we focus on it if we consciously decide to so what I'm about to describe are some simple protocols in fact very simple protocols that you can do in order to create more spine stability and in fact you can do these anywhere the first involves strengthening the muscles in the front of the neck now this is something that I do believe most everybody should be doing anyway why well most people nowadays are starting to take on a c shape not just rounding the lower spine but the chin is starting to move toward the chest and of course this is because most everybody is texting or on a laptop much of the time okay this is not an exaggeration if you look at people walking around now they are tilted forward at the chin they are essentially taking an inch or two off their height they are potentially creating pain elsewhere in the body maybe even in the neck itself and what I'm about to describe is a way in which you can very easily strengthen the muscles in the front of the neck without adding size to the neck because I know a lot of people don't want to add size to their neck I've talked elsewhere about strengthening the muscles on the side of the neck and in the back of the neck this is something that I do believe is important especially for people that are doing a lot of heavy weightlifting who are broadening their shoulders or who already have broad shoulders also just from a sheer aesthetic perspective nothing looks weirder than a little head and neck placed on broad shoulders okay but more importantly than any athetic matters is that if the musculature of the neck is weak you have a weak upper spine which is not a good thing from the perspective of avoiding pain and not a good thing from the perspective of safety let alone posture breathing Etc I've talked about that elsewhere I'll provide a link in the show note captions to some of the simpler exercises for strengthening the neck that you can do without equipment in the meantime for sake of strengthening and pain proofing the back it's very clear that strengthening the muscles of the front of the neck can be very beneficial this is something that not just Dr Wheeler but also steuart McGill have been proponents of and the simplest way to do this without any equipment is to Simply put your fists underneath your not your chin but on the two sides of your jaw so on either side of your chin if you're just listening that's where my voice is going like this and then with your tongue on the roof of your mouth and breathing through your nose you're just going to do a 10-second static contraction where you're going to try and move your chin down against the resistance of your fists underneath your jaw okay so you're going to go push down there again tongue on the roof of your mouth feel free to exale exhale as you do this you might want to do this for three or four repetitions of 10c static contractions and then just relax you could do that for anywhere from two to five sets very easy to do what you're doing is you're generating strength in the muscles of the front of the neck and some nearby musculature it has the tendency to then put you into a default position at a distance from your chest okay so this is different than strengthening the muscles on the back of your neck which will of course help to keep your your chin out and and away from your chest but when one does this there are a number of different benefits improved Airway passage so as many of you know I'm a big proponent of nasal breathing unless you need to breathe through your mouth both during sleep and sometimes during exercise but certainly at rest so strengthening the muscles of the front of the neck again I'll provide a link to this in the show note caption very easy to do it takes barely any time you can do it anywhere and it has a number of different benefits for strengthening and pain proofing the spine next is to focus on strength of your feet and your toes Yes you heard me correctly why are we talking about feet and toes when we're talking about back strengthening and alleviating back pain well your feet are the foundation of your entire body they're carrying you around all day long and it's very clear that the stronger your feet are the healthier the rest of your body is going to be it's not to say that the rest of your body will be healthy if you just focus on foot strength that's certainly not the case but strengthening your feet has many many benefits it's something that I've been focusing a lot on in the last couple of years and it's made a huge difference in terms of eliminating shin splints when I run it's made a huge difference in terms of alleviating a certain amount of lower back pain although you heard the anecdote about how I largely did that through other mechanisms earlier basically strengthening your feet is an allaround terrific thing to do how do you do this well some people opt to get very wide toebox shoes some people will even run in those um shoes where the individual toes are look like they're in a glove I don't own those shoes I do have a slightly wider toebox shoe for running and I've really benefited from that but basically what anyone can do and you don't need to purchase any shoes or anything like that is to try and see if you can spread your toes out from one another so that none of them are touching on both feet many people find that they are able to do that some people including myself found that they could do that on one foot not the other and it just took a couple of weeks of working at it and strengthening those neural Pathways learning how to activate those neural pathways through concentration to be able to spread my toes on both feet this might sound a little silly to some of you but being able to spread your toes on both feet actually says a lot about your ability to activate distal neural Pathways or I should say neural Pathways to distal parts of your body there's a bunch of interesting data about how that correlates with some metrics of Aging or lack of Aging I'm going to cover that in a future podcast but some people find that they can't spread their toes out and they need a little bit of help from toe spreaders yes there are commercially available toe spreaders that take the form of these kind of um stocks that you can put between um your toes these are rubber stocks that then spread the toes it can be a little bit uncomfortable at first but then you get better at it help you learn to spread your toes you certainly don't need those things you could even just take some you know paper towel or or tissue paper or something of that that's that's firm and put it between your toes and that will help you learn to spread your toes I'm not suggesting you walk walk around all day with tow spreaders although some people actually do that but basically what you're doing is you're creating the ability to activate the neural Pathways that that allow you excuse me to spread your toes I know this might sound silly but if you do this you're going to find that you're walking your stance when you're stationary and certainly if you do any kind of running or cycling you're going to find that all of those things are going to benefit in addition there is benefit to strengthening your toes this is something that I'm only now starting to explore um one way you can do this is by sitting in a chair Barefoot spreading your toes as much as possible and then seeing whether or not you can lift each toe independently I'm not at the point where I can do that yet I'm still trying to learn how to um lift my big toes independent of my other toes again all this is learning how to activate neural Pathways to distal parts of your body that serve as stabilizers for the arch of the foot for the foot itself for the ankle for the shin that carry over to spine stability and a strong spine I know it seem seems kind of wild that we're talking about the feet and Toes spreading to benefit your back but all of these things relate to one another up and down the chain of activation involved in Walking In running and certainly if you're involved in any other sports but also just standing around so don't underestimate the power of learning to spread your toes and learning to move your toes independently and then of course there's a whole set of exercises that you can find online of how to actually strengthen the individual toes with bands and things of that sort pretty advanced stuff most people aren't going to do that but if you're willing to explore that stuff it's clear that there are a lot of benefits and again there's some exciting literature starting to emerge about the benefits of toe strengthening and toe spreading and all that stuff as it relates to believe it or not neurocognitive longevity I know it sounds wild but this is actually a literature that's starting to pick up some weight so it's one that I'm paying attention to and that uh I'm certainly going to cover in a future podcast Okay so we've got strengthening the neck we've got toes spreading at a minimum making sure that you can spread all your toes move them independently that would be great what's that going to do that means that when you're standing at rest that you're creating a stable base for yourself when you're walking when you're running and certainly when you're lifting or you're playing any sports you're creating the most stable base for yourself possible when I say stable base I don't just mean because the toes are spread I mean because if you can activate the musculature to spread those Toes or if they're passively in that spread toe position not touching one another you're going to be activating some of the musculature that's I guess for the typical person we think of this as in the arch of the foot and the top of the foot and running up to the front of the shin that's going to create the most stability for your lower limbs your upper limbs your pelvis and your spine okay now in discussions with Dr Wheeler and discussions with Dr starett and discussions with Dr Stu McGill all of them really emphasize that when doing resistance training that bracing the body by essentially not doing a big belly breath but filling the body with air so that you essentially create a firmness within the abdominal walls and the spinal Erectors and the obliques so this would be essential in a squat type movement or other types of movements that's beneficial during resistance exercise to create the most stable canister of you the most stable activation of the musculature around the spine to avoid injury and also to lift the greatest amount of weight there's a number of different mechanical advantages and safety advantages that are afforded when we do that this was also something that I discussed with Dr Andy Galpin when he did his series on exercise physiology with us again we find a link to that in the show note captions now that bracing that filling of the body with air and that bracing of the abdominals and the musculature essentially that runs like a belt around the midsection to make yourself strong and stable during those movements that's all fine and good but it turns out that when we're at rest when we're just standing around we actually want to do the opposite we actually want to relax that musculature and belly breathe now I've done an entire episode about breathing and the difference between belly breathing versus breathing where the chest lifts or a combination of both but we can keep this very simple you can do yourself a great favor by trying to remember that when you're at rest you're just standing around maybe you're seated or standing and working or you're talking or something of that sort that you're ideally nasal breathing unless you're speaking or eating or something of that sort and you are belly breathing okay so you're actually relaxing the abdominals as you inhale and the belly is moving out and then as you exhale the belly moves in so that's the ideal pattern when it rests the exact opposite of the pattern that you want when you're actively engaging all that musculature for sake of exercise and stability especially when you're engaging in weight training under loads so that places us at strength in the front of the neck toes spreading and strengthening of the feet belly breathing at rest and then there's a kind of fun one that's something that I've been incorporating a lot because frankly I'm not a big fan of doing abdominal work it's just not something that I really enjoy doing in the gym or elsewhere but I know that it's important to have a strong abdominal wall it's important to have strong abdominals generally and yes occasionally I'll grab onto a bar and I'll do a set of Pikes I actually enjoy Pikes you know bring my ankles up to my hands and doing that trying to stop there doing LS sits things like that I'll do those every once in a while but what I found to be very beneficial and that is more kind of realworld related in the sense that it activates the musculature of the abdominals you can train your abdominals while doing things that more closely mimic what you do in real life is to actually stagger one's stance while doing certain forms of resistance training okay so not during deadlifts not during squats or anything of that sort but let's say during dumbbell curls for the biceps rather than stand with feet parallel standing with one foot in front of the other making sure that they are wide enough apart in the lateral plane as we'll call it okay so far enough away on either side of your belly button so that you're stable Little Bend in the knees and then making sure that your belly button is still facing Direct directly forward this is really key not twisting the Torso but making sure that your belly button is facing directly forward and doing curls one arm then the other arm one arm then the other arm then switching to a stance in which the other foot goes forward and the other foot goes back again make sure that you're not in a CrossCountry skier position with the feet very close to your midline because if they are you're not going to be stable so make sure that they're far enough away from your belly button on either side that there's a bend in your knees so that you're stable and then doing curls that way can also do this for any kind of triceps exercise like an overhead triceps extension those are mainly the exercises in which one could apply this although there are a few others maybe for back work maybe for shoulder work although I think parallel stance is probably best for that and certainly for leg work so what are you doing if you do curls or overhead triceps extension in this way with one foot forward then the other foot forward what are you doing well if you deliberately insist meaning force yourself to keep your belly button facing exactly forward and for that reason sometimes it's helpful to do these in front of a mirror what you're doing is you're generating anti-rotational forces you're requiring that your upper body not twist while you're lifting these loads and what that does is it trains the obliques it trains components of your abdominals and to some extent it's training components of your lower back although not so much as it is the obliques the abdominals that are anti-rotation that are preventing your body from twisting while you're carrying out these movements and in doing so you're also mimicking the way that a lot of movements are carried out in daily life because if you think about it it's pretty uncommon that you're going to be lifting things with one arm with feet parallel I mean it happens okay there are times when feet are parallel and we're lifting something up with both hands there are times in which you do something similar to kind of the stance that you would be in for a dumbbell curl you know with feet parallel in the gym or a tricep extensions with feet parallel but more often than not as we move through life one or the other feet is positioned in front of the other and you know we're reaching something or lifting something or we're pulling something those are the patterns that exist more typically in daily life and those are the patterns of movement that typically people hurt themselves while doing you know they reach down to get something out of a cabinet they'll reach into the back and they'll twist a bit to grab something in the back and that's when their back will go or they're reaching overhead to grab something and they're twisting as they reach with one arm so I've certainly found and this was supported by again all of the experts that I spoke to that staggering one stance while performing resistance training typically curls or overhead tricep extensions there aren't many other things that lend themselves well to this so those are the two that I'm really focusing on doing that while insisting that is forcing yourself to keep your belly buttons facing completely forward okay not tilting to the side either way that can really help strengthen the abdominals through the use of what's called anti-rotation this is also what you're going to experience if you ever take a yoga class and you do a pose where you know it's arms overhead Like a Warrior 2 pose or a warrior one pose and they'll say make sure that your belly button is facing completely forward that you're not twisting to the side too much this is also what the instructor will tell you in a Pilates or a yoga class very often in certain movements where there's a tendency to kind of um relax or sag into a twisted upper torso of course there's some yoga and pilates movements that require that you twist your upper torso but that's not what we're talking about here this is when they tell you keep your belly button facing forward you're generating anti-rotation forces not just of the abdominals but as the abdominals connect to the pelvis and of course all of that is providing stability for the spine and then if you run down the legs in your mind that is and you think about your feet with those nice spread toes and the activated um musculature on the base and the top of your feet and running up the front of your shin and your calves you can really imagine how you're creating the most stable positioning on the floor stable positioning of the spine no wonder that the spine is not only going to experience less shearing stress less pain but you're also in a position position to create a nice strong chain of activation from the nerves and muscles from the base of the floor all the way up to your neck because you're already strengthening your neck okay so in terms of protocols thus far we've covered stum Mill's big three then we talked a little bit about things you can do to relieve pain so this was the hanging from a bar with the toes touching the ground right as well as the kind of up doog or Cobra exercises and then we talked about five or six things that one can do including strengthening the neck spreading the toes strengthening the feet Etc in order to generate strength and stability distal to the back and thereby to strengthen and pain prooof the back now we're going to cover four final protocols to strengthen your back pain prooof your back and allow you the greatest degree of Mobility both for sake of Mobility during exercise and in daily living the first of those four protocols is going to be to activate and strengthen and in some cases Des spasm the medial glute which is a muscle that most people don't think about the medial glute is involved in stabilizing the hips as you walk as you run okay so it's going to prevent the pelvis from moving from side to side it's one that when it weakens or when you have trouble activating it can lead to some forms of what is perceived as lower back pain so if you reach to your lower back and you feel these kind of like two kind of like almost like nodules at the top of your pelvis a lot of people will experience pain in and around that region or maybe even as a kind of a like a belt um of pain around that area more or less and in some not all cases but in some cases that's due to lack of medial glute activation or in some cases it's due to spasming of musculature in that region it's really hard to tell unless you're being assessed by an expert which one it is again that's not what we're here to do what I am here to do is to provide you a protocol that I've found to be tremendously beneficial for relieving the sort of lower low back pain and the kind of pain that even extends into the top of the glutes that many people experience especially if you've been sitting a lot if you've been driving a lot flying a lot if you find yourself doing a lot of hip hinging exercise like squats and then you travel so you're sitting on a plane for a while and you don't um pay mind to really stay in a you know flatb or um arched back position by the way if you're somebody who has disc bulging in that direction that we talked about before and can benefit from doing those Cobra poses or kind of up dog you know push-ups if you travel or drive or you're seated a lot for work I and many others find it really beneficial just take a towel and just roll it up and put it so you maintain the arch in your lower back so you're not rounding in your seat that can be really useful and it makes perfect sense if you think about it given what we were talking about before with the squeezing out of the cream of the Oreo cookie in that direction you want to make sure that you're not rounding your lower back too much keeping it straight or a little bit arched is going to be beneficial not overly arched but straight or a little bit arched and a you know a rolled up towel or something of that sort that you can put in your lower back can really be helpful for that now the protocol here is to essentially activate and Des spasm the medial glute this is actually a protocol that I learned from Jeff Cavalier long before I ever met him or he was on the podcast which he's been on the podcast Jeff cavaliere has a YouTube channel called athleen X which has tons of zeroc cost protocols for resistance training for cardiovascular training he just provides so much useful information again zero cost I've actually paid for his programs no he didn't ask me to say that he doesn't pay me to say that over the years I've paid to use various programs from athlex and they've benefited me tremendously I've customized them a bit for myself but in any case love the work he does grateful to call him a friend extremely grateful that he was a guest on this podcast we'll Pro provide a link to the episode that he did talking about exercise and exercise physiology and nutrition in the show note captions in any event the protocol here is to activate and some cases Des spasm the medial glutes which can be done in a very straightforward way where you lie on your side essentially like you were going to do a side plank so you've got your elbow and your forearm on the ground making that fist you would imagine you'd go into a side plank except no you're going to keep the lower leg the leg that's in contact with the floor against the floor you're going to take the leg that's on top you're going to point the toe down okay so you're not bridging up into a side plank you're just resting on the floor on your side you take that top leg point the toe down you bring that toe out in front of you touch it to the floor and then you're going to bring your heel back you're going to extend it not overextend it but extend it as far as you can with your heel pointed toward the back wall and up towards the ceiling so you're trying to maintain that downward pointed toe effort okay then you're going to lower it again touch bring it all the way back up you're going to do that for maybe five 10 repetitions and then on the final repetition you're going to hold it there in that raised position not as long as you can but probably anywhere from 10 to 20 seconds depending on how much strength you have in your medial glutes to be able to do that and if you like you can also take your hand on the side of the foot that you're raising okay so if you're lying on your left side you're going to take your your right hand and you're going to take your thumb and put it right at the top of your glutes and you'll feel when the leg is fully extended back with the heel towards the back wall and ceiling you'll feel the muscle activate there and you can kind of push against it what are you doing when you do this you're activating the medial glute you're in some cases Des spasming the medial glute and some of the musculature around there and many people find that they get considerable pain relief of that low low back region when they do this exercise you of course would want to switch to the other side even if you're not experiencing pain on the other side and do the same thing for the opposite side so lying on your right right hand side taking then your left leg pointing the toe down putting in front of you bringing it back doing multiple repetitions of that and then holding it in a static hold while feeling that medial glute get activated and then taking some rest this is the sort of thing that you can do if you're experiencing low low back pain to see if it provides some relief many people find it does provide that relief if of course it exacerbates your pain please stop doing it you never want to exacerbate pain in any kind of way but many people find that it relieves the pain in that low low back region and it does so not just during the exercise but in the minutes and hours following you may need to repeat this a couple times per day you may need to adjust your other activities including exercise it really depends on the severity of your back pain and injury the nature of it Etc however it's something that many people including I also include in our regular routines I'll sometimes do this as part of a warm up on leg day I'll sometimes do this just while you know watching TV or something which I don't do terribly often but I'll just take a couple of minutes literally just 2 minutes or 3 minutes and I'll do a couple sets of these on either side just to maintain that neuromuscular activation of the medial glute some people I would say most people are not very good at activating that medial glute region if you're somebody who is being conscientious and doing a lot of posterior chain work such as Kabal swings on a regular basis you're doing glute ham raises which I'm a huge fan of I'll do an entire video about posterior chain and why I'm such a big fan of glut ham raises unfortunately you need a specialized piece of equipment to do them or Nordic curls such a big fan of Nordic curls glut ham raises etc for all sorts of reasons strengthening the back strengthening the posterior chain making sure you can still generate power in the pelvic region lower back region while maintaining posture especially as you age all of that I'll talk more about those in a future episode of The hubman Lab podcast but the point is this many people just fail to get activation of the glutes in a way that supports their lower back and allows them to strengthen their back to the extent that they would otherwise and much of the time it's not just a failure to activate the glutes because of course there are many ways to activate the glutes there are all sorts of exercises you can read about online but a failure to activate the medial glute muscles in particular that people need to overcome by strengthening those nerve to muscle Pathways and of course I'm talking about activation of the medial glutes and Des spasming of the medial glute which is really what happens when you hold that medial glute contraction for some period of time then afterwards you allow some relaxation in those neural pathways that is often again not always but often the cause of that low low back pain so if you have low low back pain and it's safe for you to perform this exercise I encourage you to give it a try again it requires no equipment it's very easy takes almost no time and at least for me and many others that I've spoken to it has been tremendously helpful in relieving that lower back pain by Des spasming the medial glute and at the same time allowing for nerve to muscle activation of the medial glut such that the medial glutes can be active when they need to in order to stabilize the pelvis and allow for the strongest possible pelvic spine interface okay so the next protocol is one that you can do essentially anywhere it takes almost no time and it's a wonderful one because it allows for stretching of the soaz muscle right the muscle that is easy to say and hard to spell soaz it's PSAs right I think the p is generally silent you'd say soaz muscle um the soaz muscle is involved in connecting the spine to the pelvis okay it also has an interaction with the diaphragm that's really important this muscle that's important for breathing and many people have tightening of the soaz tightening of the hip flexors but being able to stretch the soaz muscle is something that provides a ton of relief to the tightness that one can experience from sitting too much from being in a hip hinge position too much especially if you're doing heavy hip hinge work and then you're sitting or driving a lot and many people also just carry a lot of stress in their midsection and relieving or stretching the soas can be very beneficial okay there's a lot about this that could be said in fact I'll probably do an entire episode about soas and fascia okay I know there's a lot of requests to talk about fascia but it's far too much to get into now here's the protocol that I do believe everyone can benefit from I don't care how bendy you are how rigid you are how big you are how live you are how slim you are this is a wonderful exercise it just feel so good and it allows you to afterwards be in a long spine posture to really feel opened up at the hips if you will now I'm using yoga type language but I think you understand what I mean and it is a great stress reliever as well which is essentially to do what looks like a Warrior 2 position in yoga so you're essentially doing a lunge okay where you're going to Lunge with one leg back and the other leg forward of course that's a lunge and then you're going to take the hand on the same side as the leg that's extended behind you reach that toward the ceiling okay and then you're going to rotate pinky clockwise okay the other way to think about this is to put the palm of your hand parallel to the ceiling if you're doing it outside parallel to the sky okay so you're going to get into the longest lunge that you safely can for you okay that's going to differ for everybody and then you're going to raise the arm on the same side as the leg that's extended backward and you're going to go parallel Palm to the sky or to the ceiling this will provide a stretch all the way or you should feel a stretch all the way from your wrist down past your hip and possibly even into the foot that's behind you now Dr Stuart McGill showed me this um I've certainly done Warrior 2 pose in yoga classes and when I've done yoga at home from time to time I wasn't new to raising an arm overhead while stretching in a lunge position but Dr Su Mill was the one who really emphasized that by putting the Palm parallel to the sky to the ceiling and twisting a bit so that you're turning that pinky toward I would say the best way to describe this is to turn that pinky toward your head okay not away from your head but toward your head while still maintaining a flat palm and reaching as much as you can and extending all the way from the heel of that back foot all the way up to your palm that you're getting stretching not just of the soas but they also getting activation of some of the neurofascial aspects going from Palm all the way to heel that provide some relief that is some relaxation of the musculature that otherwise is providing tension of the spine pelvic interface and that can allow for better posture longer spine and at the same time strong spine positioning after you do the exercise and of course you want to do this on both sides now I realize that many of you are just listening to this you're not watching this but even for those of you that are watching on YouTube it's very difficult since I'm seated behind a desk to show you the proper form of this exercise which is why we've provided a link to a visual of this exercise in the show note captions that you can go look at otherwise but hopefully it's clear to you it's basically a lunge front leg slightly bent at the knee back leg perhaps slightly bent but extended behind you so you're in a lunge position arm on the same side as the extended leg raised overhead pum Palm parallel to the ceiling okay with arm extended and turning your wrist a bit so that your pinky is more or less trying to point towards your head although most people including myself probably don't have the flexibility to do that all the way so that your pinky is pointed towards your head I encourage you to experiment with this a little bit until you feel that stretch all the way from hand down to heel it feels really good to do you can hold it for anywhere from 5 to 10 seconds you can exhale or inhale doesn't really matter you can just breathe normally the point here is that you're getting a terrific stretch of the soaz you then switch to the other side get a terrific stretch of the other side soas and after you move out of this pose you will definitely feel as if you sort of have quote unquote lengthen the spine you know the extent to which you have lengthen the spine isn't clear what more likely has happened is that you have some relaxation and perhaps even some lengthening between the spine and pelvic connection so then you can sit upright nice straight spine and you're not being pulled forward by that tighten soas that connects the spine to the pelvis okay so that's sort of the simplest way that I can describe all that it's a wonderful exercise to do you can do it in an airport you can do it when you get home you can do it when you get out of the car it's one of those things that provides a ton of relief in terms of kind of stress and compression and C shaping of the spine from sitting that most all of us are doing too much of these days and as Dr Stu Mill will explain when he comes on the podcast it also provides some both activation and relaxation of the nerve to fascial to muscle interface that's so critical for having a strong and pain-free spine okay so the final protocol I want to share with you today believe it or not is purely mental it's purely cognitive it doesn't involve any movement what it does involve is developing an awareness of your movement patterns As you move through your daily life including exercise but not limited to exercise what do I mean by this well based on what I told you at the beginning of today's episode and throughout today's episode you are now armed with knowledge about the different components of back Anatomy the vertebrae the discs the nerves the muscles and how those relate to one another and how bulging that is herniating of the discs or I would hope not but even rupturing the of the discs or inflammation at a particular spinal segment or maybe tonic static contraction at the level of the neck or lack of strengthen the feet how that could create back pain how that could limit back Mobility how that could limit overall Mobility so the final protocol of today's episode is for you to really pay attention to any pain you might happen to have in your back region and any kind of limitation you have in terms of its ability to manage loads or to generate the kinds of movement that you need for your life what do I mean by this well if you're somebody who has a lot of lower back stiffness lower back pain you might ask yourself okay when I drive when I sit even if I use a standing desk what is the position of my feet are they directly underneath my pelvis am I rounding my back if you're somebody who has a lot of pain in your low to midback and you find just by way of observation that you're rounding your back a lot of the time either because you're texting or typing maybe you need to take a towel roll it up and put it in your lower back region maybe you need to just spend a little bit more time each day not all day but a little bit of time being consciously aware of maintaining a little bit of lower back arch or maybe even a straight back if you can't arch your back in that way if you're somebody who's standing at your standing desk or even just talking to friends or family members do you always lean to one side do you always relax to one hip is that because you're not activating the medial glute on one side more than the other or either or is it because you know you tend to stand with one foot in front of the other or you're not maintaining enough toes spread or you don't have the strength in your feet to kind of stabilize yourself are you relaxed with your breathing and letting your belly go out when you're not exercising these are the sorts of things that once you start to observe and by the way you don't have to become neurotically self- observant all the time about your back and your breathing in your foot position that's not what we want okay that is absolutely not the goal here but if you're experiencing back tightness or shoulder tightness you should ask yourself are you you know constantly like thumbs pointed in shoulders rolled forward are you doing enough pulling exercises to balance out all the pushing exercises you might be doing like push-ups and shoulder presses and bench presses make sure you're balancing the back musculature and the shoulder and chest musculature these kinds of things are extremely valuable to pay attention to because oftentimes the origin of your back pain or the origin of your sciatica or the origin of your neck pain and tension is something that can be fairly simply remedied it doesn't necessarily mean you have an injury maybe you have a small degree of dis bulging and if so what direction is that bulging is it toward the front of your spine the side is it the back and if so what are you going to do to adjust it are you going to do you know one or two sets of those Cobra push-ups each day are you going to put that you know towel rolled up behind your back in order to make sure that that bulge doesn't increase further are you going to avoid doing a lot of crunching in the gym many of you are going to need to avoid doing crunching and finding other ab exercises like the rollup to do in order to still strengthen your abdominals which is so important for stabilizing the spine and having a strong pain-free back but you don't want to generate more forward rolling and bulging of the discs out the back of the spine for all the reasons that are now obvious to you so this final protocol is one that I could go on for hours about but really it's for you to think about for just a couple of minutes for a couple of days and just pay attention to your movement patterns how you stand at rest how you breathe at rest whether or not you're using best possible posture or whether or not you're using postures and patterns of overuse in your daily life and in sport these things can really build up some strong imbalances in neuromuscular activation patterns that over time can translate into pain and even if they don't translate into pain can translate into a weakened back system or put more appropriately a weakened body system where you know you're always sagging one shoulder or you're not breathing properly because your chin is always towards your chest these kinds of things now today's episode is certainly not geared towards fixing every aspect of your posture your movement patterns strengthening your back and removing your back pain however I will say that thanks to the information that's out there from the peer-reviewed literature and from these fabulous practitioners again MDS pts folks even in the Chiropractic Community I say even because oftentimes they take a lot of heat from people in the other communities but again there's a range of quality of practitioners in all these different domains they've really started to explore these different aspects of back strengthening and removing pain from the back in ways that sure they come to the table through different lenses of training right some are going to talk about laser therapy and by the way we didn't cover that on purpose there's a little bit of evidence but it's not super strong for laser therapy for the back okay there I just upset all the people are into laser therapy we'll get into that in a future episode sure there's evidence that Pilates that yoga walking has been shown to be tremendously beneficial for back pain there's wonderful evidence for any and all of those different practices what I've tried to focus on today were prot protols that practitioners who spent most if not all of their careers thinking about strengthening the back and pain proofing the back generally agree on okay I realize there isn't going to be Universal consensus but they generally agree that Stu Mill's big three the curup the side plank the bird dog they generally agree that strengthening the stabilization muscles and Pathways from feet up to hips and all the way to shoulders and top of the head including the neck including breathing in a particular way while relaxed while not exercising again those would be belly breaths ideally through the nose unless you're talking or you're eating making sure that your abdominals are strong not just from crunching but that you're activating the obliques that the muscles between your ribs are strong something that can really benefit from anti-rotation work so that you can generate a stiff stable spine which is great provided you can do that when you want to voluntarily and then you can relax and you can move about your days still in great posture is still in a strong position but without having to brace all the time which is obviously something you don't want to have to do as you move through your life and having a number of different stretches that allow for lengthening of the spine we talked earlier about hanging from a bar with feet touching the ground so that you can create some space to alleviate hopefully some of the disc bulge to nerve impingement that might be causing pain that you might want to do those Cobra type push-ups or those up dog type movements that can provide some kind of pushing back of the cream between the two Oreo cookies that I use as an an analogy for the discs and the spinal segments these are the sorts of things that most all of the data and most all of the experts in the field generally agree on and so I've offered them to you today in the form of this list of protocols there are about a dozen of them I realize again we have links to examples of them in video form in the show note captions I certainly don't expect that everybody's going to do all of these every day that's by no means the expectation think of these more or less as a buffet of things that you could explore and experiment with depending on whether or not you have back pain in which case please proceed towards them with a lot of caution please remember also that I am not saying that epidurals painkillers surgery and other methods for treating back pain are not useful I am certainly not saying that those certainly have their place and yet I would say many people if not many or even all adults could certainly benefit from thinking about how their back interfaces with their pelvis their legs their feet their neck and vice versa and thinking about how to strengthen that entire system by creating a strong core a strong lower back generating the proper movement patterns and doing so through protocols like the ones I described today that don't take a lot of time require zero equipment they're essentially zero cost except for the minimal time investment required and that have been shown time and time again to lead to a stronger pain-free back if you're learning from Andor

Title: Dr. Matt Walker: Using Sleep to Improve Learning, Creativity & Memory | Huberman Lab Guest Series
Published: 2024-04-24 12:00:23 UTC
Description:
This is episode 4 of a 6-part special series on sleep with Dr. Matthew Walker, Ph.D., a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of the best-selling book "Why We Sleep." In this episode, we discuss the relationship between sleep, learning and creativity. 

We explain why and how sleep before and after a learning bout can improve memory and performance for both cognitive tasks and physical skills. We also discuss how to use time learning and sleep, how to use naps, non-sleep deep rest states, and caffeine to optimize learning, and the mechanisms for sleep and memory consolidation. 

We also explain the critical role that sleep plays in creativity and one's ability to discover novel solutions to challenges and problems. 

This episode is filled with actionable information on using sleep to enhance skill learning and improve memory and creativity. 

The next episode in this guest series explains how sleep benefits emotional regulation and mental health.

[Music] welcome to the hubman lab guest Series where I and an expert guest discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine today's episode marks the fourth in our sixth episode series all about sleep with expert guest Dr Matthew Walker during today's episode we discuss sleep and learning as well as the impact of sleep and the specific stages of sleep on creativity and memory we talk about when and how long to sleep relative to different bouts of learning as well as the role of naps in consolidating information that you are trying to learn we discuss the science and Protocols of sleep as it relates to both cognitive learning and motor learning and the mechanism by which sleep encodes memories as with the previous episodes in this series today's episode includes information about the biology of sleep as well as practical tools that is protocols in which you can use sleep to improve your learning memory and creativity before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Helix sleep Helix sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are customized to your unique sleep needs it's abundantly clear that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance when we're getting enough quality sleep everything in life goes so much better and when we are not getting enough quality sleep everything in life is that much more challenging now one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is to have the appropriate mattress everyone however has slightly different needs in terms of what would be the optimal mattress for them Helix understands that people have unique sleep needs and they've designed a brief two-minute quiz that asks you questions like do you sleep on your back your side or your stomach do you tend to run hot or cold during the night or maybe you don't know the answers to those questions if you go to the Helix site and take that brief quiz they'll match you to a mattress that's optimal for you for me it turned out to be the dusk DS mattress it's not too hard not too soft and I sleep so much better on my Helix mattress than on any other type of mattress I've used before so if you're interested in upgrading your mattress go to helixsleep.com huberman take their brief two-minute sleep quiz and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you and you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order and two free pillows again that's helixsleep.com huberman to save up to $350 off and two free pillows today today episode is also brought To Us by whooop whoop is a fitness wearable device that tracks your daily activity and sleep but also goes beyond that by providing real-time feedback on how to adjust your training and sleep schedule to perform better I've been working with whoop on their scientific advisory Council to try and help Advance wop's mission of unlocking Human Performance as a whoop user I've experienced the health benefits of their technology firsthand for sleep tracking for monitoring other features of my physiology and for giving me a lot of feedback about metrics within my brain and body body that tell me how hard I should train or not train and basically point to the things that I'm doing correctly and incorrectly in my daily life that I can adjust using protocols some of which are actually within the whoop app given that many of us have goals such as improving our sleep building better habits or just focusing more on our overall health whoop is one of the tools that can really help you get personalized data recommendations and coaching toward your overall health in addition to being one of the most accurate sleep trackers in the world whoop allows you to recover more quickly and fully from physical exercise and other kinds of stress and thereby to train more effectively and sleep better if you're interested in trying whoop you can go to join. whoop.com huberman today to get your first month free again that's join. woop.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by waking up the waking up app is a meditation app that offers hundreds of guided meditations mindfulness trainings yoga need your sessions and more I started meditating over 30 years ago at that time there wasn't very much science on meditation but by now we know that there's a lot of strong science supporting the fact that a daily meditation practice can improve mood focus and alertness and can reduce stress and improve sleep and overall health one thing that I and many others have noticed is that while meditation is excellent for buffering stress it's often times during periods of stress that we let our meditation practice go the waking up app overcomes this by offering meditations of different durations so they have some longer ones of 30 to 60 minutes but also some much briefer ones 10 five and even one minute meditations that are known to be effective so no matter how busy or stressed you get you always make time for your meditation practice the fact that they have lots of different types of meditations and Yoga Nidra sessions and non-sleep deep rest protocols also make sure that your meditations are kept fresh and interesting you never get bored of them I personally use the waking up app to do a 5 to 10minute meditation or a non-sleep deep rest protocol which is similar to yoga Nedra each and every day and if I miss a day I try and double up the amount of time that I do nsdr Yoga Nidra or medit the following day yoga NRA and non-sleep deep rest protocols can be done essentially any time of day in order to restore mental and physical Vigor I'll sometimes do one first thing in the morning if I wake up and I feel I didn't get quite enough sleep the previous night you can also do yoga NRA or nsdr in the middle of the night if you wake up and you're having trouble falling back asleep sometimes they will allow you to fall back asleep and if they don't you'll still feel more refreshed than you would have had you been tossing and turning and worrying about not getting sleep so nsdr and yoga Nedra are terrific for both restoring mental and physical Vigor and potentially for restoring sleep that you otherwise would have missed if you'd like to try the waking up app you can go to waking up.com huberman to get a free 30-day trial again that's waking up.com huberman and now for my conversation with Dr Matthew Walker Dr Walker Dr hubman welcome back we have covered a lot of material first episode of this series you gave us an overview of sleep and some actionable items about sleep then in the second episode you gave us far more actionable items of how to think about one sleep in a way that leads to very concrete decisions about controlling light temperature when to sleep and then some really in-depth Advanced tools or protocols as we call them and then in the third episode we talked about caffeine and napping and some other things that people can do to really supercharg their alertness through sleep augmentation in the daytime and today we're going to talk about sleep learning in memory and a topic that I know everybody is very interested in creativity indeed resplendant pleasure to be back on the show thank you for having me yeah absolutely so I think nowadays most people understand that there's some relationship between sleep and learning but I think think it would still be a good idea for us to zoom out a bit and establish what that relationship is you know I I think most people are familiar with being exposed to some new material cognitive material physical uh skill material and not being able to learn it right away but then having a few days in between and then all of a sudden voila yeah there's uh the skill has been embedded it seems but not obvious in that scenario is that sleep is perhaps the pivotal event that allowed the learning process to take place so how do you think about sleep as it relates to learning and memory I think I've conceptualized it in three different stages or three different buckets of a benefit the first is that we need sleep before learning to prepare your brain to initially imprint and lay those memory traces down but then you need to sleep after learning to take those sort of freshly minted memories and then save them and cement them into the brain so that you don't lose them the third domain is that sleep will then take those new memories that you've been learning and it will start to collide them with all of this back catalog of information that you've already got stored in your brain and it updates the iOS of your informational systems so that then you come back the next day and you have a better abled ability to understand how the world Works in other words the difference between knowledge which is learning the facts and wisdom which is knowing what it all means when you put it together that's the third category and why is that beneficial because it provides you with creative insights and so we will will perhaps just double click on each of those three and I can I can expand them because the data behind them is utterly fascinating as you said I think many people subjectively have a sense that sleep helps me with my memory in some way but in what way and for people I think one of the things that you do here is not just protocols but you help explain the conceptual understanding or the conceptual mechanisms underlying the reasons for all of the these protocols and I would love to dive into detail yeah so let's do that let's talk about this business of sleeping before learning you know essentially establishing a millu within the brain that is optimal for learning what what is that about and neurochemically at the level of circuits and um what is the evidence that providing some I don't know additional sleep or just adequate sleep prior to the exposure to the new material can be beneficial yeah I that word that optimal millu and it beautifully describes what we found we started off asking a very simple question at my sleep center is pulling the allnighter a wise idea so we took a group of perfectly healthy smart individuals and we assigned them to one of two experimental groups a sleep group and a sleep deprivation group and both of those groups went through those two different protocols and then the next next day after sleep or after no sleep we put them inside of a brain scanner and we had them try and learn a whole list of new facts as we were taking snapshots of brain activity and then we tested them to see how effective that learning had been when we looked at the group that had had a full night of sleep they had incredibly efficient learning capacity so in other words they had learned and imprinted that information initially very well well when we looked at the sleep deprivation group not so much in fact there was a 40% deficit in the ability of the brain to make new memories without sleep and we've used lots of different types we've replicated that now we've had visual information we've had textbook like information and the range is somewhere between 20 to 40% I find that by the way striking and we can come back to this based on what we are seeing in our Educational Systems right now there is this parcity of sleep because of this model of early school start times and I'll explain exactly what's happened there and what we've been doing to try to change that but coming back to those two groups the Sleep group and the sleep deprivation group what was going on as you said inside of the brain that would help us understand why they couldn't learn or at least couldn't learn effectively and the structure that we focused on is one you've spoken about before called the hippocampus and you have one on the left side and the right side of your brain it looks like a long cigar that runs down the left and right side of your brain and people listening can think of the hippocampus almost like the informational inbox of your brain it's very good at receiving new memory files and then holding on to them and when we looked at that structure and its activity during learning in the Sleep group they had wonderful powerful activation of the hippocampus as if it was gobbling up all of that new information into the inbox when we looked at the sleep deprivation group however we couldn't find any significant signal whatsoever so it was almost as though sleep deprivation had shut down the memory inbox and any new incoming files they were just being bounced you couldn't effectively commit new experiences to memory and then subsequent stes that were not done by us but uh looking at animal models they were looking at how able the synapses are in that memory structure the hippocampus how capable those synapses are for building new connections and the synapses are just those connections between neurons and we think that part of the way that we make memories is by strengthening the connection in the memory circuit itself and what they found was that when they restricted the sleep of these rats or the mice that part of the brain became very stubborn it just wouldn't form those new synaptic connections and something that we call synaptic plasticity so we started to understand this was the bad that happened when you take sleep away but let's come back to that control group that I said got a full night of sleep exactly what is it about sleep when you do get it that seems to support and promote your learning ability so we decided just do another different study instead of manipulating sleep by dialing it down we instead tried to dial it up by way of a daytime nap and again we took two groups and we had them initially learn again a huge amount of factual information they learned it over and over and over again and then we brought them back 6 hours later at 6pm and now we had them learn a whole new set of information and after each one of of those fresh novel learning sessions we tested them to see how effective that learning had been again one of those groups spent that 6 hours of time awake doing just relaxing activities the other group was able to obtain a 90-minute nap and we Ed that 90-minute nap to allow them to go through a full sort of average cycle to get some non-rem and to get some REM what was interesting is that when we tested the group that remained awake later that fall following day the learning capacity had declined but in the nap group it seemed to restore the brain's capacity to learn and you didn't get that decline in memory in fact if anything you got a little boost and the difference between those two was about 20% so it's quite a nice benefit yeah not trivial not trivial at all and then we said okay well if sleep is doing something what is it about that sleep so we unpacked the physiology of sleep and the different stages of sleep that we discussed in the first episode and what we found was that it was the nonrapid eye movement sleep or the non-rm sleep and particularly those sleep spindles those short bursts of electrical activity that we have discussed before that seemed to predict how restored and refreshed your learning ability was and the best way that I've been thinking about this in terms of sleep storing or refreshing your encoding ability and it's a crash analogy and I don't mean to make a direct brain to computer analogy but think of that hippocampus almost like a USB stick that's very good during the day at going around and grabbing new files but it has a limited storage capacity and what sleep was doing seemed to be shifting those memories from the USB stick of your hippocampus over up to the cortex which you can think of almost like your hard drive a much bigger storage capacity and by way of doing that when you woke up after the nap or after a full night of sleep you had this cleared out USB stick so what could you do you could go around and start acquiring all these new files again so that started to teach us a little bit about why sleep before learning is critical but also mechanistically how sleep is doing this remarkable work of memory restoration we then wanted to say well can we translate this out into the real world and I think there are two regions that we've moved this workout into one is education one is is medicine and Alzheimer's disease but the education piece was very interesting in the United States I think the last time I checked the average school start time is somewhere around 7:30 745 sounds about right and if you think about that for 7:30 school start time school buses will begin leaving around 5:30 5:45 in the morning mhm that means that some kids are having to wake up at 5:00 a.m. maybe even earlier this is lunacy when you think about it there's a great study in edner I hope I'm pronouncing that correct edner which is a small suburb or it sits in a small suburb outside of Minneapolis in Minnesota and they shifted their school start times from 7:25 5 to 8:30 in the morning and then they wanted to ask what is the consequence of that on the academic performance of their students and the metric that they used in these teenagers that they were focusing on was something called the SAT score which is a score I had to learn when I first came to the United States is a critical assessment test that will largely determine which university you go to and they did an analysis which was clever they focused on the top 10% performing students which you could argue those are the ones that are closest to the ceiling performance and the hardest to expect any benefit from sleep so in the year before they made the time change the average score of those top 10% performing students was 1,288 which turns out to be a pretty good SAT score the following year after they made the time change the average score for that top 10% was 1,500 that difference is non-trivial and it will change exactly where those individuals will go to university in terms of the tier of the university and likely change the trajectory of their lives as a consequence now some people have argued that data you know in terms of its source and its reliability may not have necessarily been accurate but now we've got very consistent data when you start school times later academic grades improve psychological and psychiatric problems decrease truancy rates decrease but something else happened in that story of later school start times that we didn't expect which was that the life expectancy of students increased and you think well hang on a second how do you determine that the number one cause of death in teenagers 16 to 18 is actually not suicide turns out to be second it's road traffic accidents and here sleep matters enormously there was another great example from tetan County in Wyoming and they shifted their school start times from I think it was 7:35 in the morning to 8:55 and the only thing more remarkable than the extra 1 hour of sleep those kids reported getting was the drop in car accidents that following year there was a 70% reduction in car crashes in that age range of 16 to 18 what time are they getting out of school well they will probably be ejected out of school that's another interesting part by the way maybe around 4:30 and people have said well look all of this idea of later school start times it means that it's going to cost us more cuz you've got to change the school bus system and they've argued push back against that and I would say probably two things first I know it's difficult and I'm not saying it's an easy problem to do it's a complex problem and I'm sympathetic to that but I I think we've put people on the moon and so I suspect that we can also solve the problem of early school start times the the other component of that is what are we doing as Educators if our goal as educat is true truly to educate and not risk lives in the process then we are failing our children in a most spectacular manner with this incessant model of early school start times and if you look at the data it's very clear when sleep is abundant Minds flourish and when it's not they don't and so that's the reason why myself and a whole group of sleep scientists we started to try to create a movement for later school start times and we got this bill passed firstly in California we got it on the governor's desk at the time who was governor uh Brown and unfortunately he didn't sign it into law then when the organization changed and Governor nusum came in as governor of California we got the bill back on the on his desk and he did sign it and then uh the next state to go was New York they started to put in legislation for recommendations for later school start times I think Florida is about to fall as well in that regard so there's gradual movement happening but it's hard fought and it's it's problematic I still think that it's it's impossible to deny that data I mean it was an interesting thing I remember when I was a professor back at Harvard we were doing this work on sleep and and learning and they said and it was sort of published in these sort of um kindly I don't know how we did it but in nice journals and they said okay based on the media attraction would you write an editorial for the Harvard newspaper which was called the Harvard Crimson I said I'd love to so at first I thought I'm just going to write a straight piece about sleep and memory and why it's important then I realized no there's a better opportunity because teaching there and you know this as well as I do there is this bizarre system where we teach for an entire semester and then we endload the semester full of exam in this stressful 2E period and what do you think is going to happen they're not going to sleep especially at a time when they're trying to cram information so especially in college where you don't actually have the material four weeks before so there's not really the option to learn it in advance no everything's about University to me was about getting a bunch of information and needing to incorporate it very quickly and then move to the next item right next item next item and then all of a sudden there's this cataclysmic moment at the end of the semester and you are supposed to regurgitate this by cramming everything into your brain in this Sleepless twoe period so rather than saying look the students need to change their behavior they need to understand this is problem it's not their fault I said it's us as Educators and administrators we have created a system that forces them to undergo deliberate sleep deprivation and we are educating them amnesic quite literally so I put this uh editorial out it received a um a rather Baltic if not Arctic response and um that was the last editorial I was ever invited to to write for the newspaper but you know you've got to say your piece well so but I'm curious why there's resistance to shifting to later School times and to improving the conditions for learning if the goal is to learn I mean tradition dies hard um maybe that's why um I think there's also the idea certainly in the medical profession that you know well when I was doing my training we would pull all nighters all the time um and so the idea then is that it's just part of The self-directed Hazing process that is getting a degree that you're going to be doing a lot of allnighters and cramming and things of that sort is that is that why you think motivates the the resistance to change I think so I think you've hit all the points I think you know Zeitgeist die one generation at a time and we see that resistance certainly there too I also think that when you come back to later school start times they have suggested that there is this cost when they tally it up but you made a point which is when did they get out of school and let's say it's around 4:30 one of the interesting analyses that was published and we latched on to this that is this strange bewitching hour when kids get out of school but often their parents are not home to work and if you look at the Teenage Crime rate and you look at when those crimes are committed it's usually in that bewitching hour after they get out of school but they don't have a home or parents yet to go to that filled but by pushing school start times later they get out later they go home and if you were to even half that debt that those crimes cause you would easily pay for the education system so it's very interesting I think that also notion of well we went through it and here I am so you can go through it too is very prevalent in medicine this is another good example we and mostly um colleagues at mine such as Charles Eisler at Harvard have really done a great job job at cataloging exactly why we need to abandon this resident program which has a fascinating history by the way which is Young residents should be working 30-hour shifts often without any sleep whatsoever and when you look at that data residents who are working a 30-hour shift are going to be almost 460 more likely to make diagnostic errors in the Intensive Care Unit if you have a surgeon and you're getting elective surgery who's had less than 6 hours of sleep in the previous 24 they are almost 70% more likely to cause a surgical error which could result in non-trivial consequences and then the irony is that when young residents after a 30-hour shift get back into their car at the end of the shift and drive home there is 168% increased risk that they get into a car accident and then end up back in the ER from where they just came but now as a patient rather than a physician and you think what are we doing I Charles SE I think has described they provided this evidence to the council and at first they just I think the idea was look our minds are made up don't confuse me with the data and you appeal on the empathetic basis but it wasn't well received so then if you go back and you say no I'm going to give you a different argument if you look at the cost of malpractice caused by insufficient sleep and if you get the administrators into the room all of a sudden the schedules change so then based on that data there was a policy that you couldn't work any longer than I think it was a 16h hour continuous shift the problem was that they only said that that was apparent for the first year residence and not the remaining years and the question was well why I said well the data that you showed us you only collected in firste Residence as if something magical was going to happen when you become a second-year resident and you Dawn this TEF long coat of immunity against sleep deprivation well if anything it would compound to get worse so so it seems to me that um there's there's like zero question that getting adequate sleep is good for learning but and when the stakes when it's high-risk High consequences scenarios or even high consequences scenarios like a medical situation um just seems like uh should almost come down to Legal liability yeah I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens and is designed to meet all of your foundational nutritional needs by now I'm sure you've all heard me say that I've been taking ag1 since 2012 and indeed that is true now of course I do consume regular Whole Foods every day I strive to get those Foods mostly from unprocessed or minimally processed sources however I do find it hard to get enough servings of fruits and vegetables each day so with ag1 I ensure that I get enough of the vitamins minerals Prebiotic fiber and other things typically found in fruits or vegetables and of course I still make sure to eat fruits and vegetables and in that way provide a sort of insurance that I'm getting enough of what I need in addition the adaptogens and other micronutrients in ag1 really help buffer against stress and ensure that the cells and organs and tissues of my body are getting the things they need people often ask me that if they were going to take Just One supplement what that supplement should be and I always answer ag1 if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer you'll get five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman so are the errors of sleep deprivation in these scenarios both in students and medical professional are they due to errors in memory per se I mean so I mean because you can imagine all sorts of Errors so with a surgeon they like cut the wrong thing or they cut too far the margin on the surgical side is too big Etc but since we're talking about learning in memory um and its relationship to sleep uh is it that people are forgetting what they did are they forgetting what they didn't do I mean um or is it a deficit in motor skills or all of the above it's all of the above above plus which is that learning in memory your recollection of both what you did or what you need to do or what you should do based on your training is going to be compromised because your recall of that information it turns out is also compromised but it's also decision-making too that what we know is that your frontal lobe is especially sensitive to a lack of sleep and it's that frontal lobe that really takes complex situations to Stills them down and comes up with the correct output scenario of decisions that you need to make not so much when you're sleep deprived so how should I establish the proper neural millu for learning by sleeping prior should I make sure that I I mean in an Ideal World I get excellent night sleep for the you know every day of my life leading up to about of learning being Expo and here I'm referring to about of learning as being exposed to new material but life happens um so if I know that tomorrow I'm going to take a class in something or I'm going to need to perform a skill that it's pretty nent skill for me I only learned it recently what should I do the night before I would say think about what you can get in terms of your sleep under current conditions and understand that that is staying awake and foregoing sleep is not the right equation that you may think in other words think of sleep that night as an investment in tomorrow rather than a cost opportunity of now or today that would be the message I think for learning in memory some people will say logically and rationally well but if I stay awake I can at least be learning and going over that material for many more hours so doesn't that compensate for me going to bed let's say I haven't learned it well enough well surely I should just you know say I I should just focus and stay awake CU at least then I can just go over the material Time and Time and Time Again doesn't that offset the the deficit and to a degree it does we did that study but what was really interesting is that the next day were you able to at least learn and recall some of that information to a degree yes you were and the more that you kept going over it the better you performed even when you were not getting sufficient sleep but then we did something interesting we then brought them back we haven't published this this day I should do we brought them back a month later and then we tested them again and what you find is that the group that slept was far better able to have retained and remember that information whereas the group that did not sleep as much they performed much more similar to the group that got a full night of sleep the next day but when you test them a month later almost none of that material is residing in their brain anymore got it so this is the cramming effect that's right right and and if one knows this from teaching university courses um or if they've crammed that you can learn a bunch of material but then you regurgitate it for the exam and then it's gone yeah so so it's almost like a it just never passes from short-term to long-term memory essentially that's correct okay and that seems to be in some ways that's a beautiful description of then what happens next in the Sleep process it's not just about sleep before learning you then have to sleep after learning to do exactly what you just described so I have an class in the morning or I'm going to learn something new the next day afternoon my goal presumably should be to maximize the amount of sleep I get and to be on the same sleep schedule so this gets back to qqr that was presented in the first episode quantity quality regularity and timing I people should refer to that um nothing wrong with your memory by the way well I don't know about that but um the um the qqt formula was was described in the first episode um let's come up with a what I think is a fairly common scenario so I like to go to bed early between 800 and 9:00 p.m. I discovered this recently thanks to conversations with you this is clearly what works best for me I kind of always inted it but I um it clearly is what works best if I go to bed at 10:00 I probably want to wake up sometime around I don't know 6:00 a.m. or or 6:30 and um if I go to bed any later than 10:30 I start running into problems I don't feel good the next day even if I get sufficient hours of sleep so this is the importance of regularity and timing keeping things more or less locked to that 8:30 to 9:30 to bedtime for me 4:30 to 5:30 wake up time that's me just by way of example in an Ideal World therefore I would stick to that schedule wake up the next day and go do my learning or my performance of something that I'd learned someone else might have the chronotype we're going to bed at 11:00 p.m. and waking up at 7:30 a.m. is their preferred schedule however often because of travel because of courses because of Life circumstances the night before something critical that we need to learn or to perform some critical task physical or cognitive the Sleep the night before is disrupted in some way either by virtue of timing or quantity and then of course by extension regularity so is there anything that we can do heading into a bout of learning meaning the night preceding that bout of learning that can kind of um provide a buffer or or set us up for the best possible learning scenario if we're not able to stick to our perfect schedule I think there may be two things there's been a little bit of work that's been done um to suggest that caffeine may actually enhance the hippocampus this memory encoding structure and boost its ability to encode now what they haven't yet done is the study where you sleep deprive someone then you give them caffeine the next day and then you have them try to learn and ask can caffeine by way of its effect on the hippocampus rescue and restore what would otherwise be an encoding deficit now that is entirely possible and I think it's a fascinating question by how much we don't know but if it doesn't it's equally likely that the hippocampus by way of being sleep deprived is not receptive to the benefit of caffeine under conditions of sleep deprivation and I told you in the rat studies when those rats were deprived the hippocampus once again became stubborn in its ability to form new synapses and it may be that it's equally stubborn to receive the normal benefit of caffeine when you are sleep rested but I would love to do that study the second is to then say well if I have the choice of when I'm going to be learning during the day let's say that you've had a bad night of sleep or you just had a short night of sleep non-negotiable couldn't do anything about it and the next day I've got to cram in some information I would say think about your chronotype and think about when you are at your best operating temperature so your scenario let's say going to bed at 9: waking up at 4:35 your Peak is probably going to be maybe 10 11:00 in the morning where your biology and your Cadian rhythm is on its almost Crescendo Peak at that point we know for Cadian influences on learning and this is independent of sleep influences on learning that's where things are better now for me you actually described me which is I'm a kind of an 11 to 730 type person for me it's probably going to be much closer to about midday or 1: p.m. where I feel at my operating Peak both for physical performance and also mental performance so if you've got the choice and you are underslept there's nothing you can do about the sleep that you've lost the night before but at least recognize that your Cadian rhythm is going to come to your rescue and help offset that as long as you time you're learning to that known peak of your Cadian Rhythm does that help a little bit yes that that makes good sense so the idea gets us back to something you described in previous episodes which is that you have this sleep pressure due to the buildup of the molecule adenosine which the longer we are awake the more adenosine in our nervous system which makes us sleepy but separate from that there's this circadian circadia about 24-hour Rhythm right um that causes fairly dramatic shifts in wakeful fullness and sleepiness independent of the adenosine signal now sometimes the two signals overlap so that late in the evening for instance we have a lot of adenosine we've been up all day and our circadian rhythm is such that our alertness is starting to diminish so they're aligned and in the early part of the day assuming everything is normal the adenosine levels are low because we slept well the night before and our circadian rhythm is on the upswing so to speak um and we are alert so if I understand correctly the goal is to of course Maxim the quality quantity regularity and timing of sleep qqr but that in the absence of the ability to really anchor any one of those things to 10 out of 10 you know A+ performance if one knows that okay typically around you know between 10:00 a.m. and noon is when I'm at my sharpest that would be the time to be exposed to new material or ideally take an exam if one can control that sort of thing and then perhaps in the afternoon there's another opportunity be uh after the postp perenial dip that's right but before the post perenial dip sometime between 1 and 4 pm usually lasting about an hour to 90 minutes this is a dip natural dip in energy but then after that is another opportunity to learn um sure there'll be a lot of adenosine in one system because you've been a long time um but the Circadian system is on its sort of uh upswing again before the down swing that occurs in the evening is that right right opportunities um and by the way it's strange you were to ask if you look at the Cadian Rhythm right before sort of bedtime there is this sort of strange little blip this peak um that Folks at um back at Harvard have have discovered and you think well why would my Cadian system which needs to really ratchet down for us to get to sleep well why would it have this little Jag upwards in the evening hours right before we need to sleep and it then drops precipitously right makes no sense until you think about Evolution because after foraging for food during the day what you need is this final spurt to get you home safely to your nest or to your home yeah to batten down the hatches exactly so there is this beautiful little built-in Cadian upswing to say okay I know you're returning to home this is probably a time when there's some maybe Potential Threat to you I'm going to just boost your alertness very quickly so you travel home safely good to go great and now I stopped my downswing I think this is a really important thing for people to know about um I'm familiar with the data uh although just in top Contour but the idea here as I understand it is that many people will feel like okay around 6:00 p.m. 6:30 they're getting sleepy 7:30 8:00 p.m. and then they want to get to bed at 10:30 and suddenly for them based on their chronotype around 9:00 p.m. they're like Wide Awake second wind right the second wind and they're like oh no I need to sleep tonight um now maybe it's the case that they're a they would be better off going to bed far earlier and waking up earlier the next morning but in many cases it's just that transient 45 to 6 you know 70 minute window of increased uh alertness this kind of um uptick in the in the Circadian system so this two shell pass and then also just set yourself up for success and we discuss a little bit about the methods of really ratcheting things down dimming Down the Lights having a tiet alarm these types of things will just gradually back you off and after that second wind comes give you the greatest ability to decline physiologically which then permits this beautiful thing called Sleep to come in its place well speaking of sleep postar learning um what is the role of sleep that follows about of learning and here again we want to Define learning as the exposure to novel information that one is trying to encode either cognitive information motor information or or combination of the two um and I say that because learning AKA neuroplasticity has many different stages it's a process not an event but um so let's say that uh earlier in the day I took a dance class Lord knows I need one or um you and both or a musical lesson or was exposed to some interesting information who knows maybe on a podcast and I was you know trying to engage in that information and and pay attention and then that night I I plan to sleep um or perhaps one could take a nap after this bout of learning how close to the learning episode about as I'm calling it does the sleep have to arrive in order for sleep to maximize the amount of learning that occurs is very good question which is what would happen if I were to be learning information and I'm listening to um this odd British gentleman should I then immediately dive into bed so that I maximize the retention of that information and the answer is no don't worry and I'll come back to why not to worry um but to your point not only do you need sleep before learning as we've been discussing but there is something unique and equally necessary of and causally necessary I should say for sleep after learning but it does something different sleep before learning gets your brain ready to lay down those new memory traces after you've imprinted them into the brain sleep after learning then takes those freshly minted memories and then it strengthens them it all essentially it's almost like sleep will hit the save button on those new memories so that you don't forget so in other words sleep is future proofing that information within your brain so that you don't forget and then the question and we've been able to and we and many others have replicated this in fact it's nothing new if you look at the literature on this sleep after learning um gig it goes back as best we can tell to 1929 although I'll argue with that in a second but two researchers Jenkins and dback did a landmark study they had participants learn a whole bunch of nonsense syllables and they had them learn them over and over and over again and gradually they got better and then they started to test them across an 8 hour period they tested them 2 hours later 4 hours later 6 hours later and 8 hours later the only difference is that in one of those testing sessions that 2 hours 4 hours 6 hours 8 hours was a cross awaking day in the other they had them learn that information to near Perfection before sleep just as they did in the waking group but now they woke them up after 2 hours and tested them after 4 hours and tested them after 6 hours and then again when they woke up in the morning 8 hours later and what they found is that in those people who stayed awake after learning there was essentially just catastrophic forgetting the amount of information 2 hours 4 hours 6 hours 8 hours later just declined dramatically but when they repeated that in the same individuals after learning things to the same degree 2 hours 4 hours later memory was starting to decline but after about two and a half three hours of being asleep all of a sudden sleep had fixated those memories almost like um like an animal that's been trapped in Amber and set in Amber like a fossil and then those memories just would not Decay any further and you retained them what was stunning about that study is it has been replicated time and time again that's not the surprising part the surprising part is that in that study they tested a vast number of subjects in fact a sum tootal of two participants but what's stunning is that that finding has gone and been replicated time and time again so that demonstrated to us that there's something special about sleep that is concretizing almost literally like taking things and setting it in concrete and then the question became again mechanistically how how is it and it's important to understand mechanism because it has ramifications for diseases and Medicine how is sleep doing this fantastic saving of memories and we now have at least two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms so in other words both seem to occur the first is what we call memory translocation sleep and particularly what we found for fact-based memories and I should note by the way that this story of sleep after learning is a two-part or it runs in two different narratives one is sleep after learning for fact-based memory what we describe as declarative memory and you've uh done a fantastic uh previous episode on working memory and describe all of these different types of memory so one story line has been sleep after learning for fact-based memory but the other which is equally interesting is sleep for non declarative or procedural skill memory in other words what we think of as motor memory but I'll come back to motor memory in a second what we then found for this sleep and textbook like memory is that there are two mechanisms the first translocation and here what we found is that it's deep nonrem sleep for fact-based memories and it's those big slow powerful brain waves that we spoke about in the first episode combined with those sleep spindles that ride on top of them almost like a surfer on a huge amplitude wave and it's the combination of those two brain waves that acts like a file transfer mechanism and it moves and shifts memories from a short-term vulnerable Reservoir the hippocampus to the more permanent long-term storage site the cortex in the brain and therefore protect protecting them and making them safe so that's one mechanism is the the shifting of memories around the brain and through different storage sites from short term to long term the second I think is perhaps even more fascinating it's called memory replay and this was discovered back in the probably 1990s Bruce mcnorton um at the University of Arizona working with a young Matt Wilson who not uh I'm Matt Walker he's Matt Wilson at MIT now they were looking at rats and they were looking at how rats learn a maze and they had these electrodes in these hippocampal brain regions um these memory related regions that we've been discussing and they were listening to the individual firing patterns of those memory cells in the hippocampus as they were running around the Maze and sure enough as they ran around the maze statistically you would build up what looked like the signature pattern of learning so think about those neurons that they each had a special tone to them and as the rat is running around the maze you can hear the signature of learning I just me it over and over again but then they did something clever when the rats went to sleep after learning they kept listening what did they hear they didn't just hear noise they heard that same memory signature replayed however it wasn't replayed at the same speed it was replayed somewhere between 10 to 20 times faster so now all of a sudden instead of hearing you heard just going over and over again and what we've learned is that this replay of memories for that type of information now for rats that's the version essentially of that spatial navigation is their version of fact-based memory and I won't go into detail but yeah cuz navigating novel environments is especially important for all species but rodents to know where they cashed food where escapes are and things of that sort yeah perhaps even more so than as humans that locational memory is necessary and nowadays there's Google Maps and Uber and things of that sort but in the the old days as it were I recall the the London taxi drivers were considered the um you know the world heavyweight champions of of uh memory and there were some decent brain imag studies of their hippocamp ey and indeed they have amazing spal memory of the city of London um now that's probably changed because of Google Maps there there's no need to rely on on um internal memory stores when you have no you still actually there's still a now you can drive you know these ridea apps but for London taxi drivers they still have to go through in some ways it's almost like a hazing it's called the knowledge and if you if you are visiting London you will see these strange guys who are going around on mopeds and they just have this huge kind of map in front of them and they are doing the knowledge which is that they are learning exquisitly the entire road map of London and what they found in those studies was that the size of the hippocampus this memory structure related to fact-based memories and also spatial memories was significantly larger in cab drivers than it was in matched controls now you could say well this is a self- selecting process that people who already have large hippocampi as we would say they're just going to be the people who can do the knowledge well and pass as it were but what they also found was that a correlation the longer that you've been doing the knowledge and being a taxi driver the bigger and bigger your hippocampus so it's time on task so coming back to the the the rats in this spatial learning it's almost as though sleep after learning is taking that memory trace and it's like etching into a glass surface you just go over that memory circuit over and over again and you're strengthening that memory circuit what was also fascinating however I would I'm telling you that it's during non-r sleep that you do all of this memory replay and certainly what we found is that for textbook memory it's deep non-rem sleep that's the important stage of sleep but Matt Wilson published at MIT an interesting study looking at REM sleep what happens to the memory Trace in REM sleep and REM sleep which we know is associated with dreaming there the memory replay didn't slow back down to normal waking speed it slowed down even further to point five times relative to waking speed so the waking speed versus the dreaming speed in dreaming sort of in REM sleep I should say because we don't know if rats dream or not but in REM sleep things had slowed down by essentially 50% and this comes back to our conversation in a previous episode that we had about time and you and I were discussing how there's this strange phenomenon where you are woken up by your alarm and you're in a dream and you have a snooze button that lasts 5 minutes you hit the snooze button you go back to sleep and you feel as though you've been dreaming for I don't know 10 minutes 15 minutes but it's been 5 minutes in the real world but time has slowed down time has dilated it's almost like a satina that's stretched out and all of a sudden we were finding in or Matt Wilson because we don't do animal research was finding that this replay was slowed down by 50% so I always wonder whether or not there is neuronal evidence that helps us explain why dreams seem to pack more time despite being in real world time a shorter amount absolutely fascinating yeah I have to imagine that um rat dream and dog dream and other animal stream I mean why wouldn't they um you know if uh all the components of REM sleep that are expressed in humans appear in these animals and vice versa you imagine it almost has to be the case it does and I think there is some interesting supportive evidence that you can argue there is a sleep disorder that we understood in humans first called rapid eye movement disorder or REM sleep behavioral disorder and in the first episode we said that one of the fascinating features of REM sleep which is when we principally dream is that your brain and specifically your brain stem paralyzes your body so that your mind can dream safely so you're shut down into this motor paralysis incarceration rightly so but what also happens is that as we get older it seems to be particularly more so in men than in women but it can be both both once we get past our 50s there's a higher likelihood that that mechanism starts to degrade and you can start to act out your dreams now this is not sleepwalking or sleeptalking that actually comes from deep non-rm sleep and there what happens is that there is a trigger an Awakening either a brain response almost like a stress response that wakes the brain up and you're in the deepest stages of sleep and you are trying to get forced back up to wakefulness sort of the back to that analogy of going from the basement to the to the penthouse and instead you just get locked into this mixed state of consciousness of and as a consequence you start to enact very root basic behaviors you'll go over to the refrigerator open the door close the door pick up a glass put it to your mouth put it back down and if you wake someone up which you shouldn't necessarily do unless there's there's harm that and ask them what was going through your mind just a few minutes minutes ago they all say nothing and the reason is because it wasn't coming from dream sleep it was from deep non-re sleep I see however there is a very different condition that sometimes people will mix up as the very same thing which is REM sleep behavioral disorder and there you're acting out your dreams it can be quite violent some people have enacted violence on their partner and woken up and being absolutely devastated I bring this up however because human beings are not the only species that suffers from REM sleep Behavioral disorder dogs suffer from this as well and when you see it and you can understand it's very clear you have electrodes on the head they go into this REM sleep State and all of a sudden they come out of the paralysis and they start enacting what very much looks like a behavior of wakefulness it's quite complex and at that point you look at that and you say okay I'm I'm sorry but that looks very much like dreaming now we can't of of course ask dogs a question you know what was going through your mind you can ask them but they're not going yeah but yeah you can ask them but it turns out that the response is is less than it's just a look to say give me a treat but you know in science sometimes if it looks like a duck talks like a duck walks like a duck maybe it's a duck what what about um this phenomenon which I've experienced before of being asleep presumably in rapid eye movement sleep and being completely paralyzed but then waking up and I'm still in paralysis but I'm not asleep and um this was a long time ago uh probably the 10th grade which for me I was what 15 years old I'm 48 now and um it was at a party that I I fell asleep on the couch and I goodness I I don't believe in underage drinking but there's a there's a possibility that I might have been inebriated I I was kids parents that you know I I just I actively dissuade young people from drinking and many older people from drinking but yeah I started drinking far too young um and but I remember I drank the night before I got drunk the night before again something I'm not um suggesting or proud of I woke up and I was wide awake gosh I remember this so well and I was paralyzed I could not move and it was terrifying and then all of a sudden boom I could jolt myself awake and I was like oh my goodness and um it must have been in an invasion of that atonia that sleep induced paralysis into the waking state so I can explain this and you have this is the perfect prototypical situation when we see this what you're describing to me is something that many people listening will have experienced called REM sleep paralysis and it's not necessarily a problem or a sign of a condition that you need to be worried about although if it's happening frequently we can think about that what Norm happens when we wake up out of REM sleep and REM sleep as we spoke about in the first episode dominates the second half of the night and particularly the last quarter of the night as you're coming out of REM sleep and waking up out of REM sleep which you know you've got a 50 50% chance perhaps cu the other state that you're in a stage two light non REM as you're coming out of REM sleep you're regaining Consciousness to the external world and then normally in lock step with that perfect lock step if not a little before your brain is realizing this and it's releasing you from the paralysis and we all wake up and we don't even think about it I just wake up and I lean over I turn off you know the alarm and I get out of bed everything's fine every now and again however the waking up and Consciousness re-engaging occurs however the brain does not release you from the REM sleep paralysis so at that point it's almost like a locked in body phenomenon and it's very frightening because because you begin to be aware of your surroundings but you cannot make any voluntary movements because I told you that the voluntary sceletal muscle system is imper by the atonia the absence of muscle your involuntary you're still breathing and all but your eyelids turn out to be part of your voluntary muscle set so you can't lift up your eyelids and then normally what happens is that it's associated with a strong sense of often an in Rudder it seems to be if you're doing it sort of in bed by yourself at home now your context was a little different and it turns out that if you look at these descriptions of sleep paralysis where you can't wake up you can't shout out you can't move you have this sense of another presence or another being in the room it adequately explains most if not all alien abduction stories because when was the last time you saw a news article or on the news that someone said okay today it was very clear that Jimmy in Wisconsin in the middle of the day was abducted by aliens and everyone saw it you know you're at the meeting table and whoosh what happened that was Jimmy he just got whisked off by alien doesn't happen that way it's normally that you're in bed at night it's the early morning hours just before you're waking up these aliens came into the room they injected something into you they paralyzed you you couldn't shout you couldn't move it's simply REM sleep paralysis now when do we see that there are ways and not ways because these are not protocols that we advise there are circumstances where the probability of that increases and I've experienced this too when you are sleep deprived or you are highly stressed the likelihood that you will experience these REM sleep paralysis events upon Awakening is increased and for me it was happening when I was um a a young uh PhD student and I was studying sleep and then I would be awake all night because I'd be monitoring the patients and looking at their sleep the irony of sleep studies exactly that you have to deprive yourself of the very thing that you are trying to study and is which by the way gives you some amazing insights for experiments that I've had as a consequence not that I would advise that as the way and we'll come on to why that's not wise when we speak about creativity but we were um doing these studies and then I would go home and then I would take a short period of sleep maybe just 2 and 1 half hours of sleep and then I would wake up I didn't want to cuz I was ready to go deep into sleep but I would wake up and then I would force myself to be awake throughout the day and try to get to bed at a reasonable time because if I slept all day what's going to happen I'm just going to be awake all the next night and I'm going to be out of my rhythm but what's interesting is that when I would wake up then I would be waking up maybe at 10 10 a.m. in the morning 11: and at that point if you're sleeping there with someone like my face you are in a very REM sleep Desiring state that it's in those last morning hours and into the early morning hours when your brain wants to devour off the menu of sleep stages this thing called REM in vast quantities so I was sleep deprived Point number one second I was going into a very REM sleep Rich phase in other words higher likelihood of paralysis and that occurred to me your description is also prototypical you've been drinking the night before went out to the party we spoke about in one of our previous episodes that one of the problems with alcohol is that it's very good at blocking your REM sleep so you'd been absent of REM sleep the PRI night you built up what we call a REM sleep debt and when you slept all of a sudden what your brain wanted more because it at least got some sleep and there you're going to get mostly your deep sleep the death on the sheets of your balance account for sleep was not so great for deep nonrem but you were very much in debt with REM so what happened as soon as you conked out on the couch whoosh you were probably straight into REM sleep and then when you woke up you had this mismatch in timing between Consciousness and the release of paralysis what did you experience REM sleep paralysis love it I mean hate it I did not enjoy it but I love your description it's because it makes so very clear what happened and for those that have had the experience it can be mildly stressful to terrifying so thank you for um providing the therapy that is knowledge and uh so that people don't stress it too much but we still dissuade people from consuming alcohol prior to sleep correct I want to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor insid

insid tracker.com huberman okay so we've been discussing complete paralysis and of course that's the inability to move let's talk about the ability to move meaning motor learning what is the relationship between sleep and learning physical skills either coordination of motor movement or who knows maybe increased power output or endurance um and if you would could you comment on whether or not there are specific phases of sleep that are specifically linked to motor learning yeah great questions so what we've spoken about so far is that you need sleep after learning for that textbook like memory and that is one category of memory that resides within your brain there's another type of memory that you've spoken about which many of us don't realize is memory and that's what we call non- declarative or procedural skill memory so if I were to you know ask you okay Andrew you know last night for dinner or yesterday for lunch do you remember what it was that you had to eat and my guess is that you could probably tell me so do you recall what what some of that my diet is pretty boring um in the sense I tend to eat more or less the same thing every day although I'm open to being flexible yesterday for lunch I had two grass-fed hamburger patties maybe a little bit of rice sliced cucumber some tomatoes and because I'm a driveby blueberry eater there were some blueberries out on the counter and I had several large fistfuls of those and then I washed it down with some water and I half mug just like this of some cold brew sugar-free yamate and I can confirm folks I was there at the incident and that's exactly what he had but did everyone who was watching or listening just realize what happened in this room today something that Einstein suggested would never be possible that Andrew just travel back in time that using this Incredible Gift of memory you you folded time almost like a concertina compressing it and you race back within milliseconds you were shaking your head yes I know what I had and you race back into that catalog of all of your previous lunches you found the correct manila folder for that specific lunch all of the details and out it popped that is a spectacular complex computational process that your brain's memory system accomplished Within milliseconds it's stunning what we have as this gift of memory but as I said there's another type of memory so if I were to ask you okay how do you ride a bike it's very difficult there is no textbook for here is how to ride a bike the way that you do it when you're a child is that you are taught how to learn how to ride a bike by being on it so if I were to say how cuz I'm a longtime cyclist how do I take uh a right turn with my bicycle the obvious suggestion would be well you turn the handlebars if you turn the handlebars at 30 m an hour trying to go around a right Bend you going crash very quickly what in fact you do is you alter the steering angle just a little but you lean and that is what we call non declarative meaning you can't declare to me what it is that you know you just have to show me through action and behavior this is skill learning and we use it for things like sports surgical procedures flying planes there are so many musical performance as well so many aspects so we wanted to then say well sleep is helpful after learning for fact-based memory but what about this other type of memory and in truth I didn't come up with the idea it was given to me back in the gosh I'm aging myself in the early 2000s I was back in the UK I gave a lecture at the for the decade of the brain which it was back then and at the end of the course I'd spoken a little bit about sleep and this informational processing but no evidence for motor skill memory and this gentleman be lovely gentleman Old Gentleman with a sort of a white beard I remember his tweed jacket this green Hue was beautiful and he came up to me at the end and he said look I'm a musician I'm a Pianist and I was fascinated by what you said about sleep sometimes I'll sit down and I'm learning a new piece and I just don't seem to be able to get it and I practice practice and practice into the evening and then I just stop and then I come back the next day and I sit down at the piano and I can just play do you think that's sleep and of course at that moment my mind starts just relexing with ideas and I'm thinking gosh there's the next 10 years of my work and grants and so I sort of said look I I think it's a fascinating hypothesis it could also be that you're just maybe a little bit tired in the evening and but it's it's entirely possible I don't know of any evidence yet that supports that I suppose the alternative hypothesis that there's simply a certain amount of time that needs to elapse After experiencing something new that one wants to learn the trigger for learning is I don't know some biochemical SL neural signal that's like a wavefront and it takes a while for that wave to go ashore which is learning and that independent of how much sleep one gets or the quality of sleep that the learning could occur I suppose that's one idea no that's in fact precisely the central hypothesis that we then set out to test which is that your maybe it's it's practice then some time that helps you create that perfect motor routine that's one hypothesis but let's split that apart maybe it's time but time spent awake or is it time but time spent asleep so we designed a study to disambiguate between those two both groups learned a motor skill task and it's very much like learning a piano and you learn a sequence of movements let's just say 41324 and we have you type that out over and over again for periods of 30 seconds and then you rest for 30 seconds and then you do it again you do 12 of those trials and sure enough practice seemed to get you better and you were learning and your learning curve went up and then we brought those participants back 12 hours later and we retested them on that same motor memory half of those participants spent that 12 hours awake the others had a night of sleep in between an 8 Hour night of sleep when we brought the people who had learned in the morning and tested in the evening without sleep they had retained that memory they were no worse they were just no better but in the people who had slept what was stunning was that they had improved their performance output speed by 20% and they'd improved their accuracy by almost 37% wow so in other words it wasn't time that you needed to produce Perfection it was time with sleep in other words you've often heard the statement practice makes perfect but we violated that edict it wasn't practice that makes perfect it's practice with a night of sleep that makes or leads to perfection in other words after learning your brain continues to improve in the absence of any further practice however that learning occurs exclusively during periods of offline sleep and not across equivalent time periods while you're awake now what was interesting in the group that remained awake across those 12 hours we then actually brought them back after a further 12 hours but now after a night of sleep and they showed that beautiful benefit so the sleep that can let's say enhance although I think what we're really talking about here that consolidates motor learning yeah can arrive the night after meaning one finishes let's say learning at I don't know 11:00 a.m. and then they sleep later that night or the following night and in both instances that sleep can enhance or let's say consolidate the motor learning that occurred that's right so it was to your question actually that we discussed earlier and I recall now I didn't answer it which is that you the things that you learn throughout the day you don't have to worry about learning them really close to bedtime so that they're available and accessible for this sleep dependent work of sleep after learning it seems to be that the human brain and we've plotted this we've looked at how at what point does the brain sort of fail in terms of its ability to place on hold sort of on the runway ready to take off into the consolidation phase and it seems to be about 16 hours MH that you can hold on to those freshly formed memories for about 16 hours and then you get the chance to sleep and consolidate them so if you learn at 11:00 in the morning or if you learn at 7:00 p.m. in the evening don't worry about that those memories are still going to be gathered together in the beautiful receptive arms of sleep and then knitted up and enhanced when it comes to procedural memories and by the way that's a key difference to those two types of memory sleep will take fact based memories and simply save them so that you don't forget it doesn't necessarily boost them anymore it just simply prevents you from Forgetting which is what would happen otherwise across a waking day ah key point it's it's not enhancement it's consolidation of or essentially um the way I might think about it is the new information is put into a potential memory bank and that information is either flushed or maintained depending on whether or not you get sleep that's right there's no enhancement enhancement would be supranormal levels of memory if you sleep and that's the case for textbook like memory in other words sleep comes in and it stems the blood flow of forgetting from the memory wound as it were to get I don't know why it came up that's a terrible analogy no I like it I guess we might say Hemorrhage right like it is okay and but so sleep comes in and prevents that from happening but with motor memories it is enhancement it's that when you're awake across the day you don't get any worse which is what happens with fact textbook memory you hold that performance but then sleep comes in and it boosts you even further you get a nice benefit without doing anything further so then the question became to your point if sleep is doing that if it's not practice that makes perfect but practice with sleep what is it about the sleep so we looked at their sleep physiology and what we found were two interesting components first it seemed to be related to that lighter form of stage two nonrem sleep I told you that textbook memory requires deep non-rem sleep stages three and four casting back to episode one motor memory more dependent on stage two and those beautiful spindles that are the Hallmark of beginning your stage two the more of those that you had the greater the memory benefit the next day we then wanted to say well is this effect simply something to do with the nighttime because that's the other hypothesis it's not really about sleep it's just something about night ESS because in all of the studies i' described so far they're all happening at night and at night they were sleeping so is it really nighttime or is it specifically sleep so now we did a nap study with motor skill learning we repeated that and sure enough even though that time period was across the day not during night n they showed this beautiful motor skill benefit if they napped versus if they did not and then in that naps City I was telling you that they were learning the sequence with the um right non-dominant hand and they were all we selected all right handers to to make it equal and they were typing 41324 41324 and that right hand as well you know is controlled by the left motor cortex so after in the nap study when we recorded their sleep we used very high density EEG so lots and lots of sensors on top of the head so we could map with High Fidelity resolution the surface of the brain or the surface of the scalp and infer what's going on in the brain and what was interesting is that yes those sleep spindles the more of them that you had in the nap the better your motor skill learning was but there seemed to be a lateralized effect such that the Sleep spindle activity on the right side of the brain which controls the left hand which was not working that showed no spindle increased in activity however on the right hand activity that invoked activation in the left motor cortex that left motor cortex and specifically Al the hand region showed a local increase in spindle activity and subsequent work and work prior to our had demonstrated that it's not sleep physiology globally it's almost as though your sleep physiology responds to the mapping of the memory in the brain wherever the memory is that's where sleep when you go to sleep sort of starts massaging the cortex so that you get that plasticity it's almost like a good masseuse you know you sort of sit down they say where are your problem points and you say it's it's here and here and so they don't give you a general massage they go to work on the regions that have been working hardest that require greatest attention sleep does that it's a amazing and reminds me of some of this work that was done I think in the late 90s early 2000s Richard Morris and um colleagues over in I think he was in Edinburgh um talked about synaptic tagging you know this notion that animals or humans perform or learn some new motor skill maybe navigation of a novel environment maybe a motor skill of the 41234 that you described you know keys on a piano or something like that and then it was acknowledged that the the changes in the connections between neurons don't occur immediately which meant that there had to be some sort of tag or label to the synapsis that marked them for consolidation later for plasticity long-term potentiation things of that sort the names don't really matter um I think later it became clear based on Marcus Frank's work and others that indeed during sleep the hard rewiring of the nervous system occurs plasticity occurs but what you're saying is that there's a high degree of specificity meaning the specific circuits that were active and required for the learning are the specific circuits that are modified which on the face of it one could say well of course what that means is that during sleep the brain is um somehow able to uh the neurons of the brain that is are able to chemically or electrically or both signal like this is where that there needs to be some modifications done and then then like a night crew um the the brain self- induces its own changes which is remarkable it really is it's almost as though there are red flags that are planted in the territories that have undergone learning dependent plasticity and they are calling out almost like you know hungry mouths that are in plasticity famine for the feast relief that comes by way of sleep do we know what the factors are that are released in sleep that allow that to occur or is it I'm guessing there are many people love to talk about brain derived neutrophic Factor bdnf but which is a very interesting molecule but um it's probably just one of a panoply of of molecules that are that are important we we don't know necessarily the neurochemical processes although some people have manipulated plasticity and then blocked it with different types of nmda which is a certain type of receptor in the brain for excitatory activity which is the underlying basis of brain plasticity so that certainly is dependent but what's interesting about the sleep spindles I said in the first episode that they burst somewhere between about 12 to 15 times per second if you apply that type of stimulation to a particular neuronal circuit within the brain that seems to be one of the and it's not the only but one of the ideal sort of Sweet Spot tickling of neurons that forces them to say oh I think I should strengthen this circuit so it's almost as though these sleep spindles are ideally designed at the frequency at the sort of tickling level of neurons to stimulate exactly what we think is the underlying basis of strengthening a memory which is at the level of the neurons the strengthening of synapses so interesting um because we hear this fire together wire together high frequency transmission between neurons is what creates plasticity but this is literally a replay of previously meaning earlier that day or the previous day as you pointed out activity in the given circuit being replayed not unlike the the the work that you talked about earlier the fast replay of neurons in in the hippocampus but here it's not necessarily just in the hippocampus it can be in the neocortex or other structures that then builds up the uh the the Vigor with which that circuit can function in the daytime AKA learning um is it's super interesting you mentioned that this is occurring largely in stage two of sleep not in rapid eye movement sleep is this business of stage two being the the main period of sleep in which motor learning occurs unique to motor learning in other words cognitive information um surely can get um wired into the brain at night but is that largely Associated just with rapid eye movement sleep what this would suggest in other words is that the earlier stages of sleep 1 and two and heading into three and four serves a specific purpose which is consolidation of motor skills and and motor learning from the previous one or two days it does seem to be that stage two stage one is we now think of more of a transitional stage but we will speak perhaps when we discuss the idea of creativity that it also may have a memory function that very light first step of sleep stage two is certainly related to motor skill in fact stage two is fascinating we used to think of it as just the stage that you had to go into to get to deep sleep and the stage that you had to go back through to get up to REM sleep never made any sense to me why because stage two non-rm sleep is about 40 to 50% of your night why would you spend 40 to 50% of your time asleep when it's just simply a gate to get to something better you would spend more time in the something to something that's better stages so we started to find functions and stage two is dist distributed throughout the night but those sleep spindles in stage two are not evenly distributed throughout the night you get some of them in the first quarter more of them in the second quarter of sleep certainly more in the third quarter but you get a lot more of those sleep spindles in the last quarter of the night and in fact when we looked at the overnight study where we' had people learn in the evening tested the next day we recorded their sleep in between yes sleep spindles predicted and stage two predicted how much better they were the next day but it was especially stage two in the last quarter of the night let's say I'm going to bed at I'm just for argument sake for ease midnight and I'm waking up at 8 it's in that sort of 6:00 a.m. to 8 a.m. range when I if I was going to sleep at that time would be getting my stage two and I find that interesting because it is the time of night that we all feel it's okay to cut short to get a jump start on the day it's this Modern Life erosion of our sleep time and what these findings would suggest is that you are short changing your brain of some significant motor memory performance especially those classic Olympic coaches that have their Athletes Training until you know 8 in the evening and then you know they're in bed by sort of 10 or 11: but they have them waking up at 5: back on the athletic field at 6 but they would gain some additional motor memory benefit if you just let them sleep a little bit longer I recall there was a study done at Stanford relatively small study um but interesting nonetheless because I think it was the basketball team that was asked to um spend I think an additional two hours in bed there a sleep extensions today um and they were even told that they could do other things in bed uh besides sleep um there might have been some specifications of you know things they should not do in bed during that time um but at least by self-report some of the students said that they slept a bit more or they relaxed a bit more in bed and indeed when compared to the control group there was a significant Improvement in their um I forget if it was three throw free throw percentage excuse me um or other metrics of a basketball performance yeah it was the point scoring performance it was the speed up and down the court it was a great study done by Sher Mah at uh Stanford University um and she's done epic work with athletes to to sort of replicate those findings and the athlete story is interesting some people may be saying well didn't you just make a hop skip and a jump from you know 41324 to inferring complex motor skill I thought about that so we did a a new series of studies where we this is control that's the nice thing about the sort of typing on a sequence you can really measure that performance with high sort of accuracy but we then switched it to a b manual task much more like learning to play a piano and you were learning sequences that were 12 14 items in length and you had to learn them over and over and we had a hypothesis would sleep fail at the the task when motor skill performance became much more complex or would it be different and what we found was that the more and more complex the motor skill became the greater and the greater the benefit of sleep um by way of that consolidation effect and then I started to hear something cuz I would often be in the room as these participants were learning the sequence and then as they were testing and my ears started to hear something that I I couldn't quite believe to begin with they would start to learn these motor sequences but they would seem to have these pauses and it's what we call chunking in motor skill memory so instead of 41324 41324 they would do 41324 41324 and I would have them be using the same keyboard and I got to know the sound of the the keyboard so I could hear it 41324 41324 and then when they came back the next day yes they were performing faster but they weren't just doing 4132 4 41324 they were simply doing 413 24 4 3 there was no Gap at all so we went into the individual responses individual motor sort of finger responses and sure enough before sleep there were these very clear problem points on these pain points in the motor memory sequence but then when we came back after a night of sleep and looked at their data it wasn't as though sleep simply grabbed the motor skill memory sort of profile and lifted everything up sleep was selectively going after those pain points and improving them and that to me was interesting because that's the goal of a good athlete it is automaticity you don't want to be thinking about it at some point you go from a very conscious Act of deliberately trying to remember what you should be doing to then not thinking about it at all it's only automaticity that gives you that ability not to think and it operates below the level of Consciousness super interesting and here we're talking about specific changes in the brain terms of neural activity Etc that occur during sleep when we've been exposed to or engaged in a particular novel for us motor skill and you see this you know these spindles in stage two Etc but does it work the other way as well meaning does the process of trying to learn a new motor skill enhance certain components of sleep or maybe even one's ability to sleep you know years ago I heard uh that practicing unilateral leg movements this is a perhaps a crazy idea but but it makes sense in the context of what we're talking about practicing unilateral leg movements things like you know everyone's familiar with squats and deadlifts and things of that sort but there are some one-legged movements like a pistol Squad a pistol Squad that's pretty hard um if one can do them I'm always impressed um Bulgarian split squats you know foot up on the bench and then squatting down with a dumbbell things like that were just unilateral movements that require a lot of mental attention to the performance of that movement could be in the gym but it could be something else as well you think about a dancer trying to learn how to um organize their their steps um where they have to pay careful attention to right versus Left Foot Right they always say you know like two people have two right feet that can't people can't dance have two right feet or two left feet by the way for those listening Andrew is looking at me right now when he's saying two right feet rightfully so no I I have no knowledge of your your dancing ability or or or challenges thereof um as I recall there may have been some some uh very preliminary data about changes in the amount of certain sleep stages according to whether or not someone had tried to learn a skill in this case unilateral uh uh limb performance the previous day so in other words if one wants to improve their sleep would the attempt to learn a new motor skill be one Avenue to to improve one's sleep it's it's interesting if you look at some of the data it's a little bit mixed in terms of motor skill learning but there are some studies demonstrating that it's true for textbook like memory and there's a study gosh done many years ago Again by the great German group of yan born and they simply ask the question if you were to just not be learning very deliberately and intensively through a textbook like set of information and then we just measure your sleep to get a Baseline and then we force you to have a very long very intensive learning session of these facts and then when we measure your sleep again is there any difference relative to the non-intensive learning day versus the Intensive learning day and indeed what they found was that there was an increase in their deep non-rem sleep in their deep slow wave sleep and again we think it's almost we describe it as a homeostatic response which is just a fancy way of saying that when the brain is driven to undergo a demand then sleep will respond to try to accommodate that demand and so I would say that there are probably many other things and we discussed this in episode 2 in terms of a how to optimize your sleep that probably carry a bigger bang for your buck in terms of optimizing and enhancing your sleep but is there any evidence to suggest that that's the case there does seem to be some evidence in the literature yeah so interesting I I certainly know the experience of trying to learn a lot of information and then feeling like my sleep is that much deeper although I've also experienced the challenges in quote unquote turning my brain off when I've been trying to learn something and then it's late in the evening forget the caffeine component you know just that the the information is spooling in my head maybe some pre uh test anxiety that kind of thing so I think the the tools and protocols that um you offered so generously in episodes one two and three are especially important under those conditions learning how to really taper off one's level of of thinking and planning and arousal in the evening really bring things down so that one can access that sleep I mean one only wishes that the more we did during the day the easier it would be to sleep I think to some extent that's true but there's there's some um there's some conditions in which doing more thinking about more and and I guess that's sort of the the irony right I interrupted myself but on purpose that wouldn't it be wonderful if the amount and ease of sleep was directly proport to how much we needed to sleep that's that's one of the the tricks in this whole business system sometimes right like sometimes when we really need sleep we're dealing with something psychologically challenging or we need to learn something we have an exam that often can be when it's most difficult to sleep gets right in the way of what we need most although coming back to your point I think physical activity does seem to be one of those things that is very good and I'm I I'm remiss to have not included it in the optimization or the unconventional tips there is a very good robust literature now demonstrating that if you are Physically Active during the day you can boost the quality of your sleep particularly your deep sleep at night it seems to be there are some subtle differences in terms of whether you're doing aerobic versus anerobic so let's say versus you know doing a spin bike class for an hour versus lifting resistance uh or doing resistance training for an hour or strength training there's subtle differences but netet overall the big picture of you is that when you perform exercise you drive a response from enhanced sleep particularly deep sleep at night and I think many people have had that experience you've been out on a long hike maybe a 10 12 mile hike or you've just been working in the garden doing really you know sort of long Landscaping work throughout the day six or seven hours and you just come in and you go to bed that night and you you just know that this is going to be the most Royal night of sleep that you could you know it ahead of time you know sort of earhole to to Elbow um and that evidence is now very clear the the one interesting thing if you dig into that data though you can drive increases in deep Sleep by way of exercise it does seem to come at a little bit of cost to REM sleep exercise May throttle back some of your REM sleep now don't fear that it may just simply be that every night and we know this my sleep and my stage stages of sleep are going to be much different to to yours in how they are structured and how they play out but even within me the same individual Matt my sleep stages vary from one night to the next to the next some of that is idiosyncratic others are or other reasons depend on what I've been doing during the day and so it may be that we don't need to get concerned about that modest reduction in rem due to exercise enhanced nonrem because it's simply that when you've gone through that form of activity as a human being during the day what you need is that type of sleep more so than perhaps REM sleep and therefore the next night things calibrate back down let's say I wasn't as active I just sort of went to work durly and I'm back to Baseline again so I don't get too concerned about that but I just want to bring it up it's there in the literature yeah I think it's a very interesting point and one just has to trust that nature Knows Best in modifying the percentage of different sleep stages according to our daytime activity again highlighting the the key uh relationship I mean the the closely tethered relationship between daytime activity and sleeve and vice versa correct yeah and it's a it's a reciprocal Loop because what we found is that exercise during the day can enhance sleep at night but also what we found is that sleep at night enhances your athletic performance the following day and I'm not just talking about motor skill memory upstairs in the brain I'm talking about physical activity in the body and if you limit sleep to let's say less than 6 hours the data demonstrates that your Peak muscle performance is decreased your Peak vertical jump height decreases your time to exhaustion decreases by in some studies it was up to 30% so if you're training for a 10K Marathon but you don't get enough sleep the night before you're done by seven we also know that it decreases perhaps more than almost any of those and it's striking the brain's motivation to exercise at all so in fact many people may be able to get close to their Peak muscle strength when they are underslept chances are they're probably never going to get to the chance to express that because their motivation to exercise just drops off and I think many people will resonate that you had a bad night of sleep I just don't want to go go to the gym the next day the final part of that is injury risk there is a significantly elevated injury risk and if you ask most athletes okay what am I particularly concerned about is it my performance or if I had some kind of injury that knocks me out for the rest of the season and so I've had the fortunate chance to work with many professional teams uh of different kinds and gradually they are realizing what I've sort of long said and it's a crash statement but I think sleep is probably the greatest legal performance-enhancing drug that most athletes are not abusing enough I could not agree more I mean I feel like every time I say sleep is the Bedrock of mental health physical health and performance it um it's sometimes perceived is just kind of like oh yeah sleep we need to sleep um but there's no question that it the positive effects of getting excellent sleep on a consistent basis um far out way and perform any kind of supplement or even performance enhancing drug in fact those Mo most supplements and performance enhancing drugs that can indeed improve performance of various kinds seem to only function or function best certainly on a backdrop of excellent sleep and I should say that you I think you've done a brilliant job of being very explicit about the fact that you need to get all of the basics in place and then it's great to think about fine tweaking with optimization of things like supplement ation and all of these other things and I think sometimes that message has been maybe a little bit more mixed in the social media environment that we often don't think about the basics and we go straight to supplementation where you would say gosh there's actually a log order of magnitude benefit that's on the table if only you to do some of the basic things that your your grandmother would probably tell you you know eat right get your stress sorted out do some physical activity and make sure that you get some sleep do those things and you're very far along now there's more opportunity on the table for fine tuning as as you've elegantly discussed but I think I just want to acknowledge that I think you've done a really great job of being balanced in that message um and I hope people um in the general sphere can appreciate how hard that is to do it's not an easy thing when you are talking about supplementation because at first it sounds as though gosh all of this speak and you describe great data means that it is the Holy Grail of enhanced human beings but you're always careful to say this after the foundation and I can give a very good example with sleep let's say that you're trying to manage your weight and lose weight and you're dieting but you're not getting sufficient sleep what we've discovered is that yes you will lose weight when you're dieting even though you're not getting enough sleep the problem is that almost 60% of the weight that you lose will come from lean muscle mass and not fat in other words when you are unders slapped and dieting you keep what you're trying to lose which is the fat and you lose what you wish to keep which is the muscle so your body does something very interesting in its um removal of different types of energy stores in your body when you are not slept it becomes very stingy with fat and it will not give it up when you are sleep deprived which is very why would that be by the way muscle such a metabolically demanding tissue you know if you're you're send by not sleeping well you're sending signals that there really isn't the capacity to take care of what you already have much less uh increase the size of the engine that's exactly right and then think about fat which is in terms of its energy you know unit benefit it has you know at least perhaps twice the caloric value that protein does so if you are underslept that is a warning sign to any evolutionary species past that things are dire so whatever I'm going to do this is break glass in case of emergency situation and if you're not getting enough calories I'm going to hold on to the thing that has the highest caloric value right until the end which is fat and I'm going to give away the stuff that doesn't have as much caloric benefit because I am in a caloric deficit right now now of course that's strange because the person trying to lose weight perhaps is rightfully trying to lose weight based on them being somewhat overweight but that's the biology that we think explains why that that's the case it's not just a strange phenomenon it's a very logical one yeah it is a logical one and and thanks for the um the support around um you know my constant um voicing and revoicing of the the pillars of Health you mention you know exercise SLE well I put it in the order of sleep as the the most important pillar um and then one could argue about the the order of the others but in no specific order um light which dovet tales with sleep but um nutrition movement exercise uh social connection stress modulation these these kinds of things yeah the fact the speed with which that comes out of your mouth tells you how many times you've you you've said it and you've said it over and over it's wonderful well thank you it's it's interesting because they are the basics but um they are Basics that need to be re-up every 24 hours so often I feel like we all need to be reminded every 24 hours I also you know one of the most common questions I get is what should I take people like if I had a dollar for every time somebody said what should I take you know i' I'd keep podcasting but I'd be a gazillionaire um but my response is always the same which is how's your sleep the first question I say is how's your sleep and then they think I'm going to suggest a sleep supplement but I want to know whether or not people are sleeping well on a consistent basis and that that opens up a a whole set of discussions and that um inevitably we forget about the what one should take conversation I think it's the rare individual who's sleeping very well every n of their life there are such individuals and then the the what should I take conversation makes sense in a certain context there's something I wanted to just uh return to uh for a moment before I move on to the next topic which is you mentioned all the um significant deficits that occur in Motor Performance when one has not slept that well the night before grip strength a vertical jump motivation Etc um you know we're not here to um to deliver anything except the facts to people at we we're certainly not here to soften the blow of reality but there are a good number of people that will have say a physical performance like a race they're training for a half marathon or um they have a a big game the next day or um they have some Performance Event the next day and by virtue of butterflies um anxiety travel an alarm going off in a hotel in the middle of the night I've had that experience Etc that they may not get the best night sleep the night before and and obviously there are going to be ramifications of that but um I'm reminded of a study that was done by Ali crumbs Lab at Stanford where they people wear sleep trackers and then and they actually knew how much and how well or poorly they s slept the night before I don't know how detailed the analysis was but it stford sleep center so presumably it was it was reasonably detailed and then the next day with that knowledge in hand either lied to the people or told them the truth about how well they had slept the night before or poorly for instance if someone had got eight hours of great sleep the night before they might have told them hey you got eight hours of great sleep the night before or they might have been in a condition where they said hey you know what your sleep last night wasn't that great yeah or if somebody got five hours of sleep they might have said hey you know you got eight hours of great sleep so there was a ly a lot of lying involved in this study but basically what they observed is that performance in I think it was motor skill performance but it might have been cognitive but the the that's not the the issue here the the point is that much of our performance can be dependent on our subjective understanding of how well or poorly we slept the night before in other words there can be belief effects that's right so this one the concerns about placing too too much emphasis on the one poor night sleep you know and obviously people should be mindful of injury as you pointed out but if someone has a big race or a big event the next day and they just don't sleep well yeah I think the that we have to be careful that the mere knowledge that they're not going to perform as well because that's what the data say um Can potentially be offset by the the Ali crumb study which is if they they believe like hey a lot of it is about what they believe their own sleep to be which just tells you that performance can and motivation presumably can override some of the the physiology there a you know and again we we you can't rescue what you can't rescue no and I think it's a very good point because it comes back to our discussion about the placebo effect in some ways which is this is mind over matter and that your biological state so one of the things I do when I'm working with professional athletes and we're doing sleep tracking of I'm working with a coach and I will say during that period where they're really you know it's they're on the road and now it's they've got seven games to play in the playoffs let's keep tracking their sleep and let's you and I make sure that we're trying to optimize this athlete because they've given consent they want to have their sleep as good as possible and they want us to help them do that but I say at that point we will simply look at the data night after night and then we can describe the data that they've been having at the end of the week after they finished the series because for exactly that reason if you start giving them feedback we don't want to erode confidence and with sleep trackers there is such a thing called orthosomnia and it's now a described situation orthosomnia in medicine words mean something so although people will be familiar with in medicine Orthopedics Orthodontics it's about getting things straight Orthopedics getting your sort of bone straight Orthodontics getting your teeth straight orthosomnia is about trying to get your sleep straight and being so worried about that that it compromises your sleep now we don't know exactly what proportion of people it may be less than 10% who use sleep trackers but I would say that to anyone listening if you are tracking your sleep with a Tracker and you're experiencing this sleep related anxiety do one of two things first take my recommend Commendation which is that only on let's say a Sunday afternoon do you open up the app and check your data so that way you can still be measuring your sleep which is very helpful but you don't have to get the anxiety morning after morning the other is that if you are truly starting to get a very negative experience take it off put it in the drawer and just get your sleep confidence back using some of the suggestions that we had in the optimization episode and only then return to using that tracker what's also interesting it relates to what you were saying about beliefs and intention they did another another great study where they looked at this cortisol rise in the morning that you and I have discussed on this series many times which starts to happen sort of just before you're waking up and really Rises into the morning what they did was they brought participants into the laboratory and they had them go to sleep around 11:00 uh at night and then in one group they said we're going to wake you up at 7:00 a.m. in the morning the other group they said we're going to wake you up at 5 a.m. in the morning well it turns out that both of those groups were woken up at 7 a.m. but what was bizarre is that in the group that was told they were going to wake up at 5:00 a.m. their cortisol release started to rise around 5: a.m. in other words just the knowledge before sleep that you're going to be woken up at 5:00 a.m. change the non-conscious brain's release of a stock standard prototypical hormonal release mechanism and that comes right back to this idea that we we were speaking about with time that consciously we have lost time perception when we're sleeping but non-consciously it seems as though the brain is still knowing what's going on because for that early morning flight you wake up 2 minutes before your alarm well perhaps the reason why is that you're you've learned that you have to wake up at that time and you've changed your cortisol response which would normally because you don't wake up for an early morning flight every day would normally not come for 2 hours but it's arriving earlier it just blew me away I couldn't believe that the brain non-consciously could change a hormonal profile simply based on me telling you what time you're going to wake up the next morning spectacular and and really as you pointed out really speaks to the fact that during sleep there is a lot of problem processing going on you know un you subconscious unconscious cognitive processing and we know this in the form of Dreams uh a topic that we'll talk about um in a subsequent episode of this series but okay so you've shared with us the clear value of getting the best possible night's sleep before what I call a bout of learning y you also shared with us the clear value of getting sleep after being exposed to some new information AKA about of learning and you've explained to us the key relationship between sleep and motor learning learning of new motor skills what are some other aspects of brain and cognition for which sleep exerts a significant positive effect so those for a while were the first two things that we really thought sleep was doing for learning in memory sleep before learning to make those memories sleep after learning to consolidate them and and hit the save button but then data started to emerge and we started to look at this too that sleep was much more intelligent than we ever imagined when it comes to information processing sleep doesn't simply just strengthen individual memories like isolate Islands unconnected sleep after learning is almost a form of informational alchemy that sleep will take these new memories and it will start to interconnect them and Crosslink them with the new information that you've learned because usually information that you're learning during the day is interconnected and sleep was building those connections between new memories but also it was integrating them into the back catalog of all of your past autobiographical memory systems so that you woke up the next day and you had a revised mindwise web of associations and a good example of this we did a study gosh very early on where we asked the question which stage of sleep then is important for this type of I almost think of it it's probably strange analogy but almost like group therapy for me memories that at the end of the day every new memory gets a name badge and sleep gathers in all of these memories into the same room and it forces you however to speak to the people not at the front of the room that you think you've got the most obvious connection with it forces you to speak to the people all the way at the back of the room that you don't think you've got really any connection with at all but it turns out that you do because sleep doesn't simply build associations and connections it does it seems to bias the brain towards building the most non-obvious distant associations it's almost it's almost like a a Google search gone wrong that during the waking day our memories which are still our brains are still associative in how they can build links and connections that's like page one of the Google search so let's say that I type in you know Andrew hubman and I the first page I get the first hit is the hubman lab website great but if I go to page 20 it's about a field hockey game in Utah and I think he a second what's what's Andrew doing you didn't know but yeah I know exactly I don't think I've ever played field hockey I've been to Utah it's a beautiful state it's beautiful but if I look I can see that there is a very distant non-obvious Association I can understand why it's there that's what sleep seems to be over indexing for in this associational framework so then we asked well what is it about sleep so we had participants perform anagram solving tasks and anagrams are simply these words that are the letters are all jumbled up and you have to kind of stare at them or work through them and all of a sudden you start to see which word it really is because at first all jumbled up and it makes no sense but we didn't teach them it before sleep and after sleep we did something different we woke them up out of different stages of sleep why well when you come out of different stages of sleep you there is still some degree of the biology of that sleep state that lingers in your brain almost like Vapors coming off the stage of sleep that you've just exited and it only lasts for about 2 minutes or so but what was nice is that that this anagram test you could do within 2 minutes so we would wake them up out of different stages of sleep and then we'd have them quickly do these anagrams and I told you that for fact-based memory that sleep after learning was important to strengthen the individual memories and it it was particularly nonrapid eye movement sleep that was doing that strengthening of the individual facts now what we found is that the association creativity benefit of sleep was very different that cross-linking benefit came by way it seemed of REM sleep because when we woke them up out of REM sleep compared to non-rem sleep they were 30% more capable of solving these anagrams and when we looked at how they were solving them it was interesting coming out of non-rm sleep it was very sort of analogical it was very what we think of as um very sort of convergent very focused way of trying to logically solve the problem but with REM sleep it was much more Divergent fluid intelligence it was almost as though they were just standing back and waiting for it and then it just popped out in front of them all the letters kind of reorganized and and clicked into place and then there was a subsequent study that did something different it looked specifically at creative insight and it was a lovely study and they performed something called the numeric number reduction test which is one of those test that psychologists love to administer and participants hate to perform and here's what happens you're shown a whole string of numbers and you are given a certain set of rules and you have to work through those number problems and come out with a final end answer and you're told that you're going to be judged simply on how many correct Final End answers that you get and you work through hundreds of these problems what they don't tell you in the instructions however is that there is a hidden rule here embedded in that all of those sequences all of the sequences are different that you have to solve but there is one common rule that binds them all together which is that the second part sort of the second component of the solution so you're working through let's say it's a 10 digigit string number and you have to apply these rules to the first number then carry it through to the second number and then to the third number and the the second partial number that you produce in this string of calculations to get to the Final End answer it turns out to be always the same end answer so in other words if you clue on to this hidden rule all you have to do is work up to the first let's say 10% of every problem you can just shortcut the rest of it and you just write down the number because you are told that the only thing we're going to judge you on is the end answer so they train participants on these sort of numeric number reduction uh trials and then they brought them back after 12 hours of being awake and no one seemed to have that light bulb moment of the sort of okay I get it but then they did the same thing they trained them but now they trained them in the evening they get gave them a full8 hours of sleep came back the next morning and there was a threefold increase in Creative Insight problem solving ability in other words people were coming back with that aha moment of you know the gig is up I've got it I know what you guys are trying to do and I'm going to show you then they did something clever they said back to question of motor skill learning well is that really sleep or is it just Cadian that it's just something about going through the night that gives you this kind of dally creative benefit so they took another group they taught them the information in the evening and they tested them the next morning just like the Sleep group but they kept them up all night so they went through nighttime n for that time period and they showed no benefit in the problem solving and my experience is that sleep deprivation leads to all sorts of ideas about how one um is coming up with novel ideas and solutions all of which completely suck after two good night sleep um but but most of the time it seems that sleep deprivation intoxication of any kind um it it gives one the impression that you know you're coming up with novel Solutions but really they're just novel that D is very clear that you know there was this Moma that if if I sort of go through the night and work sort of through into the morning I'm just much more creative when I'm sleep deprived and and it's been tested and it's just it's the opposite quite the opposite in fact what I I also find interesting though about this the sleep and creativity log it was always there in the literature that there are innumerable anecdotes of people having sleep inspired Insight it's almost as though when you wake up the next morning having had that revised set of web Connections in your brain you can divine solutions to previously impenetrable problems and there's a great example I think Dimitri Mev um who at the time was trying to answer one of the most epic questions in human history how do all of the known elements in the universe fit together in some logical order and he was failing he just could not and he was so obsessed with this problem he created playing cards with all of the different elements of the universe and their atomic weights and their electron and he would go on these long train rides and he would just Shuffle the cards and he would deal the cards on the table he was just desperate to try to see what the pattern was he was shuffling and shuffling and shuffling and then the story goes and it's written that one night he fell asleep and he dreamed and he could start to see all of the cards just dancing around in front of his eyes and then they snap together in this logical grid based on the atomic weight and the different electron properties and he wrote it down on the back of an envelope which still exists to this date really yeah and you can see it out and that was the initial basis for what we call the periodic table of elements amazing and it revolutionized human history and it's not just in science I mean there's great scientific you know people have won Nobel prizes for understanding neural transmission utoy well and maybe it's worth um rattling off a few brief examples because they're they're so spectacular Einstein was known for taking naps in the middle of the day multiple times throughout the day in order to come up with novel Solutions um I think the the discovery of the um some of the organic you know ring the Benzene ring was uh came to uh I'm forgetting in a dream thank you um there are numerous examples of fundamental scientific discoveries that is creative insights that were anchored to real world experiments um and Theory pure Theory as well that came to people in their dreams so what's interesting though is that there seems to be some sort of hydraulic pressure created by the the the waking or within wakefulness attempt to like figure something out so all of these people um to be very clear didn't didn't just sleep to come up with solutions they put a lot of kind of hydraulic pressure feeding a lot of information you thinking about a problem in a in a structured or unstructured way taking walks focusing on their other demands of the day but then when they went to sleep clearly that information was still being worked with in in in important ways and then you going to mention some examples uh from uh the Arts I think yeah there's some great you know I'm um I was born and raised in uh Liverpool uh in England and of course famous for the Beatles and for Liverpool Football Club uh and event as well that I'm a Lial supporter however Paul McCartney has gone on record very clearly to say that two songs that were probably some of the the the most successful songs yesterday and let it be both came to him by way of dream inspired Insight there's a lovely description I think in his biography he was filming it was either help or a hard days night down in London with the rest of the Beatles And he was staying in a rental in wimpole street in London and he was staying on the third floor and in his bedroom fortunately there was a piano on the opposite side of the room and he describes how he woke up one morning with this beautiful Melody by way of um it was a string quartet that was playing it and it was the melody for um yesterday and he went straight over to the piano and he started playing it and he said it was just so Sumptuous and he couldn't remember where he had heard it and then after a while he remembered I haven't heard it anywhere before it came to me by way of sleep same thing with um Let It Be the the obviously you know Mother Mary comes to me singing songs singing words of wisdom let it be and there's often been a suggestion that that has religious overtones um in terms of mother Mary it actually is not um it's his mother Mary McCarney and was having a hard time struggling with the fame of The Beatles at that moment and one night he slept and his mother Mary came to him and just said Relax it's going to be okay stay true to yourself continue doing what you're doing just let it be and he woke up and he wrote the song I love that story um and there's some actionable takeaways here that um if if I may I I just wanted to um mention um a previous guest on this episode in fact he's been on the the podcast twice is the the great Rick Ruben oh I've listened to those yeah one of one of the most legendary music producers of all time and and the second episode that we did with Rick gets heavily into some of his protocols for lack of a better way to describe them and one of the things that Rick does is when he wakes up in the morning he makes it a point to he takes walks he gets Sunshine he hydrates he does all of those things but to try and make the transition between sleep and wakefulness to be rather gradual almost to allow some of the the components of sleep to um kind of bleed into the morning and then allow wakefulness to to come about um and in his case he's able to push some of the more uh linear processing and procedural things to later in the day um and I've spent a lot of time with Rick I'm fortunate to be close friends with Rick and and I can tell you that he also spends a fair amount of time you know sitting or lying down typically very still with his eyes closed just thinking or allowing thoughts to emerge as part of um his creative process now he's certainly not the only one to do this um but he's he's a notable example but what's the takeaway here should everyone be you know lying with their eyes closed um when they first wake up perhaps but there's a some potential dos but I think there's a really strong don't if one subscribes to the idea that during sleep there is substantial reorganization of neural circuitry AKA learning but also expansion of creative opportunity as you've clearly pointed out and there are data to support that statement then it stands to reason that upon waking there's a key opportunity to capture some of that information that is now in your mind um that was created the night before but that if you immediately look at your phone that you Eclipse that process with sensory input from somebody else's ideas and what's going on in the world and it's not to say that looking your phone first thing in the morning is a is a is a cardinal sin or a violation of any kind of neural neural circuit requirement but I in an attempt to try and capture some of the learning and creativity that occurs during sleep have tried for a while now to not look at my phone for at least the first 30 minutes after waking it's very challenging to do for for most everybody but rather to let some of the ideas um from sleep percolate up and I will often go you know be you know making a morning of tea or something and then go running to my office to write something down that suddenly Springs to mind and then I'll remember that this was something that came to me in a dream the night before none of which as significant as the Benzene ring or the periodic table or the kind of works that uh Rick has produced but I think that we need to be cautious about um not short circuiting these um these creative insights that no doubt can come to us and sleep I think it's very well worth just even for your own mental health firstly not to just wake up up and start your reception of the world but to do some as we've mentioned reflection on what you've just experienced by way of sleeping and it doesn't necessarily have to be that you're trying to recall your dreams just sit with whatever your thoughts are think about the the day ahead think about the days prior and there is some benefit and the creative benefit there you mentioned Einstein another one that is often mentioned to me is Edison uh Thomas Edison the in ventor and Edison was claimed to be a short sleeper people will say well he was a brilliant inventor but you know he said that he didn't sleep very much it turns out that Edison was a habitual Napper during the day and I've got lots of pictures of him him napping on his workbench um in his Studio him napping in the garden I love it well I took a 45 minute nap today yeah and it was he and I'm no Edison but I subscribed to his protocols um but you know he he understood the creative Brilliance of sleep to your point about writing things down and he used it ruthlessly as a tool and here's what he would do it's genius he would take a pair of Steel bull bearings in his right hand he would sit in his office on a reclining chair with a rest for his arm and then he would put a pad of paper and a pen next to him and then he would gradually start to relax off but what he' done was he' used a metal sauce Spin and turned it upside down and placed it underneath the armrest and as he was drifting off into that state into that sort of lional state so he didn't go too far into sleep what would happen is that his muscle tone would gradually relax he would release the steel ball bearings they would crash on the saucepan wake him up and then he would start to write down all of the ideas that he was having from that linal state oh you said saucepan saucepan sorry that's why no no that's okay but uh very so what made a it made a a a metal sauce underneath you know or a water pale whatever it was and it would crash that wake him up and then he would write down these ideas so interesting and in fact if you look at his house which is preserved um historical you can walk around and he had nap Cuts installed in his house so he could go into different rooms and take naps in these little cuts for his genius brilliant isn't it it is brilliant sorry I didn't mean to interrupt but it was out of enthusiasm I I mean I I don't want to um like give too much detailed information about Rick's working environment but yet let's just say there are a lot of places to lie down and access these these states of mind um and you know it looks like somebody just lying there with their eyes closed but there's an extremely active mind in there obviously look at the look at the um productive output of Rick's career is you know it's truly something to behold behold in capital bold underline highlighted letters um but it's so clear to me um based on all the examples you gave the ones that we're kind of batting back and forth now and I think there's a book the title is something like Winston Churchill's nap or something like that that my dad has always talking my dad's a theoretical physicist always talks about napping is so key um to one's ability to come up with novel Solutions um you know I guess uh that napping frequently throughout the day perhaps violates some of the tenants that you um described in the uh episode on napping and caffeine episode three we put I think you we put in guard rails and we put in the protocols to say okay naps under certain circumstances are no bad thing at all and if you're going to do it here are the suggested guidelines as to exactly how you optimize naps with a protocol um but it is I think it's very worthwhile to just appreciate exactly how complex sleep is in terms of what it's doing for information processing and if you to ask me look what's the the take-home of this final section I think it's no one has ever told you Andrew you really need to stay awake on a problem they've told you that you should sleep now many times on a problem go to sleep yeah sleep on a problem and what's interesting is that in every language that I've inquired about today from you know English to Swahili that phrase sleeping on a problem or something like it very much exist I think the Spanish someone was telling me is translated is you have a conversation with your pillow which I thought was lovely what I also was struck by a fellow who was um French said you in in England you say you you sleep on a problem well the French translation is much closer to you sleep with a problem and I thought that's much so much about the Romantic difference between the beautiful French and the the Eng you know you sleep on a problem ver as you sleep with a problem yes I agree I I think um not only does it have more romantic Notions but but I like it because it there's a a um a symbiotic aspect to you know sleeping with the problem there's kind of a meshing with the challenge in a way that um isn't as uh combative like this thing that's Weighing on you you go to sleep with and you're supposed to wake up and and feel like you've solved it like Eureka right push down on it rather than it's elaboration with sleep rather than a demand from it but I also think it's you know I make that notion about language translation and maybe a slight joke but what it also tells me is this that that phenomenon of sleep dependent creativity transcends cultural boundaries it is common across the globe it's a universal phenomenon why well because sleep is a universal phenomenon not just even in humans but in almost every species that we've studied carefully to dat as you uh described the um the the French notion of sleeping with a problem I think um what the that comes to mind is that perhaps the the idea is um if you're going to sleep with a problem that um you should be the big spoon and they should be the little spoon as opposed as opposed to the problem being the big spoon and you're kind of wrapped in the problem maybe the the problem needs to mesh with you but maybe I'm taking this this IM a little too far before we close out this discussion about sleep and creativity I can't help but bring up um a set of questions around a different nonsleep protocol that in many ways seems to mimic sleep and that for some individuals throughout history in particular the great physicist Richard Fineman um another habitual Napper yeah and an absolute Idol of mine uh wrote about and spoke about his fondness for um these flotation tanks that are contain a temperature of water that is um fairly neutral so one doesn't recognize um the difference between body temperature and the surrounding water and there's a certain amount of of salt salinity in the water that allows one to float at a at a um kind of a depth within the water that one loses their sense of proprioceptive awareness as you described earlier in in this series a key component of falling asleep and he talked about how under those conditions in the flotation tank there was a um kind of an untethering of the of one's Notions of space and time that were very sleep-like and that that was one of his um go-to for Creative Solutions um people talked about walks um as a go-to for Creative Solutions in the shower people seem to come up with Creative Solutions states of Mind where that they're um an activi is where it's only somewhat goal directed but basically the idea is to just lose track of one's body positioning and let the mind go so to speak and for that matter psychedelics are um have on occasion been um attributed as at least one of the sources of Creative Solutions um I raised these ideas understanding that each one of those could be a podcast into itself but it seems to me that sleep and in particular dream sleep is Nature's Way of creating these um you know these states of untethering our our our rigid linear understanding of what relates to what and it provides this this you know near magical mixing of of things learned the day before and um and that's the essence of creativity and humans have been trying to tap into the creative process through all these other portals for a long time with expensive Technologies and um but it it it's becoming very clear to me that the technology already exists and that it costs absolutely nothing and that it has tremendous health benefits uh uh in addition to its benefits for creativity and that that uh technology is this This brilliant technology of of sleep yeah and dreaming it's a stunning State Matt thank you so much for today's discussion about sleep memory learning and creativity um we are now four episodes into this series on sleep uh first episode we discussed rather you taught us about sleep and the biology of sleep as well as some actionable um takeaways so actually some I would say some uh important guidelines for getting one sleep correct and then in this second episode you went much further into protocols both basic Advanced for getting one sleep right maybe even optimized and the third episode you taught us about naps and caffeine and today you've taken us on a beautiful exploration of the relationship between sleep and learning are what's more interesting than neuroplasticity and learning I mean after all um you know humans are unique in our ability to learn so many things throughout the lifespan it's one of the things that distinguishes us from the other species on the planet the the the very very long window perhaps lifelong window for the opportunity to learn and of course creativity and novel solutions to challenging problems in the world but also great works of art and music Etc I think we can fairly say based on what you've taught us today that sleep has been not only the Bedrock of mental health physical health and performance since the beginning of time and still now but also has been one of the fundamental drivers of human evolution because of all the creative insights that have OCC occurred and all the learning that's occurred in sleep that's then been transformed into real world Technologies indeed it's much of the way that we have the the blessing of being right here right now if that's the flag that you're raising I will salute it uh five we still Tuesday very much yes well I'll salute that flag right with you and also point to the exciting fact that the next episode episode five in this series you're going to teach us about the really tight relationship between sleep and emotional processing and emotionality and I can't think of a more interesting topic to get into especially at this point in the series and I look forward to that discussion with emotional enthusiasm I can't wait if folks are interested in trying to modulate their mental health um I think that next discussion should be very helpful with regard to sleep I hope so at least thank you for joining me for today's episode episode

There are a lot of studies now really showing pretty significant effects of e-cigarette use on heart and lungs. Not only all the chemicals we've mentioned, but also the flavorants. There's cinnamon aldehyde, another aldehyde, there's vanillin, there's the buttery flavor that's in there is also a lot of concern. You then take it and really inhale the resulting aerosol, and then we're seeing the lesions on the lungs. We're seeing young people who have been using e-cigarettes having lung collapses, pneumonia, asthma amongst people who've not had, seizures. One of the teens I know who was using four pods a day was having seizures. Makes sense because nicotine is a stimulant. Yes. So it can cause runaway excitability in the brain if too much is taken. So if that's happening in the living child, that can't be good. Yeah. That can't be good. That can't be good. Lungs, bloodstream, everything. And all the aldehydes are carcinogens. Correct. We know they cause cancer. Right, right. And so that's why there's a lot of concern there.

Title: The NASA Nap Culture: Boosting Alertness & Productivity with Short Naps
Published: 2024-04-22 21:08:24 UTC
Description:
Dr. Matt Walker discusses how @NASA discovered the benefits of short naps in the 1980s, leading to improved alertness and task productivity among astronauts and ground-based employees, fostering what is now known as the NASA nap culture.

Transcript Language: English
NASA figured this out back in the 1980s. They were looking at ways to optimize their astronauts because when you are up in orbit, depending on what orbit you are in, you are rotating around the planet maybe 10, 20 times per 24 hours. So you're seeing 10 to 20 sunsets and sunrises. So your sleep is a total mess, and you can safety check almost everything in terms of technology. But the one weak link in a space mission is this thing called the human being. That's where errors typically happen. And what they found was that these naps produced almost a 20% boost in short naps, 20% boost in their alertness, and almost a 50% boost in their task productivity. And it was so powerful that it translated to the terrestrial employees of NASA on the ground, and it became what was known as the NASA nap culture.

Title: Dr. Bonnie Halpern-Felsher: Vaping, Alcohol Use & Other Risky Youth Behaviors
Published: 2024-04-22 12:01:02 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, PhD, FSAHM. She is a professor of pediatrics and adolescent medicine and a developmental psychologist at Stanford University School of Medicine. Dr. Halpern-Felsher is a world expert in adolescent decision-making and risk-taking behaviors. 

She explains the huge increase in vaping (e-cigarettes) by young people. She explains why vaping nicotine and cannabis is particularly dangerous to the developing brain. We discuss the rise in vaping addiction, the unique social pressures and social media influences faced by youth that make quitting challenging, and interventions to aid them in quitting or reducing use. 

We also discuss the role of technology and social media. And, the use of alcohol, nicotine pouches, fentanyl, and other risky behaviors that adolescents face now. 

This episode should interest parents, teachers, coaches, teens, and families. It covers the current youth substance use landscape and also covers resources and ways to quit these addictive behaviors.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Bonnie helper felsher Dr Bonnie helper felsher is a professor of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine a developmental psychologist by training Dr Halper felshire is a world expert in the risk behaviors that adolescents teens and young adults participate in today we discuss nicotine use both by way of smoking as well as vaping and ecigarette use we also discuss cannabis and some of the correlative as well as possibly causal data linking cannabis use to psychosis in young adults and we discussed some of the other common risky behaviors that adolescence teens and young adults participate in including risky driving behavior alcohol consumption and risky sexual behavior we discussed the various factors that impact whether or not a young person will participate in Risky behaviors including the family and home as well as peer group and social media and as we discuss social media we get into a deep discussion about how marketing is combining with peer pressure in order to drive youth toward particular risky behaviors by the end of today's conversation you will have learned from Dr Halper felshire the latest research on risk-taking behavior in adolescence teens and young adults and what we can each and all do to ensure that they either avoid these behaviors or if they are already engaging in these behaviors that we can mitigate some of the potential harms and potentially get them to eliminate these behaviors toward having a life of enhanced mental and physical health before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity now I've spoken many times before in this podcast about the critical need to get sleep both enough sleep and enough quality sleep when we do that everything our mental health our physical health performance in any sports or School Etc all get better and when we're not sleeping well or enough all those things suffer one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is that your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3° in order to fall and stay deeply asleep and in order to wake up feeling refreshed your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3° one of the best ways to ensure that happens is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and with eight sleep it makes it very easy to do that you program in the temperature that you want at the beginning middle and end of the night you can even divide the temperature for two different people if you have two different people sleeping in the bed and it tracks your sleep it tells you how much slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep you're getting it really helps you dial in the correct parameters to get the best possible night sleep for you I've been sleeping on an eight sleep mattress cover for well over 3 years now and it has completely transformed my sleep for the better if you'd like to try eight sleep you can go to 8sleep.com huberman and save $150 off their pod three cover eight sleep currently ships in the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by matina matina makes loose leaf and ready to drink yeram mate I often discuss yeram mate's benefits such as regular ating blood sugar it's high antioxidant content the ways that it can improve digestion and possible neuroprotective effects I also drink yamate because I love the taste while there are a lot of different choices of yerbamate drinks out there I love matina because again they have the no sugar variety as well as the fact that both their loose leaf and their canned varieties are of the absolute best quality so much so that I decided to become a partial owner in the company although I must say even if they hadn't allowed me to do that I would be drinking matina is the cleanest tasting and best yeram mate you can find I love the taste of brood loose leaf matina yerbamate and I particularly love the taste of maa's new canned cold brew zero sugar yerbamate which I personally help them develop if you'd like to try matina go to drink maa.com huberman right now matina is offering a free one PB bag of loose leaf yerbamate tea and free shipping with a purchase of two cases of their cold brew yerbamate again that's drink maa.com huberman to get the free bag of yamate loose leaf tea and free shipping today's episode is also brought To Us by element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means zero sugar and the appropriate ratios of the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium and that correct ratio of electrolytes is extremely important because every cell in your body but especially your nerve cells your neurons relies on electroly in order to function properly so when you're well hydrated and your hydration also includes the appropriate ratios of electrolytes your mental functioning and your physical functioning is improved I drink one packet of element dissolved in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning as well as while I exercise and if I've sweat a lot during that exercise I often will drink a third element packet dissolved in about 32 ounces of water after I exercise if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element spelled elm.com huberman to try a free sample pack again that's drink element.com huberman and now for my discussion with Dr Bonnie helper felshire Dr Helper felshire welcome thank you so much for having me we're going to talk about a very important and sometimes troubling period of life not always troubling but I think for everyone adolescence and the teen years youth essentially is a tricky landscape yes it is it can be yeah as our brain and bodies mature we have more autonomy in where we take them but that means also more exposure to the ideas suggestions actions pure pressure of others and um that's sometimes where the the problems arise and who knows probably also where the solutions come from too from time to time but I think as conscientious people um who mind the well-being of others of our species we'd all like to know sort of like what are the key features that Mark this stage of development maybe we'll just start off by talking about this through the lens of um your expertise as a developmental psychologist you know what is adolescence in the teen years like what's going on um what sorts of things are being worked out psychologically um that we might not be aware of and then we can talk about some of the common pitfalls and the risk-taking Behavior everything from smoking vaping drug use um sexual behavior uh addictive behaviors as it relates to social media bullying risky driving there's so much there but uh maybe we could just look at this stage of Youth through the lens of a developmental psychologist and share with us anything you feel is worth worth knowing sure so first of all ages adolescence uh can be anywhere from start starting roughly around age 10 some people would say ending around age 18 maybe 21 if you want to go into young adulthood then maybe mid2 and really adolescence is a wonderful time of as you said exploration it's a time when first of all marked by pubal changes on set amenes for girls um and and really the pubal and physical development SE secondary sexual characteristics are coming out we also have a lot of emotional development going on during this time height changes are occurring during this time but we're getting a lot of social changes as well as you said peer pressures so one misn is parents think that they don't matter during adolescence they still really matter but peers also come in and matter quite a bit and then teens are really trying to figure out who they are you get a lot of questions who am I where am I going in life what do I want to do when I grow up what's important to me how do other people feel about me and then how do I feel about other people so a lot of the social and psycho Social Development is happening as well and you get asynchronous development too if a young person for example starts puberty at a younger age say 10 where they're physically looking older more mature but emotionally in psychosocially they still might be young versus the late matures physical matures who may be not having and looking like in a older teener an adult till 16 17 18 but they're more mature emotionally than others then you might have some confusion to that young person I look older but I don't feel older and stuff like that but it's really this wonderful time of exploration for an adolescent and a time of really wanting autonomy and wanting to make a lot of decisions that we should like them make but there are some risks that we have to be careful about at the same time I often heard this word autonomy as it relates to this uh stage of you know puberty and the teen years you mentioned that kids of the that age still really need their parents um you know in the last gosh 20 30 years in this country there's been a market increase in the frequency of divorce um is there any direct evidence that single parent homes or homes where I don't know people are remarried or just basically divorced homes are somehow um creating more challenges in terms of risk-taking behavior in adolescence and teens or um or not because I know plenty of people who had you know grew up in single parent homes um sometimes parents remarried and sometimes didn't and I by my mind I can't seem to come up with any direct correlation you know plenty of uh those kids did fine and plenty of kids in two parent homes that I know had had challenges and and vice versa yeah I haven't contributed actually that was some my earlier dissertation work and I haven't really contributed to that literature for a while but what you're saying is is pretty accurate to what I've seen which is really the literature would say it's not the divorce per se it's the conflict that is happening so if parents actually get divorced usually if the conflict resumes teenagers and children generally do well and particularly within about two years if the conflict uh resolves if the conflict resolves right so you can have two parents who are married and living in the same home and may or may not be a good relationship but living in the same home if there's no conflict or that then generally teens will do well or as you're saying there's not necessarily a direct correlation the problem comes in whether parents are living at home together or separated or divorced is if there's conflict and then that conflict tends to result in social issues emotional issues a lot of social anxiety a lot of feeling like I need to do better so that way my parents like me more and we see that with children too that's not just adolescence a lot of depression and with depression can come self-medication and uh self-medicating around other drugs and so on but that generally is resolved if the conflict resolves but as you're saying we're seeing adolescent angst regardless of parenting uh what we really need though it's not a matter of just the divorce or not divorce or the relationship between the parents it's parenting that's important so parents being good monitors being involved in their kids' lives not this oh you're 16 you have a car you can go wherever you want and we're not going to keep an eye on you we still need parents to monitor to pay attention to find out their kids' friends where are they going after school that discretionary time when parents are working and teenagers come home between 3 and 5 or 3 and six tends to be the most risky couple of hours they're it's called discretionary hours where there's no parent around and we don't always know where those teenagers are hanging out so that's more important knowing where their children are and what they're doing and that there's some adult presence some monitoring then whether or not they're still in a relationship my sense is that smartphones have allowed more communication and monitoring between parents and kids but also more interactions between kids and other kids and kids and adults more broadly so is there any evidence that uh the Advent of smartphones is directly creating problems for kids that um has to do with just so much more PE PE to peer interaction or peer to-peer exposure like when I was growing up we didn't have smartphones uh if you did something stupid like that meaning that kids would laugh at it might get told to a small group of people maybe a larger group of people but um in general it just kind of didn't go anywhere you're like a I screwed up and then You' get teased a bit and then it would kind of dissipate but now of course that can propagate very very far very fast is there any evidence that that mere fact is creating issues for for kids so I would say it's not a blanket statement I think it depends on the behavior that we're talking about bullying no doubt the example that you gave no doubt that if you mess up if you do something stupid it's getting filmed and it's going to go viral it will go on social media and then it will perpetuate and escalate amongst the peers um that we definitely know is happening and certainly in terms of drug use and marketing there there's def some peer-to-peer interaction look how cool I am look at the Smoke Ring I did look at other things that I've been doing there there is no doubt but in general there are also some good things about it parent communication they can monitor where their children are they can put a tracker on the phone uh I know with my own kids sometimes it was the best way to say you seem a little sad when face-to-face communication wasn't happening I could use the the phone to have that conversation so yes there is some evidence that overall phones and smartphones have increased risk behavior but it's more the access to the behavior and then the viral of really getting that information out like you said if somebody screws up um somebody dresses wrong if somebody kisses somebody that that could go pretty viral I wouldn't say that smartphones and social media as a whole is the problem I think it's situation specific and behavior specific that we're seeing and particularly around marketing for example that teenagers have more access now to YouTube to marketing that they're promoting not only are Industries promoting for example ecigarettes or cannabis promoting to young people but teens are promoting to each other and that we didn't see before smartphones right we didn't see I took a picture or Instagram look at me smoking or look at me dressing sexy or look at me looking cool or anything like that that did happen before it was more just word of mouth so that is definitely where we're a lot more concerned about social media um but more my concern about social media is the outside world targeting young people and that's where where I've been the the biggest concern about it teenagers targeting each other with bullying no doubt big issue but in other ways there's more support there's more social interaction the other time I get concerned though around teenagers is is more the social piece of sitting around together at a table and they're not talking they're on the phones so what we really don't know enough is how is the not getting out and playing and instead playing on a game not going to the park and and instead communicating through phones how is that changing their social and physical development is where I'm also very concerned yeah I uh have family relatives with um who are in their teens and it's interesting to see them interact um where they're on their phones a lot of the time but I've also noticed that there's a cohort of kids that are really trying to put their phones away and just spend time together and that was actually directly stated to me that oh yeah we hang out and we make it a point not to be on our phones when we hang out and then but then of course they'll text or be on the iPad with one another in the evening when they're apart so they're sort of never apart right um but I do think there seems to be at least a sub movement of um kids and teens that are trying to do more face Toof face interaction with devices at least put aside I answer a really good point I've talked to some teens who say that they all they get together and they will deliberately put the phones face down in the middle no phones and have dinner have a conversation so I I think you're right I definitely think that that that has been a movement and I really appreciate that and I think that's fantastic I've also seen circumstances where two teens are trying to help each other with homework and they're texting each other which is fine but I've often said why don't you just pick up the phone and call the person and in five minutes you can figure out the math assignment instead of 20 30 minutes of back and forth it's just not as efficient unless you're literally copying and showing the picture but is that having a change on their social or physical development or emotional development probably not it's just a different world the way that they communicate and that's why I say I'm less worried in some ways as long as they're still getting out and they're playing and they're being creative I'm less worried about that kind of social interaction on on phones and social media it's a different way we don't have a lot of evidence to say when we're the other but if they're still doing the things that they should be doing as young people my concern is that outside world the the um concern of predatory behaviors the concern of Industry the concern of mass media and marketing to teens that's the part that gets me particularly worried yeah well we know for sure that this is the first time in human evolution that um humans have essentially written with their thumbs there's got to be a massive expansion of the brain's representation of the thumbs relative to you know 20 30 years ago but maybe now would be a good time to talk about risky behaviors uh or even just behaviors that are known to have some detriment to health smoking and vaping and e cigarettes um primarily and we should be probably distinguishing between nicotine and cannabis um maybe let's just start with nicotine what what are the statistics on um smoking vaping and ecigarettes just rough statistics I I um saw a talk that you did online decided some pretty outrageous increases in um or shocking increases in smoking and vaping in the last couple of years just staggering so maybe if you give us the top Contour of those sure absolutely so the good news is smoking rates conventional cigarette smoking rates has gone down pretty dramatically in the last couple of decades with teenagers with all people in the US which is wonderful by teenagers to um well below 10% if not really well below 5% of teenagers that's the good news in terms of ecigarette use which I prefer the term ecigarette use than vaping because they're they're not Vapes they're aerosols uh but ecigarette use has gone up pretty dramatically so ecigarettes came on the market in the US in 200 seven and they were slow to to for uptick amongst teenagers they look like cigarettes when they first came on the market they weren't very popular with teenagers they didn't have they had some flavors not a lot didn't have a lot of nicotine it was probably around 2011 to 2014 we started seeing an uptick but then it was really in 2017 to 19 that we saw a dramatic increase and that was the the statistics there we saw upwards of 27 to 29% of teens using ecigarettes during th those couple years daily use past 30 days so any use in the past 30 days okay uh was and in daily use it'll be some smaller percentage of that it was something like a 78% increase in high school student use and a 48% increase in middle school use over those couple of years so a very dramatic increase in use since 2019 it's gone down but I'm going to give a caveat it's gone down in 2020 to the numbers are showing uh they went to around 20% and now around 10% part of that was in 2020 we had covid and initiation of ecigarette use really occurs socially and going back to socialization it's a lot of teens getting together and it's not pure pressure of you have to try come on try this it's more like my friends are using I'm at a party I feel like using yeah I'll try it well during the pandemic and the shutdown teens were not at school they weren't with their friends so initiation went down teens who were addicted and we can certainly talk about levels of nicotine and eats but teens who were addicted continues to use some tried to quit which was great but we still saw a fair amount of use so part of the decrease in those 2020 to 2021 have to do with just access and socialization had changed and so rates went down since then even we publish a paper showing relationships between Co and vaping we saw evali ecigarette and vaping Associated lung illness so that that we think was part of why we also saw further drops around 2021 but people were concerned about their lung health and teens as well and that's great the latest data show that their rates are under 10% the National Data I actually don't think it's true and the reason I don't think it's true is I'm in the schools doing curriculum presentations all the time where I teach and educate teachers to use our tobacco and cannabis prevention curriculums and we've never been busier than we are right now with schools just crying for help we have an another group of teenagers using ecigarettes nicotine or cannabis or whatever it's way more than 10% I would say schools are telling me it's 40 to 60% of their students are using ecigarettes so for with for we don't know or canis it's very hard to know it's very hard to know what's in there uh but 40 to 60% that's what the schools are saying at some point in the last 30 days at some point in the last 30 days they're catching just exorbitant numbers of students using right now and so from a science perspective is it 10% 20% 30 we don't know I can just tell you that the national CDC data would say 10% and maybe it's a problem with the surveys or the questions or teens aren't being honest but from a school's perspective it's much higher and then we have some National Data suggesting it's more in the 20 to 30 to 40% range as well whatever it is it's too many it's too many teens who are inhaling nicotine and and cannabis as well wow a lot to unpack there first of all um nicotine I did an episode of the podcast about nicotine um and a little bit of that got um confused in the way it landed um so I'll just quickly State nicotine known cognitive enhancer also known to dramatically increased blood pressure and vasil constriction not healthy for the body just to be clear it's not healthy for the body so when people hear that it's a cognitive enhancer increases focus and alertness that's true um in the short term highly addictive highly highly addictive um and habit forming since sometimes those are separated maybe we um delve into that distinction but by my observation very few people can use nicotine occasionally people who try it seem to um like it um at least in the short run and keep using it um so presumably kids are using I should say youth are using nicotine either by vape ecigarette and they quote unquote like the way it makes them feel who knows maybe it'll allows them to focus on their studies better I don't know uh but it is known to improve certain forms of cognition but only transiently and it's highly addictive and it's bad for their health for anyone's health so that puts us in kind of a tricky situation when evaluating in the statistics that you just uh laid out because uh one wonders you know are they taking it and then continuing to take it because of peer pressure because of lack of peer pressure to not do it because it helps them with their schoolwork um because they're naturally a little bit depressed and it provides a kind of um anti-depressant signal I mean what what do we know about why they're actually starting and why they're continuing and why they are reluctant to quit maybe we just parse those so why does a teenager try nicotine so there are a few reasons why they start um based on the the literature scientific literature and just talking to teens one has to do with the marketing no doubt if you look at the marketing it is targeting young people uh it's targeting them with first of all the devices themselves they are cool looking uh they're easy to hide they look like USB devices they look like highlighters in fact there's a new brand out called highlight that is a highlighter that's a working highlighter but it's actually a nicotine ecigarette so a highlighter pen to to study highlighter pen to study and then but it's actually you take the cover off and it's actually a nicotine ecigarette device clearly marketed toward students clearly marketed towards students wow you have what's it called Boba uh you know um teas drinks oh yeah the tea with the yeah a little mimicking that drink that's actually a that the straw is actually The Vaping inhaling there little pieces you have um Star Wars shapes you know it goes on and on just the cartoon shapes that are clearly being targeted to not just teenagers children that we're sing CH children like young children children like young children so wait so I'm I'm I'm um shocked so kids younger than 10 are are having these products push their way they are and actually I didn't tell you in the statistics the statistics I was citing I should go back and clarify a couple there to that are even more shocking so those are the numbers for middle and high school we don't have data from elementary but again the other part of in addition to the science I contribute to the interventions I do I am getting Elementary School teachers calling us for help they are catching second and third graders using nicotin cigarettes I'm not kidding and not just one or two quite a bit we said we would never develop an elementary school version of a vaping prevention curriculum that's what we call our uh you and me together vaperee we would never we have a middle school and a high school we were never going to do elementary we've had so many schools across the country call us and say we need something for elementary so we actually created a curriculum so we're having there there was a story of an 8-year-old uh back East who was caught and using and and the teachers and police didn't know what to do and of course I said it's not a police matter why aren't we helping this young person so we are we're we're seeing younger now sometimes they're starting because they're siblings older siblings uh it's being marketed to it they don't realize that it's a nicotine ecigarette or cannabis ecigarette they just don't realize what it is but the number of these products that are being targeted to young people is absolutely ridiculous ous what they look like uh the pictures are endless and the problem is they're coming out with new products every few months that are targeting kids so marketing the other is flavors and flavors and marketing go hand in hand you know if it if it looks bad looks like or and smells like and tastes like nicotine or tobacco teens know that that's gross that's why we don't have cigarette use anymore teens we've socialized our country to say if you smell tobacco it's it's nothing that we want to smell we walk away from it you walk across the street whatever we've done a really good job in Tobacco Control getting the word out around that these products e cigarettes smell and taste like sugar like sweets like dessert like candy so you've got and and the names are things like unicorn poop and sugar booger and honey dooo that's not for adults those names are squarely for kids it's kids who are using chocolate it's kids who are using these flavors that are on the market and then the marketing around it are these I mean they're beautiful they're these you know Pizzazz of pineapple dancing around or of you know um strawberries dancing or whatever it is that are very animated they're a juice box style that uh that have come out juice boox style vaping devices that are marketed looking like juice boxes again that's that's not targeting you and me that's targeting a kid interesting and uh scary uh to hear all this I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 by now most of you have heard me tell my story about how I've been taking ag1 once or twice a day every day since 2012 and indeed that's true I started taking ag1 and I still take ag1 once or twice a day because it gives me vitamins and minerals that I might not be getting enough of from Whole Foods that I eat as well as adaptogens and micronutrients those adaptogens and micronutrients are really critical because even though I strive to eat most of my foods from unprocessed or minimally processed Whole Foods it's often hard to do so especially when I'm traveling and especially when I'm busy so by drinking a packet of ag1 in the morning and often times also again in the afternoon or evening I'm ensuring that I'm getting everything I need I'm covering all of my foundational nutritional needs and I like so many other people that take ag1 regularly just report feeling better and that shouldn't be surprising because it supports gut health and of course gut health supports immune system health and brain health and it's supporting a ton of different cellular and organ processes that all interact with one another so while certain supplements are really directed towards one specific outcome like sleeping better or being more alert ag1 really is foundational nutritional support it's really designed to support all of the systems of your brain and body that relate to mental health and physical health if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs with your order plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman what percentage of adults in the US Vapor use ecigarettes just by way of comparison so I've seen numbers anywhere from 5% to around 20% depending on the statistic I actually haven't looked at the latest data on on adults um but but the majority of adults who are using are it's a little bit different to think about it adults are using generally they're not initiating tobacco through ecigarettes they're generally and I'm talking 30 and up they generally have been smoking cigarettes and then maybe they're trying to use ecigarettes to quit which is a whole another uh set of literature that it's not say as effective as we're hoping that it is there isn't good literature on a popul ation level that ecigarettes help adults quit uh cigarettes the difference with teenagers is they're initiating with ecigarettes and they're not saying huh here's a cigarette here's an ecigarette which one do I choose it's not that they're substituting or replacing they're not using cigarettes some are now because they're switching back and forth but they're initiating with these cigarettes they're initiating because of the marketing they're initiating because of the flavors and the products and the ability to hide it parents don't know what these products look like so the landscape is very different so you were telling us Why teens and Adolescent start vaping and marketing is clearly oriented toward them there are a number of reinforcing factors that at least to my mind as you're describing all this make it sound like the stuff is supposed to be quote unquote playful that it's it's not um it's not a drug that sort of thing reminds me a little bit of sugary cereals when I was a kid you'd buy this the cereal cuz you wanted the taste but you also wanted the colorful box you had the you know the cartoons that it related to on TV and there's usually a toy inside that you wanted some surprise that you could then collect across boxes so there was a lot of levels of incentiv foration why do they keep smoking or vaping are they addicted to nicotine yeah absolutely so so the other reason why they start is they like like the taste and they like the rush so I've talked to so that's the other piece as so a few more reasons why they start and then and then certainly answer your question around the nicotine um teens have told me outright that they like the taste they like the rush they like the buzz and we could talk about how much nicotine is in there it's astonishing and I can explain that but they like the buzz they they another reason by the way is stress and coping right now teens are so stressed out they' they've been stressed out for years but they're particularly stressed with the pandemic and even though we're a couple years out of the lockdown teens are still they're having socialization issues social emotional learning issues they're still confused uh they missed a couple of years particularly high school students may have missed part of middle school where you're learning to socialize with other people so they're very stressed and we know that there's a pretty strong relationship between stress not being able to cope and using any drug but incl Nico tee so there's a lot of different reasons why young people and certainly the peers and again it's not peer pressure it's more like a lot of friends are using it I've talked to teens who say I wasn't intending on but I tried it and wow I really like the taste I like the flavor and then there's the amount of nicotine that's in there in 2015 when the newer products came on the market it was a salt-based nicotine so cigarettes and then earlier ecigarettes have a freebased nicotine freebased nicotine uses ammonia and sugar to bind to the nicotine and the other chemicals there's hundreds of chemicals in there to go through the body lungs into the brain and give you that Rush the free based nicotine is very costic if you think the litmus test it's very much on the basic side of the litmus test there and if you're a nicotine naive youth which again Most teens starting with nicotine ecigarettes have not used nicotine before when you start you don't want that costic throat hit feeling that's how it's described teens will say they don't like it they cough it tasted bad well to an adult who's been using cigarettes they don't mind that they're used to it but a teen is not well I will mention juel here because it's relevant juel came on the market in 2015 with a salt-based nicotine which essentially uh for those who aren't familiar with CTIC and um litmus tests and things like that the salt-based nicotine as I understand is quote unquote smoother it's um it causes less U sort of coughing um static contraction of the the muscles in the mouth and throat you know and so it's basically more palpable and more of a of a kind of gradual on-ramp which is exactly what a company wants um if you want somebody to start using something you don't want to hit them Square in the face that's exactly right that's exactly right so salt-based nicotine generally uses benzoic acid to move that Li Mist test needle from the CTIC towards acidic because it's it's an acid but really towards neutral so exactly so when you use it it's smooth it's easy to use you don't have that throat hit you don't cough you don't feel sick from it so teens will say and I I've talked to teens and young adults who tried earlier ecigarettes and didn't like it and then tried the salt Bas style and said oo I like it couple with the flavors it's also more absorbent so there's some suggestion and some early evidence that it's also more addictive so when those products first came on the market before earlier ecigarettes had say 0 to 36 milligram of nicotine suddenly we jumped up to 59 Mig per mil which is about generally about a 40 41 milligram uh because it's about a 7 mil uh sorry little chemistry and math that we a lot here but you're looking at basically it's anywhere from the nicotine that you see in either one to two packs of cigarettes per per device per pod per ecigarette device and how long does a pod typically last a let's say like a 15 or 16 year old kid who's um you know taking a hit off The Vape Pen um I don't know what five times a day so I've asked teens in some of the early earlier Publications we did now not with the newer devices but the older devices and they would say that they were using a pot a week which is about two or three cigarettes a day to one to four pods a day one to four pods a day one to four now these are highly addicted teenagers that is one to eight packs of cigarettes depending on the debates on how much nicotine is in there but you're looking at several packs of cigarettes worth of nicotine okay so just to backtrack a little bit because we got a little bit um technical um which is great but I want to make sure everyone's on board the amount of nicotine in one of these pods that goes into the vape pen or EIG is significantly greater than the amount of nicotine in one pack of cigarettes in many cases in many cases and there are many youth so adolescence and teens you said before between ages of 10 and 21 roughly 10 to 18 10 to 21 that are going through as many as four pods per day which has to be at least the equivalent of four packs of cigarettes but could be as much as eight packs of cigarettes per day correct in terms of nicotine concentration correct now I I guess to be fair they are not smoking in the traditional sense so that presumably there's some tars and other contaminants that are not going into their system but we know that there are a lot of chemicals in these pods besides just nicotine and I think that's where a big source of the um debate and interest is now is you know how dangerous are those those other chemicals is really an interesting question so um a lot of things that you said are really important to highlight U absolutely now not all teenagers are using four pods a day these are extreme very highly addicted teens uh and and unfortunately teens we've seen with lung collapses and and other pretty significant health issues typically teens are using maybe a pod a day the newer ecigarettes by the way have probably four times that they're bigger volume so you're looking at 60 70 Mig of nicotine some of them are equivalent to about 3 to 500 cigarettes worth of nicotine now are they using them in a day probably not we haven't done the studies on that but it's really the first nicotine product we've had that you can use 247 when I've talked to teens you know I wake up in the middle of the night I may check my phone and check my email teens are waking up in the middle of the night to take a hit and they're they're hiding them under their pillows in their nightstands whatever and they're telling me that they're just using them all the time and they could just suck on them all the time are they using when you say all the time that's interesting forgive me for interrupting but no no no are they using it specifically to wake up to study to um or just to maintain Baseline I mean that's the that's the problem with any addictive substance or habit forming substance is that what starts off as a rush becomes less of a rush and then um when one doesn't use they feel below basic Baseline I've done a lot of discussions about dopamine and Baseline versus you know um non-baseline peaks in dopamine and some of that is smooth out for General discussion uh dopamine does many things besides set up reward systems and um incentives in the brain but it's at least one of the things it does so are kids starting off taking nicotine and then and feeling like whoa that makes them feel really elevated in terms of mood focus and alertness and then finding that without it they're just depressed is that is that the general them I'm not trying to lead the the the witness here I just want to know what what's what's going on internally absolutely no no no all all great um questions there so what we're what we're finding when we talk to teens is that pretty rapidly they're going from I like it to I need it so you know your your multi-art question which is great what makes them start and what makes them continue they start because of the flavors and and the marketing and they like the The Taste and all that they continue because of that high level of nicotine and we are seeing that teens are addicted and we're seeing we actually published a couple of studies showing that teens who have been using ecigarettes in the past 30 days that the majority are showing signs of addiction pretty rapidly too within a few weeks it's such high levels of nicotine and there are some people who don't believe that teens are becoming addicted to nicotine and that you the levels of nicotine are not the same as what we're seeing in cigarettes that's actually not the case and we've seen more and more studies and to the question of using it as soon as they wake up there's a study by colleague of mine that showed in the last few years the the data are showing that teens a greater percentage of teens who use ecigarettes are doing so in the first five minutes a waking that is a sign of addiction so you wake up maybe go to the bathroom maybe not and you take that hit and so and all the National Data are showing even though initi ition may go down the percentage of teens who we're using daily has gone up and I attribute that a lot to the type of nicotine the salt-based nicotine and to the huge amount of nicotine that's been on the market so yes teens are definitely feeling it they're definitely going through withdrawal symptoms that that feeling uh shaking the the sweats all the feelings that they need lack of concentration the problem is when you talk to teens they they think that ecigarettes are helping with school and and by the way I've not heard a teen tell me that they started because of school reasons or concentration maybe they're continuing for that reason but teens have said that taking the hit makes them feel good what they don't understand is it's that it makes them feel not bad right the withdrawal is making them feel bad and they don't realize that that hit and that that doping room Rush that they now need it that they're going through a withdrawal either way I'm wondering where they're getting the money to pay for all this uh nicotine when I was a kid I worked um I like mode Lawns I had a newspaper out for a little while but mostly um started working when I I think I was about 14 or so coffee shop skateboard shop um bus tables did that kind of thing so I made money and I was able to use that money on the things that were important music skateboarding and bus passes and stuff that that's what it was back then food um Etc where are 12-year-olds getting the money to buy four or even one Vape cartridge pod as you called it um per day I mean someone's got to pay for this stuff um I mean unless they're stealing it and I can't imagine that they're all stealing it where are they getting it how are they getting it yeah it's a great question so there's not one way uh in terms of money I think there's questions around money and questions around access right and they're not necessarily the the same thing money babysitting the problem is when some of the newer products came on the market some of them the the say 2020 2021 products were about a dollar or two per pod compare that with a pack of cigarettes which is $10 to $15 depending on the state you live in so they are cheap they're easy to get now newer ones and older ones are a few dollars more but they're not that expensive they started off very expensive when they first came on the market Market but they haven't been the other is the sharing and we used to hear about pod parties where somebody buys the device which is more expensive buys the device and then you bring your own not beer bring your own pod which is a few dollars then you pop it in and then you share it around um we've also heard stories of a few teenagers buying them and then selling for a few cents or a few dollars a puff so meet me in the bathroom for 50 cents or a dollar you can have a couple of Puffs so I think teens are getting very very creative we've also seen unfortunately parents buying e cigarettes for their teens well at least they're not smoking cigarettes that's not the right comparison um so I think they're very creative they're getting into many many different ways I've heard students say I'm not using my lunch money to buy lunch I'm going to use it to buy Vapes um there's no one way uh there's not and unfortunately access is easier than it should by the way one thing I think is incredibly important for people to understand is across the US in 2019 December 2019 the legal age to be allowed to purchase or to sell nicotine products across the US is is become 21 so many people think it's so 18 so you go into a vape shop or a tobacco shop and if the shop owner doesn't realize it's 21 they'll sell it to somebody who's 18 and even if they know it's 21 they're still selling it because there's not enforcement right now going on so we really do need our the public we need all the parents listening we need Educators police officers to really enforce the and regulate this age restriction because teens are getting them from vape shops really easily they're getting it online really easily um they're buying them for each other somebody's going and buying 10 and and then reselling them if the looks older there's not a lot of carding going on or fake cards ID cards is pretty easy still to get so unfortunately we have a product that is appealing to teens in a very unregulated market right now the FDA is not regulating it local shops are not regulating it that it's just it it is the wild west out there so setting aside the issue of whether or not vaping is quote unquote better for us than smoking cigarettes because that argument is um a complicated one uh to say the least what do we know about the health hazards of vaping per se um does it increase um lung disease does it increase cancer rates I mean um my understanding is that nicotine the chemical is not what causes cancer in cigarettes it's the tars and other things that um are consumed or brought into the lungs and therefore blood stream when one smokes um that's not to say nicotine is safe I have to be careful here sometimes Clips get cut and people run wild and I I'm not saying nicotine is safe but um what are the problems with vaping nicotine um even let's just say one or two hits per day um especially in kids you know do we do are there known challenges for brain development are there known challenges for cognitive development are there known challenges for um lung function is it I mean nicotine is a vasoconstrictor and it raises blood pressure so that's basically stress on the system chronic stress uh but yeah what do we know about what um vaping and ecigarettes are doing to malign Health yeah so first of all start with the brain and and nicotine uh absolutely these high levels of nicotine and really any nicotine is harmful to the developing brain and our brains continue to develop until we're around 25 24 or 26 depending but to around 25 so in that process of of your brain developing of your brain changing if you introduce nicotine you're changing your brain you're changing the brain chemistry and you're so much more likely to become addicted as an adolescent and young a young adult the tobacco industry knows this I mean they that's why they target teens we've no this with cigarettes if we target a teen then we're going to have have them for life so significantly more likely to become addicted because it actually rewires your brain and there's plenty of evidence for that the the other pieces that we're worried about is now you're right nicotine in terms of cancer although I will tell you having talking to some oncologist they would say the vast amount of nicotine still worries them in terms of cancer we just haven't had enough research on ecigarettes to really know now you're right ecigarettes do not have tar but ecigarettes have alahh tides and alahh have been L linked to cancer so there's still some concern there there's some early anecdotal evidence and probably some of my colleagues out there would say no no there's pretty good evidence around cancer I we just don't have enough body a resarch but again it took 50 years to figure out cancer and cigarettes we've not had the amount of ecigarette use or or that we saw with cigarettes for that long for that many people to really know it's still pretty new I just might want to just interject the alahh tides um like parap from alahh from Malahide these are the same chemicals that we use in Laboratories to um fix as it's called tissues to make those tissues firm so that then they can be cut and analyzed under the microscope um alahh highes cross-link proteins um basically change the configuration of proteins and turn what would otherwise be appliable tissue into kind of a hard rubbery think of like a dense eraser like um consistency and in other words not the configuration most conducive for those cells to live and Thrive actually quite the opposite um which is why um that's for sake of doing anatomy on well any body part you use param alahh glut alahh um and for Malahide to cross-link proteins it basically kills tissue by cross-linking proteins taking a nice you know pliable configuration that's uh amendable to life and twisting the the U or shearing the proteins more or less um relative cross-linking them and making them nice and rigid so if that's happening in the living child that can't be good that can't be good they can't be good lugs bloodstream everything and all the alhida cancer right right and so that's why there's a lot of concern there and when I talk to teens uh and in our curriculum we we often say uh because when you just say and you gave a beautiful explanation of the alahh tides but for a teenager what I generally say is is if you ever dissected a had biology and you dissect a frog yes how did it smell it was gross well that's what you're putting into your body when you're vaping uh because that that's exactly the point and and that kind of helps them understand it a little bit more but there's a lot of concern around the alahh highes uh there's lead there's cadmium there's propylene glycol and glycerin so there's a lot of other chemicals so no we may not have the thousands of chemicals that we have in cigarettes but we certainly have hundreds of chemicals in an ecigarette that's very concerning so there are a lot of studies now really showing pretty significant effects of ecigarette use on heart and lungs a lot um not only all the chemicals we've mentioned but also the flavorants there's cinnamon alide another alahh there's vanilla there's um uh what is it the The Buttery flavor um that's in there is also a lot of concern so that you're inhaling these flavors and I have often explain you can take flavors you can take butter and heat it to several hundred degrees and eat it if you don't burn your tongue but you then take it and really inhale the resulting aerosol and then we're seeing the the lesions on the lungs we're seeing young people who have been using ecigarettes having lung collapses pneumonia asthma amongst people who have not had seizures uh one of the teens I know who was using four pods a day was having seizures uh so makes sense because nicotine is a stimulant yes it can cause runaway excitability in the brain If too much is taken um if 40 to 60% of kids are using ecigarettes um and it's destructive to the lungs uh and it sounds like the brain as well where are all the young athletes are they the the remaining um uh are they the remaining fraction yeah and and I should say 40 to 60 is what schools are telling me and that might just be using once in a while we don't really know but even kids just like I had to do PE class when I was in high school yeah yeah we had to run a few laps I can't imagine doing that if your um if your lungs don't function properly no it is actually much harder and teens will say that and adults I know I actually know an adult who said that when he went from smoking cigarettes to eat cigarettes it actually was harder for him to exercise and to ride his Bic and and and exercise and do other things on the ecigarette compared to the cigarettes that the the impact on the lungs is so strong so you're right it is probably hurting um Athletics right now where actually there are some curriculums on athletes and and vaping and we're building one as well because there's a lot of concern when you tell a teen you know I'm worried about lung cancer in 20 years years H I don't care about 20 years from now but you would tell a teen it's harder to run they're more likely to listen to you I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge one of our sponsors waking up waking up is a meditation app that offers hundreds of guided meditations mindfulness trainings yoga needer sessions and more I started meditating over three decades ago and what I found in the ensuing years is that sometimes it was very easy for me to do my daily meditation practice I was just really diligent but then as things would get more stressful which of course is exactly when I should have been meditating more my meditation practice would fall off with waking up they make it very easy to find and consistently use a given meditation practice it has very convenient reminders and they come in different durations so even if you just have one minute or five minutes to meditate you can still get your meditation in which research shows is still highly beneficial in addition to the many different meditations on the waking up app they also have Yoga Nidra sessions which are a form of non-sleep deep rest that I personally find is extremely valuable for restoring mental and physical Vigor I tend to do a Yoga Nidra lasting anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes at least once a day and if I ever wake up in the middle of the night and I need to fall back asleep I also find yoga Nedra to be extremely useful if you'd like to try the waking up app you can go to waking up.com huberman to try a free 30-day trial again that's waking up.com huberman we haven't talked too much about peer pressure or just social pressure um I remember when I was a kid it was in the just say not drugs era and um remember seeing the television commercials with the eggs like two like really beautiful raw eggs and say this is your brain and then was this your brain on drugs and it was frying and you know Nancy Reagan was the big like was everywhere those in that in that time you know just say no just saying no in any case um there must be a lot of data indicating that what messages kids respond to I was told and I don't know if this is true but I was told by a researcher um that the anti-smoking campaign that was effective in kids was not one that convinced them that smoking was bad for their health but was one that um convinced them that it was um their purchasing and use of cigarettes that was making uh other people rich and then um kind of demonizing those people that was effective kind of like show uh the commercials of of these guys um you know kind of cackling behind closed doors you know making fun of the the people that were um in their words um you know not bright enough to know that that they were being taken advantage of and then that set a kind of a psychological warfare between teens and these people that they perceived as I'm taking advantage of them for money right and that that was effective in getting them to smoke less as opposed to telling them Hey listen smoking is really bad for your health right absolutely so first of all the just say no not effective say just having saying just say no around any Behavior to a teenager whether it's tobacco cannabis cigarettes um and sex does not work it does not work and for many reasons first of all te are curious and when you say just say no why well because it's bad for you well wait a second exactly what you're saying just telling me that it's bad for me if you tell me I'm going to get lung cancer or I'm going to have lung disease or anything and I tried the ecigarette and I didn't have lung problems and instead I actually liked it then we look bad we look like we're lying to teenagers and instead what we were talking about earlier the the feeling the rush the flavor The Taste the perceived in real benefits outweigh the concerns over the risks as a teenager so when we say to a teen just say no don't and they say well why well your brain or your heart or your lungs or it's bad for you they don't believe us and and we absolutely Lo lose credibility so we talk to teens and this is based on decision-making research that I've been doing for 25 years we have to help teens weigh the benefits and the risk now I don't mean that we say hey it's good for you or you're going to like it certainly not but if we only come from a risk model and a just say no model that never works for teens we need to help them understand the balance and and teens know that there are good things about using some drugs real or perceived and we can't lie to them on that so that gets to then how do we have those messages and you're right if we only harp on and and our research would show this too the long-term health risks the your brain on on drugs those kinds of things that's so far in the future or the tra you know you're going to have a tra if you smoke but they're showing the 80-year-old and no 16-year-old even looks at somebody at that age or cares about somebody that's so that other person that that's the problem so we need to talk about the social aspects that teens really care about you you may get wrinkles although we don't know that so much with these cigarettes but um but the Athletics the things that are important to teens now the campaigns that you're talking about are really effective as well particularly the mass Campaign which a level that we see social media Campaign which is do you realize that the industry ecigarettes tobacco nicotine cigarette whatever you want to call it is targeting you as a teenager on purpose they want you as a smoker I used to go to middle school students and say before eat cigarettes when cigarettes were of concern and I I love saying to to young people 400,000 adults are dying each year from a cigarette from cigarette use you're a replacement smoker and it was great cuz teen said we get really angry and say wait I this 12-year-old boy was so cute wait I don't want to be a replacement smoker Dr money was a big deal to him and I I don't want to give money to the industry and it's great channel that energy and get young people mad that's what really worked showing that the Seven Dwarfs we call it the seven CEOs of the to Big tobacco companies at the time said nicotine's not addictive nicotine is not addictive there our cigarettes are not addictive and that clearly they were lying to teens you show that to a teen and explain how nicotine is addictive and they knew it but they're trying to get you works really well and and same thing with marketing we we have a whole lesson on marketing do you think that that that candy was for me as an middle-aged adult it's for you and that gets the mad because they don't want to be duped they don't want to be targeted that is a much better message now we still have to tell them about the health risks we absolutely do they still need the knowledge they still need to understand what they're doing is unhealthy but we can't do it in a lecturing way and we can't do it in a way that makes them feel stupid we can't tell them their brains are developing till 25 and therefore they're dumb our lessons on talking about brain are more like it's really cool that you're developing it's why you can do dance that's why you can sing better you can learn language there's so much that you could do that's really cool that I can't do right now but because of that that's why you're so much more likely to become addicted and the industry knew that that's why they're targeting you those are the messages that work a lot better for teens sounds like the the key is to never undervalue the spirit of defiance in youth yeah and perhaps to um wager it um against these clearly destructive behaviors to be honest I'm shocked that um there's so much Vape use and ecigarette use I mean these numbers are staggering yeah maybe we could weave in a discussion about cannabis sure uh I did an episode about can cannabis um the landscape around cannabis has changed so much since I was a kid it was highly illegal at least where I grew up um now I think it's um been decriminalized certain places still illegal elsewhere I don't want anyone getting in trouble um as a consequence of not understanding what you know the laws in their area uh and outright legal pretty easy to get in a lot of the country and um it's not clear that at least with individual use that it's being um you know punished as fre nearly as frequently as it used to be so the you know 10-word summary of of the Cannabis thing is that the ratio of THC to CBD is important it is true that a lot of cannabis has much much higher levels of THC now than in the past although I'm told that high THC level cannabis always existed um but it seemed seem to be the concentration of THC that is of let's just say concern as it relates to the potential development of psychosis um if there's a predisposition um as in terms of the uh how addictive the Cannabis is and so on and so forth which is not to say that CBD is totally innocuous but it seems to be like the THC concentration is the kind of the thing that to mainly focus on so what do we know about cannabis and here we're going to assume cannabis with a a reasonable to high level of THC in it so not pure CBD um what do we know about vaping and EIG use of cannabis specifically is it true that youth that are taking um nicotine by way of Vape or ecigarette then transition into using cannabis is it sort of a Gateway into cannabis use and how prevalent is cannabis use in kids age 10 to 21 first of all your right I mean THC levels we're seeing today's joint is about 10 joints when I was a te uh so the the dramatic increases in the potency right now that we're seeing around THC and then you get something like dabbing which is about 80% THC versus 20 to 30% of of the more mainstream products that we have on the market when I say mainstream I mean like uh uh joints or or ecigarettes so the potency has gone up dramatically and it is of concern so depending on the study you're going to see anywhere from 10 to 20% of teens saying that they're using some form of cannabis either smoked or in the form of a joint or a blunt and for those who don't know a blunt a lot of people don't realize is a combination of both tobacco and cannabis so it's it's a cigar leaf or some people buy a cigar and pull out the tobacco and put in the Cannabis or they'll just get the cigar leaf and and roll the the cannabis flower then you're getting both the kind of the double whammy and the Chaser the high of both of nicotine and THC so we're seeing a fair number of it's interesting even though teens are not smoking cigarettes they're still using joints which is interesting uh but very quickly increasing is ecigarettes with cannabis in there you could buy a cannabis style ecigarettes and that's been around for a long time with volcano vaporized and specific cannabis vaporizers that's not new but it's become much much more popular but now we're also seeing teens buy a nicotine ecigarette inhale half of it and then add the the cannabis wax or oil to it and then basically get the combination I had one young young teenager probably 123 14year old young man who said yeah I I got a cherry nicotine vape and I inhaled half of it probably use the word inhale but I used half of it and then I added in some cannabis oil and now I had a cherry flavored cannabis nicotine device so we're seeing that more and more and even though you're not technically supposed to and the manufacturers of nicotin cigarettes will say don't open them and add stuff a simple YouTube video will teach you how to do it um and unfortunately the videos are not using gloves and bedz zoic acid is coming your skin and things like that but which is bad for which is does it go transdermally does it go through the skin it supposedly it does yeah yeah if the benzoic acid is going transdermally presumably when one inhales off one of these pods they're also bringing benzoic acid into the lungs correct and um hopefully people realize this from our episodes on breathing but if not I'll just make it clear now that when you breathe in a substance you know a airborne substance into your lungs because of the um interface between the vasculature the blood supply and the lungs I mean basically things pass from the lungs into the blood supply very very readily quickly and then if those things are able they'll cross the bloodb brain barrier correct correct and it only takes about 7 to 10 seconds to go through the whole system and into the brain too so it's a very fast process so yes so teenagers are definitely uh vaping or using cannabis ecigarettes and the the problem is you know for one teasel think it's healthier than just like nicotina cigarettes they think it's healthier than combustible I mean yes you're not burning it but you're still inhaling and you still are inhaling there seems to be the purp and glycol the glycerin the flavorant all the alahh tides even if it's just just a an cannabis ecigarette so there's a lot of concern there and then addiction is still huge it's a huge issue when you're talking about cannabis the same reasons that we talked about with nicotine the brain development and so on psychosis just a lot a lot to think about here psychosis um there's actually some scientists now who are really strongly saying it's not associated as causal that if you are predetermined to have a mental health issue psychosis schizophrenia then it starting to use or using cannabis can actually trigger and cause you to become psychotic um I don't totally understand the mechanism yet I don't think we totally do yet but that there seems to be more than just it might happen and it seems to be right in that older adolescent young adult time frame that it is happening so around the same time that the brain's developing um and we're hardwiring the rest of our brain that that change is happening from from a neur neuronal connection perspective um my understanding sorry to interrupt but my understanding is that indeed um the use of high THC cannabis in youth in particular male youth right predisposes and you're saying might even be causal toward the development of psychotic symptoms correct in late teens early 20s correct and that some of those cases um are ones in which the psychosis is irreversible correct um is it sometimes the case that somebody exhibits psychotic symptoms as the consequence of using THC and The Psychotic symptoms resolve or is it you know some sort of circuit switch that is then permanent you know it's a good question I honestly don't really know the answer to that of what what percentage um the the few cases I know of and in talking to the psychiatrist uh would say that it that it's causal and it may be permanent now it could be it could be managed it doesn't mean that somebody's going to be having psychotic episodes all the time I mean certainly can be managed and certainly we say please don't continue to use uh would be very important but whether it's completely reversible is something that I'm not sure of uh somebody more versed in this but we you know what you do in in your research and what I know is you know changes to the to the neural circuitry is not changeable you know when we hurt our uh brain cells that is not something that we could recover from so that is very much concerning yeah as an as adults there are very few new neurons added to the brain um um there is significant plasticity and recovery of function in some cases both by virtue of traumatic brain injury um certainly people can get over uh certain behavioral patterns and that no doubt involves plasticity but it it takes work and um and when it comes to addiction uh there's evidence that some of the reward circuitry can adjust but um again it it takes um adherence to specific things in order to make that happen um I'm very concerned about this uh potentially causal relationship but certainly correlation between high THC containing cannabis and psychosis mostly because we already have a serious problem with psychosis on the planet a lot of people don't realize that you know approximately 1% of the world's population has schizophrenia and by the way I have to be careful with the language nowadays you know has schizophrenia or is schizophrenic or all that that language gets murky but meet the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia I think is a safe way to put it um so if one is then adding to that number of people exhibiting or and suffering from psychotic symptoms that prevent them from having uh functional work lives Etc that that's that's an issue um how difficult is it for these Adolescent and teens to quit vaping and ecigarettes and cannabis I mean um can they quit just by deciding are there programs are they all going into um you know recovery programs are there recovery programs in schools I mean how successful are they in stopping it's really difficult and and maybe I'll talk about nicotine first and the same would be true for cannabis but a little bit less extent I me both are addictive and interestingly not a lot of people realize that cannabis is addictive and about one in six teens or people who are using particularly under the age of 25 do become addicted so they don't realize that it's addictive they don't realize it's addictive the argument I often heard was it's not as bad as alcohol which is a um kind of a lame argument I understand why people default to that but I mean getting hit by a car might not be as bad as getting hit by a train um but yeah I don't I wouldn't even look at that analogy as accurate there just different um levels of destructive different types of destructive um yeah these not as bad as blank doesn't really seem to to work no no and and you know I often say people say well why' you start studying tobacco I mean there is no safe level of tobacco use period yes we have very few 30-year-olds who suddenly pick up a cigarette and become addicted you know at that point you you your development of your brain now can if you use regular Le are you still going to hurt your lungs and and heart and stuff like that absolutely the brain changes may not be there in the same way but most people don't pick up a cigarette or a cigarette for the very first time in their 30s or 40s and and on so absolutely it's addictive and and it is probably the most difficult to quit uh drug that's out there whereas alcohol we don't see I mean yes we have alcoholism I'm not downplaying that it's a huge issue in this country it's a huge issue on this planet but you're not going to have people in two weeks three weeks suddenly say I'm addicted to alcohol you are going to with nicotine and you are with cannabis to some extent as well so yes uh nicotine is incredibly addictive and we have so many teens who are addictive addicted to nicotine through ecigarettes and really struggling to get off of it I gave a talk recently to a group of parents and they said this is all great information Bonnie but how do I help my kid and I just felt awful because there's not a lot that we have so taking a few different things first of all we don't have there are some programs there are inpatient programs absolutely showing some some POS impatient program there are actually some impatient programs and but those are going to be expensive or require that people have insurance that will cover that absolutely and they take weeks and then you're taking a young person out of their natural environment out of their school out of their friends stigmatizing which hopefully we're not stigmatizing drug use anyway but you know you take a young person at 12 14 16 you put him in another place that's very difficult on them and if part of why they're using in the first place is stress you're just enhancing that outpatient programs we have some things but the problem is we don't have the best recommendations because we don't have great research so for example nicotine replacement therapy the patch first of all it's not authorized for use by the FDA something it approved by the FDA for anybody under 18 and and yet we have a lot of teenagers who are addicted we just don't have the right studies and they haven't gone to the FDA for that approval now a lot of doctors are using nicotine patches and prescribing them for somebody under 18 it's considered off label but you still can do it and most people would recommend it the the problem is and and I don't mean problem with using them I have no problem with and I've often suggested to I don't treat I I want to make sure that I'm not misquoted there either I don't directly treat see patients myself but based on the evidence and the American Academy Pediatrics recommendations we should be using a patch with those under 18 te but then the question is how much if a nicotine patch is about 21 milligrams of nicotine and a teenager is using 40 milligrams in a day do you give two patches and I've had some doctors say wow that's a lot of nicotine I say Well they're using a lot of nicotine what I've heard some uh my adolescent medicine colleagues have suggested as one patch and then supplement with gums and suckers and La Anders not as a starting I don't mean like what we're seeing with with some uh pouches out there like Zen as a starter I don't mean that I mean as a uh a form of treatment as a way to wean them off so reducing the dosage over time correct correct and and now but then they also don't have the the hand to mouth piece that we see that is difficult so gum in this case I mean non- nicotine gum just chewing regular gum um I've heard teenagers say that they're that they're withdraw last three to four minutes so they have a one teenager said I have a playlist on my phone that's each song is three to four minutes and when I start to feel the withdrawal I pop the music in my ears and I go do something and I listen to the song and by then that uncomfortable feeling is over I've heard teens say that they'll run that there's many different things that they'll do um chewing on a toothpick not a nicotine toothpick but just a toothpick um other ways to really get their mind off of that feeling is really important but we also have to know with adults and cigarettes it can take 7 to 11 tries so we can't expect until they're fully off of a cigarette can't expect a teenager to quit overnight especially with the social pressure and again sorry to interrupt but I think the the 7 to1 tries um did an episode on on nicotine and I talked about smoking a bit and most people fail most people fail they relapse it's very very difficult to quit smoking people that do it and stick to it are real heroes of the process uh it's not not easy um but that's with a heavy incentive you know immediate health issues sometimes it's Financial um Etc with kids it feels like all all the pressures are pushing in the opposite direction because it's socially rewarded they get that you know elevation of mood and focus and there's just oh so much um driving them to you know continue using absolutely right one of the things that we do in our program to help teens quit is we talk about social withdrawal and it was actually one of our we have a wonderful group of 40 youth who work with us we call our youth action board our yab our reach lab yab uh our yabs say that we need to talk about social withdrawal not just physical because of exactly what you're talking about they may not be able to go to that party at on a Saturday night where they know their friends are vaping because it'll and we know the brain cues up that they'll see or smell or or witness somebody using an ecigarette and those cues will happen and they'll want to use it so they actually have to isolate themselves from their friend group who was using so it's very difficult so really setting up your social M you really setting up your friends who are not using really trying to talk uh and and have your family around you and I really tell parents it's not the time to get pissed off with your kids for using it's the time to really help them let's be in this together and often I say the reason why they're using isn't their fault let's go back to the beginning of our conversation about marketing and and that they're being targeted and teens didn't even know what was hitting them what was going on so let's not be mad at them let's be sympathetic and help so they need the combination of nicotine replacement they needed to change their milu they need to have healthy snacks and water and and exercise and all kinds of things around them and they may also need cond behavioral therapy or some other therapy to really get them it's not going to be a one stop we need to work with them and that's the same with cannabis by the way this is just any drugs and just feel so bad it is such a problem right now when we built our curriculums same thing I said I was doing middle and high school and never thought I'd do elementary and we have an ele curriculum I thought I was only going to do prevention we now have intervention and moving towards sensation that's how many young people are just struggling right now when I was in high school there seemed to be a phenomenon of you know certain behaviors allowed kids to have some social clout um by virtue of I guess they used to call it holding like if someone had weed or if somebody um yeah if they had weed then sort of gave them a position in the social structure often times the um kids that you know I mean I was friendly and knew most people in my high school class um you know and a few of them were kind of like less socially engaged than others but then at some point Midway through High School one of them was like start showing up with weed at parties or something and suddenly like they had like a social clout um it was kind of interesting to see how you know having paraphernalia having nicotine or cannabis or whatever it is is sort of um I think has long been a kind of like an instant um sort of uh route to inserting oneself into a social structure which is obviously unhealthy I'm not I'm not promoting this yeah and then it is social right that there's a there's sort of an instant substrate for communication when I was growing up I worked at skateboard shop and on my break I would go behind the shop there's a little alley there we'd skateboard there's this little bump and but occasionally like um employees would share a share a cigarette or you you'd ask someone for a cigarette this this was kind of a way of bridging social gaps um so again I I feel like it's so hard to be a teenager there's so much going on internally and externally and everything you're talking about you know in terms of the the negative health effects the paraphernalia the marketing The Taste the addictive qualities of it Etc um just start to pile on on all these these challenges to to staying away from it but a big one seems to be the kind of instant um social cred that one gets when they participate in something that other people are participating in because for instance like a sport like if there's a pickup basketball game you have to play reasonably well to get into get into the game otherwise you're it's not going to be easy or you have to be very bold yeah right um so unless you're engaged in a sport you're in theater or you're doing other things it it's sort of an instant route okay I think I've made my point um is there anything about that um that by way of understanding you know can help you know create like replacement behaviors I mean it's going to be hard to take a kid who's you know entire life is hanging out with their friends and vaping cannabis or nicotine after school and hanging around and playing on their phone and saying Hey listen you're going to quit vaping nicotine you're going to feel worse your friends are all going to be doing it and um you'll still be their friend but you're not really part of it it's almost like you have to create a culture of quitting before this can really go the other direction you do and and what you're saying is is so correct and so relevant and why I feel so bad for teens right now and and and the social media right you put put that in there as well and it's all over the place right now with them they're bombarded by all of the different factors that you talked about and it was interesting we were talking about earlier around the social aspects too I was thinking there was a point where it was so cool particularly around Joel it was so cool to jeel that I had teens come up to me and say Dr Bonnie do you have a fake ecigarette and I said a fake ecigarette well yeah all my friends are using and I don't want to but I want to fake it and I just felt so bad and I said no I'm not going to get you a fake e cigarette but I will help you with refusal skills and teach you how to say no but in this case not just say no but teach you how to feel good about about saying no to certain things that you don't want to be doing and during that time there was it was very difficult for teens to come up and say I either want to quit or I don't want to be a user I just don't want to start because that was not cool I think we changed in the last couple years thankfully I think there are more teens who are not using who are open to it or who open to quitting a lot of teens want to quit right now so thankfully we're in a new era where this yes the pressures to use are absolutely there but there's starting to be a tide change where we getting more teens who are getting on the so-called bandwagon to either quit or not use I think the social supports are being there a lot more than we've ever seen before we have more youth groups who are getting on board of either trying to help quit or trying to make sure that it's okay not to use um it's still hard and what you're talking about so it's our job as adults and healthc care providers and Community Partners and Educators to really talk to young people to set up those social groups and say it's okay not to use it's okay to come on over to this group and yeah maybe you're not going to be with that same social group on Saturday night let's start a new social group for you I'm not saying it's easy this is not easy for young people and it's not easy parents are struggling too they're struggling to know what how to talk to their teenagers but this is what we have to work towards and setting up those social networks of it's cool not to use one of the other things by the way that we talk talk about is the environment when we talk to teens about not using and why why it's bad for them heart lungs Etc and all the things and being duped and being marketed to and and the money the environment piece has also been interesting you know teens right now may not care about their hearts their lungs 20 years from now they care about the environment and there are environmental aspects to these the Plastics the the pods don't disappear the benzoic acid does not evaporate and and we've got secondhand Vapor secondhand smoke secondhand and third hand so what I mean by that is if I were to use any ecigarette near you you would actually get a lot of the volatile organic chemicals a lot of the nicotine is in the air actually some stays suggest covid might even be on those droplets there's a lot of issues there and then third hand is it just doesn't dissipate that Vapor aerosol it's not a vapor that Aeros so then settles into carpets and and clothes and so on and this is toxic to pets to Children things like that so we talk to teens about that that's another way to get young people to be willing to either quit or to Rally around not using is the environment know I if I wash dishes for too long and my my younger was out of the house but when when she comes over I get yelled across the room mom turn the water off the environment we have to save water that's what they care about so much that if we could at least get that into young people's hands say you know what you may not care about yourself but what about your friends and what about the environment I think we can also shift some of the generation right now interesting yeah I think replacement behaviors concerned for the environment seem like good incentives and I'm hearing all this I feel really lucky that I was always obsessed with something growing up whether or not it was like birds and fish tanks or skateboard or prior to that soccer or you know um I mean certainly there were drugs and alcohol around but there was there were always activities that kept us busy um and I guess I wonder whether or not the Advent of social media has created less interest in activities I you know after school activities I guess they used to call them but um I mean even if it's video games um if it's playing a sport if it's theater if it's um art if it's music uh presumably kids are still doing all that stuff but is it the case that the kids that are vaping let's say nicotine maybe cannabis as well are less likely to be engaged in other activities I mean is this thing becoming just kind of a closed loop of reward I mean that that's to me the real danger of any substance that um increases the dopamine system activation without a lot of effort right because the as you and I know that the the whole of dopamine circuitry as it relates to reward is all about effort reward reinforcement effort reward reinforcement um but the effort piece is key and drugs basically bypass the effort piece and then you get the reward reinforcement and then eventually the rewarding and reinforcing levels of of return on that drug nicotine cannabis Etc diminishes and then you're just caught in a behavioral Loop right right right absolutely um so you know are kids doing less stuff are they are they studying less as a consequence of this are they are they playing fewer sports are they less engaged in youth theater and music and youth groups and things like that when we were talking about cigarettes when I first started my career up until probably 2014 I would say yes you're absolutely correct and it was generally the teens who would say I'm bored and I didn't know what to do with myself and that's why I picked up cigarettes or um or I'm not an athlete or or this was my social outlet I haven't seen that as a result as much with ecigarettes now as a result of ecigarettes yes but not as a cause of using because it's so ubiquitous ecigarettes we're seeing everywhere it doesn't matter if you're how old you are male female used to be more males using because some of the earlier devices were more Tech and guys were using it and some of the females didn't want to put them in their person because they would leak we now are seeing more of an equal if not a little bit more female using um it's it's not your so-called bad or good kids it's not anything it's not the young people who are struggling with school it's everywhere right now independent of location race ethnicity things like that so I don't see so much what you're talking about in terms of a predictor in terms of a of a result absolutely I mean then we're seeing teens who become more isolated who are not engaged as much who are more bored because they're sitting home and they're vaping um but I also see a lot of young people sitting around together vaping uh so I I do think that that landscape has changed um is it going to change back I don't know is hopefully we change the culture again uh but it it's an interesting thought I mean as soon as you said that I was thinking yeah I mean they're certainly not out as much as they used to be in terms of and we're talking about this at the beginning we're not seeing them out in Parks as much we're not seeing them playing pickup sports games as much as we used to but I don't think that's because of ecigarette use I think that's because of social media and just the whole change and honestly parents being afraid of letting their kids out for some predatory behavior and in other ways um and you mean if kids are let out of the house they're more at risk to predatory behavior but of course they're also at risk when but just by use of the phone because the phone connects everywhere absolutely the phone connects everywhere and that's something we try to teach teens as well but I think that that's been something that parents are worried about you know I have to you almost the pendulum almost swung too much of now I have to keep my kid in because I don't want to let them out of the house and I don't want to let them alone driving and alone at the park and things like that but I think that we've reduced you were talking earlier about autonomy we've reduced teens just autonomy and they they have to get into a little bit of trouble they have to jwalk they have to do I mean I'm not encouraging but you know but but we there's some natural amount of getting together and hanging out and being crazy at the park and playing and playing games and things like that and I think that has stopped or or slowed down a lot uh I I see it with with some people in my own Community I don't see as much just hanging out in the front yard and shooting the breeze and instead they're they're inside and they're on their phones and and stuff like that so could that be part of why we're seeing more ecigarette use possibly I just don't haven't I haven't seen the studies on it yeah perhaps that's a good segue into risky behaviors when I was a kid I mean the dumb stuff that we did um meaning dumb because it was dangerous to ourselves I mean I am not suggesting people do this kids please don't do this just don't but just the dumb stuff of you know jumping off roofs or between roofs um I'm not going to give any other uh any anecdotes just uh it's amazing that we all survived um and and some didn't but that was largely the consequence of drugs alcohol mental health issues of kids I knew um but car accidents um actually I grew up in the uh in the mother's Against Drunk Driving era and there was a there real discouragement around drunk driving I was fortunate that at least in high school most of my friends didn't drink or didn't drink much um but you still heard about fatalities kids happen um even one is is too many obviously um what's going on now in terms of risk-taking behavior um driving fast driving drunk um doing what used to be just described as dumb stuff um that unfortunately sometimes is is fatal or you know results in paralysis people jumping off bridges into water without testing the water depth you know we've all heard the stories and sadly um they true stories of people becoming paralyzed that kind of thing dumb stuff dangerous stuff teens do more of it um is it still true that males are doing more of that physical danger stuff than than um than females or is that not true that's what we used to hear but then of course there's been this big push importantly really to um balance out the amount of research on on both sexes yeah it's a good point I mean some of it has to do with just the methods of our research to know you know what's interesting I haven't seen more recent data in terms of differences by sex of of risk engagement and risk behavior I mean a lot of what I've seen is balanced out I think it's maybe different kinds of risk behaviors that that people do but we're still seeing it I we're still seeing teens drinking we're still seeing teens going to parties and getting drunk we're still seeing teens out on the beach and getting drunk I think the big difference now is whether from Mothers Against now I think it's destructive driving is that what it's called I think it's now mothers destructive driving I think that's so that includes drunk driving and racing and racing and and driving under the influence of cannabis or anything else which can be harmful but at least in in a lot of the teens and young adults I've talked to at least we've gotten that word out to teens so they're still drinking and they're still doing stupid stuff when they drink but they're not getting behind the wheel as much um much less and this idea of a designated driver or sober driver um Uber or Uber Uber's really I guess or lift or any R shair let's just say any ride share has certainly been uh a game Cher in in in the landscape of teenagers and young adults right now uh and in fact I've heard not just a designated driver but a designated partner or a sober a sober sitter so this idea that you go to a part party and there may be drinking going on but you make sure that there's one person who's sober not just for driving but to make sure you're not going home with somebody you don't want to go home with to make sure that you're not leaving drunk and falling downstairs to make sure that you're not falling out of that window so that message we've gotten across really well which I'm thrilled about are we still seeing drunk driving in accidents I certainly have among some people I know certainly we are but I think that the message overall is gten out there some people I've talked to said we just just don't get behind the wheel period what's also interesting is more and more teens are not driving they're delaying driving more and more whether that's because of uber lift I mean it's it's as a parent it's less expensive to pay for a ride share than to pay for insurance for somebody under 25 or to pay for a car so certainly that might be it um but but that is there doing other stupid stuff I mean in addition to drugs jumping skateboarding certainly we're still seeing that well skateboarding is a good sport you got to don't exceed your skill level but jumping between buildings not smart um unless you're super skilled and know what you're doing I mean you know there are the parkour kids and the skateboard kids and in the BMX cuz we we don't want to take away what the incredible things that they can can do but but there's risk there right I was referring to people who lack the skill to to complete the to complete the maneuver and um and getting badly hurt or or in some cases not getting badly hurt but you you just kind of shake your head and wonder why you why you ever engaged in that kind of stuff just so risky yeah yeah we're definitely still seeing risk behavior amongst teenagers and part of it has to do with impulsivity we know that teens's up until around part of the development right of cognitive and social psychosocial and Social Development it's up until around 16 17 they're still very impulsive uh we know with the brain development right the back of the brain develops f faster and first and that's our amydala our emotional Center our motor coordination versus the front of the brain which is our executive functioning our uh uh planning for the future our really slowing down and being able to think of the risks and benefits and make those decisions a little slower and a little bit better more like we would as adults so we certainly see impulsive decision you know hey let's go teepee that house or let's go ride on that car or let's go do things that probably hopefully wouldn't get them killed or injured but may get them busted in other ways we're still seeing that I think there have been more programs to help teens sort of rehearse in in situations so they're not more life skills training so they're not making some of those impulsive decisions but teens will teens are going to be teens which by the way is why we don't put things in front of them like you know sugar booger and unicorn kind of marketing that's going to get te attractive because that is buying into that knee-jerk impulsive it looks cool everyone's doing a kind of thing that they can resist I don't mean that they can't but just buys right into teens are going to be teens and that's what they're going to do um what about sexual behavior you mentioned that kids are driving less um or getting their driver's license less frequently um which by the way with respect to teens wanting to drive less that just like baffles my mind I mean one of the reasons I like skateboarding as a sport is you could do it anywhere it was also transportation and I like the social milu I loved the social milu of it um and but getting my driver's license was like one of the most important events of my life me too I could drive to yede in the summer I could do all sorts of things with that I'm so surprised that kids wouldn't want to do that um such autonomy there so much fun um oh I I agree but I've also heard that um rates of of sexual behavior are going down is that true yeah stabilizing and going down um and certainly rates of risky sexual behavior has also gone down so we are getting the message across around condom use around um STI testing around birth control things like that which is also really good but rates overall have gone down is teen pregnancy down I think it's down actually I haven't looked at the latest numbers I think it's down uh certainly I don't think has gone up but I'm I actually would need to look back at those numbers it's been a little while since I've looked at them and is what we're talking about um today mostly within the United States and the United States alone or is it carry over to other countries as well so it it totally depends on the behavior that we're talking about let's say vaping um or E use of cannabis uh or nicotine so interestingly ecigarette nicotine ecigarette use has not been as high in a lot of other countries it depends on the country but for example the UK or Europe we haven't seen the rates as high in the last few years part of it was that a lot of other states have a nicotine standard so that means a minimum amount or maximum amount excuse me of nicotine that you're allowed to have so for example the UK I think it's around 1.7% in the US we have no nicotine standard which is another major issue with regulation we don't have we have as I was saying 5% 10% nicotine s there is no regulation about how much nicotine that you could have so in certain countries if it's right around the addictive level or a little bit below it we're going to see fewer teens becoming addictive it's still bad at any amount but we're going to see fewer people becoming addicted the other is the marketing was not as big in other countries and really was the marketing was ecigarettes if you're trying to stop smoking cigarettes not marketed to teens that has changed in the last year or two so in countries I've talked to for example the UK I've been interviewed by them many times in the last few years and they would say we don't have the same problem and now they're saying boy we are seeing a pretty significant increase in the number of teens who are using part of it is a different landscape of the kind of ecigarette that's out there the kind of marketing that's out there whatever it is we are now seeing is it as high as we have in the US I don't think so but it's certainly increasing same thing in in other countries where they actually didn't allow certain ecigarettes to be on the market have now come in and and been on the market and infiltrated and even in this country certain ecigarettes are illegal and they're coming in um illegally through illicit trading is happening in and and crossing the borders so um so ecigarette we're still seeing cannabis depends on this on the country right whether it's legal or not now even in the US I should say even states that have legalized cannabis you have to be 21 uh but we're still seeing underage cannabis use of course just like we're seeing underage drinking and underage nicotin use in other states where it's just really difficult to get we're not seeing cannabis as much but we still are seeing it we didn't talk about um things like Zin pouches which are becoming more popular with adults as well so no vaping no EIG no smoking nicotine but a little pouch um which is different than dipping tobacco or snuffing tobacco um as far as I know uh Zin pouches and things similar deliver nicotine into the bloodstream which then crosses the bloodb brain barrier goes into the brain has this effect of creating focus and alertness kind of little High um but doesn't carry the same carcinogenic risk but presumably there are other risks um which include of course the add and habit forming nature of it the blood pressure increase the Vaso constriction which is related to the blood pressure Etc but what do we know about Zen pouch use is it on the rise or um is or is it that there's something so compelling about vaping and um eigs that you know people in particular kids want the the physical act of of vaping so um this is a case where I've seen this one other time where actually the popular press is ahead of the scientific press and probably head of the science and teaching us scientists that we better hurry up and figure this out how was how was that um so the popular press has been talking about Zin a lot and and arguing that it's a very popular product and that we're seeing now this is true we're seeing a very sharp increase in the market share of Zin compared to other nicotine products so we're seeing it on the rise what I mean by science hasn't caught up is we don't have a lot of surveillance data to show whether or not teens are actually using Zin we have some data we actually published this study a couple years ago showing around 20 to 25% of people in general adolescence and adults and about 11 to 15% of teens are using a pouch presumably Zin we didn't ask we now we looking at our data around Zen use um but we don't have widescale studies we do have studies of pouches more generally like the CDC showed that about I think it was a couple of percent one and a half percent and that it went up a little bit so I think I can't it was something like I think it went from one 1.1% to about 1.5% of teens seem to be admitting using pouches so not a huge increase but a few hundred thousand teens are using across the country as opposed to 2 and A5 million plus using ecigarettes but with all those qualifications aside yes we are seeing an increase in Zin use amongst teenagers what's most concerning is that it seems like it's teenagers who are not using it in addition to ecigarettes but new initiates so they're now just like I'm concerned about teens initiating tobacco or nicotine through ecigarettes now it seems like some are initiating through Zen so Zen is kind of the Gateway it may be an onramp um to using and and and the idea is that they're putting it in between their lip and their gum and then each pouch of Zin is three or 6 milligram it comes in a 3 MGR pouch or a 6 MGR pouch now it is nicotine that yes it's originally D derived from tobacco but there's no tobacco in the pouch itself it's a white powdered nicotine and the I don't know what else is in there we are really lacking the research there but my concern is we've seen this with smokeless tobacco for years is oral cancer and you're putting this in the mouth and at the mucosal line and are we going to start being concerned about oral cancer which we've already been concerned about with other pouches how would you get oral cancer if there if there's no tobacco and it's just nicotine does nicot I I was under the impression and please tell me if I'm wrong that nicotine itself doesn't cause cancer the question is what else is in there is it just nicotine or is there aldhy and other chemicals that are cut with it so that's why I'm said we don't know enough about it my big concern is exactly what you're saying are we going to start seeing teens using nicotine and then nicotine pouches and moving on but the the brain piece it doesn't matter what else is in there we are still concerned about the brain development and if you're using a 3 mgram or a 6 milligram pouch and we know that a lot of teens are using multiple pouches our study showed this as well multiple pouches throughout the day and actually some social media is showing teens putting in several pouches at the same time then you might be getting again as much as a pack of cigarettes of nicotine and that's very concerning so the whole piece we talked about before about brain development and are we stuning or changing or or really rewiring the brain with nicotine doesn't matter what form it's in it is not good and it's not good for teenagers yeah I get asked a lot of questions about Zen pouches and other nicotine pouches and one of the more common questions is um related to the fact that a lot of people start with one or two pouches a day quickly move to four to five and the typical ceiling for most people that at least ask me questions about it uh is moving to quickly a canister a day yeah which is a lot of pouches uh I think it's 15 to 20 pouches per can okay so 3 to six milligrams right you can do the math do the math what's that 60 to upwards of 60 milligrams that's that's and I'm thinking back three packs of cigarettes you got your step ahead of me two steps ahead of me two let's play it safe two I'll give you you know two packs of cigarettes day at least two packs of cigarettes worth of nicotine and it's interesting in in the in the old days when we didn't have e cigarettes and we were talking about cigarettes and we were talking about adults we would talk pack cigarett years right how many packs of cigarettes and for how many years and that language kind of reduced for a while because adults and people weren't using cigarettes as much and so we weren't worrying about this concept of packs I'm worried about it again again we're getting so much nicotine now now yes not in the form of combusted not in the form of burning maybe it's in the form of ecigarettes or pouches but it's still a huge amount of nicotine that we're seeing that young very young brains are using yeah can't be good in my opinion I spent years studying brain development still teach brain development every year can't be good the brain doesn't do well developing with high artificially high levels of any neuromodulator and then you go back to the 8-year-olds we were talking about earlier and we have no studies right on what does a drug like nicotine do to not a teen brain but a child brain and clearly is not good but what exactly is happening we don't have those studies but it's it's incredibly scary to to think about what's happening with young people um and getting addicted so young and then continuing that addiction of a lifetime of addiction that they might have seems like it would be appropriate now to kind of take a step back um I think everyone agrees that these are major problems that are in our youth um and just evaluate messaging and tools to overcome uh these issues um right so obviously if you never try a substance or behavior you can't get addicted to it um but given the prevalence of this stuff what sorts of messaging work earlier we talked about set you know accessing the the rebellious spirit that is youth as a way to get um youth to engage in healthier behaviors and abandon unhealthy behaviors but there's quitting there's just saying no and then there's harm reduction um there's convincing people that some substance is bad for them and scaring them to the point where they quit there's incentivized in them to be healthy there's um replacement behaviors there's just so much in that landscape I know you just um held a conference on cannabis and tobacco recently I'm sorry I wasn't able to attend it sounds super interesting but whether or not we're talking about social media or cannabis or risky driving behavior or um you know Reckless Behavior of any kind I mean what works and when I say this I don't necessarily just mean at the level of Public Health discourse but also parent to child um peer to peer yeah um sibling to Sibling what works I mean how should one approach a kid or an adult for that matter who's vaping cannabis or is vaping nicotine at uh and it's just clearly going to be a bad trajectory what can one do I mean we all also understand personal accountability and neuroplasticity generally emerges best when it comes from within as opposed to from the outside but what can we do the most important is and I've said this for years have a conversation and some people think that having a conversation about name your name your risk behavior drugs uh of any sort Alcohol Tobacco other drugs having a conversation about sex having a conversation about risky driving get young people curious that is not at all the case there's nothing we can talk to a young person about that they don't already know you know we're kidding ourselves to say oh we can't mention drugs to a 16-year-old because we're going to get them curious they've known about drugs since they were 8 years old they we're not and and I often say to parents start that conversation Young when you're when your kids are really young four or five maybe the conversation is having a cookie or having some grapes and and make or going to bed now or going to bed in five minutes I used to say that with my own kids you want to go to bed now or in five minutes so they felt like they were making the decision I didn't really care which decision they were making it was not a fight we need to start having conversations around decision making and healthy decision making and not having a confrontation but a conversation very young now I'm not saying that we talk about drugs or sex when they're very young although to be honest I did I talked about cigarettes and and um and pubal development with my kids when they were very young but it but just starting that conversation so that when you move into more sensitive topics more difficult topics as a child ages and becomes an old older child and into adolescence it's not shocking that you're having those conversations and this is whether you're a parent an educator or whatever so just talking a conversation and not scheduling it by the way not on Saturday at 3:00 we're going to sit down and talk about sex or 3 o' we're going to talk about drugs that does not work you need to I I joke that was like the queen of organic conversation you know I'd see something on TV oh you know oh let's have a conversation about that just making it a natural part and you were asking about differences in cultures and and countries we don't normalize those conversations other countries do and we need to be doing that so that's it sounds like we don't normalize them or formalize them correct we don't so that's one thing the other is we're kidding ourselves if we just talk about the just say no as we're saying before of course we want no use of course we want teens to wait I mean and say we hope and expect that most people if not all will grow up into a healthy sexual relationship whatever that might look like even a healthy alcohol relationship a glass of wine or half a glass of wine at night with dinner again no safe use of a lot of the other drugs including nicotine certainly fentanyl illicit fentanyl um want to make clear not all fanol mid elicit fentanyl but to just simply say no and don't do and it's bad for for you is setting up again that failure of your conversation because okay well you're telling me it's bad but I liked it or my friend liked it and it's not so bad so you've lost credibility the most important part of harm reduction is not to do it absolutely of course not to use not to have risky sex maybe not to have sex at all until you're older not to use tobacco not to use any drugs but how do we do that with a young person who you go into a classroom and 10% 20% have already started using or having sex or whatever the conversation is you shut them down well they don't understand me so why should I listen to them they're not talking to me and so that no use conversation doesn't work there's a Continuum or spectrum of use everything from no use to once in a while to regular use all the way up to addicted years when we're talking about drugs so to go in and assume that nobody's ever used or nobody wants to use you're setting yourself up for failure that's the expectation that's the hope but what we really also need to talk about is best if you don't use but if you do let's if you are using Let's help you cut back or quit and if you are continuing to use let's keep you safe let's make sure that you're not going to die and what I'm talking about here is you know when when most parents if their kids are going to go to a party well I shouldn't say most parents but a conversation often is hey I hope you're not drinking but if you are pick up the phone and I will come get you that's harm reduction and people oh I didn't think about that well that's putting Safety First that is a harm reduction message o or saying I you know you're pretty young to start having sex but here's a condom just in case why do we schools have condoms and because they know that as much as we say it's best to delay are going to that's harm reduction let's at least reduce risk of sti's pregnancy and so on and what did the data say is um the consequence of harm reduction versus the um kind of like thick black line don't don't go anywhere near this behavior all the research or pretty much all the research that I've read and hopefully will contribute to shows that that those messages the harm reduction messages um or what I would say comprehensive really the harm reduction unfortunately harm reduction has gotten a bad WP um part because of cigarettes versus ecigarettes and this reduction or harm Continuum with tobacco so maybe we don't say harm reduction we say comprehensive conversations comprehensive education from no use all the way up to what do we do if you are using and all the research is really saying that those messages are way more effective than not using it all than that if we tell teens don't use and we see this a lot in sexual behavior we say do not have sex period sign a contract that you're not going to have sex and then they're in a situation and we don't arm them with the understanding of how to negotiate how to have a healthy relationship had to have a conversation what do they do if they're thinking that they might want to have sex what do they do in that situation we then find that we're having teens who then don't know how to protect themselves and either have sex that was unwanted or sex that was unprotected and teens want to understand they want the truth they want the knowledge I I went to a school and asked whether if I came and talked about cannabis would they come and they said absolutely I want to understand it and there's this great quote that I recently learned um that said if you know if you don't basically the concept is if you don't teach teens they're going to seek out information so the quote is having teens learn about sex from porn is like having them learn physics from a Transformer from the Transformers or having them learn how to drive from Fast and Furious We need to give teens the information because they're going to find it that's right they're being exposed to other information elsewhere um anyway so that so what you're talking about here is um coming up with counterbalances counterbalances real science-based information that's not overblowing the risks that's not scaring them and then that helps them understand it's best to say no but if you do Fentanyl let's make sure you're not using a loan I mean obviously I don't want somebody using a drug that hasn't been tested and they got off the the internet period because I know kids who have died it's so scary you know we have close friends that um gosh I I would have never guessed that their kids were using drugs and M maybe they were using drugs at the frequency that was always typical of of Youth I don't know I don't know the situations well enough but you know I would say about once every four sadly once every um 4 to 8 months I hear about someone's kid or close relative that died of a fentanyl overdose yeah it does seem to be kids um maybe 30 and younger yeah it was more in the the 20s and 30s it's now really getting into the teens and young adults you're absolutely right and some of the teens I know of who and and young adults who have died were not your drug users you know we talked about not stigmatizing and and that's the other thing if we don't talk then we're stigmatizing we need to have those conversations but a lot of those teens were not using they they needed a pill cuz they were in pain or they needed something and they were not told and this is again that harm reduction and that conversation they were not told don't buy something off the internet if you do test it and and and test it with a fentanyl strip for example and make sure that you're not using a loan because if you're using a loan we can't then give you an our can we can't do something I care AR cam with me all the time do you really I do I have it in my backpack all the time for anyone that you might see that having an overdose or anyone who might see yeah thankfully it hasn't happened but if if if it does I would and and you can't hurt somebody from using it if that's something's happening so should everyone carry a naram I think everybody should have Naran I I do I think I think every school should have Naran I think every Library should have Naran I think every bar should have Aron um I I absolutely believe it now test strips is an interesting debate that I've had so I totally believe in this concept of comprehensive if you don't want to say harod action comprehensive drug education comprehensive sex education and what I mean by that is both the spectrum of of use or behavior as well as all kinds of drug sex rock and roll that we talk about the whole thing but FAL test strips has been an interesting dilemma Within Myself and I'll explain why I've been working with some groups to try to test whether we could study whether if we put both Naran and Fentanyl test trips in schools would teens you get them so you're my fantasy bowl of condoms bowl of Naran bow of fenal test stps and you have it out for for teens wow that's that's a bold statement it is a very bold statement what about the argument that I imagine some people uh counter with um I'm not necessarily saying this this is my argument but just um imagining that some people will hear that and say um having those things uh visible freely available will in will create more of an incentive for risk-taking so I've grappled with that and with condoms we know that that's not the case T it's not going to create teens starting to have sex just going back to what we saying a few minutes ago you're not going to incentivize or create people engaging in any risk behavior by having the conversation but my Gra with the Naran and with the fentanyl test trips has been there oh well you tell me it's a bad idea to use a drug but I'll just test it make sure it's okay well I have a couple of problems with that um even though I still believe in it I still believe in having those there because right now we have an overdose epidemic with fentanyl and Other Drugs so I'll be honest with you I grapple if if if I were in a school and I saw a teenager taking a fentanyl test strip which probably means that they're use it for themselves is the first thing I want to do shake the kid and say are you crazy don't that means that you're thinking about using drugs of course that's my inclination as a parent as a scientist as a developmental psychologist as a human being you want to say what are you doing so yes I would grapple but at the same time if I know that there's a chance that a teen's going to go to a party or pick up a drug and not know do I would I rather that they're safe yes the problem with fental test stps though is that they're not perfect if you are testing the right side of the pill but it's the left side that has fentanyl you still could die and so I don't want to give the impression that that there's one stop is going to fix anything right now it is not and that that is the the issue with the comprehensive drug education or harm reduction uh conversations I'm not saying that it's perfect I'm not saying saying that it's going to stop young people from engaging or young people from from getting hurt or or you know unfortunately dying but if you have a group of Youth who are going to use I would still rather arm them with that information so they don't find themselves in trouble um that is the biggest part that scares me is fentel making its way into all Pharmaceuticals like benzo um MDMA I'm thinking about some of the things are taken recreationally um benzo MDMA um is it in cannabis so most of what I've seen is either by itself fentanyl um using or that it's mixed into pain pain um pills a lot um why would kids want to take pain pills I mean they're in pain they're stressed they're or so they're doing they're doing it sort of self-directed clinical correct or Prozac they're anxious I see so it's not like they're doing it for recreational drug use at parties some are some aren't I mean there there's been so many different circumstances um cannabis and vaping have been interesting debates and we actually had this just the other day uh some of the studies suggest and the that and and suggest that biologically we can't necessarily combine cannabis or nicotine and Fentanyl and have the same reaction on the body and some suggesting that the studies haven't been there but and it's still so new but I will tell you that they're that talking to teens and some some studies suggesting that yes teens are combining or at least getting and a lot of times it's not knowingly it's cut the fentanyl is cutting or the the uh drug manufacturers and sellers are cutting a drug with fentanyl and so they're not even teens are knowing it but that some um I was talking to a a person the other day who said that he has definitely heard of and seen some teens with fentanyl overdoses from Cannabis or from vaping so there's so much studies that are still needed right now and to understand the biological mechanism um as well as the the access to these drugs that we don't know but I I'm nervous so we teach about drug testing we teach about not getting something off it used to be a uh Skittle drug uh parties you'd go and people would take drugs and all different things and put them in the in the middle of a bowl in the middle of the room and just you take whatever who oh yeah when was that this is not long ago maybe 5 10 years ago I was hearing about these I never went to a party like that I didn't either but I didn't go to many parties I was I was Square kid but yeah it's interesting may maybe it was just where it was I mean there were certainly drugs around but um I feel like now recreational pharmacology it sounds like it's everywhere so so different yeah and self-medication is is everywhere that wasn't that wasn't common that wasn't as common but we or if it was people weren't talking about it I think it was I I remember as a middle school student walking into the bathroom and somebody had taken I think what's called a lwd then and and had passed out um it it was certainly around uh different drugs uh but not the not the same that we're seeing now and we definitely saw cocaine overdoses when I was younger yeah I I feel like there was a lot of weed cannabis that is um alcohol um Sil cyb and then as a recreational drug now obviously it's being explored as a clinical tool as his cannabis for that matter um but hard drugs like cocaine amphetamine were PCP were discussed in the media a lot but and it certainly existed in some high schools and colleges and things like that but sounds like it's seeping out of everywhere um it and it's in these commercial products I mean I think the picture that um has been created here is kind of an ominous one so how optimistic are you I I will tell you I'm optimist istic in seeing a a change in the landscape of Education now some people say education doesn't work that we need policies we need both I mean we we have Federal policies and regulations that are slipping through the cracks uh FDA with regulation of ecigarettes with cannabis uh legalization but not being enforced we have uh age restrictions not being enforced so we certainly need education and I'm seeing more and more people for example the concept of of harm reduction or comprehensive education comprehensive sex said not everybody's of course up for it but or open to it but I'm seeing more of a shift towards understanding the need I'm definitely seeing more teens as we were talking about earlier more teens being willing to say no that's not something I'm going to do more teens joining youth groups more teens speaking out about concerns and and trying to be healthier and make healthier decisions for themselves so I'm optimistic in the the human capital and the social capital I'm not optimistic when it comes to the the pharmacology or or the drug Capital so to speak um more and more drugs infiltrating infiltrating our youth I mean you could Vape dot dot dot anything nowadays and that makes me very nervous I do think vaping um and I am using vaping instead of eat cigarettes there to be more lay conversations there or or what the the the culture is saying vaping is just more normalized than it than we've ever ever had it just like smoking was normalized vaping and now vaping anything is very scary to me and very much normalized so that worries me again the fentanyl the hallucinate gens um making its way more and more so that the drugs themselves and the new devices scares me the social and the human capital gives me optimism very grateful to hear that you have optimism sounds to me and correct me where I'm wrong please um and add anything that for parents for siblings for teachers for educators or for any concerned citizen it seems like having conversations about these things the fact that they're happening so not turning a blind eye the fact that um you know kids are aware of it they're you know that we're fooling ourselves if we think that they aren't aware of these risk-taking behaviors they're sort of they're all around them uh anyway so we shouldn't shy away from those conversations and that at least having a conversation about the difference between avoiding behaviors and harm reduction is something that one ought to consider I mean obviously this is a household by household Choice absolutely um in some cases school by school or classroom by classroom choice but certainly household maybe even parent by parent choice but that um because of social media and just because of the nature of Youth that young people are having these conversations anyway that that's what I'm hearing coming through and that and that it you said don't formalize the conversation so much that you know Saturday at 3:00 we're going to have a discussion about drugs but make it part of the landscape to create some ease um solely make it fasile to talk about these things concerns um and probably listen to them too they're right there in the midst of it um so they have a data set internally about what what's actually happening totally agree totally agree and and I often say to to parents or Educators if you're they're listening to this podcast or any it it's actually say hey I I learned something can we have a conversation about what I learned and not confront again that it's a conversation not a confrontation it's let's normalize drug discussions let's normalize uh Behavior discussions not normalize the use or the behavior itself so talk to your teens you're absolutely right talk to your teens this is what I just learned what do you know can we find out some information together go on our reach websites go on other web websites go learn information out there learn together and not lecture but have a conversation you may not know right away a team may not tell you right away yes I'm using or yes I'm having sex or yes I'm drinking alcohol or yes I'm doing something that is just a risky Behavior but that's not necessarily our goal is as adults to find out today whether or not somebody is doing something it's okay okay to let it be a little bit more organic it's a it's okay to start that conversation and see that's your building trust it is parent to parent but I would say I'm not going to bust you I certainly I'm not going to be happy but let's have a conversation so that way we can build the trust and I could help you either not use get help stop using or be safer in using or help you prevent from using it all so having that conversation that organic and and talking to where they're at as a developmentalist that's what we do meet people where they're at meet youth where they're at whether that's using already not using don't come at them with your preconceived notions as an adult because it will not work it will backfire we need to use the strengths young people are strong young people are smart we need to use their strengths take their lead and then use our adult wisdom and experiences to then turn that into the proper conversation I love it well on the topic of conversation and communication one of the um kind of unique features of this podcast is that we have a uh a large social media um footprint um and inside of that footprint we not only broadcast information but we get information back so in anticipation of uh this conversation today I reached out to uh followers of huberman lab social media on X formerly known as Twitter and Instagram and they had a lot of questions for you we don't have time to go into the many thousands of questions but I'm going to just ask you um if I may in kind of a um short Q&A format a few of them and if you don't have answers you can just say pass we'll get back to that maybe we'll do another episode another time uh please don't feel um obligated to give thorough answers this is uh we just wouldn't have time yeah so one of the top questions is would love to learn more about how to get teens to see the longer term implications of the choices they make and the habits they form now is there any way to get them to understand how now leads to later we've done studies where we've asked teens about their goals and I want to be a dancer we had one teen tell us or I want to be a doctor or I want to be whatever it is asking teens about their goals about their aspirations and then connecting their current behavior and their current risks and and keeping themselves healthy and how that plays into their goals that tends to work a lot and we've seen that in our studies teens set boundaries I don't want to get pregnant because I want to be a dancer things like that so really linking what they're doing now to their ultimate goals is one way to really help them think that through I like that how a different maybe even larger goal um if you could supersede these like short-term behaviors and they could see how those things link up absolutely that's great um there's another question came in requesting some positive news about teenagers to be shared quote every discussion is around risk or emotional distress or social anxiety or phone addiction as if they're all dysfunctional U because of their brains we never dismiss toddlers learning to talk and walk because their brains are offline so I think the point is that um you know can we highlight some of the ways in which the Adolescent teen brain is um is exceptional at something that perhaps the rest of uh the brains out there are not so I mentioned some of them around our youth group and about the youth movement now against drugs and and other things I think and it comes the optimism I I I I'm the biggest teen Advocate out there it's why I study adolescence and I do the prevention and advocacy work that I do teenagers are fundamentally fantastic uh they're creative they're passionate teens care about the environment kids really teens really care about social justice teens do care about our future and our planet that is wonderful well more than do adults right now so I think we should be capitalizing on that teens are incredibly creative we need to be working with teens and young adults in everything that we do because they are a future and I don't mean that as a cliche I really mean that so having the conversation let them be be part part of that conversation help them find out what they think we should do to solve some of the problems they're the ones to talk to so I very optimistic about teenagers we have 40 teenagers who and young adults who work with us all the time on our work because we trust them so I think some people are afraid of teens I embrace them I think they're fantastic love it do we know how vaping shapes the teen brain in other words are there any known biological changes in the developing brain as a consequence of of vaping and here I'm going to assume it's vaping nicotine but you know we talked about um cannabis as it relates to uh psychosis earlier so let's just keep it restricted to um nicotine sure well we know that during the adolescence that nicotine changes the brain wiring and what do I mean by that we're actually born with the nicotinic receptors we're born with the ability to become addicted to nicotine same thing with the um cannabis you were talking about before so if we don't during the Adolescent time when we're pruning away and getting rid of the the connections the neurons that we don't need what happens is uh dur during that process anything that we don't use that we don't reinforce goes away well if we introduce nicotine in into our brain it solidifies it keeps that that receptor there and also makes it to where our receptor is really kind of I think of it as like um keys and locks in a key and suddenly you've got that receptor and it says ooh you're putting nicotine in there keep that in there or cups it's developing those cups I often think about and filling those cups with nicotine and those cups are your receptors that were already there you then take away that nicotine and your cups say I need more so you're rewiring your brain you're wiring your brain to be more likely to become addicted and now you're addicted and you need to keep feeding those cups with nicotine or you're going to go through a withdrawal and so that is what H is happening during an adolescent and young adult that we don't see in adults that's why we really want to keep young people away from nicotine as long as possible a lot of questions about um are there negative effects of of pornography on the developing brain I imagine there's a lot of literature on that yeah I I don't know as much actually in the developing brain um I'm sure there is I I don't know it there is but there's clear evidence about viewing pornography around just not having goodal healthy sexual relationships because porn is not normal it is it is not a normal relationship between two people what you are doing is really making it so that way you um you're you're not necessarily developing a healthy relationship with your partner because you're assuming some gold standard out there that may or may not be able to be achieved so um and it also is also a problem with body shaming and the body types that most people don't have and can't achieve and that's that that's another problem out there with with uh with with pornography a lot of questions about how social media impacts brain development that's probably an entire episode unto itself it is it is that that we could do another time and we should and um if you'd be so gracious to come back and do that we we will um I think as a just a final question you know is there any um information about potential causality between the Mental Health crisis that we observe in Youth and um let's just say substance use um of the sorts that we talked about today obviously the directionality is tricky there you can imagine that a lot of HGC cannabis use is leading to more psychosis but seems more likely that um kids are self-medicating correct in the face of like immense challenge you know not just the lockdowns and the culture around isolating kids from other kids and um the stress that was on everybody um stress generally the sociopolitical landscape social media I mean it's hard to not feel like it's at least a cloudier maybe a darker time than it used to be but I don't know I mean we humans have evolved through a lot um and it I don't know that it's also fair to say that everyone's you know bummed out about what they see presumably there's still some optimists out there so absolutely uh there there plenty of studies that show the bidirectional relationship between anxiety depression Mental Health and substance use you're right a lot of teens are self-medicating by using various substances to reduce their anxiety reduce their stress and also just social lubrication right of going into a party and and pregaming or going into a party and using drugs to make themselves uh less stiff less less stressed during that situation but more what we're talking about is that they're self-medicating because they're feeling sad or uncomfortable and this is they think helping them again it's not helping it's making them feel less bad had by continuing to use but we also do know that drugs also lead to suicidal ideations suicide attempts psychosis and other mental health issues we also know that drugs lead to reduce academic achievement um even though there's some potential uh cognitive in reinforcement that's going on there's also some issues with lack of concentration the other piece by the way that we didn't really talk about a lot but is the co-use that we're seeing a lot of te not just using multiple products but using them together so a lot of teens who are chasing cannabis and tobacco because it enhances the high or they're using cannabis with alcohol and other mixing of drugs which is uh enhancing the high but not in a good way and very scary uh for for young people and and a lot of times young people don't even realize like with blunts which is truly as I was saying before using nicotine and cannabis together that you're actually becoming addicted to both products really simultaneously and that we're seeing young people who are having mental health issues and depression more likely to use both products uh so definitely linkage is there amongst mental health issues and multiple products as well so poly pharmacology yeah well I don't want to end on a down note but I don't think it's a down note I think uh what you've done today and sharing with us the the realistic landscape of What's Happen happening out there and the realistic landscape of what you're trying to do to amarate these issues is uh nothing short of spectacular meaning uh as cloudy as it may seem in uh in our youth uh there's also great hope in everything that you're conveying which is um to put it simply uh why would you be trying so hard to fix these problems if you didn't believe that they could be fixed so so I I find great optimism in the message I also I like data and you've shared with us a tremendous amount of data about what's happening what likely needs to change and the optimal change an optimal route to change as well as some you know realistic perhaps less than optimal but realistic approaches like sometimes it's just a matter of harm reduction there's we're not going to eliminate these potentially dangerous behaviors or dangerous behaviors so for all of that I want to say thank you it's a tremendous gift to us all and I know that we have a lot of parents and kids and nonparents and um every age um and background that listen to this podcast and uh what's clear to me is that it's going to be a community effort to try and face all this and I keep hearing in the back of my mind this thing that you've said several times now that kids know what's happening we have to have these conversations they're hard conversations to have um for any of us they're uncomfortable for adults to have but that until we normalize at least the conversation it's unlikely that we're going to solve these problems so thank you for your incredible efforts in the research domain and also for helping to normalize and bring about these conversations they're oh so important thank you so much thank you very much thank you for

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine recently the hubman Lab podcast hosted a live event at the Sydney Opera House in Australia the event was called the brain body contract and featured a lecture followed by a question and answer session with the audience we wanted to make the question and answer session available to everyone regarding regardless if you could attend so what follows is the question and answer session from the Sydney Opera House in Australia I also would like to thank the sponsors for the event they are eight sleep and ag1 eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity now one of the key aspects to getting a great night's sleep is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3° and in order to wake up in the morning feeling refreshed your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3° eight sleep makes it extremely easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment at the beginning middle and throughout the night and when you wake up in the morning I've been sleeping on an eight sleep mattress cover for nearly 3 years now and it has dramatically improved my sleep if you'd like to try eight sleep you can go to 8sleep.com huberman to save $150 off their pod 3 cover eights sleep currently ships to the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com huberman the other live event sponsor ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens and other critical micronutrients I've been taking ag1 daily since 2012 so I'm delighted that they decided to sponsor the live event the reason I started taking it and the reason I still take it every day once or twice a day is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas for vitamins and minerals and it ensures that I get enough Prebiotic and probiotic to support gut health now of course I strive to consume healthy Whole Foods for the major of my nutritional intake every single day but there are a number of things in ag1 including specific micronutrients that are hard to get from Whole Foods or at least in sufficient quantities so ag1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals that I need probiotics prebiotics the adaptogens and critical micronutrients to try ag1 go to drink a1.com huberman and you'll get a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 and five free travel packs of ag1 again that's drink a1.com huberman thank you to the Sydney Opera House for hosting us and for making this event [Music] [Applause] [Music] possible what are the latest findings on the physiological mechanisms behind stress's impact on the body and brain and what are some practical tools or techniques for managing stress effectively well um thank you for that question I'll I'll um deliberately not repeat what I said earlier about physiological size panoramic Vision Etc and raising stress threshold because we covered that um already but I think that one of the the most interesting findings two most interesting findings in the in the field of stress in the last five years or even three years I think the the work from my colleague Ali Crum at Stanford she's been a guest on the podcast she works on mindsets uh is the following um result uh students Stanford students that is come into the laboratory they view a I think it's a five minute movie about how awful stress is for the mind and body all the things it does like deplete your immune system make you miserable uh deplete certain aspects of the the reproductive axis and on and on and then a separate group comes in and watches a video also five minutes also true about all the things that stress can do to enhance performance both cognitive or physical like excess or additional energy additional cognitive power access to certain memory sets albeit narrow memory sets Etc and what you find is that the results Point directly to the fact that whatever you believe about stress provided the information you have is true is what happens so if I tell you that stress improves your memory Focus attention one observes that if I tell you that stress depletes your immune system Etc one observes that so this is something that we don't quite yet understand as neuroscientists and the psychology of it makes more sense frankly than the mechanisms but it's becoming very clear that what we believe about a given phenomenon strongly impacts how it shapes our response to that so I find that very interesting now of course you can't delete information about stress being bad for you so what does that mean if you want stress to be uh enhancing as it's called there's literally now called the stresses enhancing mindset that the thing you can do is to learn more about how stress can be enhancing we're not talking about lying we're not talking about placebo effect we're talking about real knowledge based in fact that one can absorb and I find it amazing and wonderful that the mere learning of something can actually change how we respond to something at a core physiological level the second I think very important set of findings on stress relate to a structure that I've talked about recently on the podcast and I talked about with um the one and only David gogins most people presumably have heard like he's on his way he running here right now from from Central America um yeah that guy I'll tell you that guy is every bit as intense as he comes across I met him for the first time in 2016 at a at a gathering in uh it was in Silicon Valley which're just doing a little bit of work for this company at the end of the day he leaves for minute and he changes into his shorts and his shirt he's like I'm going running I got to go to the airport I'm thinking I'm going to go running then I'm going to go to the airport he was running to the airport seriously and we're like 14 miles from the airport which I realized 14 miles for a marathon are no big deal but he's got his bags and I'm thinking to myself this guy he's nuts and I love him I mean he's really he's really that guy it's it's it's actually very refreshing you know the the Rick you know I think one reason we love the Rick Rubin and the the David goggin is they truly are different but from one basic standpoint is they just don't give a they just do what they're going to do and they trust that they're doing right for them and for the people around them and it's awesome it's really awesome I think that it it again brings about that you know that word that you know doesn't come about very often for me but you just kind of stuns you into like behold David God Rick rubben the Cuttlefish whatever you know so but I talked about this with David there's this structure in our brain and these are recent discoveries not by my lab I wish I had discovered these but actually a colleague of mine at Stanford Joe parvey who's in the department of neurosurgery has made these beautiful discoveries about the anterior mid singulate cortex the anterior mid singulate CeX it's a structure in the brain that has a lot of subdivisions but when Joe put a little stimulating electrode into this area because he had patients that needed neurosurgery and they probe around asking questions what do you feel how do you feel what are you going to do and sometimes they hit an area I've seen these experiments they're unbelievable stimulate an area and the person says you know I feel like I'm about to go into a rage they like okay let's back off let's move over here anterior mid singulate cortex they stimulate and the patient the person says I feel like I'm heading into a storm you go oh that doesn't sound good and they say no but I'm ready I'm leaning in a different patient you stimulate their anterior mid singulate cortex and the person says I feel like I'm going to get up out of my chair and do something really really difficult okay so this is interesting across multiple people you're seeing the same general kind of forward Center of mass kind of response leaning into Challenge and challenge specifically and then there's now scores of studies in the just the last 3 to 5 years showing that for instance people who successfully overcome a challenge of any kind fitness challenge cognitive challenge interior mid singulate cortex expands or at least increases its Baseline levels of activity you see people that fail to meet that challenge less inter mid singulate cortex activi there's a bidirectionality of the response and on and on and it seems that doing things that are difficult that we don't enjoy or that we have to push ourselves to do grow and enhance the activity within this anid singulate cortex and the beauty of it is that it generalizes that the anid singulate cortex can be applied or the growth of it can be directed towards lots of different things which is I think a call for you of course seeking pleasure seeking Comfort seeking relaxation seeking sleep every night seeking sunlight in the morning Etc but also deliberately seeking out challenges that is challenges for us the importance of doing hard things in a safe manner psychologically and physically safe manner of course is truly beneficial toward our ability to manage ourselves in what would otherwise be called stress so I think those the work of alium and the work on the ENT mid singulate cortex by parvis and a bunch of other labs I think are the two areas where I um feel like things are happening really quickly we're making big strides as a field and we're moving away from uh kind of conjecture about how to U better ourselves uh in lots of different ways can you talk about time perception why is it that in some instances time moves very slowly while in others it seems to move very fast thank you tonight has been so fun thank you I've had fun too um this is something I'm trying to do more of not necessarily lives but that too but um someone recently uh who I I love and admire very much said to me we're gonna have so much fun and I thought whoa like behold no one's ever said that to me no one's ever said that to me all my years growing up I I mean I mean I love with with all due respect to my parents I can't remember anyone ever turning to me and saying we're going to have so much fun so I'm trying that that to me just kind of blew me away I'm think yeah like you're allowed to have fun so time perception is a topic that I am you know as obsessed by as I am many other topics um but one that is really near and dear to my heart because I've always been struck by this observation that is certainly not uniquely mine that you know if you're sitting waiting for an appointment at the doctor's office it feels like time goes by really slowly like really slowly whereas if you have a really full day with lots and lots of activities it seems like time went by really fast like oh my God I can't believe that so much time has G by sorry so much has happened excuse me but not a lot of time has gone by which means that our frame rate on life is highly Dynamic and in fact it is and in fact it's set by you guessed it our visual system at least for cited folks for people who are low vision or no vision and by the way I I always reference that because my laboratory has worked on low vision no vision um issues for a number of years it's through the auditory system but for sake of generalizing now and simplicity we'll talk about the visual system so it is a fact that when we focus on things up close think of watchmaker think about looking into your phone our perception of time is more fine grain that is our frame rate is higher okay so more frames per second than when we view things at a distance you might think well how could that possibly be how could that possibly be but it makes perfect sense you know when we think about the time space coding in the brain we need to Anchor ourselves to something the rising and setting of the sun of course the you know I mean unless you're a flat earther you know we're going around the Sun now what's that no someone we got no flat earthers One Flat earther in the audience let okay cool um uh yeah just I don't think that's what they were saying but um but we need to Anchor ourselves in time and our visual system is the way that we anchor ourselves in time we have facts about past present and future so we have knowledge but at an unconscious level we need to Anchor our frame rate set our frame rate and so this is why if you go down to Bondi and you lie back and you look up at the clouds and the clouds are kind of moving in an unpredictable way whenever we're looking at a landscape which has some lack of predictable features like waves or rustling of trees where you could predict that if the wind's blowing this way that the trees going to go this way and then back again but you're not not really in a mode of trying to anticipate just how far in the same way that for instance if you call an Uber you're waiting on a text message you know if you're ever waiting on a text message you notice you'll F slice okay dot dot dot when's that thing coming when's that thing you're fine slicing time as your level of autonomic arousal goes up your frame rate goes up as your level of autonomic arousal goes down so you're sleepy or if you're viewing things that have kind of an unpredictable aspect to them then your frame rate expands your the passage of time changes or your perception of the passage of time changes this is why one of the reasons why I love Aquaria you know and one of my favorite things to do since I don't have a fish tank at home right now but that's going to change soon is I'll go on YouTube and there's this beautiful live video of this aquarium in Japan and I'll just zone out it's like the most relaxing thing ever and every once in a while a whale they have a whale shark in an aquarium every once in a while a whale shark will go through and you go like whoa and then it disappears and then the little fish and the kelp and things like and it's immensely relaxing what it does is it slows your frame rate down and then I find that resets me after just five or six minutes to go back to doing this you know High frame rate type stuff which is what we're doing when we're texting when we're typing when we're social media by the way is tuned to a frame rate that's really interesting that keeps us engaged just up to the point where then we want to swipe to the next thing it's it's the algorithms are are designed uh and by the way I have a somewhat benevolent semi benevolent view of social media I think it' be used for good I think it' be used for not good um I think you know limiting one's time on there is good but there's some there's some good content on there for sure a lot of my life is spent on there indeed so frame rate is set by where you're looking the further out you're looking the larger the longer sort of time bins your capturing bigger time bins okay less resolution closer in and the more you're trying to predict the next outcome sort of fine grain analysis predicting what we call dpos duration path and outcome what's going to happen for how long and what's going to happen is something that you're thinking about and wondering about then frame rate goes up and there's actually a wonderful movie um a Hitchcock movie The Name Escapes me at the moment in which Hitchcock understood this and it's a movie that's only about 90 minutes it's long but in the background the sun rises and sets and the way that people move through the scenes of this movie gives you the Feeling by the end of this 90-minute movie that a full 24 hours passed it's really interesting you feel it in your body as if it was a much longer movie even though if you look at your watch that happens and now the Cannabis smokers again are thinking like yeah like where you sit there and you're like whoa that was a really long time you looking it's like three minutes went by and you're like whoa like wow psychedelics will do this as well um they certainly do they distort our time perception mainly through the deployment of large amounts of the neuromodulator serotonin which is intimately involved in kind of clock perception mechanisms there are a bunch of other things that can set sort of in trenic rhythmicity of our auditory system that also adjust our frame rate I think one of the reasons why 40 Herz tones can be valuable for doing cognitive work is that they tend to entrain the the certain circuits within the brain for doing the kinds of work that most people call work kind where you have to type things out think logically kind of if then kind of um analysis very different than say writing new sheet music or coming up with poetry where you know here again we can think back to the you know the Rick Rubin thing or the you know being stationary right you like the W we're sitting with movement and the Brain going forward there's something about adjusting frame rate for capturing new ideas versus implementing ideas implementation of ideas to be carried out on higher frame rate type time perception and now you can understand why our visual perception said about the distance of a laptop or phone would be uh good for that or a conversation you know remember that whole thing of like looking at somebody's face and having a conversation as opposed to looking off into the distance walking and allowing one's gaze to go panoramic so hopefully now you're starting to sense some themes so that that's all I say about time perception now but of course humans have throughout history and still now Frank Al um also embarked on a lot of pharmacology If we're honest in order to try and adjust frame rate for sake of productivity but you know caffeine will injust frame rate in the predictable Direction but also things like alcohol and and various drugs like you know cannabis in order to adjust frame rate I'm certainly not suggesting you do those things I'm not a cop you do what you want just know what you're doing can you please talk about the jet lag protocol you followed when arriving in Sydney oh yeah well this one was a little bit easier for me because obviously it's not that far off it's just you're a full day ahead uh from where I live back home in California um but nonetheless I suffered tremendously from jet lag and once actually in 2017 I went to Abu Dhabi a 12-hour flip from uh where I was living at that time in the Bay Area and I was a wreck I could barely make it to the meeting I was crying I was like it really messes me up I I slept great the first night and then just didn't sleep for two days I was a mess so jet lag is something that I've really had to work hard on and there are a couple things worth noting and we've done a whole episode about this but I'll kind of hit a few key bullet points and maybe it's relevant to you even if you're not traveling at any point soon because many people are jetlagged without traveling because of the way that they stay up late in fact most everybody in the world now qualifies as a shift worker did you know that and here no disrespect only reverence and gratitude to the actual shift workers that stay up all night doing emergency work and Hospital work and caring for children and things like that throughout the night so I'm not trying to take anything away from them but we are all shifted Enough by virtue of artificial lighting and and uh electronic devices that we are effectively shifted and shift working because we're staying up engaging our cognitive systems in ways that frankly we didn't evolve to which I'm not saying is bad but it's just the reality okay what to do for jet lag the key thing is this and actually this is very valuable in general for sake of sleep so this is something I haven't talked enough about on the podcast ask yourself what time you normally wake up without an alarm I realize there's some variance from dayto day but you know for me it would be about let's say 6:00 a.m. so let's say for you at 7 you know just get pick your typical wakeup time if you subtract from that number so for me 4: a.m. that almost with certainty is what's called your temperature minimum your temperature minimum we could measure it you could put a thermometer in your mouth or if you come to the laboratory Unfortunately they have to do it rectally 4:00 a.m. would be my temperature minimum maybe for you if you wake up at 7 typically or around 7 it's going to be 500 a.m. okay so we're not actually measuring your temperature in this kind of Gunk and this thought experiment what we're doing is we're trying to find a time so here's what's interesting if you expose your eyes not your skin but your eyes to Bright Light in the 2 hours or so maybe 3 hours prior to that temperature minimum time so if you wake up at 7: a.m. 5 a.m. is your temperature minimum so in the two hours maybe three hours prior to that you're going to shift your wakeup time and your toed time what's called a phase delay a shift in your circadian rhythm by about an hour interesting given that if you view bright light in the two to three hours after your temperature minimum you advance your clock meaning you pull back your clock to want to wake up a bit earlier and go to sleep a little bit earlier by about an hour for every time you do that you think well okay I wake up in the morning at 7 and let's say I'm using you as an example or me at 6 and I usually try and get some sunlight in my eyes especially on overcast days etc etc you've heard me blab about this many times before on the podcast and elsewhere so how come I'm not going to bed earlier and earlier every night and waking up earlier and earlier every morning and indeed you would you would keep phase advancing your clock if you did that except that in the afternoon if you got sunlight in your eyes as presumably you did today it was beautiful sunny day on your way here you phase delayed your clock a little bit and as a consequence you wake up and go to sleep at more or less the same time every day it's an amazing mechanism and guess what viewing sunlight in the middle of the day does not do the same thing it doesn't shift your circadian clock they don't tell you that in school but they should they're telling you like all the other stuff the reason it doesn't do it is that middle of the day period is What's called the Circadian Dead Zone sounds very dramatic very ominous getting sunlight in your eyes during the middle of the day is great for mood it's evident that it's also important if it gets on your skin and healthy not burning amounts uh levels that would induce burn that it can enhance testosterone estrogen levels Etc in healthy ways healthy ratios nonetheless that morning sunlight viewing after your temperature minimum advances your clock makes you want to get up earlier go to bed earlier viewed before delays your clock makes you want to get up later go to bed later so this is very useful if you ever want to shift your clock at home before you Trav to get onto a new schedule for work or school or if you're traveling what it means is that when you arrive in a new location like I did in Melbourne the other day believe me I practiced that for like at least an hour you know and with two aies and they kept telling me I was doing it wrong until finally they're like no I'm just joking with you you got it right like the fourth time you guys have a wicked sense of humor down here the I'm tougher than I look the the the key thing is that if you land you have to ask let's say at 8:00 a.m. local or noon local time the key is to ask yourself hm what does my body think what is my temperature minimum back from back home so for instance if you land at 5:00 p.m. but it corresponds to a time before your temperature minimum and you go outside and you're like w W beautiful Setting Sun I'm supposed to get sunlight in my eyes well guess what you might delay your clock if you want to go to bed earlier that's probably not a good idea whereas if you want to stay if you want to advance your clock you would view sunlight at a time that is corresponding to the two hours after your temperature minimum I realize it's a little bit tricky but that's all you have to ask yourself for the first three days first three days that you travel to some location because then you can shift very fast so what that requires is sometimes saying oh I don't want to shift myself so I'm actually going to wear sunglasses and a brimmed hat to avoid shifting because I'd like to be on the local schedule or in some cases you think oh I really want to wake up here and I'm in the perfect opportunity to wake up because it's the middle of the afternoon in Sydney and back home I would have just hit my temperature minimum and so I'm going to get sunlight in my eyes well that's going to wake me up and it's going to actually make me want to go to bed a little bit earlier so I can go to bed at local time so I'm not going to be up until you know 3:00 a.m. so you might have to work this out a little bit on paper but this is the way that military and this is the way that shift workers who are educated in the in the mechanisms of this stuff that's the way they do it it also helps to eat on the local schedule because food is another what we call zeit Gaber another one of the timekeepers for the circadian clock so if you force yourself to eat on the local schedule that can help you shift activity can help you shift and social rhythms can help you shift as well but that temperature minimum and the role of light before or after the temperature minimum either delaying or advancing your clock that's the heavy hammer in this whole process so I did that and these days I do a lot of red light time in the evening when I want to go to sleep and I don't mean red light panels like the expensive stuff that has a whole other set of uses what I'm talking about is just getting a red light like a party light we turn off the lights and put in a red light and that is known to reduce cortisol levels as opposed to other kinds of lighting so it only takes about half hour before you go to sleep or so you want to mellow out you just switch over to Red Light it's actually very pleasant right um as long as you can go about the activities you want to do safely just you know get a you put a red light up and by the way Rick's house is like all red lights at night no artificial lighting past Sundown guys like a plant can you elaborate on the science between psychedelic psilocybin and neuroplasticity uh yes um you know this is a topic that just a few years ago I was was like too frightened to talk about um I was afraid to lose my job frankly um you know these are still scheduled drugs in the United States although they are being explored for therapeutic reasons mainly for the treatment of uh severe depression but among among other things smoking sensation Eating Disorders by the way anoria nervosa still is the the the highest morbidity of any psychiatric challenge it's just really tragic so you know like there there's a real need for treatments that work and um psychedelics like psilocybin LSD to some extent um MDMA which uh technically is not a psychedelic it's an empathogen we could talk about that also called ecstasy um so uh these sorts of compounds are have been explored quite extensively in the last few years and I've completely ramped my stance on them for for a couple of reasons I'll just come clean you know as as a kid um too young I I explored these things I do not recommend that uh I had some pretty bad experiences on LSD as as a young teenager um and I don't recommend it I think the brain is highly plastic that time in fact being an adolescent a kid or a teen is a psychedelic experience you do not need psychedelics and I don't recommend them um unless some very qualified clinician you know can convince you otherwise I you know and there I would also you know seek a second opinion but they they clearly have their role and I think a couple of things have changed my stance first of all there are a lot of ferally funded stud studies taking place at Stanford and Elsewhere on these compounds um second they for whatever reason and I don't quite understand the sociology of it but for whatever reason psychedelics are no longer uh associated with the kind of counterculture the way they used to be and are in fact heavily associated with some of the veterans groups that are using these for PTSD with groups in the states groups like veteran Solutions which are doing amazing work with different psychedelics in including ibigan um iboga it's a 22-hour long psychedelic Journey I've never done it um truly where you close your eyes and and you get um essentially real life like recollection of your experiences but you have agency inside these experiences um there's some cardiac issues with abigan that require constant monitoring of the of the heart but they're they've got some really impressive outcomes this is all worked by my colleague Nolan Williams at Stanford so things like psilocybin we view a little bit differently nowadays what is psilocybin psilocybin if you look at it chemically looks a lot like serotonin a lot like serotonin and it tickles that is it binds nearly selectively to a specific serotonin receptor and it seems to create more what we call resting state lateral connectivity which means more brain areas connected to other brain areas or at least talking to those brain areas after the psilocybin Journey as it's called as opposed to before now these Journeys and I have done them as an adult um I did this as part of a clinical trial did was participated in a psilocybin trial and I participated in MDMA trial um they can be terrifying while they're happening but often there's great Insight um from those experiences provided the right support is provided and it's they always say set and setting so I'm not providing all these like caveats about safety for for no reason or to protect me I'm saying to protect you I mean it it can be it was for me absolutely terrifying and then you do it again as part of these trials the second time I'm like okay this time moment is going to be good going boom terrifying it was a horrible but I learned a lot and there does seem to be an anti-depressant effect I wasn't clinically diagnosed with depression but prior to that but or after thank goodness but I think what we're seeing with these compounds and from my own experience if I may is that they allow us to see relationships between events of past and present and hopefully anticipate certain actions and changes into the future while experiencing the fullness of the emotionality of those experiences in real time so as somebody who's done an immense amount of therapy um I can tell you that I I find Great Value in talk therapy I do um especially of the I think what's called Insight oriented psychoanalysis or or Psychotherapy doesn't have to be classic psychoanalysis not just support you need that not just Rapport you need that but insight as well is is the goal those three things but one of the issues is unless you get on the phone with your therapist or you talk to them in person in a moment where something is really acute like it's really getting you right at that moment sad or happy or whatever it may be it's hard to experience the fullness of that issue in that moment while also parsing it cognitively and it does seem that the psychedelics and to some extent MDMA allow people to get into the full amplitude maybe even enhanced amplitude emotionality of an experience and at the same time allow people to reflect and with the help of a so-called guide or the the therapist take notes in a way that lead to specific actionable outcomes and I think that's the real value you can get realtime experience with insight and of course you need need support as well and of course set and setting and safety are absolutely key so psilocybin seems to do that in one manner MDMA does it in a different way MDMA by the way we we know dramatically increases serotonin and dopamine but it seems to be the serotonergic effect that um is responsible for most of its therapeutic effect by the way MDMA is methylene dioxy methampetamine which isn't necessarily saying that it's bad what's actually interesting is that MDMA ecstasy provided that it's pure and in the appropriate dosage range does not seem to be neurotoxic as it once was thought to be the paper claiming that was retracted they accidentally were giving the subjects in that study uh Beth amphetamine not MDMA and right yes right and they retracted the paper but nobody talks about that paper but do you know it's kind of interesting do you know where the um most of the data on the lack of toxicity of MDMA comes from there's a a beautiful set of studies that were carried out on subjects who were exclusively from the church of latterday saints sometimes referred to as Mormons right Mormons are an excellent test population for a study like that because they don't do other drugs but MDMA is not on the no-fly list so apparently according to these papers and by the way I have a lot of friends who are LDS and they're they're wonderful people the according to the these papers which I believe because they're published and peer reviewed and they still are in the literature you can find subjects in that Community not all of LDS are taking LDS folks are taking actually I don't think but presumably no but people who have taken anywhere from one to two to 50 to over a 100 doses of MDMA in a short period of time and aside from a mild deficit in in attention and the people who have taken the large doses or frequent doses that is they there do not seem to be many cognitive deficits um that are detectable and certainly no um apparent neurotoxicity which is not to say go do MDMA as much as you like I think there is the potential for neurotoxicity if it's taken too often and things of that sort so a lot to still figure out but MDMA um seems to have a slightly different um trajectory of than psilocybin it tends to be less um scary um although it it is very sympathetic uh arousing that is so people can get afraid or if the elevated heart rate Etc but the empathogenic component is really interesting because ultimately with PTSD it's really about developing empathy for one's self it's really about developing empathy for oneself and resolving one of the core issues of trauma which is often not discussed which is that at an unconscious level at an unconscious level trauma seems to be a confusion to the nervous system about who's responsible so that even if somebody knows and understands hey that was them they're the perpetrator I'm the victim somehow the nervous system gets confused about responsibility in a way that leads to triggering of some of the the negative feelings around that event or events as the case may be and MDMA seems to be able to intervene in that confusion and shortcircuit that confusion through this self-empathy self-empathy is something that I think um deserves more exploration in the years to come so lots happening there in the United States MDMA is um now being registered with the FDA for um for additional perhaps for legalization right now it's it is still illegal so if you take any of what I said tonight and go buy MDMA I'm not at fault okay getting in the sa about two hours before going to sleep really improves my quality of sleep what's going on here ah love this this one can be pretty simple the relationship between temperature and sleep is a wellestablished one to fall asleep you need to cool down by 1 to 3 degre you've probably heard me say that before to wake up you need to heat up by about 1 to 3 degrees and when you get into a sauna or you take a hot bath or even to a lesser degree you wash your face with warm water in the evening hands with warm water because of the way that the body Thermo regulates you actually end up cooling yourself off you think no I got in the sauna actually I've been going to the sauna at this place here um recovery they have a wonderful sauna coal plune and then they have this bed where you float on the thing have you tried this thing this thing is so cool it's like a water bed but it like floats you that's amazing amazing by the way they don't pay me to say that I'm just grateful that they let me like sit in this bed I've was sleeping in there as much as possible but they shut down at night eventually and I got to go home so the the sauna is a great tool before sleep or or warm shower or hot bath or warm bath for the following reason the brain area that controls Thermo regulation is the medial preoptic area which is operates like a thermostat so if you warm the external portion of the body the brain has to then what cool down your core body temperature it doesn't happen right away but it happens as you get out of the sauna and maybe you take a a warmish shower or cool shower so what ends up happening is that you warmed up which allows you to cool down internally and then you're able to fall asleep and stay more deeply asleep um that's probably what's improving your sleep in fact a kind of Mantra that I learned from the great Matt Walker who wrote The Great Book why we sleep and by the way we have a sleep series with the mighty Matt Walker coming out later this year we recorded six episodes all every aspect of sleep you can imagine he says and I hope I'm getting this right uh he says you need to warm up to cool down to go to sleep or to fall warm up to cool down to fall asleep stay cool to stay asleep warm up to wake up there you go that's a a straight bite out of uh Matt Walker's um mouth so he deserves that um citation not me so that's what's happening when you get in the sauna now when you get into the cold plunge you're cold but guess what same thing the surface of your body is cooler those thermal receptors transmit information to the medial preoptic area of your body and your core body temperature eventually goes up provided you don't stay in there get hypothermic of course okay people are always asking me I have a good friend um who uh just so happens to be straight edged he's like never never even has sip of caffeine I I don't know it's a good thing because he's extreme and I he got a cold plunge and he went in for a minute and then the next day he's like I did three minutes and then pretty soon he's like hey Al I got a I got a sick I was like what do you do he's like I got naked in the cold plunge for 45 minutes I was like well listen you know I'm like first of all thank goodness you don't do drugs and second of all like Easy Does It Easy Does It that the cold cold is a very powerful stimulus as is heat so you know you you know minimal effective dose you know you could have some fun with it but don't go wild I I still don't know why you got in there naked but who knows if we expose ourselves to the same stress over and over again do we release the same amount of adrenaline and its positive negative impact and just becomes less receptive do we release less adrenaline and hence it's less harmful it's a great question depends on the context typically you'd release less and less adrenaline and actually this relates to a really important fact about the the ever famous structure of the amydala which means almond I don't know why I told you that the um happens to be shaped like an almond the amydala um people associated with threat detection in danger but it's actually a novelty detector essentially and it's involved with a bunch of other brain circuits that anytime we experience something novel you know uh we have a elevated level of autonomic arousal like earlier tonight before the show there was a kind of a repeating and the first time I happened I'm like fire alarm like what's going on by the time it happened five times I was kind of like so that's sort if we I'd be willing to bet both amigdalas that had we recorded from my amigdalas he got one on each side of the brain you would find that that the first time was a big increase in activity lesser second third fourth fifth and you attenuate you habituate so if if the stressor is one in which you don't care it doesn't have much relevance to you like that alarm um probably less and less adrenaline I'd be willing to bet however if with each subsequent exposure like somebody you really can't stand or something like that it's decreasing your life satisfaction and increasing your level of cognitive or psychological stress then it would go in the opposite direction I think that's that's fair to say hey hey Andrew I like that I like that I like hey that's cool yeah the other day it was really interesting every once in a while someone walk up and be like hey listen to the podcast which is always nice it's always nice to meet people and this kid walks up to me this was in Melbourne in the in the gym like this has never happened to me before it was really cool he just walks up he goes hey Andrew I'm like cool like he just said that's it and he just walked away I was like right like I like cool and I was like that kid is so mellow it was really cool like I was like we would have been friends actually friends with all the wild ones but it was a really interesting phenotype again human phenotypes fascinate me so if we run into each other on the street and I ask your name and we talk I'm genuinely interested I'm not studying you I'm not taking notes or data but people are so different but hey Andrew okay so maybe it's him hey Andrew hey aie I found that I'm able to focus far better when I bounce my legs up and down while sitting on the balls of my feet what's going on you got a lot of energy that's what's going on no I think you know um there isn't a ton of science on this but it's very clear as I mentioned earlier that people have different um spontaneous movement rates and some people people you know some people are a little bit more jittery um if you look if you go into a uh a classroom of young children see them sitting around boys and girls let's say somewhere between 4 and 6 often times you'll notice that some of the kids can sit extremely still and then some of the kids are like really like and there is a chromosomal difference there the boy it's known that that boys have a slower development of the so-call top down inhibition from the forbrain that the prefrontal cortex which frankly we hear about over and over again many podcasts a lot of description of prefrontal Cortex its main job the best description I've ever heard of it anyway is from a friend who's a neurosurgeon at neurolink who came up through my lab Matt McDougall he's been on the podcast he the the job of the prefrontal cortex is to send connections to the rest of the brain and say basically to the appropriate circuit so it's that's why people of the pre with damage to the prefrontal cortex for any reason or degeneration of the prefrontal cortex find themselves doing things or we find them doing things that are a little bit context inappropriate and in some cases dramatically inappropriate but in most cases just kind of context inappropriate they don't suppress Behavior very well so you know it may be that a certain level of autonomic arousal brings us into that optimal you know some people call it a flow State a flow state is a little bit of a nebulous thing I mean I have great respect for Steven Cotler and those that have talked about and written about flow but what I really can just say about flow as it relates to Neuroscience is that like backwards that spells wolf like we don't really know that much more about like the neural basis of a flow state but for each of us we have these kind of tunnels that we like to be in um where we find that our level of focus and action is just right and so I I I don't think I'm going too far out on a limb here how you by saying that if you if you find that you focus best when you can dispel a little bit of that um energy by moving your body that you're able to do your your best work that makes sense to me I I don't do them so much anymore but for years I would do you know surgeries lots and lots of surgeries down the microscope dissecting retinas dissecting retinas like if you got an eyeball I can dissect it I'm good at it um I can do them in my sleep and I would find that if I had a little bit too much energy that the forceps would jiggle a little bit and it wasn't a caffeine thing and a friend of mine who's a worldclass neurosurgeon Eddie Chang is chair neurosurgery at UCSF he's been on the podcast he said ah there's a solution to that that we learn in neurosurgery they're like the astronauts of medicine he said you know you tap your foot I thought oh that's kind of cool why would that work he said well basically you've got some sort of anticipatory activity in an area of the brain called the basil ganglia which is involved in these go noo type actions like all of our actions are yes go and noo don't do something else so flexor extensor this all kind of stuff very complicated but seamless for most most people and when you have a bit too much anticipatory activity you're getting ready to go like a like a sprinter out the blocks and you're you know you're doing something that's very important like a brain surgery in his case or you know microsurgery in my case for research purposes that if you your activation state is too high that you can dispel some of that energy by just simply tapping your foot or doing some sort of rhythmic activity with another part of your body appropriate to that context of course okay last question don't know hey Andrew yeah oh oh they skipped that one I guess that's the new thing I'll never forget when I got my lab for the first time you know I came up in an era when it was still pretty formal Neuroscience you like you'd say hey professor so and so and then they say you can call me Barbara and I'm like hey Barbara but before that no one you know need hey or that and I'll never forget that in my lab one my first graduate student who's now a professor he's very very talented scientist at the University of Utah and I got a text from him that just said she called me Andy she said hey Andy when are you going to buy us an espresso maker it was like the second day and I was like whoa times have changed so I think it's good I think the lack of formality is actually good at first I was like wait a second I waited my whole life to become a professor and now it's hey Andy but I think you know W with with the years I've realized that it's it's actually kind of nice I'm 17 years old congratulations man I wish I you didn't want to know me when I well I was a nice kid but I was just had a lot of confusion I'm 17 years old so you're in a psychedelic experience of Youth what is your biggest advice on finding your passion oh well goodness gracious I think you you know I if I'm honest I I think we talked about a little bit earlier I think your passion is rooted in a feeling state that you've already accessed hopefully many times but at least one time earlier in your life when for whatever reason or circumstances you weren't thinking about what your parents wanted you to do what was cool or not cool in school you were in a pure feeling state of yum that's really cool behold and so I can't answer the question for you but I'll tell you yes continue to forage I do believe that learning is among the most wonderful things that we can do for ourselves but that if you spend some time in your memory banks that you'll be able to remember a feeling and maybe the feeling was about a board game you played or or something you observed or maybe it just came about through some other activity and the feeling is unrelated to the activity that's where it gets a little tricky and we're answering this question for a 17-year-old but it's true for all of us this is where it gets a little trick is that sometimes we think it's the activity but it's not the activity I mean Lord knows I stay out of the Aquarius stores these days you know because if I go near one it's all over no it's it's that it's the it's the Delight in something that is very personal in fact I think is very unique to you to the extent that and I do believe this that it's not capable of being created by anybody else and that feedback from other people about what we should do or what we're good at while it can be useful it's merely a calibration point for saying like someone says maybe you should do this and you go or like me or like yuck those are all just calibration points on this like Compass to take you back to that feeling state so I apologize for not having a more concrete mechanistic works the first time works every time uh kind of you know instant tool like a physiological sigh rather this this is going to have to be some self- exloration but the good news is you're 17 your brain's still plastic the good news is all of us are capable of neurop plasticy throughout the lifespan and the good news is all of us are capable of introspection throughout the lifespan so even if you can't remember you can sense and if you can sense what you're doing is you're feeling what what is this I don't want to turn this into a neuroscience lesson but I'd be remiss if I didn't say that you're perceiving and feeling on the basis of converting physical information in your environment sound waves photons mechanical pressure chemicals going in through your nose and mouth you're converting that into electrical and chemical signals that's what being and perceiving it really is it can't be anything else so there's something about the way that you're wired Oscar that is different and leads you to say yum yeah yeah yeah yeah that that that and for me I've always associated with a certain physical sensation in this arm don't ask me why I don't even know and if you can sense into what it is that gets you going in that direction if any and all of us do that then I really believe you can sense into your unique gifts or maybe you just need to sit back and think in deliberate complete sentences for an hour like Rick or one of those other Geniuses I don't have a better answer that's the best I can do thanks so much yeah thank you than you so much thank you thanks so much thank you thank you thank you so much so just as a as a final um note this evening I just want to thank everyone for coming out as Rob mentioned to you know come out as far as I know there's no alcohol here people are here amazing um an event with no alcohol on a Saturday night in this beautiful Sydney summer and where we talk science um thanks for letting me tell some stories learn some stories my my real wish my deep wish is that everyone do some level of introspection if not tonight in going forward and um I so appreciate that people are interested in the concepts around science and health and and the the real big big Wish For Me Maybe I'll even just call it an ask is that I truly don't develop the protocols I I I mind them occasionally I develop them but I mine them from the the rich sources of you know information in papers and and elsewhere and um put them into a format that I'm I'm deeply appreciative people uh enjoy digesting and hopefully apply but hopefully share and I certainly don't need attribution none of them are named after me intentionally because um that's not going to give any information about what they do or how they work and last but certainly not least thank you for your interest in science thank you to the Sydney Opera House trust for their hospitality and for making this event possible and last but certainly not least thank you for your interest in science [Music]

Title: Dr. Matt Walker: How to Structure Your Sleep, Use Naps & Time Caffeine | Huberman Lab Guest Series
Published: 2024-04-17 12:00:07 UTC
Description:
This is episode 3 of a 6-part special series on sleep with Dr. Matthew Walker, Ph.D., a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and leading public educator about the role of sleep in health, disease and performance. 

We explain how our sleep architecture changes as we age. We also cover how childhood development and aging affect sleep biology and needs. We also discuss whether polyphasic sleep (multiple short sleep periods) is beneficial. 

Then, we discuss naps, including their positive benefits, individual variability, those who should not nap, and alternative rest states like non-sleep deep rest. Dr. Walker shares protocols to optimize nap duration, timing and effectiveness.

We also explore the effects of caffeine on sleep and other health aspects, as well as the optimal timing for caffeine intake.

This episode describes many actionable science-based tools for optimizing sleep, naps and caffeine use for better health and performance.

The next episode in this special series explores the relationship between sleep, memory, and creativity.

[Music] welcome to the hubman lab guest Series where I and an expert guest discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today March the 3D episode in our sixth episode series all about sleep with expert guest Dr Matthew Walker during today's episode we discuss how to structure your sleep for optimal mental health physical health and performance we discuss monophasic sleep schedules which are the more typical sleep schedule where you go to sleep at night and then wake up in the morning so sleeping in one bout as opposed to polyphasic sleep schedules which are when you sleep in two or more bouts either at night or perhaps a shorter bout of sleep at night and another bout of sleep during the day we also discuss naps including how to nap how long your nap should be whether or not naps are good or bad in particular whether or not they're good or bad for you it turns out this varies according to individual we also discuss how your needs for sleep and naps vary across the lifespan and we discuss body position during sleep which might seem excessively detailed but it turns out that body position during sleep is critical for ensuring that the sleep you get is optimally restorative as with the first two episodes of this six episode series today's third episode is filled with both science that is the biology of sleep and napping and body position and how those relate to one another as well as practical tools that you can use to vastly improve your sleep before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is betterhelp betterhelp offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out online now I've been doing therapy for well over 30 years initially I had to do therapy against my will but of course I continued to do it voluntarily over time because I really believe that doing regular therapy with a quality therapist is one of the best things that we can do for our mental health indeed for many people it's as beneficial as getting regular physical exercise the great thing about better help is that it makes it very easy to find a therapist that's optimal for your needs and I think it's fair to say that we can define a great therapist as somebody with whom you have excellent Rapport somebody with whom you can talk about a variety of different issues and who can provide you not just support but also insight and with better help they make it extremely conven vent so that it's matched to your schedule and other aspects of your life if you'd like to try betterhelp you can go to betterhelp.com

you don't that means plenty of the electrolytes magnesium potassium and sodium and no sugar as I mentioned before on this podcast I'm a big fan of salt now I want to be clear people who already consume a lot of salt or who have high blood pressure or who happen to consume a lot of processed foods that typically contain salt need to control their salt intake however if you're somebody who eats pretty clean and you're somebody who exercises and you're drinking a lot of water there's a decent chance that you could benefit from ingesting more electrolytes with your liquids the reason for that is that all the cells in our body including the nerve cells the neurons require the electrolytes in order to function properly so we don't just want to be hydrated we want to be hydrated with proper electrolyte levels with element that's very easy to do what I do is when I wake up in the morning I consume about 16 to 32 ounces of water and I'll dissolve a packet of element in that water I'll also do the same when I exercise especially if it's on a hot day and I'm sweating a lot and sometimes I'll even have a third element packet dissolved in water if I'm exercising really hard or sweating a lot or if I just noticed that I'm not consuming enough salt with my food if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element spelled LM nt.com huberman to claim a free element sample

scripts for Yoga Nidra and non-sleep deep rest or nsdr protocols by now there is an abundance of data showing that even short daily meditations can greatly improve our mood reduce anxiety improve our ability to focus and can improve our memory and while there are many different forms of meditation most people find it difficult to find and stick to a meditation practice in a way that is most beneficial for them the waking up app makes it extremely easy to learn how to meditate and to carry out your daily meditation practice in a way that's going to be most effective and efficient for you it includes a variety of different types of meditations of different duration as well as things like Yoga Nidra which place the brain and body into a sort of pseudo sleep that allows you to emerge feeling incredibly mentally refreshed in fact the science around Yoga Nidra is really impressive showing that after a yoga needra session levels of dopamine in certain areas of the brain are enhanced by up to 60% which places the brain and body into a state of enhanced Readiness for mental work and for physical work another thing I really like about the waking up app is that it provides a 30-day introduction course so for those of you that have not meditated before or getting back to a meditation practice that's fantastic or if you're somebody who's already a skilled and regular meditator waking up has more advanced meditations and yoga needer sessions for you as well if you'd like to try The Waking Up app you can go to waking up.com huberman and access a free 30-day trial again that's waking up.com huberman and now for my conversation with Dr Matthew Walker Dr Walker welcome back Dr huberman an absolute pleasure let's talk about the different types of sleep because I think most people think of sleep as just one thing most people sleep at night some people also nap a topic we'll also discuss today but turns out there are a lot of different different types of sleep what are the different types of sleep and what do they do for us and um I guess everyone's probably wondering already I certainly am what types of sleep are we already engaging in meaning am I involved in or having multiple types of sleep each night this is a fascinating question and it comes back to something we've discussed in a previous episode the different stages of sleep and how they unfold we've described that fascinating stuff what you're already asking though is is an incredibly sort of subtle but relevant question how should I be sleeping in terms of the phases of sleep should I have one phase should I have two phases of sleep or should I have many phases of sleep in some ways you can answer that question on the basis of the lifespan because how it is that we sleep in terms of those chunking sessions changes as we develop to be clear in nomenclature I'm saying monophasic basic polyphasic unpack that monophasic obviously just simply means a single phase monophasic when you say phase you mean one bout of sleep correct so that would be within a 24-hour period you are having a single bout of sleep basic then means that within that 24-hour phase you are having two bouts of sleep and we'll speak about how those bouts are split up are they split up between two halves in the middle of the night or are they split up in terms of longer at night Siesta like nap in the afternoon and then we can speak about polyphasic sleep polyphasic sleep we in sleep science have been using for many years in the context of infancy because there as any new parents will know infants do not just simply have a nice single bout of sleep they're up they're down they're up they're down and have many bouts of sleep within that 24-hour period and that's polyphasic sleep the other term or the other application of that term polyphasic sleep has been used more so in the sort of interesting biohacker movement and we can we'll come back to that perhaps later on so how do these different phases of sleep change across the lifespan well we've already said that when you're an infant and you're first born within the first year of life you are incredibly poly phasic and you are probably going through wake sleep phases every 2 hours why do you do that why can't you just simply be born and sleep in a monophasic way it's for at least two reasons first an infant needs to feed every two hours so their energy needs and their food intake requirements dictate that you can't sleep for very long because you need to be awake to feed and then you go back to sleep Within probably the first six months things will start to to change a little bit but the second reason that you are highly polyphasic when you are first born is because your super chiasmatic nucleus and in another episode we spoke about this Central master 24-hour clock that beats out your Cadian Rhythm the rise and the fall the wake and the sleep that has not yet developed it hasn't been glued into place into the brain this 24-hour clock so the infant seemingly knows nothing about when it's light or when it's dark outside that just awake or sleep awake a sleeve so that's the second reason energy feeding needs is the first and then an absence of yet a fully developed 24-hour clock in the brain to beat out that beautiful dictated Rhythm by about age one that number of phases of sleep are starting to decrease but it's still highly polyphasic it's not not until you get to probably age two or three that now you're starting to see this consolidation of sleep what do I mean by that sleep is now happening more dominantly in the night phase of the 24-hour cycle and there a few abouts of sleep during the daytime then perhaps by the time you're in kindergarten you may be down to just two sleeps so now we've switched from polyphasic sleep as infants to basic sleep as kindergarten could you describe that it was basic patterns I recall in kindergarten um having nap time in the afternoon yeah they put out these little mats and every every kid would just kind like roll up it's actually sounds really nice it's one you know wouldn't and we'll speak about how some adults do this too but almost every kindergarten system that I've inquired about around the world different nations they all have this nap time and Any teacher will tell you if one of those children does not nap during that period of time they are the Loose Canon they are the live wire and in subsequent episodes we'll speak about exactly how sleep harnesses and improves our emotional and mental health and how it falls apart when we don't so that that's how it certainly is emerging biologically and that's how we as a society respect that and accommodate that and then probably by the age of starting school so sort of five or six now we're starting to see fully monophasic sleep children sleeping long bouts at night and then being able to sustain wakefulness during the day at that point you have locked in your monophasic pattern and that will continue throughout adulthood and into old age with a few caveats that we'll speak about so that's how sleep sleep unfolds in the monophasic biphasic polyphasic sleep across the lifespan it doesn't quite tell you however how those different stages of sleep change across the lifespan so I've shown you the view of sleep across the lifespan through one lens of the microscope if we click down one lens and focus more deeply on the different stages of sleep there we see a fascinating story in uo for the most part you are in a sleep likee State as a fetus once you get to a certain point of development in utero that sleep-like state seems to be more so something that looks like REM sleep now it's not fully fledged full fat REM sleep yet but it seems to be something very much like REM sleep I say this because in the first episode I told you as we go into REM sleep and we start to as adults dream the brain paralyzes the body so that the mind can dream safely those kicks and those punches and those elbows that uh a mother will feel from the fetus seem to be during this dream state often and I don't want to shatter any illusions of you start singing or you're cing and you get these bumps and these elbows and these legs kicking and it's beautiful it is beautiful but it turns out that it's probably the REM sleep state but the muscle sort of paralysis has not yet developed so you're getting these electrical burst this frenetic activity of REM sleep that we described but you're not getting any of the blockade of the motor output and so it expresses itself as these kicks and these bumps and then during the first six months of life and at that point in the first 6 months those infants are sleeping anywhere between 14 to 17 hours a day that's it's immense isn't it I mean it's right up there if you look across the across philogyny and you ask which is by the way a fascinating Topic at some point we should do a a separate podcast on sleep across different species because I know like me you love you know the whole variety of sweet but you've got elephants who will sleep as little as 4 hours and then you've got the little brown bat who is the rock star of sleep and it will sleep sleep almost 17 to 18 hours a day it nudges out the sloth in that sense wow can I ask you a question about that little brown P yeah does it sleep hanging upside down does so it can't have sleep paralysis in its little claws so it it will it will not have that paralysis but it goes through the stages of sleep very quickly and this happens with birds as well so birds that flock on a branch they will sleep and they sleep in some fascinating ways what some sometimes with one half of the brain sometimes with both halves but then you say well if I'm on a branch and there's this wonderful Force called gravity underneath me and I go into REM sleep and I have that muscle paralysis which they do how does that work well they only have very brief REM sleep periods that last just for a few seconds and then they regain their muscle tone got it couldn't couldn't help but ask it's genius the Flora and the fauna I especially that the fauna um enchant me that much so I don't want to draw us off course but now we know that they they can that's why the bats don't fall that's why the birds Don't Fall correct um so when you are then as an infant sleeping 14 to 17 hours what's happening with those different stages of sleep non-rem and REM at that point we can't really Define and separate the different stages of non-r because it's not yet fully formed but we have what looks like a REM sleep active State and a a deep non-rem sleep passive state almost 50% of the time that an infant a newborn is asleep is spent in REM sleep why do I say that with some kind of wonder in my voice because as adults we're perhaps down to maybe 20% of our time spent asleep is in REM sleep but 50% of the time when an infant is asleep they are in rem why would this be the case and across all species that have REM and non-rem the time when we see REM sleep in highest volume amount is always after birth there is something special about REM sleep and its function during that early period and we now start to understand why when you are first born you are still going through a huge amount of brain maturation and the recipe for the day there unlike when we are teenagers is exploding the brain with synapses all of these connections throughout the brain what we've discovered is that REM sleep acts as an electrical fertilizer to stimulate the growth of these connections within the brain it's almost as though you could think about an internet service provider with this huge new neighborhood and the first call of business is to go in and wire up each one of those homes with these Fiber Optic Cables that's what REM sleep is doing and if you start to deprive and these were studies gosh done many years ago by Howard rthor and others if you deprive animals of REM sleep you stunt the developmental growth of the brain and presumably the whole animal and the yeah as a consequence I mean if you look at its social behavior even just that it's profoundly abnormal because you don't have that REM sleep developed brain I mention this not because there is any causal evidence but we have seen REM sleep deep impairments in certain developmental disorders such as autism as well as ADHD I don't think there is any supportive evidence yet to come out with a claim that part of the trajectory underlying those conditions is abnormalities of REM sleep but I it's a very active area of research so it's a fascinating time though during infancy when you get these huge amounts of REM sleep why because of what we call synaptogenesis is which is simply the creation of sinapsis Genesis then as you move from 6 months across the next 18 months something odd happens Total Sleep time starts to decrease REM sleep starts to decrease but non-rem sleep actually increases even though Total Sleep time is decreasing and there's a strange peak in lighter stage nonrem what we call stage two nonr and those sleep spindles that I was describing in the first episode These bursts of electrical activity we will speak about the role of those sleep spindles in improving motor skill learning and we've done a many many years of work in this area why is that relevant to this phase of life that's right around the time when infants start to coordinate their limbs in a skilled way and begin to walk and we believe that it is part of the process of the development of the motor system enabling walking to begin amazing so then things will change further sleep time continues to decrease and by about age five or six now the cocktail blend of nonrem and REM is down to a stable ratio that will remain throughout the lifespan which is a 4:1 ratio so about 20% of the time that you're asleep will be REM sleep and the remaining time time will be 80% of that time will be non-rem sleeping provided one is getting sufficient total amounts of sleep correct and getting it at the right moments in time that we described in the first episode getting that sort of that appropriate chronotype match to the 24-hour clock that will certainly alter those things too so that's how sleep unfolds both at the first level of the lens monophasic basic polyphasic and then double clicking how the different stages of sleep unfold and what the reasons are behind that I then said once we're adults we become monophasic yes to a degree but there is some contention about the way that we sleep in modernity that we may not be sleeping in the way that we were designed to sleep which brings us back to basic sleep in the first episode we spoke about this strange after afternoon dip in our alertness that happens called the postprandial dip and it happens somewhere between the 1 to 4:00 p.m. region and it's measurable and it seems to be biologically wired into us if you look at certain cultures that are not touched by modernity so we and others have studied studied hunter gatherer tribes they don't quite sleep the way that we do and they don't sleep the way that we do for at least two reasons the first is that they will often have a siesta like pattern of behavior where especially in the hot dry season they will take a nap in the afternoon in the wet cooler season that may not be the case but they certainly have more of a basic pattern where they'll sleep longer at night and then have a short nap Siesta like and then of course there are Latin and Mediterranean cultures and they have this practice of the Siesta like Behavior coming back to the hunter gather tribes the way that they also do not sleep in a similar manner to that which we do is the timing of sleep they don't go to sleep as the sun goes down they will usually on average as a group they will usually go to sleep about 2 hours after Sundown and then they will wake up not with the rising of the sun they wake up just before that and you think how are they predictive of the light no the thing that changes first before the sun truly Rises is temperature and temperature is a very strong predictor that forces them awake so when you think about how they're sleeping then consider the term midnight most of us never really think about what the term means midnight refers to the fact that it is the middle of the night but for most of us in the modern world that's the time when we're thinking about sending our last email or posting to social media midnight is no longer midnight for society but it is for them so should we be thinking about midnight as the middle of the night in the context of the uh extreme early person morning person who you know presumably likes to go to bed around 8:00 P.M wake up around 4:00 a.m. most people hear 4:00 a.m. and they go oh goodness you know that's early sort of um you know like the the mighty Joo willink is is uh famous for posting images of his of his uh digital watch usually I think it's 4:30 a.m. wake up and that's when he starts his workout so his Twitter and I guess they call X now feed and and Instagram is a replete with images of his watch 4:30 and people think goodness that's early right but he was a guest on this podcast spoken to him before but he goes to bed pretty early that's right most nights so in some sense you know midnight for him or for somebody with a similar schedule is truly middle of the night that's right right but for the other chronotypes for people that uh prefer to go to sleep or who naturally um get sleepy around 10 or 11 p.m. or even later um how should they think about this biphasic polyphasic business because um at at some level um we all have to reconcile uh our sleep schedule with the with the demands of work and family and so on that's right so I was very specific when I said the hunter gather of tribes on average that's the way that they will sleep but like the rest of society there's a huge distribution and there will be some proportion of them who are a little bit like Joo who will be on the early side of that on the very early side of that but then there are other people who are clear night owls and they may not be going to bed until you know 10: or 11: and waking up later so there is a distribution there you don't have to worry that my statement of midnight on average that does seem to be when we are dislocated from all of the trappings of modernity how a group of Representative humans on average will sleep but there is huge as I said differences from one individual to the next by the way you can ask the question why do we have these things called chronotypes why is there such variability in how people have a preference for when they sleep wouldn't it just be easier if biology designed us all to be asleep at the same time not so we mentioned in the first episode that sleep is truly idiotic in the sense that you know you're not protecting yourself or the people that you care about and if everyone slept at the same moment in time you as a collective and as an individual would be vulnerable for an 8 hour period 7 to n hour period but by way of this wonderful injection of variability as to preferences for when people sleep maybe there are some people who are going to bed at 8:00 p.m. and there are other people and they're waking up at 4: a.m. there are other people who go to bed at midnight and wake up at 8:00 a.m. so then think about that at some point what you've done is that there will always be someone or collection of people awake until midnight and then will always be a collection of people who are awake starting at 4:00 a.m. so as an individual everyone gets their 8-hour opportunity but as a collective as a clan you are you've reduced your vulnerability down by 50% because Mother Nature injected the variability by way of genetics of chronotype to distribute that and lessen the burden does that make any sense it does and it reminds me of how the Circadian rhythm which we discussed in episode one is about 24 hours not exactly 24 hours the rhythm of the supermatic nucleus neurons that generate the Circadian rhythm as I recall uh is rarely exactly 24 hours it's 24.2 or 24.4 and the idea in mind the just so story uh is that that variation allows for entrainment matching to the outside light dark cycle which changes across the year so you don't want it rigidly 24 hours because if there's any variation in light dark which of course there is you know even at the equator across the year there's subtle variations but certainly As you move away from the equator and so these these uh variations in you know your circadian rhythm uh clock scn supermatic nucleus might be 24.2 mine might be 24.6 24 someone else 24.1 and in that sense um allows some uh malleability to to matching the Circadian rhythm to outside light dark rhythms is that is that a a decent parallel for what we're talking about it's a beautiful demonstration that there is always some it's almost wiggle room in how biology is programmed because some degree of sort of noise almost sarcastic noise can be very beneficial and it's much more predictive of the way in which the world works and it's much more adaptive for a species to enact and to embrace that kind of variability and yours was a beautiful example that it's about 24 hours but it's certainly responsive to changes in light duration across the year and it has to be because we need to buckle ourselves to the light dark cycle for optimal survival and here is another demonstration of where it's not about the Cadian Rhythm but it's about the chronotype distribution not within an individual across the year but across individuals at any one moment in time and that variability once again provides a biological benefit in the first episode and again now you're discussing chronotypes and one one thing that I've been meaning to ask is you said that chronotype is genetically determined but that necessarily mean it is directly inherited from Mom Andor dad meaning if your parents are both extreme early morning types will you grow up to be an extreme early morning type you already established that during infancy and development uh adolescence Etc that our chronotype is somewhat masked by some of the developmental uh um uh Necessities um but once we reach young adulthood and and our chronotype has been established uh can we look to our parents to determine whether or not we are more likely to be in morning person or or late shifted it's very unlikely to find find anyone whose parents were both extreme morning types who is a neutral or an evening type and vice versa so my guess is that people with if they know of their biological parents and they know of their rhythms it's highly likely that you will at some point acquas in your lifetime to being very similar to them now there are certain life conditions and contexts where you can you know fight that um if you're really into you know if you're someone who is in punk rock band and you're touring all the time even though your mom and dad may be morning types and you may be a morning type you're on the road you're playing gigs there's no chance but at some point let's say you retire and you give yourself the opportunity to express your natural Rhythm you will go back to that so yes it's highly genetic it's not enre highly genetic there is some degree of modification that happens on the basis of context and I've just given you a good example of context and also your exposure to light you can be someone who is let's say a neutral like me but if you're constantly invaded by Electric Light at night you're drinking too much caffeine and you're on your laptop and your computer and your phone and you're always activated by social media it's very easy for someone like me to drift and become a 1 a.m. to you know 9 a.m. person that's not my natural type but context and the environment have shifted me but for the most part yes to your question I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens and is designed to meet all of your foundational nutritional needs by now I'm sure you've all heard me say that I've been taking ag1 since 201 12 and indeed that is true now of course I do consume regular Whole Foods every day I strive to get those Foods mostly from unprocessed or minimally processed sources however I do find it hard to get enough servings of fruits and vegetables each day so with ag1 I ensure that I get enough of the vitamins minerals Prebiotic fiber and other things typically found in fruits or vegetables and of course I still make sure to eat fruits and vegetables and in that way provide a sort of insurance that I'm getting enough of what I need in addition the adaptogens and other micro nutrients in ag1 really help buffer against stress and ensure that the cells and organs and tissues of my body are getting the things they need people often ask me that if they were going to take Just One supplement what that supplement should be and I always answer ag1 if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer you'll get five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman okay so getting back to these different uh phase opportunities for Sleep uh clearly I'm getting the language wrong here but vacular monophasic basic and polyphasic um could you give us a few more examples of different types of biphasic and polyphasic sleep so coming back to basic sleep I describe one version once we are adults which is the Siesta like notion one long bout at night short bout during the day and that bout during the day is usually matching that drop in alertness that we described it sort of hits that sweet spot right there and it's quite easy for some people to fall asleep in a period between somewhere between one and four 1 to four yeah and I know it's a large window but that just allows us to sort of know okay if you're someone like yourself who's a morning type you would probably start to want to nap a little bit earli or if you were basic someone like me a neutral probably an hour and a half two hours later still but there is a different version of basic sleep for adults that has been described in the literature and it's fascinating but I don't think it's biological it's the notion that some people will have heard called first sleep second sleep and now you are splitting your sleep into two phases but they're split across the night so the idea is that you fall asleep and you'll maybe have 4ish hours and then you wake up and you then are awake for several hours and then you go back to sleep for another 3 or 4 hours if you look in history and the the record of of human history it's very clear that there were some cultures doing this particularly if you look at some of the European cultures Great Britain in particular there is good evidence that somewhere between about the 15th to 19th century seems to have ended during the kind of dezian era people were describing this behavior and they would wake up in the middle of the night after about 4 hours they would make food they would play music they would write they would make love it was a real thing and I'm not suggesting that it did not happen it clearly did and there's a there a great book that outlines this but is it the way that we were designed to sleep bif phasically versus the Siesta like and I don't think it is there is no good collection of evidence if you look at the biology of our human rhythms that argues that there is this magical period of a huge spike in Arcadian Rhythm that happens right in the middle of the night that should force us awake there is one paper that's often cited for this and in truth that paper if you read it says nothing about first sleep second sleep doesn't speak about basic sleep at all and that paper I think is unfairly used as a justification of first sleep and second sleep and the paper to me has at least three problem it's a great paper there's no no problem with the paper and its hypothesis but its use as justification for first sleep second sleep has three problems the first is the artificial nature of the study they weren't designing it to test the hypothesis but they had individuals in bed for 14 hours relative to a standard 8 hour period and sure enough what they found was that when you force people night after night to be in bed for 14 hours somewhere after about 6 or 7 hours they wake up and then you can't get out of bed in the study so you just lie awake and then at some point I don't know if it's through boredom or you drift back off into sleep and that was argued as a clear demonstration of this split sleep but as I said they're awake usually for about six and a half seven hours also there was no magical Awakening period it's a probability distribution and what that means is if you look at the data it's just more likely that people will wake up after about 6 or seven hours and they're more likely that they will go back down into sleep it wasn't as though the whole experiment demonstrated a very clear termination of sleep that everyone had at that moment in time so that's the first issue um and the second issue which is first issue it's kind of an abnormal thing 14 hours forced in bed the second is it wasn't a clear separation it's just simply higher probability the final issue is that it was a study done in only seven individuals healthy males and so I have yet to see it you know scaled up did it happen first sleep second sleep yes it did is there any strong evidence that that's how we naturally were designed and have evolved to sleep I in truth I don't think so at least I don't see good evidence right now supporting that but remain open to it in episode one we talked a little bit about body position during sleep uh and how different uh degrees of uh incline or decline might impact uh some of the features of sleep and I can't help but ask now as you uh described this basic pattern for people that were essentially experimentally restricted to to the bed um is there something about being horizontal that makes us sleepy there is and it's perhaps not for the reasons that you would think which is okay I'm just pre-programmed when I lie down and my head hits the pillow it turns out that it seems to be temperature that when your body is recumbent lying flat horizontal the distribution of how your body is able to move blood around the different regions and decrease your core body temperature meaning it can push blood warm blood out of the core of your body to these surface areas and when you push it out to the surface areas you release that heat it's this huge thermal dissipation that happens when we move Blood Out Of The Core to the surface you emit that heat and your core body temperature plummets when your body temperature your core body temperature decreases you have a higher likelihood of sleepiness in fact it's very difficult for you to fall asleep if your core body temperature does not drop and by lying down the body's what we call vasoactive ability to distribute that blood in a way that is permissive for thermal dissipation of core body temperature is superior and that's the reason why we find it easier to fall asleep lying down than let's say semi-recumbent or certainly propped all the way up and it's probably the reason naturally we evolve just to lie down on the floor very interesting maybe now is a good time to talk about basic sleep in the context of a about of sleep at night and the afternoon nap you've mentioned this postp parial dip that most people experience between 1: and 400 p.m. that many people try and combat with caffeine we will also talk about Caffe uh this episode um such an interesting substance and I think the most commonly used drug it is a drug after all worldwide I think more than 90% of adults worldwide consume caffeine on a daily basis that's correct and I believe it is after oil it may be perhaps the second or at least the third most traded commodity on this planet and it is what we call a psychoactive stimulant is a stimulant and it's probably one of the only stimulants that we will readily give to our children and you know not be too concerned about it we'll get to caffeine in depth uh a little bit later in this episode but I can't help but uh just mention that someone I think it was Michael Polland said that you know caffeine is one of the few drugs that almost everybody takes just to quote unquote feel normal yeah exactly you know it's sort of I think sometimes you know sleep deprivation is is simply just the absence of of caffeine and um so it's a very interesting chemical which I have in truth changed my mind on and I'm happy to speak about why I've changed my mind but also some God rails too well we'll we'll go there meanwhile I'll take a sip of my uh Triple Espresso here as we discuss as we discuss naps are naps good for us should we nap what if we don't like naps why do we wake up from naps groggy sometimes and other times we feel refreshed tell us about napping naps are both good and bad depending on the situation naps can be a double-edged sword in other words we and others have done lots of studies on naps and the benefits are fascinating and St I'll tell you about one study we did we had participants assigned to one of two groups and at midday they all learned a whole list of new facts so it was a study about learning in memory and then one group took a 90-minute sleep opportunity sort of focused right around that drop in alertness the other just remained awake lying on a bed and they just watched a nature documentary and then 5 hours later we had them do another learning session and so they've woken up after the 90-minute nap they've got through that sort of initial lull that we'll discuss what that is after you wake up everyone's now back to operating temperature so in other words I've had you try to cram in a whole list of facts at midday and then a whole list of facts new facts again at 5 p.m. and I can ask what is the learning capacity of your brain at midday and at 5:00 p.m. and is there any difference in your learning ability when you have had a nap in between versus not and sure enough what happened in the group that did not nap their learning capacity gradually declined across the day the nap group they were able to sustain their learning and in fact if anything improve it and the difference between those two groups at 5:00 p.m. was about 20% so that's certainly non-trivial in terms of if you to say you know here's a new compound that can boost your learning capacity by 20% would you take it I suspect it would probably make some money so that's a demonstration of for learning in memory we did another study very much like that in terms of its design but we looked at your emotional brain and we were showing people different types of emotional expressions and having them rate them and we did that firstly before an appp and then after a na versus um that same time in sort of midday versus 5:00 p.m. and another group did not nap and sure enough the group that did not nap by about 5:00 p.m. they were starting to rate fearful faces and angry faces as much more fearful and much more angry but if you looked at the group that napped it was different they actually lessened the response to fear and they blunted the normal increase in Anger sensitivity across the day and the nap seemed to boost how positively you rated happy faces so a nap there had the ability to reset the magnetic north of your emotional compass and there was a beneficial almost added Rose tint to your world viw glasses after You' napped what was also interesting in those two studies two different types of sleep were transacting those benefits in the nap group that was doing the learning the learning benefit that they got wasn't just about them napping and sleeping it was about them having these sleep spindles the more of those sleep spindles that you had the greater the restoration of your learning capacity when you wake up for the emotional recalibration that I described in the nap that had nothing to do with sleep spindles or even non-rem sleep it required REM sleep to produce that benefit so there are certainly many benefits and we've look downstairs in the body blood pressure cardiovascular measures immune Health they all seem to benefit so at that point everyone may be thinking of course this sounds good not to mention the basics which is your attention your concentration your focus and your energy all improve by way of naps even your decision- making you said decision making yeah even your decision-making is improved so your capacity to make the correct decisional outcomes based on this weight of evidence that you're facing that's also improved so almost all areas of cognition that we've looked at and many areas of your emotional and mood Health we've looked at seem to benefit by way of a nap at that point you're thinking so then what's the problem the problem is that when you nap you release some of that sleep pressure that's been building up so in the first episode we spoke about a chemical called adenosine and the longer that you're awake the more adenosine that builds up the more adenosine that builds up the sleepy you will feel and after about 16 hours of being awake you should have lots of healthy sleepiness of adenosine in your brain to put you asleep and keep you asleep and when we sleep we are able to clear that adenosine from the brain so we wake up after 7 to 9 hours and if it's been good quality sleep we're refreshed because we've cleansed the brain in part of that adenosine when you take a nap like a pressure valve on a steam cooker you just Rel relase some of that healthy sleepiness that you've been building up so the the Dark Side of napping is if you are struggling with sleep and you suffer from insomnia the advice is do not nap during the day because you're setting yourself up for an even higher probability of failure at night why because when you nap you release some of that good sleepiness that we need to build up for you as someone who is struggling with sleep to give you the greatest chance of awai of sleepiness on your shoulders so if you are not struggling with sleep and you can nap regularly I would say naps are just fine and we can unpack what is an optimal nap and the protocol for what napping should be I would say that's great the only caveat is make sure that you're not napping too late into the day and this is one of the components of the protocol of how to nap because napping late in the day is too close to sleep and you can think of it almost like snacking before your main meal a nap late in the day just takes the appetite edge off your sleepiness so that when it comes time for sleep you're not as hungry anymore so just keep that in mind but we can unpack perhaps the optimal way to nap if you are going to nap and exactly the dos and the don'ts of that if that sounds of somewhat interest yeah that is uh of immen interest to me and I know many other people I'm a huge believer in naps I've always enjoyed um short naps of about 10 to 30 minutes unless I'm somehow sleep deprived in which case I will sleep for an hour or even a little bit more but I make sure I set an alarm U really based on advice that you gave me which was to um first of all decide whether or not a nap is beneficial for for for me or for whoever is considering that um but then to make sure that however long that nap is zero to 90 minutes that it not be longer than 90 minutes because the real goal is to not disrupt nighttime sleep that's right which is essentially just a a more long-winded way of saying what you just said so how does one determine the optimal duration of nap um and in particular to avoid the problem of disrupting nighttime sleep by napping but also this uh rather common phenomenon of waking up and feeling kind of groggy or even I'm kind of grumpy the post-nap face uh or we should call the post-nap expression right right the P NE what's your P are do you wake up um in the and for morning too some people wake up and they're like that that face and then there's the like good morning you know and I think people that wake up with the good morning are particularly delightful unless you're of the post Snap expression that is kind of the the crumpled face and then you just you don't want to be around those people right no absolutely um yeah and this probably relates to spirit animals and things like that some people wake up like a like a cheerful chipmunk and other people seem to wake up like my Bulldog Costello where it's you know um jowls still in contact with the floor yeah so um P I'm trying to hold it together and not Absol just fall apart it's brilliant please trademarket so firstly to your question how to optimally nap the word optimal is interesting because when you people say how long should I nap what's the optimal nap duration the question I have back to them is what are you trying to optimize because once I understand what you're trying to optimize I can give you a better prescription non-medical I'm talking about here the a better sort of you know protocol piece of advice for how to nap I mentioned the study about emotional faces in part for a specific reason cuz I told you there the benefit came by way not of non REM sleep but REM sleep and in our first episode we said that when you go through these on average 90minut Cycles you get most of your non-rem sleep first and then you'll have this bout of REM sleep at the end and it always seems to go that way when you are a healthy normal person you go into non-rem sleep and then you go into REM sleep it's very rare that you ever go directly into REM sleep there are only two reasons when that seems to happen the first is a clinical condition called noopsy where you can have sleep onset REM sleep and very rare the second is if you are horrifically deprived of REM sleep night after night after night and I let you sleep then at that point REM sleep the pressure for REM sleep has been built to to the point of being almost just insatiable and your brain goes straight into REM sleep but with those two things aside you go into non-rem sleep first so I brought up the emotional study of resetting your sort of mood uh compass because to get that REM sleep you had to nap for a longer period of time because you had to get through the non-rem sleep first before you get the REM sleep but let's come back to then assuming optimal is for most people when they speak about naps I just want the quick reboot I want my alertness and concentration which are failing because I'm staring at the screen or I just can't concentrate on the work that I'm doing I want my alertness and my concentration to be improved proved I want that sort of slight boost in brain energy where I know I can sustain myself for now a longer period of time and I've got the motivation which is really in some ways how I like to think about energy as well I've got the motivation the drive to keep going which is just starting to fail me to get those basic things which is what most people nap for aim for 20 minute nap why 20 minutes if I thin slice the nap duration and and those Studies have been done where we look at essentially what's called a dose response curve I give you 5 minutes of a nap 10 minutes of a nap 15 minutes 20 minutes 30 minutes 45 minutes 90 minutes after 5 or 10 minutes you don't really get very much you will wake up and you'll have some degree of improved alertness and your basic reaction time may be a little bit quicker but that Fades very quickly and you don't sustain that benefit once you get past about 15 to 17 minutes now things start to look different you get these nice benefits for concentrational alertness and motivation and those things sustain so once you wake up out of that probably really I would say 20 minute nap at that point you've got some good wind in your concentration and energy sales for the brain and that will sustain you throughout the rest of the afternoon and into the evening the benefit of the 20-minute nap is that you don't get the PNE trademark Andrew hubman you don't get that almost sleep hangover so some people will say it's strange I nap maybe I'll nap 45 minutes 50 minutes and I wake up and to be honest Matt I almost feel worse after the nap than I did before and I don't understand it it's something called Sleep inertia and an extreme version of this is in the first two hours of your night of sleep you get a phone call or an alarm goes off and you wake up and you are just kind of lost in the ocean you're looking around at your surroundings you're just in this groggy State you're half awake half asleep and you can respond and you can do things but boy does it feel miserable and it's almost as though you're going from the ground floor right up to the penthouse suite but you get stuck somewhere in between kind of you know floor 13 and it's this rough state if you go out into sleep light stage one nonrem then stage two nonr and just before you get into the very deepest stages of non Ram 3 and four that starts to happen around 30 to 40 minutes for most people but by cutting your nap off at 20 minutes you still get these nice benefits from a good chunk of healthy non-rem sleep but you're not going so far into the cycle so deep into your nonr that when you wake up after 20 minutes you're not in that what we call Sleep inertia phase that sleep grogginess that sleep hangover phase so it's a nice benefit that you get all of these improvements in your brain but you wake up and very quickly you're back up to operating temperature and you don't suffer that inertia now that's not to say that when you sleep or you nap longer you don't start to get more benefits you do and those benefits are both greater in their magnitude and sustain for a longer period of time they do it's just that you have to understand the tradeoff that you will suffer which is I will get more bang for my book and I will get more benefits but I will in the first sort of hour or so have to understand that at that point I may even be functioning worse than than that which I did before I even started napping but if you're patient and you go through it the rewards on the other side are significantly better still so that's the first piece of advice and when it comes to how to nap I would say the dose and the timing make the poison and poison is hyperbole in here it's simply just the poison being how much sleep and nurs you're going to suffer so aim for about 20 minutes that's the do the timing comes back to that which we described before do not nap too late into the day so what's the rule of thumb here for a protocol on average for the average adult I would say don't nap after about 300 p.m. 20 minute naps sometime between 300 p.m. and if you're struggling with sleep don't do this at all if you're not and you're able to get to sleep fine this seems to be a good ingredient for the basic return on your investment again if you tell me what's the optimal nap duration we need to have a conversation to understand what is it that you're going after here what are the benefits and then I can sort of you know create a finger Buffet Kaleidoscope match to what you need and we can think about the nap duration as a consequence thank you that's very informative um I have a colleague at Stanford who's a Howard Hughes investigator which for those that don't know is a a rather elite club of uh academic research they have to essentially try out for it they can every 5 years they go up for Renewal it's it's a lot of money which makes gives them a greater capacity to uh take on greater risk uh work higher risk work um and he's also a member of the National Academy and he was one of these people that graduated high school at 15 years of age one of these phenoms and he is so religious about his napping such that when he travels to give seminars at other schools he insists that they schedule a nap time for him after lunch and in his office um you know at between 12:30 and and 1: p.m. he's napping everyone knows this and um and I mention this because I think that um oftentimes people think of the Nappers as the lazy ones but um his output is um near superhuman and he attributes U much of that output uh to the nap not just the post-nap work that he's able to perform but his ability to uh just kind of manage so many ideas he has enormous laboratory and that's just one example I think there are examples from sport of um sprinters taking naps on the you know on the side of the the track field I mean so it seems that a capacity to nap is also something worth considering because I think many people listening to this are thinking well I can't nap should I nap you know um and can one teach themselves to nap so that's the question um if one would want to explore napping and um is that something that one should even consider doing if you don't have a propensity to nap should you avoid it if you want to try naps how could one teach oneself to nap you just mentioned earlier uh lying down uh relates to body temperature body temperature uh relates to sleepiness and then as a third question I promise I'll repeat these if we need to uh as a third question I'd like to have a little bit of a discussion about some of the pseudo naap states that um I certainly am intrigued by you know for instance just lying down and I'm doing a progressive bodily relaxation things like Yoga Nidra uh non-sleep deep rest which is an acronym ioin simply to to um make it clear what I was talking about but it's very similar to Yoga Nidra um things of that sort in other words but simply should everyone think about having an early to mid-afternoon protocol to reset their cognition and their body we call it a nap but does it have to be a nap and if we're not good Nappers should we try and if so how should we go about it yeah so TI your three questions firstly if you're not a natural Napper should you start doing it um if you want to start doing it how should you do it and then the third is is there some kind of you know substitute for a like kind which would be these Li these I I'd love the phraseology that you use these Lial states do they mimic that are they different to that how should we think about those the first thing I would say to point number one if you are not a natural Napper don't necessarily Force yourself to be as long as you're getting the sleep that you feel you need at night and you feel refreshed and restored during the day and you don't have that sort of postrenal drop to the point of thinking I almost need to nap during the day there is no pressure based on anything I've been telling you for you to start napping nor should there be any reason that you do start napping but let's say that you want to try what would be the right protocol to improve and increase the likelihood the best way you can do this is to mimic nighttime as best you can so wherever you are if you can shut off the lights make sure that you can block out you know curtains blinds if you can't do that fully and many people won't be able to develop an IM mask procedure um so put an IM mask on make sure you block out noise earplugs you can use a sound machine if you want and we can speak about sort of sound machines and whether or not they're good or bad on sleep and then you can lie down make sure that you try to take your shoes off and get under some kind of a blanket because we're so Contex cued by having something wrapped around us called a blanket or a duvet that to do it without that if you are not a natural Napper can help you again that some people will say I can just kick my feet up on my desk sit back in my reclining chair in the office and I can fall asleep that's great but if you're not a natural person I'm just trying to tell you things that increase the probability of that and then set the alarm I like your idea of making sure that if you do fall asleep you don't accidentally go too long and then just feel miserable so mimic the conditions that you're trying to get that you would normally get at night that will increase the probability mask out noise mask out light kick your shoes off have some kind of a blanket wrapping around you that's probably the best and then time it based on this sort of post pral drop you will know yourself everyone has fallen prey to it you know W it's usually around about 3 4 p.m. that I do start to feel this decline or it's around 1 p.m. try to match it in accordance with that so those are the first I think two questions should you not necessarily if you would like to and I'm not normally doing it how can you do it the final point I think is fascinating which is these alternate states of conscious brain activity the most obvious is when we're awake and when we're asleep those are the two most dramatic changes in Consciousness that we experience on a daily basis short of anesthesia I've become like you very fascinated by these sort of both meditative States or these linal states I think at some point you and I should collaborate and we should do some work and really unpack this but the reason I find this interesting is because I'm going to guess you are having sleep likee States but you are not fully asleep how would I Define a sleep-like state what we've learned is that your brain the way it sleeps isn't on mass it's not as though your entire brain sleeps different territories of your brain can sleep in different ways and what we've also known and there's some argument even individual brain cells seem to have a period where they go into sleep and these individual neurons will start to show what look like these beautiful big powerful deep slow waves in terms of their firing rate at least in terms of those neurons firing away I bring this up because if that means that your brain can have local sleep rather than Global sleep if you are in global sleep you're out like a light you are a sleep but perhaps these Lial States the reason that they give these benefits is because you are still awake not Global sleep so if you're in global sleep you're asleep but you're awake so you're not in global sleep but you may be having local sleep now using special um setups in my laboratory we can apply tens maybe hundreds of electrodes all over your head and we can map the the sort of the the different places where your brain is having sleep in much higher resolution so rather than a you know 480 DPI movie on YouTube I'm now in 4K resolution I can really dismantle what's going on um analytically in your brain I'm going to guess that when you're going into these states and you report coming out of those states and I ask you on a scale of 1 to 10 how would you rate that as an experience based on your common experience the greater the intensity of the lional benefit and state that you experienced I'm going to predict is directly related to the extent of this this local deep non-rem slow wave sleep that's happening you're still awake but some parts of your brain for maybe seconds of time or maybe even tens of seconds of time I'm going to bed will be oscillating in what look like slow wave sleep deep sleep States and if all I would be able to look at is that one part of your brain and that small cluster of electrodes and someone said to me is this person awake or asleep I would say oh they're asleep they're in deep sleep but then if you slowly reveal and back out and show me the rest of the brain and what it's doing I would say oh my goodness no this person must be awake but that local territory that District up there in their brain they were having slow wave sleep I think that's what we could find and that may predict some of the benefits that you get some of the productivity energy benefits by the way I should note that with all of this nap racket NASA figured this out back in the 1980s they were looking at ways to optimize their astronauts because when you are up in orbit depending on what orbit you're in you are rotating around the planet maybe 10 and 20 times per 24 hours so you're seeing 10 to you know 20 sunsets and sunrises so your sleep is a total mess and you can safety check almost everything in terms of Technology but the one weak Link in a space mission is this thing called the human being that's where errors typically happen so how do you drisk a human error up in space because if you make an error up there I mean on the ground not great up there kind of catastrophic you can try to optimize their ability to sleep and their ability to maintain Focus concentration alertness and productivity and what they found was that these naps produced almost a 20% boost in short naaps 20% boost in their alertness and almost a 50% boost in their task productivity and it was so powerful that it translated to the terrestrial um employees of NASA on the ground and it became what was known as the NASA nap culture and from there on we had what we called power naaps Power naaps by the way why are they called power naaps and you think well just because it Powers me up it's a good idea but it's wrong it has a very specific story a fascinating one two legends in my field David dingis uh and Mark Rose kind they were looking at how to instigate risk mitigation not in astronauts but in pilots who are doing long haul flights because the most dangerous aspect of a long haul flight is when it is coming down to land and that's when they can sometimes have these things called a catastrophic hole loss which is a euphemistic phrase for a terrible plane crash and they were trying to say how could you use nap strategically to drisk that and improve their alertness and they asked a very interesting question if they can nap for only a certain period of time because they have to be at work on the plane at the for the rest of it when should you place that nap should you do it at the start of the long call flight in the middle or towards the end and most people would bet like they I think did it's best to place it at the end when you're really starting to struggle get that boost and then you wake up you're not in sleep in OA cuz it's been brief and then you're energized for landing they didn't find that they found that the most optimal time to nap was early on in that long haul flight and it sustained them throughout the rest of the flight now they took their findings to the FAA who were funding the work um and the Federal Aviation Authority here in the United States and they said we've got some great findings and we think we should implement this and we would like to use a term to help Pilots understand this and it's called prophylactic napping and of course there were many Chuckles throughout the room perhaps inappropriate and they just said look you've got to understand our Pilots the you know kind of alpha male guys and if you're starting to say you need to prophylactically NAB it's not going to be adopted that's a nogo so they looked around the room because it's an alpha male culture it's a mostly masculine culture at that time they said what could we and there's a lot of beard stroking and they said I've got it power naaps it's got to be about power and so that is where if you've ever wondered where the term power naaps come from it's not because it reboosts your power which it does and boost it back up it's because there was Chuckles at the time prophylactic napping I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity many times on this podcast we discuss how in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually needs to drop by about 1 to 3° and in order to wake up feeling maximally refreshed and energized your body temperature needs to heat up by about 1 to 3° eight sleep makes it very easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment so that it's easy to fall and stay asleep and wake up feeling refreshed I started sleeping on an eight- Sleep mattress cover several years ago and it has completely and positively transformed my sleep so much so that when I travel to hotels or airbnbs I really miss my eight sleep I've even shipped my eight sleep out to hotels that I've been staying in because it improves my sleep that much if you'd like to try eightsleep you can go to 8sleep.com huberman to save $150 off their pod 3 cover eight sleep currently ships to the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com SL huberman the naming of things fascinates me especially in um the uh landscape of health and well-being um also um and that's one reason why um having become a real fan and practitioner of Yoga Nidra which I think translates to yoga sleep which is this process of lying down for a period of 30 to 60 Minutes Progressive relaxation this is these are scripts that are readily available as this is a a uh age-old practice um in in India um that is meant to restore mental and physical Vig Vigor by placing one into one of these Lial States the um and I have great respect for the uh ner tradition um but um sometimes the names are a separator so people who hear Yoga Nidra and they think oh it must be yoga movement and that's of course not true or they think um that there must be some mystical component to it which is not necessarily true sometimes they include intentions and things like that but often not so that's why I coin this um uh phrase non-sleep deep rest which is essentially maintains the critical components of Yoga Nidra um but doesn't include intentions and um has these shorter uh 10 or 20 minute um protocols so it'd be um great fun and um I think very interesting for us to do that project to explore what are the brains uh activation States or deactivation States as the case may be in these um non-traditional or Lial State uh practices now um along the lines of power napping specifically and the naming of power napping I think it's more than than just a a um anecdote because I think it is very important for people to understand that um that these protocols these tools that NASA and that Laboratories have have developed um often times are are for other purposes but they translate to a kind of broader significance and what I'm hearing and what I'm starting to integrate as we have today's conversation is that it seems that there is pretty good reason to ex at least explore basic sleep right that that for the non-nappers to to really think about whether or not they would like to explore napping as you mentioned they don't have to and then for people who are already um napping to really think about the placement of that nap uh within the day and the duration of that nap what you told us a few moments ago suggests that I should be doing or anyone that's doing naps or entering these Lial States like nsdr might want to shift them a little bit earlier than uh the period in which they first become sleepy to take that nap is that right I mean like so for instance should I do as my colleague and you know finish lunch and and lie down for 10 15 minutes um rather than wait until 2 or 3 p.m. is that is that something that that could make a meaningful difference I think it could and I think it really again depends on how much of a struggle sleep becomes in the evening for you if it is becoming the later that you nap if your sleep becomes either a more difficult to initiate in the evening or maybe you don't have any problems falling asleep but for some reason when I look back I'm now starting to wake up more throughout the night that in part again it's not just that if you nap late in the day you struggle to fall asleep you may not the other consequence that can happen which is non-mutually exclusive is that you then stay in not as deep as sleep and your sleep is more some more fragile in that sense so the probability that you will wake up because because you had the nap so late in the day is higher in the middle of the night and then when you wake up like many of us do and you go to the restroom or It's Perfectly Natural but the speed with which you can then fall back asleep is compromised why because you've jettisoned some of that sleepiness by way of the nap and there isn't as much to take you back down into sleep after you've woken up so I would just say that if you are seeing that pattern that the later napping that you're doing if you're doing that and again there's no reason that you need to nap only if you choose to nap if that's the case then consider not necessarily obviating the nap that may not be required just bring it back earlier take it after lunch see how things work out do the experiment and when you do the experiment make sure that you do what I would describe as the onof on experiment which is where you're napping as you normally do and you've noticed perhaps some problems with your sleep then do so that's sort of the the well it's sort of the on off on phase so then change your nap protocol and move it earlier so now you've Switched Off Your Standard protocol and you've moved on to something different so you're on your standard protocol and then you come off it and when you come off it meaning you go to an earlier nap and you say gosh things do seem to be better maybe he he had something there and it does seem to improve good but I don't trust that because maybe it's just a placebo effect that you you know hear some dulit British tones and you get convinced that maybe that would work and you've now instead after about two weeks of doing that and things have improved go back to your original schedule go back on to your original protocol I'm not as interested about the fact that things got better when we changed it I'm interested in the question do things get worse when we stop it and so when we stop the intervention if things got worse again now I'm I'm believing it a lot more so just as a tip if you are a self- tinkerer and you don't have to do that but if you're idiotic like me and a scientist and you want to do it with this city riger that's the way I would suggest doing it I don't think it's idiotic at all I think it's systematic and what you just described is uh both a negative control and a positive control experiment so you're you are a scientist through and through are there any individuals that should absolutely avoid napping you know I'm heard lore of you know um elderly folks um folks with certain conditions um you know can't imagine um which but um I'm sure you'll tell us that for whom napping is harmful to their health it's a very I think interesting question because the strongest evidence comes back to that which we we've mentioned before which is insomnia and really the recommendation there is just avoid naps it's and what's problematic about insomnia when you are having such tough times with sleep at night and you are just dragging through the day it is miserable and I am you know I I'm very protective of my sleep um for the most part I sleep pretty well but I've I'm I'm not immune to the vagaries of sleep I've had two bouts of insomnia throughout my life both have been what we call reactive insomnia reactive to an event or something happening and I know how just desperate and hungry you are for sleep and if it's happening week after week month after month I'll just do anything to get sleep when I can and the Temptation therefore to nap when you are suffering from insomnia is that much higher and therefore the advice is that much harder to adopt but trust me that is one of the components that we have in the psychological treatment bucket that we use for insomnia which is called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia or cbti for short and you can just look it up or um on my own podcast I done a six-part series on on uh insomnia so I would say try to back away in that circumstance but you brought up a another example which is in aging there I think the evidence is a little less causal so you have to be more cautious about recommending the absence as I was with insomnia of abstaining from naps but the data has now become quite strong that when you get past about 65 years old and you look at napping behavior in large epidemiological studies and you say is there a positive benefit in aging for napping or is there no benefit at all and they looked at that because they thought well that perhaps based on the work in healthy adults that I've described that would be good for older adults not only did they find that it wasn't good they found that it was deleterious that napping in older adults was predictive of worse Health outcomes and it also seemed to predict a higher likelihood of early mortality so at this point we're thinking well how does that fit with everything you've been telling us it comes back to this notion of bad sleep at night it's probably not necessarily that napping during the day is bad for older adults it's that the Naps reflect a problem with the night of sleep for older adults and as we get older something I didn't mention during development was that yes we get this sort of State Lael ratio of 4 to1 of one part REM sleep four parts non-rem in our 7 to9 hours and I described these changes in rem early in development I didn't mention two things about non-rem slow wave activity first as we go into our teenage years and we shift our sort of timing of sleep where we want to go to bed later and wake up later that's biologically determined it's not teenagers fault something happens with their deep sleep however their deep sleep starts to do a different or different action to the brain that REM sleep was doing as an infant I said that during infancy we have huge amounts of REM sleep and were growing sinapsis syap Genesis and we wiring up all of those new territories all of these new neighborhoods with fiberoptic cable but let's say that you've now run the experiment across many years through until teenagehood of those neighborhoods and you've been measuring the bandwidth consumption of each individual house and you've started to realize well I wanted to create a big spread across the brain and then I'm just going to let experience over the next years time tell me which parts of the brain seem to enjoy that high bandwidth and which parts don't seem to use it very much and as we go through into our teenage years we go through something called synaptic pruning where the brain actually calls and takes away copses from certain parts of the brain it seems to be that this change in slow wave sleep that happens around these adolescent years is performing the act of final cortical maturation that it's downscaling the synapses and fine-tuning the brain so you've got this beautiful efficiency and now you've throttled back some of the bandwidth from some of those neighborhoods because they just don't use it very much and you can move it over into the territories that are demanding more bandwidth and net net the brain is downscaled but it's improved its efficiency in the sense that those regions that need it and are working hard based on what we think this organism has been doing over the past you know 13 years that's where we need to now place our bets but as we get through into our older years and this will come back to this issue of napping don't worry stick with me here folks um the reason is that as we're getting older our sleep de deines but it's not just all sleep declines deep sleep declines most dramatically and we all think of aging from brain perspective as cognitive decline that our learning and memory abilities begin to fade and Decline and they do but I would argue that a physiological signature of Aging is that your sleep gets worse and particularly your deep sleep what's perhaps concerning for people listening to this right now is that that decline in deep Sleep doesn't start happening in your 60s or your 50s or even your 40s we can start to pick up that great sleep decline beginning in your mid to late 30s and then it just decreases and by age 50 you are down to about 50% of the deep non-rem sleep that you were having when you were 17 or 18 by age 65 and over or certainly by age 75 you are down to about just 5% of the deep sleep that you had when you were 17 or 18 which is a stunning decline what that means comes back to the first episode we spoke about the four macros of good sleep quantity quality timing and regularity one of the measures of quality that I described to you was this electrical quality of deep sleep the other measure of quality sleep I spoke about was how consolid ated and consistent your sleep is versus how fragmented your sleep is the measure of Sleep Quality is markedly compromised as we get older we're waking up many more times our sleep is much more fragmented and therefore our sleep efficiency is worse and we've got this huge decline in our deep non-rm sleep so no wonder then when you are awake during the day as an older adult Your Sleep Quality is so compr promised at that stage you perhaps try to compensate by way of napping but that compromised quality of sleep that you're having at night is probably the reason that you start to get sick more that you have a higher probability of illness and disease and why also you probably have a higher risk of premature mortality so in other words it's the bad quality of sleep at night that leads to this behavior that we call daytime napping in older adults that seems to indirectly suggest oh my goodness it's daytime napping that's bad and that causes these problems when in fact it's that daytime napping is a proxy for the bad sleep that's happening at night and it's really the bad sleep that's happening at night that is more directly related to the health and mortality concerns in older adults so that's why I think right now as a field I'm still open to evidence that napping for some reason that we just do not understand right now is problematic and does causally predict worse health and a shorter lifespan in older adults I think the best evidence that we have right now is that it's actually the bad quality of sleep at night and thus we should not be necessarily jumping to recommendations that all older adults should stop napping I think we need more evidence and I'm open to both sides of that let's talk about caffeine uh I've heard the ter term is it napino yeah I I I think it um refers to a practice of drinking some caffeine then laying down for a nap and then supposedly waking up um feeling more refreshed my understanding and you'll tell us more of course is that caffeine um is effectively uh an adenosine antagonist although it's a competitive Agonist and you'll explain I'm sure um and napping as you mentioned before uh removes some of the Sleep pressure AKA uh wipes away some of that uh adenosine that's accumulated um both of which sound great but as you mentioned earlier there's a warning there as well uh the warning label on uh both those things should be that having sufficient adenosine built up in your brain is one of the ways in which you feel sleepy at night and fall asleep and stay asleep yeah so what's the story with caffeine how does it work uh to make us feel more alert and um what is the rationale for the nappuccino the nappuccino also known as the caffeine nap caffeine is a very interesting compound in relationship to sleep and wake obviously everyone knows that caffeine can help you stay awake it's no coincidence that those two words that you've used about these chemical compounds caffeine and adenosine sound the same it's because the re receptor that or the receptor systems that caffeine Targets in your brain are the adenosine receptors and you think well Matt was telling me that the more adenosine that builds up in other words the more adenosine that's latching onto those adenosine receptors in your brain the sleepier that you feel and I'm telling you that caffeine works on those same receptors that doesn't make sense caffeine if it's working on those same receptors should increase your sleepiness it doesn't because it when it binds onto those adenosine receptors those welcome sites in the brain it simply blocks them it doesn't deactivate them nor does it activate them it simply blocks them so think about it almost a little bit like um a room that's full of chairs and at some point these adenosine which is one collection of people with the name badges of adenosine they would normally like to come in and start sitting down on those seats which are the adenosine receptors and as they sit down on those seats you're building up this signal of sleepiness well caffeine which is another group of people with caffeine badges they race into the room and they start to hijack the seats and they start to sit down on them and all of a sudden adenosine can't find any seats to sit on so your brain is still flooding that room with adenosine so the adenosine is still building up but the reason that you don't feel sleepy anymore when you've had a shot of caffeine is because caffeine is raced in it's latched onto the receptors and it has essentially hit the mute button on your sleepiness so now your brain was thinking gosh I've been awake for about 13 or 14 hours I'm starting to feel it I'm just going to take a quick espresso shot and you get that you don't think well hang on a second you know 20 30 minutes later I don't feel as tied anymore why it's not because caffeine came in and removed the adenosine it didn't caffeine has come in blocked the sights but the the adenosine is still building up and then at some point the caffeine wors off and therefore not only do you go back to the same level of Denine of adenosine that you did 2 hours ago it's that plus the additional 2 hours of adenosine that has been building up and what you experience is something called a caffeine crash and now you need even more caffeine not just to get you back to where you were but to recover the crash that you've had and go further caffeine in relationship to the caffeine nap though the napino is relevant because of its timing caffeine has an instigating action of around uh 12 14 to 17 minutes so when you come through in the morning and you grab your first cup of coffee and within the first four or five minutes you you say I just I just feel better I've just had a couple of sips I've had half a cup of coffee and I already feel better I just needed that if it's within the first five minutes that you're experiencing that it's got nothing to do with the caffeine because the peak plasma concentration of your caffeine is not going to arrive with you until about you know 12 to 17 minutes so why do you feel better some of it is Placebo because you're smelling the coffee and you associate it with the L it's really not that though or or um when you say Placebo I also wonder whether or not it's possibly a a conditioned effect you know like a pavlovian thing because the smell of the coffee the taste of the coffee the the hum of the machine the walking into the cafe to to um and ordering it from the Barista also creates an anticipatory arousal like here the the alertness is coming and in that anticipation there's its own form of alertness I think that's that's certainly a big component of it the other component however if you look at the data is that it's got nothing to do with the caffeine in that moment it's the temperature that most people take their caffeine warm either it's tea or it's coffee or it's perhaps something else that Andrew hubman would drink but many people yamate since since I was 5 years old I don't I don't know if I should have been drinking uh caffein yerbamate so young maybe even four years old there's a photo of me on my grandfather's lap drinking out of the mate gourd half my family is Argentine and um so I was caffeinated from a young age this brain developed in a caffeinated millu this explains so much about what I've known of you over these no I'm kidding you um so um but we need to speak later no so what's interesting about that is it's the temperature and I told you in the first episode that we need to cool down to stay asleep but we need to initially warm up to fall asleep because warming up at that moment I was telling you is warming up at the periphery a warm up to cool down to fall asleep so you need to warm up to cool down to fall asleep then you need to stay cool to stay asleep and then you need to warm up to wake up the warming up to cool down to fall asleep is not warming up in the middle deep core of your body it's about warming up the hands and the feet and the head to dissipate the heat hence warm up the outer surfaces to cool down the inner core to fall asleep but then I told you you have to warm up to wake up and when we take a hot drink in the morning usually caffeinated the change in your core body temperature can happen with within a handful of minutes so the initial benefit that you get from the hot cup of coffee in the morning or hot tea is from the temperature rise and then you get this beautiful second kick from the caffeine itself and that caffeine can then sustain for a longer period of time so we mentioned this problem with napping that even at 25 or 30 minutes of a nap you wake up with that kind of grogginess that sleep inertia and what however if I could give you the benefits of a nap and have you come out of the nap with zero sleep inertia and that's what some folks started to cleverly think about what if I could look at the timing of the optimal nap maybe 20 minutes and think about the timing of when Peak plasma concentration of caffeine emerges and I told you really starts to kick into gear around 17 minutes and it's in full swing by 20 what if I was creative I'm going to withhold from saying idiotic enough but creative enough to get into bed just before I turn the light out for my nap in the afternoon I Swig a quick espresso light goes off I close my eyes eye mask earplugs and I'm going to drift off fine because the the caffeine is not going to kick in and for another 17 20 minutes perhaps at its full threshold so now you you fall in to sleep and you're going down into sleep and if you perhaps don't make it too large in terms of its serving the temperature change is not going to affect you in a negative way and then just as your alarm clock is about to go off after 20 minutes you're on the beautiful ascending swing of upward plasma concentration of caffeine and you get ejected out the other side with both the benefits of the nap together with the benefits of the caffeine so you get your cake and you can eat it too you get the nap absent the Sleep inertia and hence this created what we call the caffeine nap I love it the nappuccino the the nappuccino um maybe I'll give it a try uh this is the first time I've ever heard the um the rationale and the the the fine structure of the nappuccino but it makes sense um uh at a logical and mechanistic level I have to ask is there anything besides caffeine and sleep that can clear adenosine you know can exercise clear adenosine can uh cold shower clear adenosine I mean and I understand that there are a bunch of competing mechanisms in the body like presumably a spike in norepinephrine or adrenaline or both is going to impact the adenosine system I I once heard a great quote um from a former uh member of the National Academy of Sciences a brilliant guy he said you know a a drug is a substance that when injected into an animal or a human produces a scientific publication meaning meaning it is it is rare to find a paper that doesn't see some effect of some drug especially on sleep I'm told as I recall if you put aspirin REM sleep into PubMed you're going to see some effect on REM sleep people take aspir pretty much any substance that one takes is going to to alter um some feature of sleep or of wakeful States if one is looking with a fine enough uh instrument or is that an overstatement no I don't think it is an overstatement and it comes back to the first episode where we described the complexity this incredible beautiful physiological ballet certainly one of the recommendations when people say I get this afternoon this post prandy will drop in my alertness what can I do I say you could nap but another way is just get outside and walk around be physically active some of that has to do with the fact that you'll probably get some daylight and daylight can be a stimulator of alertness as long you've told us and educated us on we also know that physical activity by itself can increase the amount of endorphins and dorphin and those are wake promoting but none of those are really necessarily going to be altering adenosine they're simply overriding the adenosine that is still building up it really does seem to be for the most part at least as all that I know it's only sleep and particularly non-rem sleep that has the capacity to or give the brain the chance to remove that adenosine now what could be interesting I think is two circumstances one is where your brain becomes less metabolically active for another reason and I told you that it's not joring it's not as though during deep non-rm sleep that there is some special pulsing cleansing mechanism for adenosine there is a cleansing system called the glymphatic system which removes the toxic metabolic byproducts of the waking day wakefulness in some ways is biochemically low-level brain damage and sleep is sanitary salvation in that regard knew um but which is again it's humoristic and it's it's it's going too far but it makes a point the idea here however is that it's not that there is a special system that is removing the adenosine during deep nonm sleep it's just that your brain is less metabolically active and therefore it's not producing as much adenosine so the natural mechanisms that are always occurring in the background to be clearing adenosine and degrading it simply get the chance to do that just as effectively as they have but you're no longer working against the opposite tide that is growing the adenosine now the adenosine increase has dissipated because you're no long longer metabolically active during deep sleep and you get the chance to cleanse it all of which is to say therefore that and I think that would mimic that such as for example anesthesia my guess is that you probably do jettison some sleep pressure when you are in anesthesia I also think that these Lial States non sleep deep rest could be a fascinating territory there because at that point I'm going to guess and we'll be able to see with the e G and we may also be able to do some Imaging depending on how we you and I design the study to look at what changes in the brain in terms of its activation State my guess is that if it does put you into something like slow wave activity patterns that means that those territories of the brain are metabolically less active and that allows the brain to dissipate the adenosine so to your point I don't think things like necessarily exercise or light change adenosine level they do give a nice alertness benefit for other reasons but is there an alternative way of dissipating adenosine yes I think anything that mimics a non or a less metabolically active brain could produce these beautiful adenosine benefits thank you for that this brings me to a question about the period immediately after waking from the nightly bout of sleep um I've been uh touting the benefits of delaying one's caffeine intake by 90 to 120 minutes after waking there's a little bit of a misconception out there I think people um ran with the ball uh assuming that I was mandating this or think or suggesting that everyone should do this and that's simply not the case uh I actually wake up and I'll hydrate and drink caffeine very close to waking if I'm going to exercise soon after yeah um which I often do um but I've experienced and I know others um have experienced if they are not going to exercise immediately or they don't need caffeine to exercise for whatever reason I've heard these people exist I'm no such M mutant um that delaying their caffeine intake by 90 to 120 Minutes in some cases can offset the afternoon crash now I want to be clear some of that may be offsetting the afternoon consumption of more caffeine because by delaying your caffeine intake in the morning then perhaps there's less of an incentive or requirement to drink caffeine in the afternoon and all of which dominoes to as we'll talk about more in the series to better sleep at night because you you're not ingesting caffeine close to bedtime but at risk of taking a massive tangent here's what I'd like to know based on what you just told us if indeed sleep and lower metabolic activity in certain brain regions can help reduce adenosine levels in the brain one could imagine that upon waking it is either a step function from okay you know let's say at um 5:45 a.m. somebody is asleep and adenosine is still being cleared away because they're asleep and then they wake up boom does adenosine clearance immediately stop well for people who have that um crumpled face uh grogginess um and they wake up at 5:45 maybe even by way of alarm although we don't uh suggest that right and they stagger into the kitchen and um ordinarily they'd make their cup of coffee but they're in a pseudo sleep state yeah so it stands to reason that they're still clearing adenosine now if they are to drink caffeine right away then they're as you pointed out going to block those adenosine receptors and there's going to be a continued buildup of adenosine as opposed to a clearance of adenosine so this was um part not the entire reason but part of the rationale for suggesting that people at least explore delaying caffeine slightly and then there are things like the cortisol rise and Etc but um does that kind of framework at least make logical sense that doesn't mean it would hold up in a randomized controlled trial but given that we're talking about essentially zero risk protocols here um what are your thoughts on that I think it is good advice for people to test and it's good advice for two reasons the first is that which you describe in some ways by taking caffeine on early and masking that adenosine also caffeine can make your brain more metabolically active which means that you're going to build up more adenosine during the day which means that sleepiness is going to arrive earlier which means that perhaps that postprandial drop is going to be you know harsher and you're going to perhaps then need to self-medicate with more caffeine to and so goes the Vicious Cycle so I think that's one thing to keep in mind I think that's one hypothesis I think the second hypothesis for me or the second reason I would advocate for that is if you've been using caffeine that way for a long period of time you may also be masking the quality of your sleep because you wake up you immediately medicate with caffeine and you are alert you're awake and you think well I looking back on my night I'm awake now after my caffeine and now is the important part of that sentence I'm awake now so there's nothing wrong with my sleep is that true maybe it is maybe it's not maybe if you abstain from caffeine through and you have to get through the detox period it's not going to this is not the right test immediately but do it for about two weeks and then at that point once you're free from the detox and the withdrawal now you're in a somewhat naive state where you're taking your caffeine on I'm telling you to stop caffeine you're taking it on at 11:00 after you've woken up let's say 7:00 in the morning at that point we've now got this nice Clear Window that has been consistently happening between 7 to 11: in the morning and I'm going to ask you now do you feel rested restored and refreshed and can you operate with cognitive acumen and skill in those first morning hours now don't forget we've got to get past the natural sleep and Heria period in the first 90 minutes but after the first 90 minutes of waking up absent of caffeine let's say by 900 a.m. in the morning are you functioning well because if you're not and you still think you know what I don't feel restored by my sleep I feel unrefreshed I want to then start asking you let's take a look at your sleep and let's see how we can get you to a more refreshed state and by using caffeine first thing in the morning you don't give yourself the chance to test whether or not subjectively you sense your sleep is good quality now you don't need to do this forever you can just do a test for a month and be asking that question and if all is clear after you've got through withdrawal and you've got past the first 90 minutes after waking up and you tell me now in this more caffeine naive state in the first few hours I feel rest I feel refreshed I feel restored by my sleep then that's great we don't need to be concerned about your sleep so that's the second reason I like it because it gives you the opportunity to test out whether or not your sleep is of good quality or not I should also note by the way that I mentioned I've changed my mind on caffeine and its use and this comes back to I just raise it because you had said I made this suggestion and it wasn't binary it wasn't dictatorial you don't have to to do it I wasn't saying that everyone needs to do it and in fact even I will you know tweak my schedule if I'm doing one thing in the morning I will take on board caffeine fairly soon if I'm not I will hold off I came out the gate when I first published um a book and it and I was very dictatorial about it I and I was very mono I was very binary you know it was sleep is absolute and it's it has to be this way and no other way I was not in favor of caffeine and I was telling people about the dangers and there are dangers to your sleep and we we can speak about those but it was a little bit too heavy-handed I've changed my mind for at least two reasons first that's not the way Society works or people live so there's no amount just like technology in saying leave your phone outside of the room for 2 hours before bed and don't check it for the first 4 hours that that Genie is out the bottle so the reason I have changed my mind on caffeine is because if you look at the data on on caffeine it's stunning for Health it on almost every metric that we can measure drinking some degree of caffeine is beneficial now there is a I knew it there is a U-shaped function to this which is once you get past sort of three or four cups of coffee then you start to go in the downward Direction and things aren't so great the contradiction however was that I was telling people caffeine not good for your sleep and sleep by the way is wonderful for Health it transacts all of these benefits that we have and will discuss in this series but then you compare that relative to caffeine and caffeine transacts many of the same health benefits so how can you explain that Mr sleep scientist well if you look the the data is very clear it's not the caffeine that's the benefit most people take on board caffeine by way of a cup of coffee and the Coffee Bean is Pack full not just of caffeine it contains a whopping dose of antioxidants and because of our deficient Western diets were so absent of these antioxidants that the humble cup of coffee has been asked to carry the Herculean weight of our antioxidant needs on its shoulders so no wonder it by itself carries such a strong Health signal because it's providing you with this wonderful dose of antioxidants in addition to caffeine case in point if you look at decaffeinated coffee you still get the antioxidants but now now you don't get the caffeine and lo and behold you get many of the same health benefits it's not the caffeine it's the coffee itself so I think that is a a perfectly good reason to justify caffeine but again just like naps the dose and the timing make the poison if you're not someone who's sensitive to caffeine then having a couple of cups of caffeine and trying to step away from the use of caffeine I would argue somewhere between 10 to 12 hours before you expect to go to bed depending on your sensitivity and it is different across people and we know that it's genetic there is a specific um what we call polymorphism which just means A variation in a particular Gene and if you look at variations in that it will predict whether you are someone who is very sensitive to caffeine or not very sensitive to caffeine and it comes down to how quickly you can essentially metabolically remove that caffeine from the system so if you know that you're a very sensitive person I would probably argue try to stay clear maybe 12 to 14 hours if you're someone who is not as sensitive then you could maybe go to 8 hours the danger is for people who say look I'm one of those people who is you know really just not sensitive to caffeine at all and I can have an espresso with dinner and I fall asleep fine I stay asleep fine so it's really not a problem for me I would say that that that may be true but the inherent danger here is that and we've done these studies if I give you a dose of let's say 200 300 400 milligrams of of caffeine in the hours before bed which would be a large you know strong cup of coffee or you know two espresso with dinner some people can fall asleep and some people stay asleep but the amount of deep sleep that they have is compromised in fact it can drop your deep sleep by up to 20% now the danger is that you wake up in the morning and there was no signals in your sleep that said you had problematic sleep because you're not aware of how much deep sleep that you had that's the reason that I think you know sleep trackers can be helpful in some ways but you then wake up and you don't feel as refreshed and restored but you don't remember having a hard time falling asleep or staying asleep but now you find yourself reaching for three cups of coffee to wake up in the morning rather than the standard two and so goes the Vicious Cycle so and also you see an interesting interrelationship we did a recent study we just published in Wall Street Traders it's not just caffeine use it's also about alcohol use in the evening that people who overmedicate with caffeine during the day they then need something to bring them down at night and the principal depressant agent and depressant not in the sense of psychiatric depression but in the sense of brain neural activity depression is is alcohol so you get this classic cycle of uppers and downers I need my uppers during the morning my caffeine and I need my downers at night to lull me into sleep and it's this really interesting trade-off which we we saw in these Wall Street Traders so coming back to the notion of caffeine though I am favorable of it in terms of its health benefits I think it's very very clear just be mindful of the dose and be mindful of the timing dose try to not exceed about three cups of coffee timing understand your sensitivity there are certain genetic tests if you really want to get nerdy that will tell you if you have this sensitivity or not but you will probably know it and therefore just say okay I'm not that sensitive I could probably go 8 hours or as close as 8 hours before sleep or 10 hours if you're very sensitive 14 15 hours and keep it to one cup um so those are the ways that I would see moderating caffeine and changing my my mind on caffeine which just comes back to your point where you were saying I made this recommendation about caffeine I want to make sure I modify that so people don't get confused I certainly um needed to make a modification to my stance on caffeine so thank you for letting me say that which is a long uh winded way of of getting around it but does that help a little bit that does help it um very much thank you for that um addendum to the legislature [Laughter] okay so you told us about the power nap and you've told us about the caffeine nap the so-called napino yeah what are some other types of naps that can be beneficial for Sleep awake cycles and alertness so you can think about the caffeine nap as trying to amplify it sort of a nap plus as it were but to your question the study that comes to mind there was a brilliant investigation Herculean in its study design from a great sleep research group out in Japan and they asked okay the nap is good the caffeine nap may be a little bit better but can we go further um and so they designed a series of studies they had five different experimental groups and they tried to basically create a stack a stacking system they had across the 5 groups there was a non naap group that's the control then there was a nap group then there was a nap plus caffeine group then there was a nap Plus Cold face and cold handwashing immediately after you wake up I'll come back to explain why that we think that works and then the final group was a group that was a nap plus bright light and again thank you uh me offering this as the general public to you Andrew hubman for for your light Revolution so it was bright light at 2,000 looks immediately afterwards so they had five groups again there was no nap group nap group nap plus caffeine nap plus cold hands and face washing nap plus immediate brightlight the cold hands and face washing is interesting I told you before that there was this three-part story to to the sleep wake equation that you need to warm up to cool down to fall asleep stay cool to stay asleep warm up to wake up and I'm saying warm up to wake up but use cold water on your face and your hands don't forget that warming up when I say it in the morning is warming up at the central core of your body you reverse engineer what you did in the evening I said warm up to cool down to fall asleep so you warm up the periphery to release the blood from the core and you cool down well the reason that they use cold hand and face washing was because that's this vascular surface it's the place where we can modulate temperature quite quickly the cold water on the face and the hands therefore caused Vaso constriction the the vessels and the capillaries there they all scrunched up and they force the blood back down into the core of the body so the core body temperature increase a little bit now you also get a bit of an adrenaline shot when you're splashing very cold water on your hands and your face so there's some of that too but that's the justification so what they find firstly they were measuring different aspects of your cognition and your mood and your sleepiness those were the outcome measures to assess how did these five different experimental groups change and you can imag I mean this is I don't think I would ever take on a study where I'm doing five nap groups all within one study it's bloody amazing so they did the nonap group and then compared to the nonap group The Nap group got a wonderful benefit just as we described and they showed benefits in their alertness in their cognitive performance and also they showed a reduction in their sleepiness so Point number one on the scoreboard for a nap then they did the nap plus the caffeine and sure enough you got an added benefit to that which you already obtained from the nap now it was nowhere near as sizable as the benefit from the nap so the addition of caffeine does give you some nice benefits and I've used this before when I've worked with sort of professional athletes we do instigate these nap um these caffeine naps when needed so it did give a nice benefit but then when they looked at the nap Plus Cold hand and face washing and the nap plus the bright light those also added something to The Nap benefit now they didn't do the sixth Group which is really what I'm going to do some hand waving about which is the full St stack full fat method where they said okay you're going to do nap plus caffeine Plus Cold hand and face washing plus bright light but if you were to put those together my thought is that they're probably additive rather than simply just you know netting each other out which means that if you really want to not just do a nap or a nap plus which would be the the Caffe nap but the nap plus plus version you can lean into this study and the protocol there would be you get into bed you have your espresso shot before you turn the light you Swig it go down set your alarm for 20 minutes you wake up the caffeine is kicking in you get over the inertia you go straight out cold hands cold face by way of cold water and then you get immediate daylight for 5 to 10 minutes outside and at that point you're really in a supercharged state so that's if you just because I know there's probably going to be some audience members who are willing to give this a try or who really want to optimize don't give me you know what is good give me the extreme very best that's the only suggestion I would have based on that data I love it and actually what you just described could easily be um translocated to the uh the period after uh waking from the nightly bout of sleep although one wouldn't ingest caffeine prior to waking up for obvious reasons um but it would make good sense to me to uh wake up obviously get sunlight in one's eyes um splash some cold water in one's face or hands or get cold shower cold plunge um caffeine or delay caffeine I mean it's essentially the same set of tools and I think it really um points to the fact that circadian rhythm clearance of adenosine uh temperature modulation and of course the the way in which these interact um are really the the levers and and knobs to to modulate wakefulness yeah it's it's so it there are I think we've gone over this notion of naps but there are ways that you can try to manipulate the nap system still and there are ways that you can manipulate it even further but I like what you're saying because it just comes back to the fundamentals let's let's forego the the nap conversation just go back to the morning routine you're absolutely right and think about the cold water and warmart my guess is that very few people when they go to bed they wash their face and their hands maybe they're probably not washing it with cold water before they go to bed correct they're going to be washing it with warm water why don't they do that and they just say well why would I Splash cold water on my face you know probably wakes me up you ever thought about why it wakes you up part of it is the you know the shot of activation but the other part is Thermo regulation and the opposite is what what you want to do if anything you want to be warming your hands and your feet and that's exactly what you've always done you've always medicated your sleep onset by using warm water on your face and your hands several times during today's discussion we talked about polyphasic sleep um and the different types of polyphasic sleep that we covered are I wouldn't say conventional but they're um conventional is what are some of the more um esoteric or let's call them high performance Pol polyphasic uh strategies uh for sleep so we've spoken about polyphasic sleep in the natural way it occurs which is during infancy and sleeping like a baby means that you're sleeping in a highly polyphasic way but probably around about the late 1990s 2000s with the emergence of the biohacker movement and the Quantified self-movement there started to become a lot of chatter online about this notion of polyphasic sleep and here no longer are we infants we're now adults but we're engaging in a pattern that is highly polyphasic polyphasic sleep simply by definition again means that you're having multiple phases of sleep within a 24-hour period And there are different strategies so the way polyphasic sleep in adults works is that you take the 24-hour period and you think about it like a pie chart and then you start to slice that pie up into these quadrants when it comes to polyphasic sleep the goal is to put insert multiple phases of sleep around the 24-hour clock rather than one single phase but the thinness of those slices of the pie are very thin leaving large thick slices of wakefulness in between the notion that being that if you were to sort of just intersperse Little soupson of sleep in terms of these little thin slices of sleep you can increase the amount of time that you're awake and you can increase all of the benefits of a wake so if you look at the there is a website I think it's called the polyphasic society and there it's not a scientific Society like the you know psychological the American Association for uh psychology or medical um American Medical Association or British medic it's not one of those ratified certified scientific or medical it's just society that lives online which is great and they make claims to suggest that polyphasic sleep can improve aspects of your mood it can improve aspects of your productivity it can maybe even improve aspects of Health I think sometimes there are claims that it can help with lifespan and there are a number of different schedules that they will describe to you and that you can find out there of polyphasic sleep there is is the first one that probably people have heard of is called the uberman schedule and by the way there is no h at the start of that it is simply you I know it's not this man sitting across from me who has anything to do with this schedule and after we discuss the data he will um reassert that very same fact then there's something called the Everyman shedule and then there is the triphasic schedule and there's lots of different other flavors of this the differences between them are in how you split up that pie chart and how much you assign to little thin slices of sleep versus longer periods of wake and how many of those you insert but they all follow the same pattern if you look at the literature however it didn't begin with the biohacker movement the first description I can find in the human record comes from Time Magazine an issue in 1943 and they describe the protocol of at the time a fantastic very interesting designer a guy called book Minster Fuller and he created a design principle and that design principle was called the daxian principle the daxian principle was principally used initially to build unique building structures and it uses this notion of different sort of almost spokes that interconnect in a central Hub that create a self-supporting structure are the most obvious have you ever been to one of those geodesic domes and inside you go in it's like a botanical garden and it's all tropical despite you being in a let's say being in England in London and is beautifully tropical inside of that that structure that sort of latis structure that comes in part from his Design This was the daxian principle and he scaled it to different things the daxian car the daxian house the daxian Dome it fascinating but he was no fan of sleep and he saw sleep as a rather significant waste of time when just like the rest of his daxian principle he could be harnessing more efficiency out of the system with less structure and here less sleep structure inserted into his 24-hour period so he was the first one to describe his schedule and it was called the daxian schedule of polyphasic sleep so it may have been a practice earlier in the record but that's the earliest one I can find so let's come back to the claims of polyphasic sleep that it could improve let's say your mood or your cognition or your productivity or your health the a group of scientists at Harvard some of my old colleagues um from Harvard they looked at all of the literature on all of the stes that were polyphasic like or testing this claim and the first thing that they found was to their claims of improved cognition productivity mood as well as health they found no supportive evidence that polyphasic sleep was helpful then they turned the tables and they said well could it be hurtful and in fact that's exactly what they found firstly the total amount of sleep that you get on any one of those schedules is decreased significantly now of course that's the goal the quality of sleep that you get though is miserable your sleep efficiency even when you're having these short periods of time especially during the waking hours is very poor it's not a type of even short sleep that you would wish for third they found that it would reduce your REM sleep amounts so that was the first set of findings your sleep is no better if anything it's significantly worse and then they started to find that there were significant impairments in many of those things impairments in cognition in judgment making and decision- making impairment in mood and some aspects of impairment in metabolic Health particularly glucose regulation so when it comes to polyphasic sleep sleeping like a baby if you're an adult seems to be a rather unwise piece of advice now yeah I mean it probably goes along with eating baby food drinking breast milk and um and uh having somebody else uh clothe and change you as an adult it's probably uh not advisable it doesn't seem to be at least supported by the data and again I want to be so careful here and you're very careful too I'm not here to necessarily tell anyone absolutely how to live their life I'm just a scientist and all I can do is give you the information just as you do and then it's up to you to make the best decisions that you wish to make all I would say is that I would hope that as long as you're not hurting yourself and harming your health and you're not hurting other people then and it makes you happy then I say whatever it is in life good luck I I embrace it I always say uh do as do as you wish but know what you're doing and don't hurt yourself or anybody else can you get me that T-shirt and I will wear it five days through Tuesday so here in this regard though I would say the evidence would suggest that maybe you're compromising your health and your Wellness but that's your choice voice and I understand it so again no judgment to the question however of as long as you're not hurting other people here I would say that there is a pause of a caution because what we know is that when you're not getting sufficient sleep I described all of the health consequences in the first episode there's another danger here which is road traffic accidents and we describe these micro sleeps that happen and why car accidents that are caused by sleepiness can be so catastrophic there's a very interesting study that was done where they looked at people getting less than 6 hours of sleep for several nights and they put them into a driving simulator and they asked what is the probability that you have a crash or an off-road event and sleeping less than 6 hours a night resulted in a 30% increase in you getting into a car crash now the AAA release some data showing that when you get down to 5 hours of sleep there is I think it's something like two Three Times Higher likelihood of an accident based on real data and then when you were on 4 hours of sleep it was close to a 10 times greater risk so in other words the less and less sleep that you get it's not a linear increase in your risk of a car accident it's an exponential increase so I bring this back to polyphasic sleep because I don't know you know think about that 30% study let's not go to the extreme just less than 6 hours of sleep if this evening you call a taxi and it turns out two taxis turned up and outside of your door I said look one of these two ta you can choose either one of them but I'll just tell you that one of these taxis has a 30% higher likelihood of getting in a crash relative to the other and it's this one on the right which would you like to pick which would you like to put your wife and children in to S it's very obvious so I rais that question just to be mindful no one would wish to cause harm on someone else to C carry the harm of someone else by way of your own doing on your shoulders for the rest of your life is not one I would wish for and it's not one that you would wish for that's the only cautionary note but other than that I would say you know sort of live life to the full well that brings us to the conclusion of yet another incredible Voyage into the landscape of sleep most notably on the different phases monophasic biphasic and polyphasic sleep and naps and caffeine and all of their interactions these are such important topics at the level of Concepts the level of mechanisms and as you've also beautifully described at the level of protocols that is actionable tools that people can apply so thank you ever so much Matt for taking us even further along this Voyage I'll just remind people that episodes one and two of this series that U Matt is uh so generously providing information about sleep for us are out and those can be accessed through links in the show note captions um those fill in yet other mechanisms and aspects of sleep and I'm also particularly excited for the fourth installment in this series coming up about the relationship between sleep memory and creativity so just incredibly important topics relevant to everybody I also just want to make note that I really appreciate you highlighting some of the develop velopmental shifts that occur with sleep I often get questions about um you know sleep in children and babies and uh elderly adults as well as um all the ages in between and you've just um built this incredible tapestry of of information for people to think about and act upon should they choose so thank you Matt ever so much and I look forward to episode four Andrew thank you it is such a
