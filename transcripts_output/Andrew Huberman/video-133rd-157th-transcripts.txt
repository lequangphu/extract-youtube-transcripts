welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr David joerger Dr David joerger is a professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin and one of the world's leading researchers into mindsets in particular growth mindset which is a mindset that enables people of all AG es to improve their abilities at essentially anything he is also a world expert into the stress is performance enhancing mindset which is a mindset that allows people to cognitively reframe stress and that when combined with growth mindset can lead to dramatic improvements and performance in cognitive and physical Endeavors Dr joerger is also the author of an important and extremely useful new book entitled 10 to 25 the science of motivating young people the book is scheduled for release this Summer that is the summer of 2024 and we provided a link to the book in the show note captions during today's discussion Dr joer explains to us exactly what growth mindset is through the lens of the research into growth mindset and he explains also how to apply growth mindset in our lives he also shares the research from his and other laboratories on the stress can be performance enhancing mindset and how that can be combined with growth mindset to achieve the maximum results so while I assume that most people have heard of growth mindset today's discussion will allow you to really apply it in your life not just from the perspective of you the person trying to learn but also for teachers and coaches in fact Dr Jer shares not just the optimal learning environments for us as individuals but also between individuals and in the classroom in families in sports teams and in groups of all sizes and kinds before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is arero press arero press is like a French press but a French press that always Brews the perfect cup of coffee meaning no bitterness and excellent taste Aero press achieves this because it uses a very short contact time between the hot water and the coffee and that short contact time also means that you can brew an excellent cup of coffee very quickly the whole thing takes only about 3 minutes I started using an aerop press over 10 years ago and I learned about it from a guy named Alan Adler who's a former Stanford engineer who's also an inventor he developed things like the aobi Frisbee in any event I'm a big fan of Adler inventions and when I heard he developed a coffee maker the Aro press I tried it and I found that indeed it makes the best possible tasting cup of coffee it's also extremely small and portable so I started using it in the laboratory when I travel on the road and also at home and I'm not alone in my love of the Aeropress coffee maker with over 55,000 fstar reviews Aeropress is the best reviewed coffee press in the world if you'd like to to try Aeropress you can go to Aero press.com huberman to get 20% off Aeropress currently ships in the USA Canada and to over 60 other countries around the world again that's Aero press.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by Roa Roa makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality now I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of different challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly Roa understands this and has developed their eyeglasses and sunglasses so that regardless of the conditions you're in you always see with the utmost Clarity Roa eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed for use in sport in particular things like running and cycling now as a consequence Roa frames are extremely lightweight so much so that most of the time you don't even remember that they're on your face they're also designed so that they don't slip off if you get sweaty now even though they were initially designed for performance in sport they now have many different frames and styles all of which can be used in sport but also when out to dinner at work essentially anytime and in any setting if you'd like to try Roa glasses you can go to Roa that's r.com and enter the code huberman to get 20% off again that's r.com and enter the code huberman to get 20% off and now for my discussion with Dr David joerger Dr David joerger welcome thanks for having me can you tell us your definition of growth mindset I think most people have heard of it they have some some sense of what it is but you've worked uh very intensely on growth mindset for a number of years so I'd love to know how you define it yeah so it's it's simply the belief that your abilities or your potential in some domain can change um a huge confusion is people think it means if you try hard then you can do anything but that's not really the idea it's it's simply that under the right conditions with the right support change is possible and you know that ends up being a pretty powerful idea because the opposite is so stressful right the idea that you are static nothing about you can change is is really kind of a stressful idea of all the uh studies on growth mindset um including yours ones that you've participated in um what one or two kind of highlevel results um stand out to you as the most striking surprising exciting or meaningful and here I will encourage you to discard with attribution we know that um or everyone should know that Carol dwac is the originator of the growth mindset idea um as a field and she deserves um tremendous credit for that so yeah um so when you stand back from the field given that it's it's mushroomed into this very large field now and you look at that research which results kind of stand out as like wow that's really cool really meaningful people should know about that what stands out to me a lot first of all is just the field experiments that the idea that you can distill a complex idea about the brain about malleability you can give it to a young person at a time when they're vulnerable and that that can give them hope and then they can do better at school or whatever so our 2019 paper in nature uh that Carol Greg Walton Angela Duckworth a lot of us collaborated on took a very short growth mindset intervention two sessions about 25 minutes each for ninth graders and we found kids were eight nine months later more likely to get good grades uh by 10th grade more likely to be in the hard math classes and the unpublished results find effects four years later on graduating high school with college ready courses from short intervention happened you know just one or two times no reinforcement so that there's a lot of reasons why that's true that sounds magical and and outrageous and there are a lot of mechanisms but that just demonstrates the overall value of the phenomenon and we in that study we did everything we possibly could to address legitimate skepticism right are we collecting and processing the data in ways that could bias it no third party is it are we handpicking schools where you could get the best effects no random sample of schools did we post talk decide on the analyses that would make the results look the greatest no pre-registered so that's a good like okay this phenomenon is not something that falls apart in the hands of anyone else besides a select few researchers that's really and we can go into that but that doesn't explain the mechanisms and I think that there are a lot of interesting growth mindset mechanism studies my personal favorite is a very underappreciated kind of like indie rock study by David newbound and Carol dck that David did uh when he was a graduate student at Stanford um and it's on defensiveness versus remediation and the basic idea is in a fixed mindset the idea that your intelligence cannot change you are the way you are it can't change um your goal in that fixed mindset is to defend your ego to like hide your deficiencies or any flaws because if they're fixed and then they're revealed then it labels you for life in some way as less than shame worthy Etc right in a growth mindset though mistake is like part of the process it's it's just an opportunity to grow so David took that idea and then set up a study and I think I have the details right where undergraduates did a task they all did poorly they were getting 20 30% correct on this task and the question is what do you do before you do your second dry how do you cope with that initial failure and he found that both fixed and mindset participants wanted to recover their self-esteem so you do poorly you feel like crap what am I going to do to feel better about myself in a fixed mindset they looked downward so the people getting a 25 look at the people who got a 12 like I'm twice as good as these losers right in a growth mindset they look at the people getting an 85 or 90 what what are they doing what are their strategies how can I improve both of them then recovered self-esteem and look the same at post test and I think about that a lot like how often in our society does something happen to us and we feel like garbage and you have a choice like am I going to look down on other people and say at least I'm not as bad as these losers or am I going to say like how am I going to get better and I I just I love that because think of a nth grader who bombs their Algebra test am I like a no good dumb at math loser who's not going anywhere in life well at least I'm not that burnout right or is it like how is anyone getting an A in this class I'm not getting an a what's happening what what can I learn from them so the open openness and willingness to self-improve I think is the underwriting mechanism and I and hardly anyone cites that study but I think about it all the time and it's the kind of thing that I like from being honest that's the mindset I want my kids they have as they go through life very interesting I'm going to ask you more about this looking down or looking up yeah um in terms of performance but before I do that I have questions about these brief uh 25 minute I think you said interventions yeah sometimes 25 sometimes we do two sessions each about 20 25 yeah can you give us a sense of what those interventions look like I mean it's incredible these two sessions have positive effects lasting up to four years and perhaps even Beyond yeah um maybe just a top Contour of uh some of what these kids hear during those sessions yeah I mean so the first thing to realize is that they're short and they have to do two things in order to have long-lasting effects one is I have to convince you to think differently at the end of the session so I just have to persuade you over the course of 25 minutes to have a different mindset that's sometimes hard but then even if I that you then might have months or years between when I did that and when the outcome is measured so how could you remember it and apply it and how many 25 minute experiences in your life you no recollection of right I have lots so I think I think people are skeptical of the mindset style of interventions for two different I think legitimate reasons like I remember a very famous statistician came to my office at at UT Austin and was like I just don't understand these interventions I mean the other day I spent 25 minutes telling my son all the things he has to change and like how he's doing everything wrong and he didn't remember at 5 minutes later how could someone remember your thing four years later and I was like did you hear yourself talking like I'm sure the way you talked to your son was like totally condescending and bad so the the first step is in that 25 minutes how are you communicating in a way where someone's ears are open where they're not feeling talked down to ashamed humiliated Etc but then the second step is saying that to you at a time when it's possible for there to be a what we call a recursive process or a Snowball Effect that's going to happen over time so that's the stage setting okay so now let's take the first part 25 minutes what am I going to say to you right um there are three big things that are in every intervention and the term that Greg Walton the Stanford Professor uh colleague collaborator um uses is wise interventions that's the umbrella term of which growth mindset is one and a good one but it's just one of many for wise interventions we often do the following three things first is we present some new scientific information some idea that almost in like a Gladwell way is not is not obvious and intuitive to the reader but feels like new information and useful information so the first is a scientific the second is we present participants with stories from people like them who've used those ideas in their lives and found them useful so in the concrete case of ninth graders getting growth mindset it's like 10th 11th 12th graders who previously felt dumb learned a growth mindset then felt better that's it's more complicated than that that's the basic idea and last we don't just tell them the stories we ask third for participants to to author a story so they write a narrative about a time when they struggled a time when they doubted themselves and then remembered this idea that people can change like my brain can grow Etc so the three points are like scientific information stories or the the technical term is descriptive Norms so you're giving people information about what's normal for people like you and then the third is the writing which we call saying is believing uh which is a a term that that's a popularized version of a term that came from classic social psychologist Josh Aronson Elliot Aronson who who found in the work on cognitive dissonance 30 40 years ago that one of the best ways to change someone's mind about something is to ask them to try to persuade somebody else so that we do those sort of things so what is the science and the growth mindset that's where we draw on the metaphor that the brain is like a muscle that um just like muscles get stronger when they're challenged and can you know recover so too does the brain get smarter when it's pushed and challenged in a certain way this idea that writing a story about one self or about others in which one succeeds can be useful toward building growth mindset in you know in basic terms I think that's what what you're what you're referring to I think is interesting it sort of suggests that that we have brain circuit that underly growth mindset type behaviors and thinking and that just storing into those can potentially um lead to better decision-making and behavior I mean obviously it can't create new skills um simply because you know I can't write a story about me being able to dunk a basketball and then expect that I can dunk a basketball because at present I can't but the idea of uh writing a story about um the effort going into duny basketball and learning how and then Translating that to a more um realistic sense of of ability that allows me to then go practice more is that sort of what you're referring to yeah so the in in a 2016 paper in pnas Greg Walton and I explained these types of interventions as a we call them a lay Theory intervention and the idea there is that lay people like not not scientific theories but just our intuitive theories for explaining the world help us anticipate what something means so the the idea from basic developmental psychology is that human beings are walking around with kind of Prior belief about objects about motion about you know number and then later about complex social structures like whether people are looking down on me how where I stand relative to others and also lay little lay Theory about adversity what does it mean when I have to put in effort what does it mean when I fail so the idea is that if you if you understand the theory someone has then you'll understand the meaning they'll make about a future experience um and therefore well and the reason meaning matters is because the way you interpret something then affects how you respond to it right so if I see someone and they're doing something innocuous but I interpret it as a threat do I call the police you know do I run away that's my interpretation that's causing it right um and so the there's a long way of saying it turns out one of the best ways to preset someone's meaning and give them a different theory is to give them a different story uh stories are kind of like theories in motion this is why you know like what's the point of war in peace right war in peace is is really a theory of of great leaders in the war um and there's any English phds I'm sure they'll tell me that that's oversimplified version of what to sto was doing but you learn the theory in a narrative way right so this is the classic idea throughout human history great writers and authors give us theories through narrative right and so we're just taking that simple human fact and doing it in a 10-minute activity and the lay theory in a person's mind that when things are difficult it can change can be taught with a very simple narrative which is the this person or even I experienced difficult difficulty on something that mattered to me that difficulty didn't determine my entire future because actually there were steps that I could take in order to like make a difference here are the steps that I took and then it improved so it's a very like the simplest freay tags pyramid and even though that simple story is available to all of us you could look in culture and see it you also see the opposite lay Theory all the time and so without absent intervention it's not like people couldn't end up with a growth mindset but they wouldn't kind of know what to sort for or what to look for so we give them some touch points for very simple of like frustration things can change then they got better and we think that once people do that in our writing exercises they're more likely to see that pattern out in the world and if you see that enough and then you take the actual steps to get better then it starts becoming true for you and that's what I called the recursive process that you we give people a starting hypothesis about the world they go out try things struggle fail it improves then they see that that's true and then they can keep acting on that over time I feel like so much of getting better at things involves reappraising the um stress or anxiety response you know the um the friction that one feels when they can't perform something well or when things feel overwhelming or confusing um and I think the analogies to physical exercise apply but I feel like they're Limited in the sense that I like the the idea that the brain is like a muscle that it can grow and get stronger I think the um the key difference to my mind is that you know like working out with weights um you get some sense of the result you're going to get because there's like a lot of blood flow into the muscle so it's like a hint of what's possible um with cardiovas ular exercise like if we run hard up a hill there's that moment where your lungs are burning Etc and anyone who understands exercise knows that that's the signal for adaptation such the next time you can do the same thing without the burning of the lungs right um when it comes to mental work and learning I think we immediately assume that if we're not performing well if we're getting confused or overwhelmed that somehow um we're doing it wrong yeah um as opposed to stimulating the growth right and so I are there any studies that point going to um Bridging the relationship between the physiology you know that the stress response and the mindset that allows one to say okay this is really hard and I keep failing and failing and failing at this math at this language learning at writing this essay whatever it is and that's exactly what I'm supposed to be doing it's like the burning of the lungs or it's like the failure to complete another repetition um in the in the gym yeah I mean I think that that you're right um you know the standard growth mindset message does have reappraisal components specifically around something Carol D has called effort beliefs which is very simply the belief that if it's hard it means you're doing the wrong thing and that follows naturally from the fixed mindset idea that ability can't change and I think it's very important to point out the centrality of that effort belief because people have tried to apply growth mindset but simplified it in a way of just saying uh basically try harder right or I believe in you if you try hard enough you can do anything right but if your natural inclination is to view the need for effort as a sign that you are doing the wrong thing which is that's the default interpretation uh then people are going to quit right if if I tell if you believe effort out to you as lacking potential and then I say you need to try hard I'm saying you don't have potential that basic Insight is very poorly misunderstood in the field and it's led to tons of misapplications of Carol's work and then people like well this thing doesn't work well okay but you haven't addressed the effort belief so I think that the first type of response to what you what you've said is you can't just abstractly tell someone your brain as a muscle and assume it magically then in the midst of stress and frustration and confusion and and all those negative experiences that you're going to immediately say yes I love doing this and this is great um but then there's also the physiological component as you're saying so when we're stressed frustrated you know confused your heart starts racing maybe your palms get sweaty right you start your breathing you know starts getting heavier uh my my daughter is 13 before like a cello audition it's like I have butterflies on my stomach I don't you know what does this mean and and I think that growth mindset research didn't always deal with the visceral experience of stress and frustration and I think in a world in which someone hears the growth mindset message and says yes now I'm going to go challenge myself I'm going to be I'm going to embrace stress and frustration do the mental equivalent of you know running ladders or running up a hill then they feel that stress but if they don't know how to interpret that they'll they'll it's like the growth mindset isn't going to get them to the skill development right or at least to the mental well-being of feeling like they have confidence and can do well so um in some in some research that we've done in the last few years what we've tried to do is to marry together the growth mindset idea with great work originally coming out of Ali crumb and Jeremy Jameson's Labs who were building on lots of great appraisal psychologists Wendy Mendes and others to say okay in the inevitable experience where if you if you fully believe our growth mindset and then now you load your plate with challenges but now you've got a physiological stress response how are you going to appraise that better and that's kind of been the New Frontier of growth mindset uh work in the last four or five years yeah could you tell us more about this uh stresses enhancing mindset I think it's a really interesting one especially when it's woven in with the growth mindset yeah so let me tell you kind of that on its own and then and then the the story of how how we had this Insight is actually kind of interesting too uh but just the basic idea as um you know people who've heard about ali crumb would know and Jeremy Jameson is that you know a an experience of your heart racing your palm sweating anxiety in your stomach that is itself a new stressor that then needs to be interpreted and appraised by the person experiencing it um that idea on its own is is kind of revolutionary for people people tend to think that your physiological arousal is this objective experience that is universally bad Ali Crum calls that a stress is debilitating belief um and I think that's a good that's a good label for it it's this idea that that heart racing Palm sweaty butterflies in your stomach is a sign of your impending failure in Doom and and it will always interfere with your performance and and and the implication therefore is if you were about to do well on whatever you're doing going to do then you wouldn't feel that way right um Ali crumb calls us being stressed about being stressed and that I think it's a really common experience right now where people are like wow you know if I was a confident good person who was about to do well I wouldn't be sitting here feeling so stressed about how stressed I am and it becomes this metacognitive layered Loop of of just being stuck in your own mind and and and interpreting your arousal in the most negative possible light so um that stress is debilitating belief doesn't people aren't like wrong for having come to that belief because it's everywhere in our culture one thing I do in my class A lot is I just have people Google image search um Stress Management memes and first of all a surprising number about cats I don't know why people think cat pictures are like the way to convey complex scientific ideas like it'll be like a cat with like a cookie jar and it'll be like growth mindset I don't understand what that what the point of that is um but you know page two or three after all the cats then you get to a lot of things that are you'll see a person with a battery that's empty and it's like they didn't d-stress or 10 tips for de-stressing and it'll be like go on a walk drink chamomile tea like and the the the underlying implication is that if you're stressed then you need to distract yourself you need to get rid of that stress but an alternative explanation in the growth mindset world is well maybe you have something that's very important to you and you've pushed yourself to embrace some Challenge in a really admirable way and that has filled your plate in some way the like if I was about to give a presentation to a senior vice president at work and I'm stressed about it I should not like go take a bubble bath and like go for a walk like I should get ready to kick ass the presentation you know and so I think what what alium and others have identified is that you can think differently about that stress you can say this is actually a sign that I'm preparing to optimize my performance and maybe the heart racing isn't my body being afraid of damage maybe it's my body getting more oxygenated blood to my brain and my muscles to like help me do really well and that's called a stress be enhancing belief and what's so interesting I think about this work and I want to give credit to lots of other people um is that if you're in the stress's debilitating mindset you don't realize that there's an alternative you just think that that's the way it is so it never occurs to you to say oh this stress is helping me right but once you tell people this what happens is in our studies we actually see a change in stress physiology it it changing your mindset about stress in turn changes how your body reacts which then becomes a different stressor that you can interpret um and so the big Insight was pairing the these ideas about reframing stress as an an inevitable Force that's going to destroy your goal Pursuit into a resource to be cultivated and pairing that together with the first step which is the growth mindset that causes you to like be open to the challenge in the first place I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 by now most of you have heard me tell my story about how I've been taking ag1 once or twice a day every day since 2012 and indeed that's true I started taking ag1 and I still take ag1 once or twice a day because it gives me vitamins and minerals that I might not be getting enough of from Whole Foods that I eat as well as adaptogens and micronutrients those adaptogens and micronutrients are really critical because even though I strive to eat most of my foods from unprocessed or minimally processed whole Foods it's often hard to do so especially when I'm traveling and especially when I'm busy so by drinking a packet of ag1 in the morning and often times also again in the afternoon or evening I'm ensuring that I'm getting everything I need I'm covering all of my foundational nutritional needs and I like so many other people that take ag1 regularly just report feeling better and that shouldn't be surprising because it supports gut health and of course gut health supports immune system health and brain health and it's supporting a ton of different cellular and organ processes that all interact with one another so while certain supplements are really directed towards one specific outcome like sleeping better or being more alert ag1 really is foundational nutritional support it's really designed to support all of the systems of your brain and body that relate to mental health and physical health if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer they'll give

performance our relationship to stress Etc could be resolved if we could overcome the deficit in language um here's what I'm thinking um we're talking about reframing stress to make it performance enhancing as opposed to Performance diminishing I wonder if we replace the word stress with just like levels of arousal but then people hear arousal and they think certain kinds of arousal so what we want to do is you know the way I think about is like a Continuum of of Readiness but then that doesn't work because Readiness could be Readiness for Sleep which is a low level of arousal you don't want to be highly alert and then you're not ready for sleep right yeah so there's a real deficit of language where I think if there was some other word I don't I can't come up with it on the Fly where you know one's internal level of Readiness as opposed to stress and maybe it looks a lot like autonomic arousal where heart rate is increased and blood pressure is increased and people would say oh yeah that's my body being ready for something as opposed to stress about doing it yeah and it it it's kind of a trivial um you know recasting of stress on the one hand but in terms of you know kids learning about life and stress and arousal and these internal signals and adults learning about those and incorporating those into their life goals I think it would be pretty meaningful and I I again I don't a solution to this but I feel like everyone hear stress is bad you hear stress is enhancing okay great but I think it's really about developing a language that lets us interpret what's going on in our bodies and compare that to what we are facing in the moment and just decide is this well matched or poorly matched to what we need to do is it great for going to sleep is it great for learning is it great for um catching that train that's you know soon to leave the station and I just wonder um why the deficit in language yeah I think it's a profound question because small changes in language perpetuate problematic lay theories because they have the baggage on them and I think that let's think this through so um what the psychophysiologists like to point out is that there's a distinction between the stressor which is the let's call it the internally or externally imposed demand could be something thwarting your goals or the exam the difficult conversation the um the going to for some people going to the doctor or the dentist the hard conversation with you know with somebody you care about it could be um or a physical stressor right like a football game or you know running a marathon right so anything that imposes demands on your body and mind and therefore will require resources whether like you know metabolic resources to do well that's a stressor okay then there's your appraisal of it that's what you name it how you interpret it how you frame it in your mind and then there's your response people in general conflate the stressor with a stress response when they say stress they're like I'm really stressed right now well what really what you mean is that there were stressors you appraised them as more than you can handle and then you had a threat type stress response which means that your body is preparing for damage and defeat and that is like an inheritance of how the you know sympathetic nervous system evolved which was to Keep Us Alive from threats mainly physical threats and so if you have a stressor some demand praise is something you cannot handle and then your threat type response your body's basically assuming you're going to lose whatever physical fight you're in like the bear is going to you know tear you apart and then your main goal at that point is to stay alive and like bleed out more slowly right so you end up with more blood kept centrally in the body cavity Less in the extremities right the body releases cortisol because it's an anti-inflammatory it's going to like help with tissue repair 45 minutes down the road so there a whole like Cascade of physiological responses that come in part from the mental appraisal that this stressor is more than you can handle now we're we're very rarely confronted with those kinds of physical stressors these days it's often social stressors but a lot of social stressers are a threat of social death right like a ninth grader coming into high school getting bullied by all their friends and are excluded because the eth their friends in eighth grade now treat you like you don't exist right the threat of social death is pretty bad right or you're a new legal associate and you've filed your first brief and all the partners are like this is garbage we're not going to send it to the client right like all of a sudden you're on trial socially in front of these people who could cut you loose at any time that's a very vibrant social stressor that evokes the same kind of physiological response as we suppose a physical one would right and so we're very careful to distinguish in our studies a stressor from the stress response because often the stressor isn't really a bad thing like you know getting critical feedback on your first legal brief as a junior associate well that could be awesome it could be like oh great I have these awesome Partners at my great Law Firm are now giving me personalized feedback that's useful or I'm a ninth grader and I have to make new friends but I don't know that's maybe you need new friends like that could be a good thing right and and same with a test same with you know presentation to senior vice president whatever it is stressor often in in our daily lives are not good or bad now of course there's traumatic stressors that you know are really bad for people um but then the appraisal is really where there's a lot of Leverage and if you think that the stressor is inevitably bad and that your response to it is always harmful then it's really hard for you to think that you have the resources to meet the demand that you're facing and you end up in this threat cycle so in a lot of our research what we try to do is give people a different story to tell themselves about a stressor and about their response so that way they end up in a better place now I don't know what that better language is but I will say I once gave a talk at a middle school in a high school and I used slides that Jeremy Jameson who was my collaborator had sent me that had the word arousal on it on every single slide and that was a big mistake in a room of like middle school kids right I did not I I strongly recommend different terminology uh so and I should I was a middle school teacher I should have known that you can't say that word in a in a high school so right yeah I think that that there needs to be a better language I think if people um of all ages understood the autonomic nervous system this aspect of our nervous system that um is on a Continuum that leads us to either be I guess at the extremes you would say um coma would be the deepest state of right parasympathetic yeah non- arousal then ascending from you know very you know deeply asleep lightly asleep groggy awake uh awake and alert um awake and alert to the point of being you know highly alert um and then you get into kind of uh low-level panic and then allout panic attack right I that's kind of the Continuum the autonomic Continuum I I feel like if people understood that and they and they could simply ask okay where where is my body and mind along that Continuum and then compare it to whatever it is they face then uh we'd have a better sense of whether or not we were in the correct maybe even optimal state for for dealing with challenge or uh or not and along those lines what is the optimal internal state for dealing with challenge that is um just outside our ability um you know maybe in an exam where I can naturally get 85% of the answers correct but maybe 15% I think this is what the machine learning and AI tells us is probably the appropriate level of difficulty for something in order to best learn I know that's probably depends on if you're motivated and if you know a lot of things like but yeah I mean I think if you think of the autonomic arousal on just one axis mhm what where where you start running into problems we find is is that I think you're right that there's like you know coma to like some arousal or meaningful arousal but the it's the middle to the end part where there's two different tracks and One Track is very high arousal but you're terrified of the damage and defeat and the humiliation and the failure and so that's that's um demanding all your attention that's what we call threat type stress there's another version that is again very high arousal but that's like you're stoked and you feel confident you're going to do well and that's also very high arousal and if you just look at arous of measures like pre-ejection period right um could you explain pre-ejection period um it's it's just a it's a simple measure of just the sympathetic nervous system that we use in all of our studies so sympathetic just remind folks is one aspect of the autonomic nervous system um has nothing to do with sympathy just the more alert means more more contribution of the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system sorry it's a mouthful and then um less alert would be um more contribution of the parasympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system and P is just a measure that we use in our laboratory studies um and and another could have been like skin conductance how it's which is a about the wet coming out of your skin and then we use an electrode to figure out how much is there um that uh those kinds of measures can't distinguish what we call a challenge type State that's almost like people have heard of flow where you're optimally balanced between important challenge you care about and resources and ability to you know overcome or at least deal with that challenge on the positive side in the other higher rousel state which is threat and that's again you're highly everything's highly engaged your whole stress system but you don't think you can deal with it so the that becomes really important because um here's a very practical example if you look at devices people are wearing to detect their stress that might say high or low arousal but it can't distinguish between super good positive challenge type stress and really negative threat type stress one of the examples that psychophysiologists like to say a lot I got this from Jeremy Jameson is imagine you're at the top of a double black diamond about to ski down if you are a good skier your heart rate isn't probably low you're probably amped up you're stoked you're like this is awesome I can't wait to do this you're fully confident you're going to make all the turns and have a blast if you're a terrible skier you're just imagining the yard sale that's about to happen you're about to crash you're going to fall down the mountain you might die also High arousal if you're wearing like the regular watch that will just detect sympathetic n nervous system activation it wouldn't be able to tell the difference between really stoked to do something positive and terrified of like crashing and dying and so we I like that example because often in social situations or performance situations you you want to be high arousal to perform your best but you you want your perception of that demand the demand that's requiring your body to respond to be matched with an equal belief or what we call appraisal of your resource to meet that demand um so I think my answer to the question is is well I think it's not so much about what's the optimal amount of Demand right so that the 85% likelihood of success rate problems are that's titrating demand I think it's how do you pair a a necessary level of demand for whatever goal you have with the perceptions of the resources and sometimes those resources are your internal like just confidence you know or sometimes it's your ability to reappraise and other times it's material resources like do you have a it could be in in real life do you have a friend that you could turn to or it might be have you been trained in a way where you're able to overcome this you have enough time so resources can be a big bucket and that's kind of the magic is because resources are appraised by the mind in our interventions we can give you a different way of viewing your resources so that way people feel like they can meet the demand and that pushes them them from a threat type response into a more challenge type response it makes sense if I think that um the stress for lack of a better term and the effort is going to get me where I need to go eventually I'm going to be far more willing to invest the effort yeah especially if I'm motivated I want the I want the thing that lies at the Finish Line you basically take the demand which was your intense stress and worry and turn it into a resource in your own mind and it it turns out that that actually helps people cope at a physiological level got it got it um we've been talking a lot about kind of the um the nuts and bolts of of growth mindset and stress is performance-enhancing uh mindset maybe we could um shift a little bit to the discussion about what you call the mentor mindset and and as we do that maybe we'll weave back in some of these some of these Concepts yeah yeah your book 10 to 25 um focuses heavily on uh social appraisal self- appraisal basically the idea that we want to be liked and we don't want to be disliked and it um and it hurts when people say mean things about us or when we hear negative feedback especially if it's provided publicly But ultimately what we do with that information is what determines you know whether or not we grow and move forward yeah um everyone loves a great report card nobody likes a poor report card so so um tell us about Mentor mindset and both for folks in the 10 to 25 age range but also for everybody you know um because it's clear that this impacts us throughout our lifespan yeah so the the the work I write about comes out of a dissertation led by Jeff Cohen at Stanford in the 90s with Claude steel and they coined a term that they called the mentors dilemma and the mentor's Dilemma is the idea that if you're a leader a manager a coach teacher whatever it is parent it's very hard to simultaneously criticize somebody's work and motivate them to overcome and embrace that criticism and the reason it's a dilemma is because the leader on the one hand wants to maintain high standards by being critical maybe in order to help the person grow but that could crush the person's motivation the alternative is with withhold your criticism don't say the truth hide all the critical feedback and be nice and super supportive but and that meets your goal of being friendly and caring but it doesn't help the person grow so it feels like we have to walk through the world stuck between two bad choices either you're a demanding autocratic you know dictator who care doesn't care about human feelings or you are a like low standards wimp pushover that that's you know giving in to the like wimpy demands of the weak Next Generation and neither of those have uniformly positive connotations and the classic example in Jeff's work was a student at Stanford who writes a first draft of an essay and then gets really harsh critical feedback from a professor are they willing to revise their work or do they say this teacher hates me they're biased I dislike them and leave the leave the comments unaddressed so the solution to that in in that research on the mentors dilemma has been to say two things one is appeal to the very high standard you have for someone's work but also always accompany that appeal to the high standard with an assurance that if they implement the feedback and use the support that they're capable of meeting the high standard I like to think of it as like if you go to the roller coaster and they say you have to be this tall to ride right so just saying you have to be this tall and you're not see you later isn't reassuring to somebody right but if you can say here's the standard and I believe you can meet it but it's going to be hard that means a lot it means I'm taking you seriously um it means I like believe in your growth and it's a kind of leadership practice that makes growth mindset be something that comes to life and feel true it's not just an idea in your head that you're growing it's like I live in a social world where people are going to push me to grow and not leave me alone are you familiar with the um book of the late I think the pronunciation is Randy P for the last lecture no he was a computer scientist he developed a lot of um early online um portals for kids in particular um uh young women to learn programming I think it was called Alice um uh and he is known for what called the last lecture he was diagnosed with cancer he eventually passed away but he talked about um in his book um lessons that were important for life and one of the things that he said was um the the thing to worry about is not when your mentors and coaches um are pushing you it's when they stop pushing you that you should really worry because that means they've basically given up on you right so that always that always rung in my in my mind yeah that what what I call the the person who just is is no longer maintaining high standards for you I call that a protector mindset that it's it's almost like it's going to be too much trouble to see you dealing with stress from being pushed that I am going to protect you from that stress I I maybe I care about you but I'm not going to not going to hold you to a high standard and I see that a lot um in coaches I see it in teachers I see it in parents um for me the the opposite problematic version is what I call an enforcer mindset this is like here's the standard and I'm going to hold you to it and it's up to you to meet it or not right that's kind of like the college professor that says look to your left look to your right half of you you know are going to be gone by the end of this um for me the solution is to think about taking the best parts of both of those two what's the high standards High support So enforcer great you've got the standards let's add your support protector you care a lot great let's add the standards and what Jeff Cohen and Claud steel found in their initial study is that students were far more likely to view negative criticism as a sign that the teacher cared for them if it was accompanied by a transparent and clear communication of these two elements of high standards and high support if it was just the critical feedback the professor could have meant the same positive thing I'm caring about you but they didn't make it clear to the person then then participants were less likely to think that the that that the professor was on their side in an artwor in some small studies we um we showed that even seventh graders when they get critical feedback on their essays are about twice as likely to implement the teachers's critical feedback with even a very short invocation of the high standards and the high support So to get to your question about Mentor mindset at some point I got worried that our experiment on high standards High support messages which we called wise feedback in those studies would be viewed as um I don't know like a magic phrase like I my joke my laugh Line This is a lame laugh line but I'm a professor so that's the best I can do my laugh line was always I just live in fear that Pearson and other textbook companies are going to sell wise feedback posted notes say they can magically erase the achievement Gap right and I always said that as a joke and then two things happen one is a popular author a guy named Dan Coyle literally called it magic feed back in his book didn't site us but like you didn't sight us no Dan but also like magic Fe I'll say it so you don't have to not cool attribution is important it's just not it's not magic at all the the the magic of high standards and high support is not the 18 words it's I'm taking you seriously when a moment When You're vulnerable and I have power over you that is just so deeply human and so powerful but there's nothing about the magic words it's the it's the experience of dignity and respect when you are questioning whether you are either worthy of it or going to be given it by authorities it's interesting we had um Dr Becky Kennedy on here to talk about parenting yeah and she said um many important things but among them was the fact that um children perhaps all people want to feel real yeah and they want to feel safe yeah um an important concept that I think many people heard and and are really internalizing I I know I am um for sure and this idea of feeling real has to do with um not just feeling seen but that U people believe us even if they disagree with us yeah like they they believe us she has another thing that's super profound is uh the the kind of two things argument that I can both have high expectations for my kids and love my kids and I think that's a very good version of wise feedback Mentor mindset that as parents it either feels like I can expect a lot of my kids but then I'm a monster and they're going to yell at me or I'm going to be a pushover and then they're going to be unruly and I think part of her wisdom is to help explain to parents how you can do both of those things and indeed one can right I think but it requires having a kind of dynamic stance or dynamic mindset as the the teacher the leader the the coach the parent I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge one of our sponsors waking up waking up is a meditation app that offers hundreds of guided meditations mindfulness trainings yoga needer sessions and more I started meditating over three decades ago and what I found in the insing years is that sometimes it was very easy for me to do my daily meditation practice I was just really diligent but then as things would get more stressful which of course is exactly when I should have been meditating more my meditation practice would fall off with waking up they make it very easy to find and consistently use a given meditation practice it has very convenient reminders and they come in different durations so even if you just have one minute or five minutes to meditate you can still get your meditation in which research shows is still highly beneficial in addition to the many different meditations on the waking up app they also have Yoga Nidra sessions which are a form of non-sleep deep rest that I personally find is extremely valuable for restoring mental and physical Vigor I tend to do a Yoga Nidra lasting anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes at least once a day and if I ever wake up in the middle of the night and I need to fall back asleep I also find Yoga Nidra to be extremely useful if you'd like to try the waking up app you can go to waking up.com huberman to try a free 30-day trial again that's waking up.com huberman I want to get back to some of the the mechanics of had to go about that but why do you think this stuff is so hard like like if we think about um I don't know kind of a curbside evolutionary uh Theory um meaning I don't have any formal training in evolutionary psychology you could step back and say like I don't know maybe we just used to be so busy from morning to sleep that we didn't really have time to do anything except the stuff we needed to complete in order to feed our families and take care of our our communities Etc and and now a number of things are outsourced and um and so here we have this notion of strivings but then again you know we went from Hunter gather uh culture to writing war in peace and everything else um Technologies of all kinds so you know there must be something in the human brain that um causes us to strive and what we're really talking about here is striving in our relationship with striving um so if we were to step back and just say okay what do you think determines whether or not someone uh feels they can do better is it early success you know I they tried at something I mean everyone most everyone I assume who tries to learn to walk walks um learns to speak speaks you know they're rare exceptions but um you know what do you think this whole thing about strivings is about and when we talk about growth mindset stresses enhancing mindset the mentor mindset um I mean are we trying to get back to activating systems that are hardwired within us and that have been kind of um masked by daily life um or are we trying to kind of better ourselves and our species through you know like really trying to do something that's never been done in human history before right it's a big it's a big question it's a big question but I mean I think that that all I can do is conjecture you know as a scientist but the um I'm often reminded of something I heard from Ron doll who's a neuroscientist at Berkeley and not Ronald doll the the children's not rald doll Ron Ron doll although Ron is just just so such an awesome guy it's like just polymath who can do everything and just so curious and generous uh he uh what he always says to me is like look is like David what do you think the human brain wants to do like I I don't know feel good he's like no wants to feel better and I think what he was trying to get me to see is that it's the kind of pursuit of some kind of Delta um and a change yeah a change from the state and and I think the argument is that even if you are if what you thought was your biggest need if that was satisfied then there's always like another thing I think as part of the argument and so but it's also this idea that if you think of the human brain as trying to learn at all times like what is it trying to learn and the at least in the animal studies as you know often it's like how do I either feel better or avoid you know feeling worse in a lot of ways and I think that as I think about adolescence that's a period where your theory of how to feel better is dramatically changing because you're no longer fully cared for by adults right all of a sudden your criteria for feeling good about yourself is your social standing not just in your parents eyes but in the eyes of the community and the mill you you're a part of and and that comes a lot from your contribution value if you think in our evolutionary history like the being ostracized and alone is certain death in ancient human culture right I mean you can't the tribes wandering around in the savannah you're alone at a minimum you have no one to watch out for you when you fall asleep and so and you humans can't sleep in trees because our muscles aren't don't contract when we're uh asleep unlike animals and so you're just Exposed on the ground if you're alone eventually you're going to die right so the the fear of moving from a parents taking care of your safety all night to now you have to trust peers to take care of you and watch over you that comes to the Forefront of young people's minds like kind of the minute puberty strikes and so what it means to feel better often is that I'm socially valued by the group there's something they're going to keep me around for some reason now they don't often keep score in an explicit way I mean now things are on social media maybe they're kind of keeping score but like the rules of how you're doing socially are so implicit you have to read between the lines they're inferred social hierarchy is very complex for adolescence and so they overdo it thinking through like how how am I standing like where am I relative to others now that process is started by puberty and we know from lots of species work that it then leads to changes in the brain so the dop energic system of course is like driven in part by changes in Gad maturation Ron likes to talk about these great studies of song birds of how do they learn the meeting calls and if song birds don't have testosterone when they are learning the mating calls they don't do the like over-the-top obsessive practice so they don't Master them and then they don't M and they die alone interesting yeah I'm familiar with that um with that literature there's a great uh unfortunately now passed away uh biologist who was first in the UK and then uh was up at UC Davis uh Peter maror and who studied the U the bird song learning yeah and it's it's um it's amazing yeah it's amazing work and it mimics a lot of the uh the development of human speech although not exactly like there's this babbling phase yeah where babies and birds experiment with different to tones and they're they're learning to use the fings and larynx or you know in Birds it's a slightly different system yeah and some birds are seasonal singers but I I wasn't familiar with this result that the testosterone drives a kind of obsessive uh practice Yeah it's obessive practice in order to demonstrate well status but really your value I mean there it's mate value right right but I think the same thing is true for lots of things that teenagers trial could be playing guitar you know uh could be gymnastics I mean think about how many of their Olympic athletes are like 14 right and they're waking up at 4 in the morning they're practicing obsessively how many like pro-social hackers who take down evil foreign governments right are teenagers right there things that that take so much practice and so much learning happen at the exact same age as adults are saying these kids are lazy and don't want to work right so I tend to focus on get to your question about why do people strive to get better I think in adolescence you look around in your social millu and see what counts for status not in a superficial way it sometimes happen but often in a deeply meaningful way what am I going to bring to the table one would hope and then well I remember Junior High School being far more superficial but I'm 48 so I remembered it in the kind of the John Hughes film era where people were very divided in terms of jocks and skateboarders and rockers and nerds now it seems a little bit more Mish mashed um but I think also people will uh in adolescence I feel like um kids find their Niche and then try and Excel within that Niche yeah you know as opposed to high school or Junior High School being um one huge hierarchy yeah you know there's kind of these sub hierarchies yeah Dan McFarland is a sociologist at Stanford did this really interesting study with the ad Health Data and you turns out you could characteriz the social hierarchies in different high schools by kind of single pyramid high schools versus multi- pyramid high schools and there's way better adjustment in the multi- pyramid high schools because there's many roots to status The evolutionary psychologist Bruce Ellis talks about having many roles and I I like that because in the old model you know if if there's one pyramid and you're kind of near the top but not at the top you've got a lot of incentive to destroy reputations be you know Mean Girls type of behavior um Bob Ferris sociologist at Davis finds that the most bullying in high school is the people that are like the 6th to 85th percentile on popularity it's like you're near the top but not all the way at the top yeah this Maps very well to Robert sapolsky's work on primate troops yeah yeah the the alphas are stressed but the the sub Alphas are they have options yeah um and this is true for female and male animals um just as it's true we were talking about testosterone a few minutes ago an obsessive practice I'll remind people that um in women uh they actually have more adult women have more testosterone than they do estrogen if you look at a pure nanogram per deciliter comparison it's just that overall it tends to be on average less than in men so the the statement about testosterone and obsessive um uh learning uh or efforts to learn it I have to imagine is not restricted to males or females and I think I understand as a man praising testosterone that I could come across but I I so I always need to remember that the research is is very interesting on t uh Evelyn Crohn's lab um did these great studies where they had kids starting age 10 to like 25 and they had them come in the lab twice and they took testosterone levels but also had them do a bunch of tasks in the scanner and you can look at nucleus incumbant prefrontal cortex Etc areas associated with reward yeah and pursuit motivation yeah yeah and um and they also have them do risk-taking tasks and what they find is that in both boys and girls testosterone goes up over time starts a little earlier in girls because going to Ary is one or two years before boys but the change score from one point to the next was equally predictive of neural reactivity during risk-taking tasks for both boys and girls so although boys end up with higher tea throughout adolescence um the the increase is equally predictive which is another way of saying it's just as important for these social learning things in girls and and T by the way is just a a really testosterone testosterone is a really good proxy other hormones are involved too they're just more complicated like DHEA you could um study as well but that's part of the same metabolic pathway of cortisol and testosterone so it's just Messier and harder to interpret so it's not we're not making claims specifically about testosterone it's just like a really good proxy for where you are in gonat maturation in both boys and girls gonat maturation really matters for this kind of status social seeking part of your brain yeah so if I understand correctly the slope of the line of one's uh testosterone increase for both boys and girls is predictive of striving if it's a steep upward you know yeah line then then that that's associated with more striving in a given practice to the extent that like neural activation during a social reward task or a risk taking task is a proxy for striving and and that's what that's what a lot of people have argued yeah do you think that striving reflects the action of a you know kind of a basic neural circuit that then can be applied to other things um or lots of different things the reason I ask is that you know the the notion of growth mindset is so attractive it's such a sticky idea um because or I think because one imagines okay if I can get really good at one thing chess then I can apply the same kind of relationship to the internal state of stress or arousal or what have you when trying to navigate a new a new environment of another kind a physical practice or a relationship challenge or something of that sort that that you know what we're really talking about here is an algorithm that can be directed at different uh Pursuits as opposed to growth mindset is applied in one context and not another um so what what of that um people who are incredibly good at accessing growth mindset in one domain of life does that mean that they'll be good at accessing gross mindset in another domain of Life what's the the um the carryover or the spill over it's a great question it comes up a lot um the Michigan State psychologist Jason moer studied this and they measured growth mindset about your intelligence the classic one your personality your morality your social relationships your emotions Etc and the question is is there kind of like one growth mindset that applies in all the different ways or are there totally narrow mindsets that have nothing to do with each other or is it something in between and the finding was that there is an overall Association if you think one trait can change and be developed you tend to think another trait can be changed and developed and just empirically it's hard to separate that from people's General tendency to disagree or agree with items that could be what the common factor is but it kind of makes sense however there's also very domain specific mindsets so there are people who think yeah I can get smarter but I can't change my shyness and other people who think my relationships are never going to get better but I can learn to play the cello you know and vice versa and when you want to predict Behavior turns out that the closer you are to that domain the better the prediction is going to be so if I want to know if you're going to quit playing the cello or not I'm going to ask you your cello mindset said that's going to do way better than in general can human qualities change but if I'm going to intervene at what level should the intervention happen if I only change your cello mindset well you're right like what if cello isn't your thing in life now are you going to be fixed mindset for your relationships in school and that I not really help you so um the kind of the empirical answer currently is if it's a domain that someone could be really defensive about it's better to be a little vaguer about it classic example is Iran how parents work on the Israel Palestine conflict which is obviously a big issue right now their science paper in 2011 changed mindsets about group conflict in general can an ethnic group or a national group ever change they didn't go to people in Israel and say Palestinians can change cuz they're like no they can't that's not it's not possible but if they said you know sometimes leaders change and When leaders change the group's priorities change and they become more amenable to negotiation and when that happens things can change if that was done at a more General level then both Israelis and Palestinians were more open to a peace process so I think if it's something you're very defensive about I I tend to think back up and do the more abstract mindset another example is I remember I was in graduate school at Stanford and one of my raas was so excited about our work and he went to a party and talked about it it's like that very Stanford thing to do as talk about research at a party and he's like oh yeah math ability can change you don't have to be done with math forever and the person he talked to was so offended she was like are you telling me I could have done better in high school math and I just didn't try hard enough and my life could be different I could be an engineer right now like I like my life why are you telling it was it went down this road of like how dare you tell me it could have been different and I who knows maybe he had bad delivery and had 14 margaritas and that's who knows what happened but I think the idea is like if if someone's got a reason to think about that fixed mindset as comforting in some way that they don't have to feel bad about something that could have been different it's probably not smart to go after that in a very specific way but if someone's not defensive generally the the closer to the domain the better because they're going to see the application otherwise they have to use it by analogy and an we know analogic reasoning is is tough cuz it's Hit or Miss we love stories of people that have come from a place of being really back on their heels um or even just dissolved into a puddle of their own tears too uh doing well again maybe even soaring again it's sort of the the the common thing is that this is the the classic American uh story although it's true of people all over the world I imagine right it's not always true in America either but yeah right some people yeah some people crash and burn but it seems like everybody loves a comeback story right I something about that um the the uh the hero's journey the the um hero of a thousand faes is that the that's the Joseph Campbell um yeah um and it's written into so many movies and books and and real life uh uh stories I can't help but superimpose today's discussion onto something like that right that um you know that life is a series of um efforts to apply growth mindset from learning how to walk right presumably is part of that right I don't know any child that just stands up and walks um early on to to the things that we we really think uh we can perform well at to um finding ourselves like really back on our heels and and so are there any data um or theories even that point to the use of growth mindset and stress is enhancing mindset in coming from a real place of deficit not just from trying to do better and learn new things but from a real place of deficit a real place of challenge I think it's important for our audience to hear because I think a number of people do feel back on their heels um in one or more domains of life yeah it's a good question I mean I think that the data suggests that growth mindset becomes most relevant to your next Behavior the more challenge you face and so for a long time what that meant is if you maybe we're a low achieving student and we're going to and we're going to evaluate growth mindset by looking at your grades you should see bigger gains for low achieving students compared to high achieving students part of that could be an artifact if you already have straight A's we can't give you more A's it's impossible right but um you know in in general psychological treatments like a growth mindset tend to work better for people who counterfactually wouldn't have them and could plausibly benefit from them where the story becomes more interesting is that often your kind of own individual difficulties are associated with your environment and the environment is really what allows you to apply your growth mindset over time so it might might make you right now need a growth mindset more but it might make it harder for you to act on it and so the for people who like complex three-way interactions the idea is that a treatment for growth mindset should work best for individuals who face the most challenges but are in the most supportive environments and one is like Baseline why do you need it and the other is over time what's going to help you keep using it so to be very concrete about this in uh in one paper we published in 2019 uh the national study of learning mindsets it was published in nature we evaluated growth mindset in this large National sample and the the question wasn't does it work on average the question was where does it work and for whom as we had there were lots of replications already and and sometimes people tried it and like well didn't work here okay well what's that's a puzzle how do we figure that out and the finding was low achieving students in high schools um that had more supportive classroom culture where you got where you got the long run effects and in the in the in the four-year results it's low achieving students in high schools that offered more advanced courses so if you're a low achieving student you go with mindset it's like great give me pre-cal oh we don't offer that here right or it's a toxic environment in some way the teachers are untrained they're first year teachers there's lots of poverty in the school if you don't have the structure to support the striving you don't get the long run effects especially if the effects you're looking at are increases in equality of opportunity so for me the message is like you think about growth mindset and psychological interventions as one tool in a toolkit to help people achieve their goals but we can't forget about the entire field of Sociology that tells us a lot about the allocation of resources through which people can even be afforded the chance to pursue their goals and so what I like about that finding which by the way came from a collaboration with sociologists who thought you psychologists are absurd they're like you think your little mindset is going to like change inequality like you're going to make an argument to 15-year-olds and that's your plan for improving the American economy that's absurd I was like well I don't know might it could do something and uh psychologists are skeptical sociologists they're like look how how often do we have huge changes in law and policy but people don't don't take advantage of the resources that are available to them let's change the behavior so they take advantage we kind of came together and said what does it look like to consider both the structure and the internal psychology and I think this was a very important point because people tend to choose one or the other together either we're going to lobby for new laws to reallocate resources or we're going to optimize the psychology of the individual and I think our perspective is to find ways to bring those two together and kind of do both um and ultimately it's not a deficit based perspective of you have a deficit and we're fixing that growth mindset is more like well it's an asset based perspective what I mean by that is we're not giving someone motivation in growth mindset we're presuming people already kind of want to do well they want to impress others they want to be meaningful they want to contribute but there's a barrier the barrier is when you strive and then inevitably struggle if you're pushing yourself beyond your abilities people make you feel dumb for that struggle so we are we're trying to remove that cultural and social barrier that's preventing people from their natural goal Pursuit and and that comes deeply from Carol D's original work at the intersection of Developmental and Social Psychology the basic claim in developmental psychology is the human being is an active learner who's trying to figure out the world right this is classic Allison kopnick you know Susan Gman infants are meaning makers trying to interpret the world and wanting to do well and eventually they're socialized into beliefs that prevent them from acting on that basic neural desire to learn grow develop ET and and growth mindset is really it's not trying to be a magic pill to give an unmotivated disaffected kid a shot in the arm of adrenaline so they go out and learn no it presumes agency and love of learning and kind of like Dr Becky said presumes the goodness in kids and tries to remove whatever kind of garbage beliefs they've learned from social context and then our long-term studies then show how you once you do that if they're also in a context where you can act on that love of learning then you can see long run effects that are far more than what a lot of people have said you could get even in even in a disadvantaged context it's so interesting because what we're talking about here is psychological theory playing out in the real world but also um kind of like no deep Notions of the human Spirit like we are a species that um seems to organize our experience in terms of of stories of ourselves and others but that um when it comes to things like strivings and learning um are really always in a constant state of either being more to borrow the words of a friend of mine either back on our heels flat footed or forward Center of mass right um and what we're talking about today is being forward Center of mass at least in certain areas of life I mean that the fact that the reward systems of the brain where you mentioned them earlier these misol liic reward Pathways that basically deploy dopamine um and other things of course um are so associated with striving and achieving striving and achieving and presumably underly much if not all of our human evolution assuming we're still evolving lately sometimes I wonder but um some people would argue we're Devol devolving but I I would argue we're still evolving um especially with this new burst in AI it's all about math nowadays folks a few years ago it all about neuroscience and Neuroscience is still really important and the two share but it's all about math lately um so I I like to just think of the human animal as so different than the other animals of the planet like we're the curators of the planet the house cats might be striving but they're clearly not doing as well as we are in terms of managing the way the world goes so what do you think that this is like a basic um algorithm within human beings to look at ourselves look at the environment see challenges overcome challenges develop Technologies it's just kind of like a a it's like the same way my bulldog used to like to gnaw on things you know you like to chew and pull we just want to learn and grow do you do you think it's inherent to who we are as a species maybe even what sets our species apart from all the others I mean that's that's a profound question I think that's that's a good one to debate that what what I've been really taken by recently is Carol dak's Secret Life as a neuroscientist she has this great psych review paper that contradicts a lot of received wisdom about prefrontal planning regions of the brain and the kind of amydala and the hippocampus the you know the affective regions and the memory creation regions and the the classic argument and going back to Plato and the FIS right is that the rational acting part of the brain plans out what it wants makes all these calculations and then has to tame the emotional part in order to make those goals into a reality and so the emotion you know the amydala the mesolimbic that's this unruly horse that the Chariot has to harness you know and I think that Carol argued and I think other people have argued too I've I've seen Adriana Galvan and Rond doll and others argue this that um the affective regions are often the teacher and the prefontal is the student and that makes sense if you think about how humans are goal directed think about how a kid learns to walk they don't do that for theoretical reasons they don't just like look at people walking and be like I want to learn how to do that right it's I have four kids it's usually because there's a toy at the other side of the room that they really really want and that I don't want them to have and the only way for them to go get it because I won't get it for them is for them to learn how to walk so the the motor learning is the effect of the desire in the goal Pursuit and what what Carol argued is that feder's had is totally wrong it's not that the prefrontal charioteer is taming the emotional it's really that the the affect part is training the prefrontal to be better at pursuing the goals that matter in the social millu that you have and a lot of people like um Adriana Galan and Jen feifer and Nim Tottenham in the Adolescent space have shown this and I don't understand all the details fully but the the argument that I've heard is that once the scanning studies were able to switch from fmri focused on simple activation to studies looking at connectivity then they and where you could get temporal ordering then you could start seeing actually that especially in adolescence it's the the affective regions are training or teaching or telling the prefrontal regions what to do so I guess the the that's a long way of answering the question of I think that I think goal Pursuit is fundamental to Human Nature and I think that the brain and our adaptation is designed to help us learn how to be a lot better at pursuing whatever goals will help us survive in our environment and the brain has to be adaptive to that environmental input because the environment's always changing if it had only one way of pursuing its goals then we would never survive so it has to be the case that the planning rational observing part of the brain is actually responsive to what works in your context for goal Pursuit so again I'm summarizing other people's here but that's how I that's how I see it yeah I completely agree that emotions Drive the more um let's call tactical circuitry of the prefrontal cortex of course we should be fair to the the Neuroscience the prefrontal cortex is part of the lyic system people often think because it's in the cortex it's higher order and um that's simply not true but um well if we both agree and it sounds like we do that emotions Drive tactical decisions that drive action and learning um maybe we could talk about the two major types of emotions um that one could imagine one is um I really want the toy I really want the piece of food I really need um something for survival or for well-being and so I'm going to be be motivated and then the prefrontal cortex will work out the strategies and um balance out the relationship to stress Etc and remind ourselves that stress can be performance- enhancing and eventually we we we get the thing or the skill or the whatever the other would be um fear fear of social shame fear of staying in a place that's not good for us financially emotionally socially Etc um is there any work that um identifies whether or not the the core emotion driving motivation is relevant and is there role for growth mindset there that's interesting um I guess it put simply um take it down out of the Ivory Tower a little bit which is what we're doing here anyway um you can do things out of love you can do things out of fear you do for both reasons too yeah um you can do things to um please yourself you can do things to please others you can do things to avoid others being disappointed in you you being disappointed in yourself presumably it's both yeah but are is there any um I'm dying for you to tell me that when we do things out of love we learn faster but maybe that's not the case well I don't know I mean so two thoughts one is just you know honoring Danny conoman who just passed away his work with Amos tersi took on a version of this question in prospect theory and it's the idea of does the does the fear of a loss motivate us more than the prospect of a gain right and their argument is that both can be motivating as well as the possibility of a loss but that losses Loom larger that people are more willing to take a risky gamble to prevent a loss than they are to get a numerically equal like a mathematically equal gain um and so a lot of people have used that information in various ways and and I think that that has led people to conclude that the prospect of a gain doesn't mean anything but that really wasn't ever the point in prospect theory it's just that it's a little more powerful to to avoid a to be afraid of a loss it's honestly a problem with with thinking like yeah losses are a little worse you know if I already had $1,000 and you took it away feels a little worse than the chance to win a thousand I didn't win mathematically it's the same Delta um but uh but but I think that the way that behavioral economic work gets applied is to appeal to people's kind of basist and most you know fearful responses to things and if you think about what what drives a lot of excellence in in moral examp too um it it's this chance to feel like you've made a big contribution to others and and I don't think people are afraid that they didn't help as many people as they could have and maybe that drives some people but I think just the the effective forecasting of uh one day I'll feel good because of the meaningful work I did for others that was high integrity when no one else would have seen it you know that I think I think that's really motivating for a lot of people and I think we underappreciate that and therefore we appeal to very narrow self-interest and and my my favorite theorist on this is Dale Miller is at the Stanford Business school and he calls it the norm of self-interest that if you look around it looks like everyone's behaving for only uh very narrow short-term self-interested reasons and because you think that's the norm then you yourself kind of respond to those incentives and then you then inter turn create that Norm even more that other people see but it's not a state of affairs that anybody really likes everybody kinds of prefers a pro-social world where people are helping others but if you think that's just a really weird thing to do and not normal then people conform to the wrong Norm so in my work what I try to emphasize is is not that we're not afraid of losses and and the narrow short-term gain that you know that we're avoiding uh or the short-term loss we're avoiding but like I I really do think that people are capable of far more like beautiful contributions to the world when we assume that that's what they want and we create opportunities for them to do that I've seen that so much um if you look at some of the best managers right it's it's not just if you screw up you're going to lose your bonus like that's not what the best managers in the world are doing right they're like let's do something no one's ever done before let me support you to do it and then let me make sure that you look awesome in front of all the senior vice presidents because you did that like that's what the best managers do and coaches too this uh for my book I interviewed the NBA's best shooting coach this uh basketball player uh named Shane Bader who played college in pro basketball told me about him and I interviewed chip England is his name and he was at the San Antonio Spurs which they had a 17-year run of being a perennial Contender for the championships and constantly drafted players who were talented but had a bad jump shot so Kawhi Leonard is in example where fell late in the first round because people thought Couldn't Shoot Tony Parker is another example when Tony Parker used to shoot Greg papovich would say that's a turnover every time chip England is the a great shooting coach worked with them there's lots of Bill Barnwell had a great story about him called him the shot doctor and I interviewed chip and I was like chip how do you sell the vision to these players who are 18 to 21 are new found millionaires everyone's saying you're the best you're a first rounder and they don't want to change their shot because if they do they could mess it up make it worse it's like a golfer superstitious about their shot and he's like you know the the number one thing I have to do is build trust because I can't critique a player shot and make them change it if they think they're going to sacrifice more so he's like Dave the first thing you have to do is sell your vision I was like well what's your vision he's like he doesn't say if you don't change your shot you are going to lose millions of dollars and be out of the league so it's he doesn't motivate with the fear of loss he says the average time in the league is two and a half years right if you develop a great reliable jump shot where even as your athletic talents decline you're still reliable you're talking about a 10-year career and then you're not just helping you you're not just helping your family you're helping your family's family so even in the like money obsessed cutthoat world of professional sports the single best coach working with the top players appeals to the prospect of what you could do for others not the fear of loss and to me that's really telling like if if it worked to just motivate with the fear of loss that's what he would do because they would do whatever is effective it's a like at some level an efficient market but that's not what chip England does and I think the same is true for a lot of other great mentors and leaders so if I understand correctly when we find ourselves back on our heels or flat-footed we want to focus on the prospect of what we can do for others like ultimately that's going to be the best um or the world yeah or the world yeah I guess yeah pick your um pick your scope of impact could be for art for intellectual history it's it's a classic Victor Frankle argument of man search for meaning right as the as Victor frankl's leaving the the concentration camps what helps him survive and it's the debt that he owes to the Future work that he wants to write to share with the world and it's not it's not the fear of death it's the the meaning of the work he could do for the world if he survives yeah I think um I'd like to hover on this for a minute or two because I think it's really important I realize we're getting more philosophical than operational but we have data on this it's a um yeah I I'd love to hear it that's one of the things I'm really enjoying about this conversation the moment I think it's going to be abstract or or that you've got uh you got it all there in in in that brain um yeah let's talk about this the pro uh that when when we feel back on our heels or we're flat footed meaning we're not doing well maybe hard things have happened focusing on the prospect of what we can do for others not just trying to avoid loss or further shame or or just diminishment is going to be the best thing so what what are the data on this yeah so um well first just look at correlational studies in these Global surveys of Happiness um and almost anyone you can think of the best predictor of Life satisfaction and well-being is going to be the meaning of your life in particular the feeling like you're connected to others you've contributed to others that your life mattered that your life there was something of value in your life to others or to the world right um and so the just anecdotally the advice I always give to people like going through depression or the risk of that is to focus on what you can do for others or what you have done right um so that that's just correlation now experimentally what we did in some work this was started with my first adviser at Stanford Bill Damon who studies purpose in life is we ask the question of when you're going through something tedious boring frustrating what motivates you to keep going and we there are many possible answers to that but we compared two different ones one is the potential benefit you get out of that striving so for a student in school it's like the money you would get one day from working hard and doing well an alternative though is what you could do with the knowledge that you gained by going through the hard learning how could you contribute to others make a difference Etc with the Knowledge and Skills we call that our purpose condition a couple things make that different from this the standard narrative but but I think ultimately intuitive one is the standard narrative is if you try hard in school or at work or whatever it is in suffer now then one day there will be a kind of financial compensation so you're you're suffering now in a way that will bring material reward in the future that the brain's not really designed to make that kind of calculation right it's like well how certain is the reward in the future how far into the future and how bad is their punishment right now so there's all kinds of affective tradeoffs that are hard for anyone or especially hard for 13 year olds right so what a lot of school comes down to is an adult saying you need to suffer through 40 minutes per day of factoring trinomials because I said so that and I said it's good for your long-term future so that one day in your 30s you can barely afford a mortgage right this is not a compelling argument for most of America's youth my opinion the purpose condition though is not about the exchange value of a credential some long time in the future it's more like right now you're getting a hard and kind of admirable skill that not everyone's going to get and you're gonna then be prepared when the moment arises to do something of significance for others now that also is uncertain and in the future but for things that are contributions you kind of get to feel like a good person right now the analogy I often use is if I'm going to like make lunch for the homeless I don't have to wait until they actually eat the food to feel like a good person I feel like a good person when I'm putting it in the bag you know or even when I'm driving to the homeless shelter right and I think it our idea was you can move up the reward by making it a social reward right now rather than a material reward years into the future because then the pursuit itself becomes the reward right right now my and actually the more frustrating it is right now the more I'm being a good person because it means it was a hard skill to acquire that'll prepare me to make a difference later and so we we framed super tedious math this is with Angela Duckworth and Sydney Dello and Dave penescu and others as Marlon Henderson as a chance to gain a skill that helps you contribute versus a chance to learn how to get an A and make money in the future versus a control and what we found was that the contribute to others version led to deeper learning greater persistence um higher grades over time and in one of our experiments we gave them a choice of either doing super boring math or goofing off on the internet and we were secretly tracking what the websites they were going to and we found that teenagers did um more very boring math and watched fewer videos and played less Tetris when they were given this purpose message uh before the task it's in our 2014 paper and what I I of always think about that's the kind of paper I wanted to go to graduate school to work on but I I think about it because if you think about Dale Miller's Norm of self-interest nobody thinks to do the purpose argument they're like of course teenagers are shortsighted and think about material rewards and all they want to do is either look cool or make money or whatever but no like in our studies if you appealed to the chance to make a contribution right now then they did the behaviors that adults want them to do they didn't Goof Off online and instead chose boring math and and adults think the only way you could ever get that is by imposing our will and and with this kind of authoritarian um set of rules but if you instead just appeal to the love of learning for the sake of others then they're willing to kind of go through the suffering and and in the paper we cite Victor Frankl where you know the person who knows the why for their existence is able to Bear anyhow mhm and I I think about that that a lot that we underestimate how willing young people are really anyone is to Bear through things that are hard and difficult if they have a strong why I think this is one of the most important Concepts frankly ever discussed on this podcast if I'm really honest I think that um you know we've parsed dopamine circuits and we've talked about motivation and reward we've talked a little bit about growth mindset in a Solo episode but never before have I really understood the um the why component the meaning component and and I love how it marries so much of what we hear in kind of like you know pop culture psychology with real data like we're finally uh thanks to you being here meaning we're finally um in the guts of it um because we hear this like oh it feels so good to make a contribution but you know people are also self-interested people want money I then then people say well past a certain amount of money you don't get any happier and I would argue that um uh it's true money can't buy happiness but it can definitely buffer stress yeah not all forms of stress and money itself can get people into more stress but um anyone that says you know past blank number of dollars there's no incremental increase in happiness I I I just don't see how that could be given inflation and you know that treats humans like linear functions I think that's a simplification right if higher purpose is best defin is making a meaningful contribution to the world um to a community to the or maybe at the scale of the world maybe at the scale of a family or or um or what have you a classroom and the thing that you said before that seems so important is that the moment that you attach uh your goal to something that's for others it makes the effort involved its own form of reward yeah that to me is so important yeah so so important I kind of want to highlight bold underline and you know put a big exclamation mark after it because that's so different than like oh you know I want to be the top player on the team yeah which means that every bit of effort you put in you're like thinking I'm going to I'm going to be the best I'm going to be the best I'm going to be the best but um and one perhaps can then feel that progress when one is making it and feel like they're ascending that that staircase but something additional must come about when we're invoking this this feeling of contribution um and I think this isessential to our Evolution as a species because we didn't develop an isolation yeah I mean we had to show our value to the group or else they would get rid of us right I mean that's what it meant to go from being a child to being an adult and the think about what it just take basketball or whatever right to if I'm trying super super hard and it feels impossible to me and I'm not getting better and it's purely for me then I I feel like a failure it feels like my goals are not being met and they never will be met right the effort feels terrible because it means something really bad about me right now imagine you're putting in effort for others the harder it is the more awesome it is because it's more noble right you've done something that's super impressive and sacrificed your own happiness for others right the social status of trying hard and failing for yourself is net negative because it's about shame humiliation I'm not good enough the status of trying hard and failing and keeping going for others is like super net positive right and I I think that's what people fail to appreciate is especially someone young or even just early in a career right starting out if you can reframe difficulty and failure as part of the process of doing something with high integrity for others like it changes the meaning of effort totally and once you have a different meaning then it something that previously felt bad can instead be motivating whether it's the stress like in our stress enhancing work or the boredom you're undergoing it's doing something super tedious um or anything like that I remember when I was a at Stanford as a graduate student I worked in the lab of John kosnik who is you know famously detail oriented when whenever we want to go in really deep into something and go beyond what any other scientist would do our joke name for that is giving it the full kosnic because in he's in Communications political science and uh there was one project I was supervising where this will sound ridiculous but it was what is the best adjective to use in a survey item so say you want to go like how hungry are you not at all very extremely like what adjectives should you pick to label those in a survey item and so the task was to find every time that human beings have rated adjectives on a zero to 100 scale in the history of Science and then average across all those to choose optimally spaced adjectives like not at all a lot a little so we had a lab full of undergraduates at Stanford who are used to you know creating startups and running nonprofits and this is very tedious work for them so how do you get them to Super pay attention to all the details and not get it wrong where we really going to trust their work it it's not by saying you know you're going to get into law school if you do this because it's not really true and they be like there's a lot of other ways for me to get into law school that's that don't involve going to journals from the 19 20s to rate adjectives right instead what I started doing was give them what I call the save the world speech which is like look we're g to write this paper and it's going to be the kind of paper that no one would have done because it's so tedious but if it's trustworthy thousands of people would know how to have more accurate measurement and they're going to be so grateful for that but not only that there will be Skeptics and the Skeptics are going to look in our supplement they're going to find mistakes and then they're going to email the editor and they're going to say why did you let the sloppy work into the journal and that happens all the time I mean I don't know much you follow what's happening behavioral scientist uh behavioral scientists these days but like you know if you have an influential finding that's the norm is people should scrutinize it they should kick the tires and they're going to find it and they're going to you know out you and they're doing more of that now like with Pub Pier yeah which I think is great Pub Pier is awesome um Pub Pier folks is where um papers are evaluated online people find um sometimes outright errors um and sure there are those like sleuthing for for like yeah you find fraud for fraud but most of what's put there is stuff like um you know differences in interpretation or or somebody will suggest that you know the authors could have done a better analysis or that maybe their conclusions were a little too far-reaching based on a particular set of methods it's good for science I mean there's a lot of uh bad intentioned sleo thing that is trying to find circumstantial evidence to make someone look bad is that true but yeah really yeah that's a shame because the the the whole purpose of it is to better the work not to uh I'm assuming the whole purpose of pup here is to to better the work and of course um point out you know where there are real errors in in the the historical literature right um well I think that the the yes there well there there's a new way to become famous in science which is to like you know find errors which again is really valuable if you successfully do it but there's enough room for interpretation that someone can um with circumstantial evidence only make it look like something's really bad and then cause an alarm and it causes all kinds of problems uh however that for for me at least in our lab that if you always assume that someone will look at your work with the worst possible intentions and will ask for every file how did it get from qual Trix into your paper just assume that all the time then that means you need to pay as much attention to the file that was downloaded and how it was processed in every you know part of the pipeline has to be documented um you just have to do that and so that working with crosx lab that's that's the process that we adopt it and there's all kind people email they like wait this show me this finding like okay here's the link to the server here's the syntax you can go find it etc etc so good scientists should do that and so the the possibility of scrutiny and catching fraud should motivate everyone to treat it as though it's inevitability and therefore you know be careful in your process convincing 19-year-old Stanford undergraduates that that is likely to happen you know and that therefore you need to pay super close attention to the details that's that was my task as a lab manager and so there it was a mix of the fear of Shame and humiliation but also ideally the contribution that our work will make and we had the hardest working Ras we ever had that summer and that's not an empirical claim that's you know I say that not I didn't randomize the undergrads to that but that experience kind of gave me the idea for the purpose studies was you know assume people want to do good work but all else equal they're G they might find an easier way to do it and then motivate with an appeal to how this work could make a difference how other people could be influenced by it and also if you don't take it seriously it'd be a really big deal it' be really bad and I I think about about that a lot because in we don't often appeal to the contribution value of the work we appeal to this you know getting a good grade and impressing people and uh and that's less important for me than did I get a skill and did I do high quality high integrity work so what you're basically saying is that if we attach our motivation to the give to the the contribution that we're going to make it actually makes the process much easier or at least more rewarding along the way um as well as um by definition contributing uh more positively to society um it's causing me to reflect on what we normally um perceive as like high achieving individuals um so often it seems like we hear the stories of like the Steve Jobs is and I I really enjoyed that book by Walter isacon and that story very you know impressed by right uh his contributions all complicated person as is often the case with people that make big contributions it seems um or people in the political sphere or people in the academic sphere or the sports sphere you know most often we we think of them as striving for themselves maybe for themselves and their family and then there are these people that really stand out as as these um uh shining examples of like Martin Luther King or you know and others where we just are kind of in awe of how um Mission driven they were for for the greater good um what sort of work um is being done to encourage that kind of mindset the contribution mindset growth mindset through contribution mindset I just coin that contribution mindset um that's more words in there right exactly that's all it needs more mindsets um but the contribution mindset because I think at least in this country um we're we are often raised to rever people that make big contributions but then we get really absorbed into that person's story yeah right it's like the story of the person and what made them tick and then that there's a lot of ego it you know and and they or they have a kind of obsessive nature to them um and we we don't know what goes on in other people's minds you know we're so I must say there's a certain arrogance in our in all of our perceptions of others like that we know what they're why they're doing what they're doing like half the time we don't even know why we're doing what we're doing yeah um but I think you get the idea here what I'm imagining is a more um benevolent world where people also enjoy striving more and the striving process itself while hard has meaning and people are not egoist but where there's a bit more balance like are we getting a little bit like we you know kind of um looking at this through rosecolor glasses or I think it's possible I like to think it's possible yeah I mean I think that that the the version that in in which people are purely pro-social and self-transcendent and have no self-interest you know is not super realistic and it's not actually what our data are finding so what we find is is that adding this pro-social contribution argument has a big effect but if you do it absent any plausible benefit the person would get it tends to not be motivating so it's the combination of let's just take the school case I'm going to learn something gain a new skill I'm G to get a job that I enjoy and that gives me freedom and make a contribution to others we found it was the addition of the pro-social part to the self-interested part now if if it was do XYZ and you know make lots of money far in the future and then give that money away that didn't work because that's still the same logic of sacrifice now for later Financial reward which then has an exchange value of some ambiguous you know amount in the future that one didn't motivate kids or students to want don't tell the philan universities depend heavily on philanthropy especially nowadays uh um and we're grateful to them that they support so much good work so you're saying that that they um it makes sense that there needs to be some component of self-interest right like jobs loved design right um presumably uh folks like uh Elon and and others love the the mechanics of what they do building Rockets building um electric cars and things like that but then there this pro-social thing the the idea that that the world could be better and different with these things in them uh yeah if you did if you did the work right I mean a good example is is my friend Danielle kic who ran empathy Lab at Google for a while and before that worked at at Apple and uh and other places you know you could think that designing products at a large tech company is purely about is that product going to sell a lot make a lot of money Etc and that's obviously part of the value for the shareholders and so on but um you know her philosophy was always okay well what is what's going to happen with the user what does the user need is there life going to be better with this product and that often led to design choices that made the product even better and more profitable and I think there are a lot of examples of that where you know when when the team is trying to create something that is high quality but with integrity and ethics that are going to benefit people people are willing to put in extra hours they're willing to solve a puzzle do better work um I think there are a lot of examples of that that's on the product design side I also want to talk about the management side so one of the people I followed from my book is a manager at company she was at Microsoft now she's at a place called service now and I just studied how she mentored young employees her name is Steph akamoto and um she has this great story about a a really awesome 25ish employee 25-year-old is employee showed up and had come from teaching Teach for America and now is in HR at Microsoft and Steph could immediately tell her name is salony uh she's going to be bored by her regular job she's going to be able to do more than what she had to do but as a manager you can't say as the first thing you need to do twice your job for the same amount of pay that's like not a good management philosophy so instead it was a conversation all right what's a contribution you want to make to the company where in making that above and beyond you're going to learn a new skill that's going to help you move up the ladder right so that in your next performance review you're going to look like a superstar like a total over performer and so the time they were running GL manager development and so um what they decided was don't just deliver the programs well which Steph thought uh she could do well but also create a dashboard to track everyone's progress so every new hire would they would know where they are in the management process and it was Global during the pandemic so kind of a complicated time anyway she did her regular job really well and created this whole dashboard which brought value to the company big contribution but then when it came time for performance evaluations she could say like you're already performing at a level two levels up that gave her promotional velocity she moved up she left the company for a while now is the chief of staff HR at Microsoft right kind of in in in line to to lead Microsoft and then what about Steph well Steph's team overperformed so which was incentivized but then she gets to go home saying like I use my time as a manager to change someone's life and that brings her so much joy and she and it's just so much fun you know as a teacher to have some of our time with young people lead them to on a on a path they wouldn't have been on otherwise it is a total blast to Mentor someone and change their lives so I think that's a good example of it's an everyone's long-term self-interest to contribute to both the company and the people around you but no one's being a martyr they're not you know really like it's also everyone's compensated so you need to think about of course is the company gonna pay you if you help others improve and there important questions that we ask there but I just think that's a good example where we have a false psychom if it's either good for me or I'm a martyr helping others but like the best work is both and then it feels awesome because you both Chang people's lives and you are compensated for it and that's great um certainly has been my experience that doing things that I love like learning and organizing and distributing information um with the specific intention of people benefiting from it um should they choose to use it uh or apply it or think about it is um The Best of Both Worlds yeah certainly let's talk about this other phenotype um the people that um and and they do serve a role in in the world um folks that um who seem whose sole purpose seems to be to critique to identify errors and um and I think in the case of catching like real uh like fundamental flaws and stuff play play a key role we we need those right yeah and it's kind of unfair we that that as a scientific field we force a small group of people to have to police everybody else's work ideally they wouldn't have to do that job and so there's a lot of value in the people who have developed very honest and high integrity tools to find mistakes yeah I think some of the AI tools for finding um errors at least in PH you know in in data sets right like the images in a neuroscience study where you can tell that the images have been all or plots like I remember a few years back the Reinhardt shown cases of the he was like this wonderin who published I was like crazy numbers like eight or 10 papers in science and nature per year and then I think it was actually um similarities in the noise the random quot in quotes noise plots that eventually led to the the like the understanding that like there was Data duplication or something anyway I I don't remember how it went yeah it's important to correct the liter that way right but then there seems to be at least online there and and on social media there seems to be a um kind of a short-term incentive I have to imagine there's some incentive for people just being really critical like I I was thinking about this the other day um what kind of mindset would one have to just randomly go put a nasty comment on social media like if you just think about it not about an issue you're particularly vexed by or somebody's stance on like that that makes sense right people get get aggravated and yeah they but just think about the mindset there like oh you got your life you have time and you're going to go like say mean things right like like to me it's just inconceivable um to do that online like to go and just post that stuff but but clearly there's something there's some incentive built built there and I don't think this is a new thing I'm I'm guessing that before we had online culture within medieval societies and there were these these elements exist within us um and that there must be some reward they must feel some reward um but it's not it's not generative it's not Building Society when appropriately placed I guess we're saying it provides a a corrective mechanism um but what do you think that's about and is there any literature on on this kind of thing yeah well not the exact example of um being a total jerk on online I mean I I can't imagine doing that and cuz who has the time I mean I had four kids coach baseball I don't know how I'm going to like police other people unless it's relevant to my work and I think someone's like not having integrity and what they're doing I'm like you guys are being sloppy then I might say that but um what I what I find compelling is a beautiful new book by Mary Murphy called cultures of growth who was trained at Stanford under Claude steel uh was also trained by Carol DW just came out a week ago and it's getting tons of great press and in her work what she finds is that fixed mindset can be a cultural variable like a a more a leadership variable not just in the mind of the individual and when that's the culture then she finds uh people are more willing to try to uh make everyone else look like an idiot so that you don't get attacked that's the summary finding and um there's a kind of deflection strategy that if I if I trash other people for being idiots then it'll make other people think twice before they mess with me and so but it creates the very toxic culture that they're trying to escape which is the threat of their own you know Intelligence being attacked so it's totally counterproductive and she uses the example of Microsoft and the Balmer era where you'd go into meetings and you'd get yelled at if you made any mistake and you weren't allowed to talk talk and they would like literally flip over a table and yell at you and people would leave the room crying um and uh this there's a lot of accounts of this is a very public information and um one of the things SAA nadela did when he came in was to change what he said uh he said we have a culture of know- at alls and we need a culture of learn at alls and um has the virtue of ending in the same words so it's it's uh piy but I kind of like that idea and so Mary describes how in this culture of um genius she calls it you don't just get the hypercriticism you then the the the consequence of that is unethical Behavior where you hide mistakes or lie about things because you're worried about being outed as not a genius so the the culture of fearing mistakes gives rise to the kind of unethical hiding type of culture now the the lay person could draw a line between that and like the and Bing and other like failed products you know that's I'll leave that to organizational Scholars to decide if that's the story but at least the cautionary tale is like Boeing is another example where Calhoun when he came in as a CEO changed the incentive scheme at Boeing to be something called stack ranking which is where you fire the bottom 10% every six months or a year who within your group so if your your group might be higher performing on average than some other group but the bottom 10% of your group are getting fired okay and this is goes back to uh ge it's a jack Welsh policy anyway so that happened you know two years ago and look what's happened in the last two years now he's out right you have all these mistakes where people aren't going and finding the problems now again I'm not boing I can't you know as a sci as a scientist I can't say that that is the cause but the argument in Mary's book is that when you have organizations like that culture of Genius you hide mistakes and then you have unethical behavior in order to um conceal those and then you don't fix them but in what she calls a culture of growth you're like willing to examine mistakes because they're not indicative of a sign that that they're not indicative of your overall inability to do well they're like part of the process of growing as a group super interesting um you said Mary Murphy cultures of growth yeah interesting it seems everybody worked with Carol dwick you uh Claude steel Mary Murphy friendship group it's an amazing Group by that I mean I have no friends except people I work with you've uh clearly landed in a great group nonetheless um this is very interesting um so people who are hypercritical or spending enormous amount of time being critical just for being critical sake are are ma are masking they're cloaking themselves um it's a form of Self Protection yeah um that's that's her that's the claim and I think there's some pretty good suggest evidence of that yeah' be interesting if if online like everyone had to put some of their CV in their Mast head you know it's like it's sort of like what have you done as you're attacking because that would differentiate the people like Elizabeth Bick for instance who I think that's her name who's a u considered one of the um best uh data evaluation um people right she runs an her Twitter account is they essentially she shows errors in papers and and I think the goal there is to offer people the opportunity to not necessarily retract although in some kisses are track but to alter the papers right and addendums and things that um to say where you know so that that's like the the the appropriate use of of critique right she's not doing it to to cloak anything else presumably yeah as opposed to people that just run around trying to poke holes in everything that they see it's cynicism really it's kind of a it's kind of an like online cynicism well I think it's it's easier to be skeptical than it is to like eventually believe in something after being convinced and so I think there's a there's a default toward well I don't believe that and we get that sometimes with growth mindset they're like well what do you mean 50-minute intervention has a well okay but all the things you're complaining about are things that we addressed in the study so at some point you have to just say you believe in the process of science or you don't and I understand if there were initial studies that didn't follow the process of science or left big holes to be addressed but at some point it's like well we did what you asked for so I don't know what to tell you sorry mhm yeah I know the growth mindset field has come under a bit of of of a not attack but um critique um I know this because in researching the solo episode and this one you know it's one always has to be careful about relying on Wikipedia too much because it's the use of editors Legacy editors and um I'll go on record saying that there's a ton of bias in even within the Legacy editors I just by the way I'm now I just got my page vandalized even more but I've sort of given up at this point because things are clued together out of context and so I like if I look at growth mindset on Wikipedia there's a lot of supportive evidence and then you can get like two paragraphs of like of critique right and so for the uninformed they don't know how to weigh that yeah right which is why we basically need a new system well they kind of want to say on one hand on the other hand you know but then um yeah and there's no there's no real waiting we don't know the expertise of these people where they're gleaning from blogs or whatnot and look I think it's a great concept I think that it's just um I I to me at least um it seems that there's an overwhelming amount of evidence that growth mindset and related mindsets that talked about today have have immense value I think um it's also good to have competing opinions in in any field um but I think it as as we're kind of parsing motivation um for people that um really want to make a I don't know feel their best do their best make a contribution to the world it seems like the default state that the the fast food the junk food um the slur the slurpie the Twizzlers and the and the Snickers bar there I just got myself in more trouble by naming name brands the junk food um is uh is in hiding by critiquing because I think maybe there's the man in the arena thing you know um that it's easy to be a spectator it's hard it's hard to try and do something real yeah I think that going back to this question of like are you willing to reveal your mistakes or not the Mary writes a lot about great exemplars in her book Jennifer Duda who's uh you know developed crisper famously has a lab that's hypercritical in the lab but then the work stands you know well in public um and it's someone who could have every incentive to just turn out as many papers as possible and you know for profit Etc but instead and I've actually interviewed one of the postdocs from that lab and it's just like an amazing scientific Enterprise that I I write about this astrophysics lab vanderbelt um with a guy named Kavon stassen who it's just a Legend um he so as you know a lot of people would be thrilled to have one nature paper in their lives like he had five last year right but uh what he does is uh Mentor the probably the most diverse group of physicists in in all of America and he developed what are called Bridge programs where students often graduate students of color or students who had low GRE scores low socioeconomic status they're pre- admitted to a master's program physics at a local HBCU Sally black College University and then if they do well then they're pre- admitted to the physics PhD program and it's a now well-known idea but the basic concept is in the old days you look at just your GRE scores and say are you smart enough to be a physicist or not and what he argued was that the coin of the realm for professional physics is publishing professional physics and if you come into a lab and you can analyze data and write a paper and publish it in a journal then you're a physicist so he has people come for two years regardless of your Gres but as long as you have kind of grit and resilience and a drive as you're saying and lets them work in labs and it turns out about about 85% of students end up getting admitted to the PHD program and then they do well so the first ever black first author on a nature paper in physics is his student right so like a ridiculously high proportion of racial diversity at Nasa are graduates of his program his laboratory right and is at Vanderbilt his is at Vanderbilt it's it's called the Fisk um uh vanderbelt Fisk um graduate program bridge program at any rate for my book I interviewed him and I was like well that's your admission so what happens there's still five years when people have to learn to be a physicist and every day they have a different thing they do so Monday is a journal Club Tuesday is a coffee but the the lifeblood of the lab is Wednesdays lab meetings where you as a trainee put up your figures in your paper in over Leaf which is like a wizzywig editor for scientific papers and everyone critiques your stats your tables your figures your narrative and everyone's just looking at your work and critiquing it and these are all top physicists in the lab and that sounds terrifying and it kind of is initially but then by the time they present at the conference they've heard everything and they're doing that far before they're spending three months doubting themselves unable to complete the paper etc etc it's like you just have to do that you have to face that fear so it's very demanding but it's super supportive and they don't pull punches in terms of the critique of the content it's it's but it's never in question whether the comments are coming from a place of believing your potential to be a great physicist and what I like about that is that you're not like it doesn't feel good at that time to have be critiqued publicly but it feels necessary and you kind of know that you will measure up at the end of that process and that it's formative I think that's fundamentally what a lot of people I think misunderstand about what it takes to help someone become better they think either I have to be a monster to critique you or I just have to pull my punches but like you can be like stassen's lab and be super demanding and super supportive and and then people grow sounds like the the key thing is to make sure that one is gleaning critique from um the correct sources and this is one of the the major issues with kind of just um open online critique while attractive because of the lack of barriers it it means that you have to be a selective filter right I mean you can see this in um online comments people some people are very impacted by them and then other people say oh yeah well that's some person in a basement or that's a you know like who what have they done and you know but some people just have a thinner skin than others and um but when you're in a in a community where clearly everyone cares about the mission the outcome the physics Etc um then you can put trust in the critique uh by the way I find it really interesting that um this lab at Vanderbilt has focused mainly on motivation and drive um as the key thing as opposed to some uh standardized score metric or something uh or prior experience when I was starting my lab as a junior Professor back before being at Stanford at UCSD UC San Diego senior colleague of mine said when picking students um you have to really evaluate many things right ethics how they do the work etc but the the main thing uh was is just drive are they driven yeah and um yeah that turned out to be the case yeah I think it's it's hard I mean it's it's such a case-by casee decision you know like you don't pick that many students over your career so you don't get to really learn but I think I had a college when I started who was like just told me they just sort by GRE right away like just by standardized squore by standardized testore I was like well I would never do that he's like how about this how about you take all the low gr students and I take all the high ones and see who students do better yeah I I feel like um standardized tests in some cases are necessary but not sufficient yeah that there's this other thing this like nuance and um I mean coming up with great experimental ideas or there's just so many examples of people people that just weren't good at standardized tests that just kicked ass in their in their various Fields but but there is a correlation there typically I mean I think my issue it like in in a perfect world standard test scores would be great for Equity because there would be people who didn't get great information in high school about where to go to college or started out in the wrong major and eventually figured out don't have great GPA or didn't go to a great college but they have tremendous ability and they deserve a shot and so I think that that argument for grees is makes a ton of sense the the problem is that you can just pay to have someone teach you how to take the GRE and your scores can go up a huge percentage and so it the G's end up being a proxy either for the training you got now or it's appr proxy for how good your 10th grade math teacher was because it's mostly testing 10th grade geometry and so again that's going to be a function of what neighborhood you grew up in and how good your high school teachers were so what I don't love is like I I would love test scores if they were about meritocracy and and equality of opportunity but they often end up being just a proxy for kind of advantages you already had so um ultimately though for Kavon the uh setting aside the GRE in physics was like a hypothesis ultimately the proof in the that needed to be in the pudding was did the students admitt it under an alternative means end up producing great physics and in that case the answer is absolutely yes and so for me it's like yes consider it or not for admissions but what are you doing with the students when they arrive how are you mentoring and how are you training and how are you breaking the link between whatever advantages might have had in the past and the work that they can do in the future if they're if they're driven we've been talking a lot about data and other people um I'd be remiss if I didn't ask you a little bit about you um uh no pressure to to share anything you don't want to share but um of all the things you could study of all the contributions you can make you decide to focus on this notion of mindsets and and essentially um trying to figure out how people can be their best for the for the greatest good of the world this would be the way I would describe it um is that just inherent in your in your wiring or was there something about your experience coming up that makes you value that in particular or um did you happen to just uh resonate with with uh Carol and folks um and feel like hey this would be a great place to place my efforts yeah well that's an impossible question to answer because there's no I have no counterfactual so a real causal inference person wouldn't allow me what so one this is a this is a digression but uh so my only real precocious skill is that I can do the splits which sounds like a weird thing to do but I can it's my party trick at at weddings you always could uh or you do gymnastics as a kid I did but not seriously not for very long and one time someone another academic he was like you can do the splits that's super weird I'm like yes it is weird and uh and he was like how can you do that I was like well as a kid I was in gymnastics and then I stretched all the time and he was like that is the dumbest causal story I've ever heard in my life there's no way that that is the single even the most important cause right and I just thought I think about that as like my whole life I've been I've been posed with this puzzle of why do I why can I do this weird thing and I told myself that and I don't think that's even remotely true I think this for whatever reason it just kind of developed so I can't fully answer your question about why I like got super interested in in this work but I will say that out of um College I I thought I was going to be a lawyer and that's because my my college major was something called the program of liberal studies which is a great books major where you read the great works of history and philosophy and stuff yeah and you read them in order and so and there's no lectures allowed you and you can't even read the introduction to the book so you just have to like read Hume and pretend like you can understand it and K and stuff like that and you argue with other 19-year-olds about what it might mean and uh I loved it it was great I still don't know what Kant was talking about but I'll figure that out at some point but then with PS the joke is probably law school which is the answer to the question of what are you going to do with this liberal arts major and so I thought that's what I'll do but at the last second I just had a change of heart and so I went and taught in a really low-income school in Tulsa Oklahoma and I ended up being the 6 through eight uh English teacher the k through eight basketball coach I coached um or k38 PE coach and then I coached basketball and ran the book club and I like ran the the Cat 5 cables to fix the internet in the Attic you know and it was great I worked like 100 hours a week I made $12,000 a year was a lot of fun had a great time and at the end of it I thought now I'm going to go to law school and uh when I was doing my applications um a friend of mine died of cancer it got saroma it was real quick it was like six months and we all went back uh to college and were there for a service and I remember being in the airport and I picked up Jeffree Sachs end of poverty which a popular book at the time and just thinking like here's a guy who like I don't know was doing something pretty mundane macroeconomics but he was spending all his time talking world leaders in other countries out of you know crushing debt that was causing poverty and it's like taking whatever precocious skill he had and using it for others and I thought law is not my Jeff Sach skill but what I I do know how to do is motivate teenagers like that's how I spend all my time and so I thought I just want to do I want to do this science of motivating young people like as much as possible so then I went to Stanford I'd never taken stats before never taken psychology but I just like tried to become like a wild man learning as much as I could and thankfully in my third year Carol started working with me and like we kind of haven't looked back since what an awesome story so totally Mission driven and and post talk causal inference so who knows if that's actually the story but that those are those sequence of events did occur though post causal inference I guess you can map on to that famous uh Steve Jobs commencement speech at Stanford where he's basically saying you can't connect the dots um going forward only backward so it all makes sense looking back exactly you know this led to that led to this led to that but going forward we're we're kind of stumbling in the dark a bit um well I must say I I and everyone else's are so grateful that you made that choice or those choices um clearly the work you're doing is is having a huge impact I I covered a few of your papers on the solo episode on growth mindset and you mentioned nature and um the the fact that most people don't uh publish there at all let alone once or twice or several times in their career you've had an amazing run lately and um youve just had this this incredible Arc of of papers in this in this area of which can be distilled down to I think um forgive me if this doesn't capture it all but uh figuring out um how people can be the best version of themselves for their own lives and for the world right I mean that's essentially what we're talking about here and I love the way you incorporate the neuroscience and the and the motivation literature and um and you're so good at attribution as something that we we should all model ourselves around um it's really an incredible literature and um I'm excited to read the book uh 10 to 25 genuinely excited this notion of a mentor mindset and um how we can bring out the best in ourselves and others it's a it's phenomenal that you're doing this work um please keep going and um I'm speaking on behalf of myself and everyone else I say you know thanks for taking time out of your busy research schedule and teaching schedule to come here and um teach millions of people about what you do and what they can do to be their best so thank you so much well thanks well we're just getting started and uh it was great to be here I did I I'm I missed baseball practice tonight so not for me but for uh nine-year-olds um an apology to your nine-year-olds yeah okay oh cuz there's more there many of them on the team okay this is back in Austin okay um when's their next game couple three or four weeks so we have plenty of time we're still learning how to throw and hit

Title: A Simple Solution for Quickly Returning to Sleep at Night
Published: 2024-04-12 14:08:17 UTC
Description:
Dr. Matthew Walker explains one of the common issues people face: waking up in the middle of the night. That itself is not so much a problem if it just happens once per night, but often, people have difficulty falling back asleep, which then sets in motion anxiety about sleep, sleep deprivation, and, in turn, the negative effects of sleep deprivation.

Something as simple as looking at the time can create a cascade of issues, leading to more sleep challenges.

The takeaway: If you have trouble waking up in the middle of the night and difficulty falling back asleep afterward, consider removing all clock faces, electronic or otherwise, from the bedroom.

"Every night, for some strange reason at 2:45 AM, I wake up, and it happens three or four nights a week." My first question to them is, "How do you know it's 2:45?" [chuckling] And they say, "Well, I look at the clock," or "I look at my phone." Best piece of advice next, remove all clock faces from the bedroom. No matter how bad your sleep is going to be that night, knowing what time it is, is only going to make matters worse. It is not going to make matters any better. And that can create an anxiety trigger that you think it's 2:45, and then you are tossing and turning. You look back at the clock and now it's 3:14 AM and you think, "I've got to be awake at 6:00. I've got that big meeting." And now it's 5:25. Don't do that to yourself.

Title: How Body Position & Temperature Impact Sleep Stages & Quality
Published: 2024-04-10 15:44:16 UTC
Description:
In this episode 1 of a 6-part special series on sleep with Dr. Matthew Walker, Ph.D., professor of neuroscience and psychology and founder of the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley discusses the connection between body temperature and sleep quality, revealing that a slightly lower brain and body temperature can facilitate better sleep.

Transcript Language: English
There any evidence that one's bodily position during sleep or the orientation of the feet relative to the head, you know, the angle elevated upward or downward, has any impact on the pattern of different sleep stages or quality or any other aspects of sleep? There is a reason for it. And we'll probably come onto this at some point when we speak about different methods for sleep optimization or the new wave of fascinating sleep enhancement tools, has to do with temperature, we think. That for you to be able to fall asleep and stay asleep, you have to drop your brain and body temperature by just a little less than about one degree Celsius, or probably two, two and a half degrees Fahrenheit. And that's the reason by the way, that you will always find it easier to fall asleep in a room that's too cold than too hot, because the room that's too cold is at least taking you in the right temperature direction for good sleep.

[Music] welcome to the hubman lab guest Series where I and an expert guest discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today marks the second episode in our sixth episode series all about sleep with our expert guest Dr Matthew Walker during today's episode we discuss the dos and the do Nots of sleep focusing for instance on how to use light and absence of light as well as temperature both of your sleep environment specifically the room you're in your body temperature and much more in order to regulate the timing and quality of your sleep and we discuss how things like alcohol caffeine and cannabis impact sleep and the various stages of sleep and we discuss the various tools that exist now and that are rapidly becoming available to improve your sleep this episode is essential for anyone trying to optimize their sleep and when I say optimize your sleep I mean trying to optimize the formula that was addressed in the first episode of the series which is the qqr formula the quality quantity regularity and timing of your sleep four variables that combine to determine whether or not your sleep is optimized for you and thereby providing the most restoration and Improvement to your mental health physical health and performance before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost of consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Helix sleep Helix sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are customized to your unique sleep needs it's abundantly clear that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance when we're getting enough quality sleep everything in life goes so much better and when we are not getting enough quality sleep everything in life is that much more challenging now one of the key things to getting a great night sleep is to have the appropriate mattress everyone however has slightly different needs in terms of what would be the optimal mattress for them Helix understands that people have unique sleep needs and they've designed a brief two-minute quiz that asks you questions like do you sleep on your back your side or your stomach do you tend to run hot or cold during the night or maybe you don't know the answers to those questions if you go to the Helix site and take that brief quiz they'll match you to a mattress that's optimal for you for me it turned out to be the dusk DS mattress it's not too hard not too soft and I sleep so much better on my Helix mattress than on any other type of mattress I've used before so if you're interested in upgrading your mattress go to Helix sleep.com take their brief 2-minute sleep quiz and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you and you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order and two free pillows again that's helixsleep.com huberman to save up to $350 off and two free pillows today's episode is also brought To Us by whoop whoop is a fitness wearable device that tracks your daily activity and sleep but also goes beyond that by providing real-time feedback on how to adjust your training and sleep schedule to perform better I I've been working with whoop on their scientific advisory Council to try and help Advance wop's mission of unlocking Human Performance as a whoop user I've experienced the health benefits of their technology firsthand for sleep tracking for monitoring other features of my physiology and for giving me a lot of feedback about metrics within my brain and body that tell me how hard I should train or not train and basically point to the things that I'm doing correctly and incorrectly in my daily life that I can adjust using protocols some of which are actually within the whoop app given that many of us have goals such as improving our sleep building better habits or just focusing more on our overall health whoop is one of the tools that can really help you get personalized data recommendations and coaching toward your overall health if you're interested in trying whoop you can go to join. whoop.com huberman today to get your first month free again that's join. woop.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by waking up waking up is a meditation app that has hundreds of different meditations as well as scripts for Yoga Nidra and non-sleep deep rest or nsdr protocols by now there's an abundance of data showing that even short daily meditations can greatly improve our mood reduce anxiety improve our ability to focus and can improve our memory and while there are many different forms of meditation most people find it difficult to find and stick to a meditation practice in a way that is most beneficial for them the waking up app makes it extremely easy to learn how to meditate and to carry out your daily meditation practice in a way that it's going to be most effective and efficient for you it includes a variety of different types of meditations of different duration as well as things like yoga NRA which place the brain and body into a sort of pseudo sleep that allows you to emerge feeling incredibly mentally refreshed in fact the science around Yoga Nidra is really impressive showing that after a Yoga Nidra session levels of dopamine in certain areas of the brain are enhanced by up to 60% which places the brain and body into a state of enhanced Readiness for mental work and for physical work another thing I really like about the waking up app is that it provides a 30-day introduction course so for those of you that have not meditated before or getting back to a meditation practice that's fantastic or if you're somebody who's already a skilled and regular meditator waking up has more advanced meditations and yoga needer sessions for you as well if you'd like to try the waking up app you can go to waking up.com huberman and access a free 30-day trial again that's waking up.com huberman and now for my conversation with Dr Matthew Walker Professor Matt Walker welcome back we're all so happy to have you here and in episode one you beautifully described the biology of sleep why sleep is important what happens when we don't get enough sleep and you incentivized getting adequate amounts of great sleep and you defined what great sleep is and you provided some excellent practical protocols and tools for getting great sleep however today you're going to tell us I believe about the protocols for really optimizing one's sleep both conventional tools and protocols and some let's say unconventional not heretical but unconventional tools for optimizing one's sleep so let's start with the basics what are the basics of what I think I've heard you refer to previously as sleep hygiene yeah I think we many of us can resonate with the idea of dental hygiene but turns out there's something called Sleep hygiene and there are probably I would say five edicts of sleep hygiene I offer them as as tools and not necessarily rules because I don't think people respond to rules people respond to reasons and not rules so if it's okay I'll probably just unpack each one of them rather than just sort of bark them at you and hope people assume that it's the right uh answer I'll explain the answer so people understand why it's important so as I said there are probably five things that you can start doing tonight to try to improve your sleep the first we've spoken a little bit about in that first episode it's part of the four macros of good sleep first piece of advice regularity go to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time no matter whether it's the weekday or the weekend regularity is king and the reason is because when you feed your brain the signals of timed regularity for your sleep it will anchor your sleep and improve the quantity and the quality of that sleep because part of that signal of regularity going into your brain in terms of that repeated Behavior night after night sleep in other words helps train that Central 24-hour Cadian clock that we also spoke about in the first episode so that's the first piece of advice try to keep it as regular as you possibly can the second piece of advice is darkness in my view we are a dark deprived Society in this modern era and we need Darkness at night as well you've spoken about to release a hormone called melatonin and melatonin will help time the regular onset of your sleep so that sounds great but what boots on the ground Matt what does that mean I would suggest the following in the last hour before bed try to dim down 50% if not more of your lights in your home and you will be quite surprised at how sleepy and soporific that will make you feel I will do this in a regimented way I have uh little reminder that pops up and tells me now is the time to dim the lights based on your bedtime and I'll go around and I'll shut lights down in my bedroom I will actually have a small light bulb and it is way down to probably as little as maybe five luxs and look is just a a metric of the light um it's way down there and it's also very deep orange sort of red and we can come on to why that's the case so that's the first thing even before you're thinking about sleep start to decrease the light for example if you were there at let's say for a standard sleep schedule at 1000 p.m. and normally you are getting into bed at 10:30 p.m. but you feel pretty wide awake if there was an electrical blackout and you lost your phone magnetic to phone goes down lights go down Total Blackout my suspicion is that fairly soon you'd say gosh how you feel quite sleepy whereas if the lights were blazing you've got your phone television's on lots of stimulation you're probably going to think 10:30 no I could I could probably push through for at least another hour so try to dissipate that light and then if you need to wear an eye mask blackout curtains always good as well but we need that Darkness at night because when you give the brain the signal of Darkness it releases effectively a brake pedal that brake pedal has normally been applied by way of light on the release of that spigot of meel melatonin and when you take the brake pedal off it starts starts pumping out into the brain you can also then of course probably reverse engineer this trick in the morning and this is another component of why you've been I think so such a wonderful advocate for light in the morning it does many things but one of the things that it does is reapply that break on melatonin and therefore you lose the signal to your brain of Darkness that's what melatonin in some ways is doing we often call it the hormone of Darkness or the vampire hormone not necessarily because it makes you look longingly at people's necklines and want to to to bite it which is great if you're into that but it's really simply about it's releasing melatonin which tells the brain my goodness it's nighttime but if you've got bright light on you come from your office you're driving home so you've got artificial light during the day which is probably not strong enough to stimulate you and bring you awake you come home and you've got again bright light but it's still strong enough now to prevent the release of melatonin you start to shift in your timing and you may have problems with your sleep so that's the second piece of advice I would love to ask you about that Morning Light two and the alertness benefits I'm as a sleep researcher more focused on the evening component of light and decreasing it but you've done a great job I don't know if there's anything yeah there are a couple of quick points that um are based on some what I consider really nice studies uh there's beautiful work in human showing that bright light exposure in the morning especially from sunlight but um if one doesn't have access to sunlight for whatever reason there are commercially available so-called sad lamps Seasonal effective disorder lamps they range anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 Lux very bright but um but certainly uh morning sunlight viewing and lamps of the sort I just described have been shown to increase the amplitude of the morning cortisol Spike by as much as 50% 5 so people hear cortisol and they freak out they think that's not good I want cortisol low but you actually want your cortisol highest in the morning and lower in the afternoon and evening um and there's a lot of reasons for that elevated mood focus and alertness in the morning and throughout the day and uh ease of getting to sleep at night lower anxiety lower depressive symptoms and so on so that bright light also serves to um control the amplitude of cortisol uh it in the direction you want in the early part of the day the other thing that's just more of a uh underlying dynamics of the Circadian visual system which is a system that I worked on for years um these wonderful um cells in the eyes that are not for image forming but rather for detecting sunlight and bright light for sake of setting circadian rhythm is that the sensitivity of that system early in the day is actually quite low so you need a lot of bright light early in the day to effectively wake up your system and shut down the sleepiness signals such as melatonin but later in the day it's a rather diabolical system it takes very little light even from artificial sources to disrupt your circadian rhythm and quash melatonin as little as 15 seconds of bright light in the evening I think CH Chuck Zer laboratory at Harvard Medical School showed can quash melatonin in the evening now I don't want people to freak out and think that if they go into a hotel bathroom which oftentimes those are very bright in the middle of the night flip on the light that they're going to um completely uh screw up their circadian rhythms but if I'm honest they'd be much better off using um their phone as a flashlight to navigate people always say well wait but the flashlight on the phone is very bright but let's just get logical here a light shown into your eyes if such as a a flashlight is very different than looking at a flashlight Beam on the ground yeah Far and Away difference so the point is that if you don't get enough bright sunlight or light in your eyes early in the day and then you're indoors under artificial lighting you might think well this is really bright lighting this is the kind of lighting that could disrupt my circadian rhythm at night and therefore it's sufficient to wake up my system no early in the day and throughout the day you need a lot of bright light as much as safely possible to avoid Sunburn and things of that sort which you don't want but then as the evening comes around after Sundown you need very little artificial light in order to disrupt your circadian rhythm and then just very quickly light from candles fireplaces is okay this is kind of interesting it seems bright it's but the but the measurements uh indicate that that's not going to shift your circadian rhythm much candles are great but of course don't burn your house down so the the orange and red tones in the evening way dim down that's the way to go early in the day bright bright bright light as bright as you safely can tolerate and what I like about firstly your mention of cortisol do you described how cortisol is rising in the morning and that's a great thing and it is a good thing and in the evening it's starting to drop and if you look right around your prototypical bedtime and we're going to speak later in this episode as to what your real natural bedtime is versus the one that you may be taking right now it's very interesting cortisol will almost hit its lowest point something that we call its Nader it's the lowest point in that trough of its decline right around the time when you should be sleeping however there's a great study that looked at people with insomnia and in uh subsequent episodes we'll we'll discuss this too but one of the ways that we think about or conceptualize insomnia is in two different flavors sleep onset insomnia I can't fall asleep and sleep maintenance insomnia I wake up I can't get back to sleep and what they looked at was essentially cortisol levels they had um a catheter in the arm and they were sampling it from the bloodstream and they were able to do that every 30 minutes so it's a little bit like timelapse photography and you're getting a data point every 30 minutes across the 24 hour period looking at cortisol across now a full 24-hour period and sure enough when you look at healthy controls who can sleep well and insomnia patients they look almost identical across the day but then when it comes to falling asleep right around that bedtime period the healthy controls are going all the way down the insomnia patients go down and down and down and then they have a rise back up right around that sleep onset period and then they start to drop back down again just as the control group but then they also often will have a spike in the middle of the night which then comes down and then both of them are staying low throughout the early morning period and then it starts to rise back up so it's not as though net net overall there is a higher level of cortisol in people with insomnia it seems to be right at those trigger zones that map very nicely to sleep onet problems sleep maintenance problems very interesting as somebody who wakes up in the middle of the night and sometimes has trouble getting back to sleep that that resonates I I have no trouble falling asleep whatsoever yeah knock on wood superstitious about this at this point but I use tools like non-sleep deep breast Yoga Nidra long exhale breathing but you know and I think these wakeup uh episodes seem to happen more when I'm processing a lot of stuff from my daily life that's right you know it's um the unconscious brain um often times it's working through things and and will wake us up yeah I often think that sleep maintenance insomnia that you've just described is the Revenge of daytime emotions unresolved that's a great way to put it yeah so that would be so we've spoken about regularity we've spoken about darkness and we've spoken about the inverse of that in the morning which is light a little bit of cortisol so the third out of the five is going to be temperature and the advice here is keep it cool as we mentioned a little bit in the first episode and we will go into great detail when we speak not just about these conventional and unconventional tips but we're also going to go into the future of Science and where sleep science is taking us to in fact optimize and even enhance our sleep we will speak a lot about temperature suffice to say that you need to drop your core body temperature and your brain temperature by a little less than 1° cus 2 to 3 Dees fhe to get to sleep and stay asleep the general Target that we have in sleep science if you look across the literature is somewhere around about the 67 Dee Fahrenheit or I'm trying to do the calculation maybe 18.5 is degrees C now I know that that sounds cold and cold it it is but you can also wear thick socks to bed you can have a hot water bottle at the end of the bed that's great too but the ambient must be cold the fourth piece of advice is Walk It Out and here what I mean is do not stay in bed for long periods of time awake and I think we mentioned this perhaps in the first episode too when you are awake in your bed for long stretches of time because your brain is an incredibly associative device it will quickly learn that that this thing called my bed is the place where I'm awake and not asleep and what you need to do is break that Association if you've learned that time and time again because you've stayed in bed and the rule of thumb and it's just a a rule of thumb about 20 25 minutes if you can't fall back asleep or you can't fall asleep it's okay just say tonight is not my night it's not a problem it's tomorrow is not completely shot it's fine I'm just going to get up get out of bed if you can if you're lucky enough try to go to a different room and in dim light read a book listen to a podcast whatever it is that relaxes you just do that don't check email don't eat because if you start eating that again trains your brain to start waking up and feeding at that time and only return to bed when you are sleepy and there is no time limit for that I don't want you to come back after half an hour when you are still awake and not feeling sleepy enough why because you're going to get back into bed and be in the same problem again and gradually if you do this and it's hard to do it you will relearn the association that you had I'm sure as a child which is that your bed is this place of sleepiness because often people will be saying I I feel so tired in the evening and then they get into bed and they say but now I can't fall asleep at all and I don't understand it in part it's because of that learned Association so that would be the fourth tip the fifth tip um makes me um even more unpopular as a personality and character which is try to be mindful of your alcohol and caffeine now in a subsequent episode we'll go into great detail as to how caffeine Works its mechanisms why it is sleep disruptive and why in fact I've even perhaps changed my mind on caffeine and and its benefits but it also does have significant detriment to your sleep so the rule of thumb here would be try to cut yourself off from caffeine probably at least 10 or so hours before you expect to go to bed and you can just calculate back calculate that and try to limit it so the dose and the timing make the poison cut yourself off after maybe two or three cups of coffee coffee and then that timing component count yourself back C yourself off decaffeinated coffee not too bad if you find the right thing too if you need that fix alcohol is probably one of the most misunderstood sleep aids in a quotes that there is it is no sleep aid at all now if I didn't understand what I know about alcohol and and sleep I would think that too which is look when I have a night cap just before bed or two even though I don't wear them um I I may actually just fall asleep very easily and feels like I stay asleep very soundly across the night so it's a great sleep aid and it really helps me there are at least I would say three issues with alcohol the first is that alcohol is in a class of drugs that we call the sedatives and sedation is not sleep but when you take on board alcohol in the evening you mistake the former for the latter and you think it helps you fall asleep the second thing is that because it's sedation or actually it's probably related to sedation if I were to show you the electrical signature of your deep sleep when you're just sleeping naturally versus when you have alcohol in your system it's not really the same it's not a naturalistic form of deep s it mimics it it looks not too dissimilar but if I really do my analyses and I almost like that Pink Floyd album where I take the white light of electrical brain activity coming from your head as you're sleeping and split it apart into all of the different components there are some components that are no longer present or some that are abnormally present the second issue with alcohol is that it fragments your sleep so it will litter your sleep with all these punctuated Awakenings throughout the night the danger that is that many of those Awakenings with alcohol you don't remember because they're too brief but then you wake up the next day and you think well I didn't have a problem falling asleep I didn't have a problem staying asleep but I just I feel rough I just don't feel restored by my sleep and you don't add two and two together the final concern with alcohol is that it's quite a potent Blocker of your rapid eye movement sleep or REM sleep and in subsequent episodes we'll go into great detail as to the incredible learning and memory creativity benefits that come by way of REM sleep also it's essential for our emotional regulation and recalibrating our moods so for all of those reasons I would say two things first if you are struggling with sleep not feeling restored by your sleep keep in mind your alcohol intake and also just in general be mindful of that if you are thinking about your sleep and want to preserve it so much of what you just said resonates uh I confess that in my lifetime I've had periods of um pretty spectacular sleep I characterize myself as somebody that could fall asleep anywhere anytime but I've also experienced the extreme challenges of sleep and um and that relates to different things life circumstances Etc in fact recently I've had some challenges with sleep despite using the protocols that I and uh others suggest I hadn't heard some of the things that you're um referring to here and um middle of the night waking has become more of an issue I communicated this to uh former girlfriend of mine who um was uh I was in relationship with when I was a a junior Professor meaning before I got tenure and she said you don't remember you had a Andrew but I do you had a pattern back then of um after I would fall asleep you would continue working on your laptop probably on grants um and then I would fall asleep working and then according to her I would wake up in the middle of the night and work a little bit until I'd get tired again and then fall asleep and then this would repeat so um really stamping down the uh the associative learning element that you talked about before so that was probably the first period of time in my life in which I I created this um rather uh delerious Association of work in the middle of the night in bed right um and then more recently I've had the the uh experience of waking up probably due to these like daytime things that I I'm waking up in the middle of the night thinking about and now because of our discussion during the course of of recording this series I get out of bed after even 101 15 minutes um so that I can start to eliminate that Association and another piece is that I've always felt that when I get out of bed in the middle of the night because I can't sleep and I go to the sofa I often can sleep very well reason being proving right it's a control experiment proving that the location of sleep is uh the and the association of wakefulness at sleep in bed as opposed to on the sofa is is a clear component and this is in an environment that's of equal temperature I mean it's not a perfect experiment right um it's anakata as we say but I I think that the associative piece is oh so strong um for many people and so this is something to to really take seriously I love that notion of and people will often say I just get up I go to the couch or the sofa and that's where I'll wake up in the morning also they'll say when I travel and I go to a hotel room I just can sleep fine now for some people it's the inverse but for those people it's the contextual difference meaning the change of the environment is so unfamiliar that it has not been bound to Association of wakefulness it's related to sleep or at least the opportunity to sleep sometimes even I've heard from some people and there's no studies or data on this even turning yourself around now this is hard if you have a partner in bed but you just switch top to bottom of the bed and you take your pillow and you pull the duvet all the way down and you put the pillow at the opposite end where your feet used to be and you get into bed and even just looking around and sort of having a difference that alone is so subtle but it can make a real difference so again just keep these things in mind I know it sounds strange or this whole sort of get up get out of bed break the associate and we'll come on to something well actually I'll come on to it now because I think it's one of the unconventional tips and you mentioned it a lot of people say to me that all sounds great I the science makes sense I just don't it's dark it's kind of cold I really don't want to get out of bed so give me some Alternatives I think the the single best piece of unconventional sleep advice I can give you is do anything that gets your mind off itself the principal reason that if you look at insomnia as a physiological condition or current working model mechanistically of how insomnia um plays out is that you are in this state of almost low-level anxiety and you are somewhat stressed and when you go to sleep or you try to go to sleep or you wake back up and you try to get back to sleep you just have this Rolodex of anxiety in the modern world we are constantly on reception and very rarely do we do reflection and unfortunately for many of us and I've been guilty of this the only time we do reflection is when our head is placed on the pillow and we turn the light out and that is the last time you want to be doing reflection that's the worst moment and at that point I think everyone can empathize with the idea of you turn the light out you're under stress your mind goes to those few things in the darkness of night thoughts become almost 10 times worse than they do in the brigh of day and at that moment you start to ruminate when you ruminate you begin to catastrophize and when you catastrophize you're dead in the water for the next two hours so what do you do the problem is as I said your mind is on itself and it's going through these repeated Loops anything you can do for example you can do some kind of a meditation and I when I was researching data for my book some years ago I did look into meditation and I wasn't a meditator I was a hard-nosed scientist and didn't really kind of embrace with that notion or even that um that group of people but time and again I read paper after paper and the data was very strong and it was coming from research groups that I respected very much indeed so I thought well okay I should probably give this a try and that was 6 years ago and since then I now meditate for 10 minutes every single night before bed I do a guided meditation because I'm not particularly skilled so I use an app that moves me through that but you can do whatever you how whatever meditation you like that's one example the second example is you can do breathing methods because again you're focused on your breath and what are you not focused on your thoughts and so anything that will allow you to um explore some other Focus maybe it's a body scan where you start at the top of your head or you start at your feet and you work your way up and you just say you know moving through now my neck what Sensations am I feeling now into my shoulders moving down into my chest now I can feel the ends of my fingers am I sensing anything and when you start doing that or any of these types of things the next thing that you remember is your alarm going off in the morning because you got your mind off itself so I would say that that's probably one of the unconventional tips but let me come back to the conventional anything else I've probably missed out or being unclear about the um actually I should probably say one thing in terms of these not they're not tips I don't like the word I know you don't either or hacks or um these are protocols and they're well-informed scientific protocols in all of this discussion today you can get all of these things in place and still have problems with sleep the reason is because you may be suffering from a Sleep Disorder so the analogy would be let's say that I'm your athletic coach and you're a sports Superstar I can perfect everything I can perfect your your diet your supplements we can perfect your Technique we can perfect but if you've got a broken ankle none of those things are going to alter your performance right now you've got to get to a doctor and get that scen to and then we can come back to fine-tuning your performance it's the same with sleep if you've got a sleep disorder such as snoring sleep apnea or insomnia we need to get you to a doctor first and then only after that come back once you're resolved then we can start to optimize that's the only other thing I probably should mention yeah this is all very useful discussion because I think that um of course there will be those folks out there that just like what are they talking about I sleep so well at night you know consider yourself blessed many many people struggle with uh challenges with sleep and I think it's fair to say that sooner or later most everybody experiences some challenges with sleep for whatever reason you look at the statistics that's highly likely in your lifetime you are more than likely to go through either a period of challenging sleep or in fact about of insomnia I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 AG one is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens and is designed to meet all of your foundational nutritional needs by now I'm sure you've all heard me say that I've been taking ag1 since 2012 and indeed that is true now of course I do consume regular Whole Foods every day I strive to get those Foods mostly from unprocessed or minimally processed sources however I do find it hard to get enough servings of fruits and vegetables each day so with ag1 I ensure that I get enough of the vitamins minerals prebiotics fiber and other things typically found in fruits or vegetables and of course I still make sure to eat fruits and vegetables and in that way provide a sort of insurance that I'm getting enough of what I need in addition the adaptogens and other micronutrients in ag1 really help buffer against stress and ensure that the cells and organs and tissues of my body are getting the things they need people often ask me that if they were going to take Just One supplement what that supplement should be and I always answer ag1 if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer you'll get five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman you talked about alcohol I'm not a consumer of alcohol anymore um nor am I and it's not I it's not because I have anything against it yeah many people do enjoy it and um and know uh we're not calling judgment on on them I mean certainly much of the world enjoys uh alcohol could we talk a little bit more about um aside from demolishing REM sleep um you know do we know that alcohol causes these disruptions in sleep directly meaning by changing the um pattern of release of neurotransmitters like Gaba things of that sort or is this an indirect effect you know is this like through the gut microbiome that then impacts sleep um and the reason I ask is maybe we could get to some more specific uh dos and do not protocols so for instance if somebody wants to have a cocktail how close to sleep can they get and uh not diminish their rapid eye movement sleep too much you know because people are still going to want to drink um and with that said if people do have a couple of drinks and then they they go to sleep is there is there anything they can do prior to sleep to uh try and rescue um their some of their quality sleep great question so in terms of the mechanism it seems actually not to be the alcohol but some of the metabolic byproducts of alcohol we think that perhaps the main culprit may be some of the aldah highs that are the metabolic um separate consequences of alcohol metabolism you make a good point though in terms of the the the dose response timing curve how late or how early do I have to cut myself off from alcohol people have done those studies and they have found that even an afternoon single glass of wine if you measure sleep in the way that we measure it at my center with High Fidelity you can see compromises and impairments I wish I could tell you otherwise I would say that based on that data the principal protocol advice I would have for you is go to the pub in the morning that way by the time you're about to sleep the alcohol is out your system and you could no no I would never as a as a public scientist I would never Advocate necessarily for wanting I'm just kidding you but um that's that's sort of one of the unfortunate consequences there does seem to be an impact to say that there isn't is just me not being truthful about the data but again if you are think about the tradeoff here if you're going out or you're having friends over and you're going to make an incredible evening of memories and you're going to open a favorite bottle of wine and have a couple of glasses of wine is your sleep going to be compromised yes it is but maybe that's worth the tradeoff for that specific night I would just not wish you to and you've spoken a lot and so is our dear friend Peter and others there just doesn't seem to be any safe amount of alcohol um but I would say think about that trade-off simply however don't make it habit that you're doing it you know multiple nights a week or more that would probably be the advice great what about food and sleep um how close to sleep um is it okay to have a meal if you want to optimize your sleep um I I like to eat my final meal somewhere around 6:30 p.m. but and I go to sleep somewhere around 8:30 900 p.m. in an Ideal World sometimes I go to sleep a bit later uh sometimes I eat a little bit later it's just you know there's some variability with these but um put differently what is the relationship between food intake and Sleep Quality in terms of timing of food intake and then perhaps we can talk a little bit about um food macronutrients it's very interesting there was somewhat of a Dogma out there that we have to stop eating you know three or 4 hours before bed for optimal sleep if you look at the data the data is quite a spread no pun intended there is there are some people for whom that works very well and if they eat even two hours before bed they just get disrupted in terms of their sleep some of that is about people just feeling too full and not feeling comfortable other aspects are that when you become recumbent when you lie down you have a higher risk of gastric reflux coming back up and therefore you get heartburn and that's pretty miserable and people will describe that too by way of closer proximity of food intake relative to when you're falling asleep nevertheless if you look at the data and I I did a recent very deep dive on this personally myself about 12 months ago it's not quite as Extreme as the Dogma makes out if you eat 2 hours before bed on average it doesn't seem to necessarily harm your sleep now that's very different than saying what is best to improve or enhance your sleep but the way these studies were designed it was looking at detriments they then went to 90 minutes before sleep onset and even there there didn't seem to be Market impermanence 60 Minutes you started to see maybe some signs but on average the effect size was somewhat weak but then when you get close to sort of 45 minutes or so then things did start to deteriorate I think it depends hugely on your chronotype and also just on your appetite Cadian Rhythm preferences too I am someone who I do not feel very hungry when I first wake up in the morning I don't feel very hungry throughout most of the day and I will onboard most of my calories probably in the hours probably in about a 4H hour period maybe less even 3-hour period and then I will cut myself off about 90 minutes before sleep so I classically I would have been considered as you know violating this sleep dogma of of cutting yourself off at least three hours I think it's very personal though just experiment with it you will know the situation um as for macros and specific food components the data is a little bit mixed certainly what we know is that if you're eating a diet that is high in sugar and low in protein your sleep is worse why would that be the case well one of the reasons that we think is that if you onboard sugar it can be somewhat metabolically active and when it becomes metabolically active it can increase your body temperature your core body temperature even just for very subtly but that's enough to disrupt your sleep as we spoke about with temperature but I think in terms of really the you know what would be the ideal macron nutrient and even micronutrient um dietry recommendation that I would have for you I don't think we have enough data yet above and beyond that that statement um yeah yeah I I've experienced um when I eat a very low carbohydrate diet which I've experimented with in the past maybe even even full ketogenic diet for for brief periods of time although I'm an omnivore so I eat meat and eggs and I also eat starches pastas rice Etc um but we know based on beautiful work from for example Chris Palmer from from Harvard Medical School uh who is a guest on this podcast I listen to that it was great podcast yeah Chris is is spectacular and and U has advocated the exploration of ketogenic diets for the treatment of various psychiatric conditions not all but psychiatric conditions and and it seems and he agreed with me on this that when people go on very low starch very low carbohydrate diets that sometimes they can experience a bit of hypomania some people can and challenge this with sleep and um sometimes there are psychiatric reasons why um people stay on those diets anyway and then they have to do other things to encourage their sleep by their pharmacology or supplementation or some combination but I I can say anecdotally for myself if I if I don't eat starches for a extended amount of time a couple of days I find it very hard to get quality sleep as indicated by Sleep trackers um and uh and just uh sleep late latency to fall asleep is longer than it is ETC um so i' I've opted to eat most of my carbohydrates Ates later in the evening um which and violates you know every rule of you know eat your carbs early in the day and and and I think there are some data to support that eating carbohydrates early in the day may actually um have certain benefits for weight maintenance or weight loss so I realized that but those aren't my my goals at the moment weight maintenance yes weight loss no so I think um I certainly feel after eating a dinner that has a bit more starch pasta rice these things of that sort and a little bit lower protein as opposed to the inverse like eating a couple couple of riy steaks and a salad but no starch that um my sleep is substantially better um and I always uh attributed that to the relationship between some of the starches and the tryptophan serotonin pathway yeah there is some data on that with the carbohydrate intake in the evening and of course that that tryptophan and that carbohydrate intake um will contain the precursor ingredients to something else that we've spoken about which is melatonin and so that may actually help healthily boost that melatonin signal and there's a little bit of data on that to supported to we also did a study where we um we were looking at night to night to night sleep and carbohydrate intake the next day and it did seem to support what you're describing in terms of some of the carbohydrate benefits we also found a strange result that was almost the opposite prediction that we made carbohydrate intake in the morning to equally help people wake up and we were a little bit uncertain as to why but we're going to go into more detail the reason that you mentioned the the suggestion of not take on carbs in the evening is in part based on the evidence that your body's ability to dispose of sugar and obviously when you're eating carbohydrate you can have a higher um Spike of sugar now that in part depends on what you're eating with that carbohydrate and also of course the nature of that carbohydrate whether it's simple or whether it's complex whether it's simple sugars versus you know complex more um starchy uh carbohydrate but the idea is that your body even if you were to eat the same amount of carbohydrate in the morning in the afternoon or in the evening same carbohydrate dose and type but your body's ability to dispose of that without having excessive spikes of glucose is worse in the evening better in the morning I.E if you're concerned about your blood sugar um and your metabolic Health maybe that's what you should do I think that that data is unclear on the basis of if you are um glycemic normal meaning that you currently do not have signs of type two two diabetes or you're not pre-diabetic then that may not necessarily be the case and so I think that's why it could be you know beneficial for you and I know that you've um you think deeply about that and and um I've even been tracking blood sugar as well I don't have any signs of that but I'm just fascinated by some of that data and how it interacts with my sleep because I'm a a sleep nerd so I think right now we just don't have plentiful data to recommend a particular sleep quote unquote diet for improved optimization I would say though that we can be a little bit more relaxed about the timing of our food earlier you mentioned C caffeine and caffeine is a topic that we get into into substantial depth in episode three but there and now I uh I will emphasize that caffeine is the most commonly used drug worldwide I think the statistic says that 90 plus perent of adults consume caffeinated beverages every day which is remarkable and a few years back I recall there was an article in The Economist that charted the country's for which the caffeine consumption was highest and way out on the peak Peak peak of was almost uh triple or quadruple what other what the second place country um consumed each day was can you guess the country that consumes the most caffeine could be tea coffee any form I'm going to suggest it's a Scandinavian country no but uh but they're they're up they're up there it was Switzerland now I don't know if that's still the case but apparently the the reason I went I was thinking it was because I've seen the graph I was thinking it was Sweden but Scandinavian and if I have that wrong um certainly someone will put it in the the comments on YouTube I recall the Swiss drink so much caffeine they have uh a lot to think about so I love caffeine I drink black coffee black espresso and Y Bronte um I love Yerba Monte been drinking it since I was a little one um because of the argentines in my family um and I drink it in the early part of the day typically um a couple hours after waking or so I'll have my first um sip of caffeine and then I try to stop drinking caffeine somewhere around noon or 1 p.m. occasionally I'll have a shot or two of a espresso in the early afternoon if there's important work to be done and I need to do that but I I've noticed that even that can alter my sleep in ways that that I don't like but the afternoon coffee for some reason tastes so much better than the morning coffee for me I don't know what it is so it's coffee year bate packed early into the day and a lot of it for me yeah I have a high tolerance for it um but then I let it taper is that an optimal Contour of caffeine intake um would Zero caffeine be better if someone's just really committed to sleep and they don't like caffeine would zero be better than any and what about that afternoon coffee or tea containing caffeine I mean how disruptive is it for sleep so the profile that you describe which is high peak early on and first thing when you wake up and then tapering off nicely down into the sort of early afternoon ideal that sounds great to me as for that afternoon coffee it really depends again on when you are expecting to go to sleep now for someone like you I would say I would love to look at abstaining from that or just switching it out to if you're using you know these pods or however you're Brewing it let's just switch it out and do an experiment for two weeks and we will look to see how much is that afternoon coffee really impacting your sleep and will track your sleep with some degree of High Fidelity with a wearable and let's test that hypothesis because you go to sleep quite early you are an early bird maybe bordering on an extreme um early bird and we'll speak about um or we have spoken about those different flavors of chronotype I would prefer you not to be having that caffeine in the afternoon based on how early you go to sleep and I mention that preference because of what you described regarding your sleep maintenance insomnia one of the issues with caffeine is that not only can it make it more difficult for you to fall asleep which you don't have in part because if you're waking up quite frequently throughout the night and struggling to get back to sleep you're going to be carrying a sleep debt into every night and that debt continues to grow and it's almost like compounding interest on a loan so you will not have a problem falling asleep in fact sometimes the speed with which people fall asleep and some of these uh sleep trackers will almost penalize you for falling asleep too quickly is because in sleep science and clinical sleep medicine if your it should take you somewhere you know healthy sleep onset you know 5 to 15 20 minutes but if you put your head on the pillow and you turn off the light and within a minute or so you're dead to the world and you're gone I'm exactly I'm worried that you're a carrying a sleep dead now not necessarily but I'm I would like to explore it um with you and then I would say even if you can fall asleep fine this factor of waking up in the middle of the night is also related to caffeine why because caffeine not only can make it harder to fall asleep not your problem but it keeps you out of that deep deep sleep and it puts you into a more shallow state of nonrapid ey movement sleep and when you are in this shallow State it's a easier for you to be woken up but be and I think more of the problem it's hard harder for you to fall back asleep because your brain doesn't necessarily want to go back down into that deep sleep and nor has it come up out of that deep sleep so you're not in that wonderful glorious thick triy sort of sleepy State when you wake up you go to the restroom you come back and you just know this is going to be great I'm as as long as I can fumble my way back to my mattress I'm going to be asleep within another two minutes going back to it whereas for you you probably wake up and you feel pretty Wide Awake I would like to see what happens when we negate that afternoon coffee on the frequency and the duration of those middle of the night Awakenings for you yeah I'm definitely making the effort to avoid caffeine intake in the afternoon and I think um already starting to see some of the positive benefits of doing that great as evidenced by the days that I consume caffeine in the afternoon and experience the the deficits it's a real thing and I I believe you've um about the numbers uh on a different podcast previously could talk a little bit about the metabolism of caffeine and um and maybe even some of the variations that exist between people in terms of the metabolic U regulation of caffeine so how long let's say uh drink a standard cup of coffee or a cuple of espresso and it has a gosh I don't know 150 milligrams of caffeine is that 200 could 150 200 let's say 200 because certainly uh you know a barista these days is going to draw a a beverage over index yeah so let's say 200 milligrams and and somebody consumes that after lunch at uh 100 p.m. and their bedtime is let's let's make them more conventional than I uh somewhere between 10: and 11: p.m. yeah okay so they're they're about 10 9 to 10 hours out from their bedtime they're having a nice strong quote unquote nice strong cup of coffee after lunch um what what does that look like in terms of their biochemistry and and impact on sleep so caffeine has something that we call a halflife of about 5 to 6 hours meaning that after 5 to 6 hours about 50% of that caffeine is still circulating in your bloodstream and thus your brain that means that caffeine has a quarter life of somewhere between 10 to 12 hours now this is on average and we'll come back to variations but think of it this way if you're taking a cup of coffee like you described there at midday and then you're going to bed at let's say 11: or midnight that would be the equivalent based on what I've just told you the quarter life of getting yourself into bed and just before you took yourself into bed you Swig a quarter of a cup of coffee and you H for a good night of sleep and the chances are that it it may not happen now again that's a little bit sort of hyperbolic as a as a statement but just try to conceptualize it in that way you would never think about taking off on you know a last quarter cup of coffee just before you put your eye mask on no but I have some friends and um somebody actually who works with the podcast team and we'll go out to dinner as a team when we're on the road and he'll order like a big coffee right after a 900 p.m. dinner and I was just like can you sleep on like oh yeah no problem and that no problem is in part this I don't have an issue with falling asleep but if we were to based on the data map there electrical brain activity you would be able to see this reduction in the deep non-rm sleep and it can reduce it if you look at the data somewhere between 15 to 20% now for me to reduce your deep sleep by 15 to 20% I would probably have to age you by about 20 to 22 years or you could just do it every night with a late night coffee should you should you wish so again I've and maybe we'll speak about this in in later episodes I have changed my mind on caffeine I think morning caffeine use or coffee I should say being more specific is fine because I think there are health benefits and we can go into in subsequent episodes why coffee and the coffee be in itself can provide those benefits so I've become a little bit more bullish on morning caffeine but evening caffeine I just think it's the data is just not supportive even if you are and there are variations and you were very um astute in your question some people I said on average caffeine has a half life of about 5 to six hours for some people it's quicker and for other people it's slower why is that it's based on a gene and we know the gene it's a gene that is part of a set of liver enzymes and the gene is called the cyp1 A2 Gene and there are variations in that Gene what we call polymorphisms and you can do these genetic tests that you can buy these kits and they all probably tell you which you are are you sensitive or you're not sensitive you probably already know and so some people will not be as sensitive and therefore they can have a more compressed time frame of a halflife because it's moving out of their system in a quicker manner so again I'm not trying to be skir mongering I think you can have coffeee in the morning and you'll be just fine that late night coffee I would I would like to see you obviate that if you are someone who's doing it and the afternoon coffee sounds like a you know maybe only every once in a while and try and make it mostly decaf or decaf for that matter if it's really just for the taste yeah if it's just for the taste go decaf if it's not I understand that in some ways what I'm talking about is the ideal world and drum roll it turns out that most of us don't live in that we live in this thing called the real world and so if you are facing a circumstance where if you're under pressure at work or if you're high performing athlete and this is it this is the event this is you it's all in a think understand that you you are going to sacrifice some sleep at night but maybe that sacrifice is well worth it so again I'm very open-minded I'm not trying to be um simply you know too rigid with this I want to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor insid tracker insid tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach

talked about food and its effects on sleep what about THC and CBD sometimes referred to more uh generally as cannabis and you know it's interesting you know gosh when I was growing up um you know cannabis was illegal um nowadays it's um either legal or tolerated or decriminalized in many places not all but I I would would say there's been a um a a tide shift in terms of um cannabis meaning that many people consume cannabis who are um consuming it legally and consume it for a lot of reasons that other people consume alcohol in you know a sedative effect a slight hypnotic effect I mean you know the actual definition of what these drugs do it goes by certain terms in the psychiatric literature of course but but in order to quote unquote mellow out to feel more relx to reduce their anxiety um it's it's far and away different than when I was growing up where I me you would get into a lot of trouble uh if you were caught um smoking a joint or um taking a bong rip in the middle of the day but not and I realize most people aren't doing that at work I guess it depends on where you work um but it you know Edibles tinctures I mean the the consumption of THC and CBD is is quite um quite robust in a lot of places so um with all the issues of legality and the fact that people who young people um should not be consuming them me people 18 and younger not just for legal reasons but the brain is still developing um what is the story with THC CBD cannabis edibl smoked uh tinctures on sleep specifically it's very interesting if you look firstly at the motivational reasons why people use cannabis based on [Music] the published study somewhere in the top two reasons sleep to fall and stay asleep fall asleep and stay asleep obviously usually the principle first reason is just to get high and have the experience and the pleasure of being high if that's what sort of floats your um floats your train floats your train but certainly it's you know sleep um as and what we call a hypnotic to put you asleep from um the Greek derivative of the God for for sleep that is high among the reasons that people will use we currently don't recommend it and here is why certainly THC helps you fall asleep faster very clear in the data the problem is that first you start to develop a tolerance and to get that same sleep onset benefit you need to get use I should say a higher dose so you start to develop dependency and your dose regimen starts to increase the second issue with THC is that it's very good at blocking your dream sleep your REM sleep in fact many people when they come and they tell me look I was a heavy cannabis user even a light cannabis user for some time and then I stopped using and one of the strangest things happened to me I just started to have the most wild Vivid crazy dreams and I didn't know what was going on and it's a very simple explanation as you've been using your brain has been compromised in the amount of REM sleep it's been getting and you've been building up chronically a REM sleep debt and your brain is smart in the sense that it does try to clock to some degree a counter of how much REM sleep you've lost and many people will say yeah I don't really remember my dreams when I'm using but when they stop the brain finally because it's been cleansed of the thing that's the roadblock to REM sleep not only did they go back to having the normal amount of REM sleep that people would have they have that plus they have what we call a REM sleep rebound which is even more and more intense REM sleep which leads to more intense dreaming so it's a very I suspect there's a lot of people who've had that experience listening if they have been users and they've stopped so that's the second reason we don't Advocate it the third third reason is that when you stop using you also go or go through a very vicious insomnia withdrawal syndrome often many people will do now that depends on you know how much you've been using for how long you've been using if you look at the data and by the way part of the um clinical diagnostic the psychiatric diagnostic um description of cannabis withdrawal is insomnia that's how reliable this insomnia problem is when you come off cannabis and if you look at the data the one of the main reasons that people relapse and start using cannabis again even though they don't want to is because they can't deal with the insomnia that withdrawal has given them so you don't want to get into that vicious cycle should you wish again it's your choice um so THC I think is not to be advised right now CBD is interesting I don't think there's enough data yet for us to have a very strong opinion but I can at least offer mine the data so far is a little bit mixed in what we call the effect size in other words how reliable and how powerful is the benefit of CBD on sleep but it does seem to have some benefit what's interesting is that it doesn't seem to have the detriments that I just described for or THC you've got to be looking at the data a little bit careful with CBD it has what's called a u-shape function to it which is that if you're taking too little and again I really I'm so mindful of not trying to be okay here are the numbers but if you look at them I would say you know kind of cross your eyes squint your eyes maybe less than 25 migr you run into the danger of CBD being wake promoting rather than sleep promoting but once you get past if you look is 50 milligrams and above then you start to go in the opposite direction where it seems to be sleep promoting and I mention that just because at least here in the United States and in many places in the world that industry is not regulated so it may say 50 milligrams on the bottle you don't really know now some of those companies will have what's called third-party Laboratory Testing where they'll send it out and you can scan a qri code and you can look at an independent laboratory that tested it and show you the p p uh purity of it so that may be one way to go so CBD I think has some favorable evidence right now if that's the case let's just assume that you and I speak in another five years time and there's really good data now for this what could be the mechanisms I think there's at least there's probably at least two maybe three mechanisms the first is an indirect mechanism CBD has been demonstrated very nicely in some fantastic studies to be an anotic which is a fancy term for saying it reduces down your anxiety and earlier you and I discussed that anxiety and stress is one of the things that will keep you awake so indirectly it removes this kind of gate that is preventing you from moving down the Royal Road of sleep and it opens back up the gate because it's remove that gate mechanism which is high anxiety and by way of being an anxiolytic IT soften that anxiety and it's easier for you to fall asleep I think that's probably the principal mechanistic bet I would have right now another indirect mechanism if you look at some of the studies in rats and we do um human work at my sleep center so we don't do animal studies but if you look at the data in the rats CBD can be hypothermic which means that it drops your core body temperature and just as we spoke about in earlier in this episode you need to drop your body temperature to get to sleep so I think that's the second reason I think the third reason is that it could have a direct sleep promoting mechanism I think it's unclear right now exactly how it's interacting with the Sleep Machinery of the brain we've got some hypotheses the danger is again it's just not a well-regulated substance so I am actually just um full disclosure I'm working with a company in the United Kingdom uh in collaboration with um King's College and The Institute of Psychiatry there to see if we can create an analog a clean analog of CBD but I think the potential upside of it not just for sleep but for a number of different psychiatric conditions like anxiety um could be beneficial so I would say that that's right now the the sort of the skinny on THC and and CBD okay so just to make sure that I have the basic list of sleep hygiene factors correct I have regularity is King yep light and dark meaning that one should optimize or at least seek to optimize their exposure to light in the morning and throughout the day and in the evening to make things dim and dark yes temperature and there you have a a little um it's not a montra but what is it it's a warm up to cool down to fall asleep and then it's stay cool like Fonzi stay cool to stay asleep and then warm up to wake up yep and we will come on to that I think in a little while again then there's walk it out which is if I understand correctly if you're trying to fall asleep or fall back asleep and it's taking you longer than about 20 25 minutes you should just get out of bed and go elsewhere in the house do something else maybe even lie down on a different surface in the house to try and see if you can sleep there but don't stay in bed don't create a parir Association of wakefulness and your bed because that can lead to problems in subsequent nights yeah and I would only say that try to resist if you can if you really want your bedroom to be the place where you now become consistently asleep try not to start sleeping in some other location consistently because then all of a sudden you bond that with good sleep and you unbuckle this notion that we're trying to relearn which is know your bedroom is the place of sleep so it's fine to go elsewhere try to stay awake and force yourself to stay awake until you are absolutely sleepy then go back to bed okay and then we discussed alcohol food caffeine and THC CBD AKA cannabis and with respect to alcohol it's clear that none is best if you're going to have some uh you don't want to drink too early in the day but you don't want to drink too much or too close to bedtime because it can disrupt rapid eye movement sleep food uh seems that creating some sort of buffer between the uh your last bite of food and uh your to bedtime by anyway somewhere between you know maybe 2 three hours but for some people it'll be more like 90 minutes and of course that's going to depend on the size of the meal Etc but eating a big meal and then going straight to bed probably not a good idea caffeine has this long halflife so if you're going to indulge which I do do so early in the day beware the afternoon caffeine yeah do the hubman tapa is what I'm going to call it right now which is not interpretive dense it's simply the caffeine tape and then um THC CBD uh does nothing good for your sleep architecture although some people have the uh impression that it is good for their sleep because it makes it easier for them to fall asleep but what they are unaware of is that it is disrupting the quality and architecture of the different stages of sleep in ways that are not serving people well that seems to be the case for THC and I think CBD you know has promise and research must try harder including my own and you um very uh kindly emphasize that you're not telling people what to do they just should know what they're doing so that they can make uh changes uh if they so choose that's right I would always say that um I'm not trying to be a medical doctor any advice that I give is simply scientifically descriptive advice it's not medically prescriptive nor lifestyle prescriptive advice I'm smiling because what I always say is um I'm a scientist not a physician so I don't prescribe anything but I profess lots of things so or as my good friend who's a musician Tim Armstrong says I'm not a cop that's right so so do what you want um okay what a wonderful list to leap off into the unconventional and more advanced tools for Sleep enhancement so um let's go there so I think many people may have heard of some of the conventional but what about the unconventional I would probably offer five or six the first one I would say is that if you are struggling with sleep and you have had a bad night of sleep the first first recommendation is do nothing and what I mean by that is if you've had a bad night of sleep you're awake for 3 hours do not sleep in any later into the morning do not go to bed any earlier do not increase your caffeine intake to try to offset it and do not nap during the day why am I telling you those things if you wake up later that following morning your adenosine clock that we spoking about this building up of sleepiness that happens when we wake up is going to start later in the day so when it comes time for you to fall asleep at what would then be the next night at your normal time you're not going to feel as sleepy why because you woke up that much later and you're setting yourself up for failure again equally don't go to bed any earlier if you have become a customed and your brain has and your Cadian clock has become accustomed to going to bed at a certain time and hopefully you're doing it regularly then getting into bed two or 3 hours early has the danger it's not a certainty but a danger of you then getting into bed and thinking well I'm I know I had a bad night of sleep last night but I still can't fall asleep straight away so now you're spending another 90 minutes in bed at the beginning because you've gone to bed 90 minutes earlier thinking it's a good idea to compensate don't do that either hold out even if you do feel tired my recommendation would be after that bad night of sleep hold out for as long as you can as close to your natural bedtime as possible then go to sleep and you'll give yourself highest chance of success don't over caffeinate that's the obvious one follow the beautiful hubman taper and then obviously try not to compensate with a nap why because that nap as happens when we sleep is going to remove some of that sleepiness that pene and once again you get into bed and you're not as sleepy as you would naturally be so you again go through a bad night cuz you're struggling to sleep or you wake up and you can't get back because you've got less weight of sleepiness on your shoulders due to the nap that happened earlier so I know it's hard but I would say when the alarm goes off after a bad night you just think I do not want to get up it's been such a rough night I know it's a shortterm gain but trust me it's a long-term loss because you're going to then just get into this vicious cycle so that's the first unconventional tip the can I just pause you for a second I I'm a little wide-eyed over here because um I did not know any of that typically if I get a poor night sleep I'll do whatever I can to recover that sleep um take a nap I'll do you know I'll adjust my to bedtime the next evening um so I hope everyone is paying uh careful attention to what Matt just said I mean the that's a important list because I think one of the very common things is for people to just not get a great night's sleep and I think most people think okay I'll drink a little more caffeine I will um go to bed a little earlier tonight you know maybe catch a nap in the afternoon this kind of thing um and I would have thought that too and maybe even suggested that and if you listen to the first episode and where we you know I list in a doomsday manner the things that can happen by way of a short night you you would think that that's what I would then recommend but it was imprinted On Me by um a wonderful sleep clinician U Michael palis um who sort of described some of these features and exactly the reasons sort of underlying them and I think I've just tried to bake that out into a formula that makes sense again it's not about the rule it's about explaining it because when you explain it at first it sounds contradictory and paradoxical when you understand it it hopefully sounds logical and actionable um so that would be the first suggestion could I just sorry interrupt again my audience hates when I interrupt but I'm doing it on their behalf because because because I I like to think that there's um some value in some of at least what you say in response um I saw a really uh terrific post from Dr Ronda Patrick um who we both know and admire um for her public education work public health education work and she described a study whereby if people are I think it was slightly sleep deprived Maybe by a few hours that some of the uh disruption to morning blood glucose regulation that is known to accompany partial sleep deprivation and certainly complete sleep deprivation but um in this case partial sleep deprivation could be offset by still exercising in the morning that's right um which frankly I have to say if I haven't slept that well then you know normally I'm like H maybe today's the day I don't exercise but now having heard that information I make it a point to still exercise um sometimes with a little bit less intensity yeah um because I don't want to be completely exhausted in the afternoon um and and go to sleep at you know 4 p.m. or something really disrupt my schedule but I thought that was really interesting because it's it's a it's a sort of um partial inoculation of of the blood glucose disruption caused by uh sleep deprivation I I'm so glad you brought it up it's a fantastic study and I um Rond and I um I think even tried to discuss it some years ago on a show but I like it because it does offer some degree of actionable Hope and a strategy blood sugar absolutely critical it is very sensitive to sleep when you don't get enough it goes in bad directions you used a very specific word cleverly so that word was partially at first you hear or read that study and Ronda was never suggesting this too I'm not saying that you think well if it offsets blood sugar and the city was saying exercise can nullify a lack of sleep you conflate that single outcome benefit with the idea that well but maybe it doesn't actually re or does it compensate for the deficits in immune function or cardiovascular disease concerns or my hormonal health or my learning in memory or my emotional and brain health maybe it does but maybe it doesn't so I think I would always just caution people to saying when you hear a study like that it's very natural to think oh that must mean that it translates to everything else in my body and everything else in my brain it may but it also may not be terrific so if you don't sleep that well do your best to still get some exercise but just be mindful of the um the fact that you know in the winter months especially that might if you go too hard in the gym or on a run you might be a little bit immune compromised just be mindful of the fact that you're you're a more vulnerable being when you're sleep deprived and that but that exercise can help adjust things in the right direction and if it's early in the day um presumably that's not going to disrupt your the proper bedtime and if it's later in the day I suppose as long as you don't need caffeine in order to uh to do that exercise and or um if you're familiar with exercising later in the day fine I you know I find if I exercise like I'm not one of these people think can go for a run at you know 7:00 at night and then just shower you're a morning type because I'm a morning type other people can okay we'll get into exercise a bit more in a later episode um we'll be sure to do that but nonetheless I just rais that now um so what are some of the other unconventional protocols for sleep so I think other suggestions I would have after do nothing would be try to think about limiting your time embed if you are struggling with sleep this is something that is used in the probably the most well validated psychological intervention for insomnia and it's called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia or cbti for short what happens is that you work with a clinician they interview you they assess all of the reasons that you may not be sleeping and then they create from the toolbox of many different options a bespoke tailored sort of saval R soup prescription for you for your treatment if you look at the studies of that collection of different tools in the cbti Box for intervention of insomnia and you ask of all of those which seems to carry the greatest impact on insomnia which has the greatest sort of Gravitas it seems to be this thing that we call bedtime rescheduling it used to be known as sleep restriction therapy but obviously if you come to to mean you say look I'm not sleeping very well I've got insomnia I say I understand and I've got a treatment for you it's called Sleep restriction therapy and you say no no no you didn't understand it I I'm not getting enough sleep but it's not quite that here's how it works if you are spending so much time in bed too much time in bed you are not forcing your brain to be efficient and by way of constraining your sleep window even to let's say five hours a night to begin with i Brute Force ruthless efficiency from your sleeping brain after several days so another analogy would be let's say you're trying to make a nice thin crust of of pizza base and you put the dough on the table and you start rolling it out if you roll it too thin it starts to get gaps and holes in it why because you've spread it out too far and you've started to create these absences that's the same thing that happens and it's very natural as an insomnia patient you would say I'm just not getting enough sleep so I'm going to start spending more time in bed it's the very worst idea another way would be to say look I go to the gym and I you know spend about an hour and a half working out but if I were to videotape you a lot of people are doing the I think you've I've coed as your phrase but um the 11th rep where people you know do the 10 reps and then all of a sudden there's the selfie or there's the social media oh yeah the texting they finish the lastup put down and then straight away on the TT and if you look they're only working out for about let's say 45 minutes and the other is wasted so what if the next day you came to the gym and I said look I'm sorry and there's some big bouncer guys at the door um you are only allowed to work out for 40 minutes and then we're going to eject you and the first day you go back and you do the same thing and then you've only got through 30% of your workout so you get booted the next day you come back in you do a little bit more and you get booted again after about five or six days you you've built up such a strong desire and hunger to get your workout in you walk in you put your phone on silent you put it over in the corner and you just get to it and that's the same thing that we're trying to do with sleep restriction therapy so you have to be a little bit careful do it under supervision especially if you're driving or you're operating heavy machinery we just want to keep an eye it's not necessarily a big concern but we would say Okay Andrew you're currently spending almost total about you know 8ish or 7 and a half hours in bed tonight I'm going to restrict you down to 5 hours a night and we're going to do this for the next week and the way that we normally do it is I don't change your wakeup time I change your to bed time why it's easier to stay awake longer than it is to wake up earlier so I put it on the front end to the compromise and at first things don't change but after maybe about four or five days of going through this I build up enough of a shortterm debt in your system that your system all of a sudden thinks gosh I just cannot be as lazy anymore I can't do this thing of waking up in the middle of the night and spending an hour and a half awake I don't have the choice anymore there's so much physiological buildup and pressure to do this and gradually what happens is that you sleep longer you don't wake up as much and after maybe about 2 weeks of doing this all of a sudden you go to bed at this later time so for you let's say you normally go to bed at 88: I'm going to have you go to bed at maybe 10:30 11: but we're still going to have you wake up at that sort of 4:30 a.m. Mark that you would normally wake up and all of a sudden you go to bed at 10:30 11 you're out like a light and then again the next thing you remember is your alarm going off saying I'm sorry you've got to wake up and what happens by way of that reset is gradually we will then once you're stable we will start to back it off we'll start to have you go to bed at 10: and if it stays stable then 9:45 then 9:30 and tit trate you back to where you were and if there's any sign that you're starting to not sleep well we zip it back up again the goal here is in some ways almost like hitting the reset button on your Wi-Fi router I'm trying to retrain your brain to better sleep because when you are not sleeping well you've lost your confidence in your ability to sleep and when I do this technique with you gradually your system and you cognitively relearn that you are a good sleeper and you can trust in sleep and now your sleep does not control you you control your sleep the hard part however is that it's not easy to go through and we have to be we have to usually ask two questions with individuals firstly what is your motivation for better sleep um we need to know that you really are motivated and then second you just stay with a hi touch White Glove frequency checking in on individuals and motivating them to keep going because it's very easy to fall off the wagon so that's the the next suggestion sleep restriction therapy or bedtime rescheduling as we would call it you said it's difficult for people to go through you know it takes a little bit of rigor a little bit of attention means in some cases getting less sleep than one would like but as compared to something that you know sadly I've experienced a lot in my life of having challenges with sleep and trying to get things back in order and looking at the the bed and just going oh my God Battle Ground you know Battle Ground you know it's um I think it it makes a lot of sense and I love the analogy to the gym somehow if there's a restriction into 1 hour in and out the door or maybe 70 minutes in and out the door CU you need to put your stuff in the locker or something like that it always at least for me gets done best when you just have those constraints I think there's something about the human brain that we don't do well in um un unrestrained systems that I I really think guard rails are are fantastic I love deadlines for instance yeah discipline is essentially the hard hard deadlines like or as they say in Academia because we you know write grants all the time drop deadlines which who up that ter but like if you don't make it that's it it's like there isn't a hey I'll send this in tomorrow 5:00 p.m. Pacific time that website closes and you better Bo do you get things done all of a sudden it's surprising how much distraction you can you know pull out the noise and focus on the signal it's great signal to noise ratio yeah and I I love the idea that you that one can control their sleep as opposed to sleep controlling them I think that that's um and and this notion of sleep confidence um one's conf idence in their ability to sleep these are important terms and they're more than just terms because I think that um a a field and and an area of Health practice and gosh what's more important than sleep it's the foundation of mental health physical health and performance period um really thrives on a common um common nomenclature and and I really appreciate that you're you know peppering these episodes with it with um new nomenclature um that captures a lot of the essence of the protocols and the mechanisms so there that's my editorial please please continue I would say that in terms of other things maybe just to go through them um a little more quickly we've spoken some about a wind down routine most people underappreciate the importance of a wi down routine we often think that sleep is like a light bulb that we dive into bed we switch off the light bulb and sleep should appear just as quickly it's untrue sleep in terms of a process is much more physiologically like trying to land a plane it just takes time to come down onto the terraferma of good sleep at night whatever it is you enjoy as a relaxation method engage in it could be listening to a podcast could be reading a book maybe it's a meditation it's light stretching maybe whatever it is that you do just build it into your regiment you know you would never you know be driving down the road and then pull into your garage at the same 40 mph speed you gradually decelerate and you come to a stop it's the same thing with sleep so you need to find some way to decelerate and we've spoken about methods already as to how to do that the next tip is a little quirky and funny do not count sheep there's a great study from my colleague Dr Alison Harvey at UC berley and she put this to the test didn't make people fall asleep faster it made them take longer to fall asleep however she did find an alternative if you are not into meditation or podcasts or sleep stories or whatever it is that you you wish for try taking yourself on a mental walk and it has to be a walk that you know very well so let's say that you walk your dog every day and you know there's a couple of walks that you take with your dog do it in hyperd detail So Close Your Eyes you go to the front door you clip in the dog to the leash you walk out you go down the steps out to the driveway then you take a right but you always cross over and you look to the left and the right CU that's the place where traffic always comes you cross over and now you're walking up and there's that strange sort of set of garbage that's been outside of that house for a long time and you don't know why it hasn't been cleared and then you move that type of High Fidelity detail allows you to do what we said earlier which is get your mind off itself and when you do that again typically you fall asleep faster and that's what she found it was a great great study I really enjoyed that I'm curious as to why it works so well and I'm not challenging that it works I I can imagine having just closed my eyes and kind of imagine what that would be like it's very pleasant um there might be here I'm just specul ating something about engaging one's procedural memory because that's procedural memory you're trying to remember how you do something as opposed to declarative memory which is about facts you know I remember this and this is going to happen tomorrow I wonder whether or not there's something about using a procedural memory um as opposed to a declarative memory visualization somebody should do that study they should and I think it's certainly possible that when you're incorporating some aspect you know some aspects of the scene and the information is more sort of veridical and maybe EP sort of episodic declarative memory but when you're taking yourself for a mental walk what is the fundamental premise of that it's a walk it's motion it's procedural memory and so maybe it's something to do about with being more attentive to becoming embodied because when you're out walking and you're moving it is a more embodied experience than just sitting there at your desk which is your mostly your head and very little your body so I think it's an intriguing idea and um I think another tip that I now think of which also comes from the work of Dr Allison Harvey when individuals come up to me um after sort of public events or they see me at the airport they'll say look every night for some strange reason at 2:45 a.m. I wake up and it happens three or four nights a week my first question to them is how do you know it's 2:45 and they say well I look at the clock or I look at my phone best piece of advice next remove all clock faces from the bedroom no matter how bad your sleep is going to be that night knowing what time it is is only going to make matters worse it is not going to make matters any better and that can create an anxiety trigger that you think it's 245 and then you're tossing and turning you look back at the clock and now it's 3:14 a.m. and you think I've got to be awake at 600 I've got that big meeting and now it's 5:2 don't do that to yourself and I even though I don't typically struggle with sleep I have no clock faces in my bedroom the phone that I use to help do the guided meditation is an old phone and it has only Wi-Fi connectivity and nothing else on it and I will only hit play and then I will never turn it around um I will not look at the clock face just doesn't help me another incentive for keeping the phone out of the room um if if one can I I understand there are reasons when um one would want the phone in the room if you know it's potentially signaling an emergency you know well I think I think it's a very important point and we've done some work in this area too what that phone does is create a a low level of anxiety it's what we call anticipatory anxiety one of the mechanisms separate from that well it's related to that if you look at teen phone use one of the reasons that they don't sleep very well at night is that they're constantly checking their phones because of fomo a fear of missing out what has gone on as I've been asleep and it's stunning the data but for most adults the other reason I don't like advocating for phone use when your alarm goes off in the morning what is the first thing that you do as you're in bed you swipe right or you unlock your phone and you instantly start checking social media emails text messages and this tsunami of Stress and Anxiety just floods over you it hits you like this wall of anxiet and I bring this up because it again trains your brain for expectation of that anticipatory anxiety has a consequence on your sleep and everyone knows this let's say that you've booked an early morning flight and you've got to wake up at 5:00 a.m. when normally you wake up at 7 a.m. two things will usually happen first you know that you're just not going to sleep as deeply that night because you're on edge and this is for an interview or it's for critical like this is a non-negotiable trip that has to happen you've got to wake up the second thing is that when you are expecting that that wave of sort of a need to wake up and maybe it's just I'm expecting the phone again you will wake up just a few minutes before your alarm it's stunning how many people will say I had this big flight the next day and you almost know I'm going to wake up 2 minutes before my alarm goes off why because your brain has stayed in this shallow state of anticipatory anxiety and you don't get as much deep sleep and we've now demonstrated that we others when you have that low level anxiety the depth of your deep sleep is not as deep you don't get the good so again not to be trying to dictate what people do just be aware that when you do create that behavior and that regiment it becomes almost like a knee Jack sort of trained habitual response terrific let's talk about some of the advanced tools for Sleep enhancement you know what sorts of methods could one incorporate um you know what are some of the data and um and is there any way that we can sort of lump these into uh sort of a some framework or categories because I know there are a lot of different tools there are and I suppose this would be you know I know our friend pet has spoken about medicine 3.0 I think this would probably be sleep optimization 3.0 what is coming down the pike what is in the research and I think you know could make it to Market or has made it to Market but yet we're still right on the cusp we've seen Wei again in the Royal Wii have been able to augment human sleep in at least four different ways there are methods for electrical brain stimulation there are methods for acoustic stimulation of sleep so electrical stimulation of sleep acoustic stimulation of sleep thermal manipulation of sleep and then finally kinesthetic manipulation of sleep meaning movement based stimulation and I maybe I can just of go into each one of those the electrical stimulation is probably the most well rendered of all of those four in part because we started there and we and here it's not the Royal Wii we have done a lot of work on on this and um I can tell you a little bit about a company emerging from that but when you're trying to manipulate the human brain the principal currency in which the brain communicates is electricity now there are lots of things that help it do that such as chemicals but the principal language and um verbiage of the brain is electricity so if you're going to manipulate the brain why don't you speak in its currency of electricity so we and others have developed a method based on something called direct current brain stimulation and specifically something called transcranial direct current stimulation and I'll unpack that trans meaning movement so if you've heard of Transport it's about moving things from one port to another um transatlantic moving you know across the Atlantic so here the start of it is moving you're moving something from one place to the next trans cranial means through your skull so we're moving something through your skull transcranial direct current is the type of voltage or the type of electrical impulse that we're putting in it could be alternating current or it could be direct current and early methods and those we use have been direct current so transcranial direct current and then stimulation we're trying to stimulate the brain specifically the cortex and the way that we do this is that we apply electrode pads to your head and we insert a small amount of voltage into your brain now it's so small that you typically don't feel it but it has a measurable impact on that electrical brain activity so very early on scientists and we weren't the first to do do this by any means there was a great paper now famous paper in my field by um wonderful scientist yam born in Germany and they took a group of subjects and they applied these electrod pads and specifically to the front of the brain and I'll explain why we target the front of the brain with sleep electrical enhancement or the electrocutica as it were they applied these electr pads to two groups of participants and then they let them go into sleep and as you'll remember we described that in the first 2 or 3 hours of sleep is when you get most of your deep sleep and they were targeting those deep slow brain waves that we spoke about those big slow powerful waves that define deep sleep and what they did in one of those groups the other group was the placebo group they still had the electrodes applied they still went to sleep in the stimulation group they waited until those individuals went into deep sleep and I told you in the first episode that those deep sleep brain waves were going up and down very very slowly maybe just once or twice a second so they started to stimulate the brain inputting the stimulation pulses at a very slow Rhythm trying to match the rhythm of the brain in fact they were less than one Hertz less than one cycle per second in terms of a pulse it's almost as though we're trying to act like a a choir to a flagging lead vocalist and as these brain waves are going up and down you're trying to sing in time with those deep sleep brain waves and in doing so you're trying to boost and amplify the size of those deep sleep brain waves now to begin with they just waited until they went into deep sleep and they started to stimulate at that frequency and I'll come back to why that's important in a second but sure enough what they demonstrated they were able to boost the electrical quality of that deep sleep by about 60% and they were also able to almost double the amount of memory benefit that sleep provided wow which is very impressive that is impressive now I should note that there was more recently a replication attempt of that paper and they did very good job they really did it to the letter and they weren't able to replicate the effects as powerfully however subsequent Studies have now taken a more nuanced approach and it's the one that we've taken too and it's called closed loop stimulation Clos Loop here simply means that I'm not going to just wait until you go into deep sleep and then just take a chance and start stimulating your brain not knowing of the synchrony of my pulses into your brain relative to the brain waves that you're experiencing closed loop does do that so what I'm doing is I'm measuring the electrical brain waves that occurring and because they're nice and slow they're very predictable and I can program my algorithm and my brain stimulation machine to say I'm going to wait and wait and as soon as you are on this peak of your slow wave it turns out to be the negative trough but I'll forgo that we then try to strike at that point of midnight when you're going through the biggest sort of powerful sort of dip in the the brain wave and we're trying to sort of enhance it and same with the peak so this is where we take a we get a stimulus from the brain your electrical brain activity and then we create a timed response so it's a stimulus response it's a call and response Loop and by way of doing that it's a much smarter specific method than a more generalized I'm just going to stimulate and hope I catch those waves at the Peaks the reason is important because different people have different speeds of their slow brain waves they're all slow but your speed of brain wave may be a little bit different to mine and if I'm off with my stimulation by let's say just half a second or a quarter of a second time and time again I may be leaving some benefit on the table but closed loop stimulation creates this personalized electrical prescription of stimulation and when you do that you get very reliable benefits you can boost those deep slope brain waves you get the memory benefits but also what we found is you not only boost those deep sleep brain waves you boost another electrical signature that I spoke about in the first episode called sleep spindles and it seems to be the combination of those two things by way of electrical stimulation that provides the benefits now I should know I haven't mentioned this before you can buy these devices on the internet DIY style do not do that if you go on to the internet too you can also find some horror stories people have misappropriated the voltage they've got skin burs they've lost their eyesight for several weeks do not do this at home I promise you use you know wait until these products come out and that's one of the reasons why we've scaled it into a company and we're we're trying to do this we've got a long way to go yet huge number of trials that we have to do before you know I feel ready to to Really lay it on the on the table and say you should absolutely buy this it's it's well worth it but we're getting very very close I would say great what about thermal manipulations temperature I mean there's such a tight relationship between temperature and sleep and and wakefulness for that matter uh what sort of Technologies tools protocols exist to uh that use thermal manipulation as a way to augment sleep I love this topic because there are high-fi low-fi and noi technologies that you can use the story of sleep and temperature as you mentioned before and reiterated in terms of the three-part stanza that tur set that I would describe is again you need to warm up to cool down to fall asleep you need to stay cool to stay asleep you need to to warm up to wake up what that refers to technically in sleep science are what we call the thermal trigger zones so warming up to cool down to fall asleep is what we call the Sleep onset thermal trigger Zone cooling down or staying cool to stay asleep is about the deep sleep trigger Zone and then warming up to wake up is the activating alertness trigger Zone studies if you looked at them to begin with before they manipulated that found something fascinating if I take you Andrew huberman and I bring you into my lab and I remove your phone all your laptop and you say goodbye to your friends and family and you I bring you into the center and there are no cues as to what time of day no windows no nothing and I'm just going to say look I'll keep asking you but at the moment that you feel most sleepy just let me know it turns out that before that we' done the um delightful um intervention of inserting a rectal probe into you because that's the best way that we can measure your core body temperature so we're measuring your core body temperature and sure enough despite you knowing nothing about what time it is the moment that you will tell me I am ready to go to bed and I am sleepy is the moment when you are on the greatest decelerating trajectory of your core body temperature it is high highly predictive of how sleepy you will feel the way that your body does this is by pushing blood out to the surface regions of your skin notably your hands and your feet because these are these highly vascular regions and you had a great podcast from one of my heroes and good friend Craig hel who's done some amazing work on this at Stanford so naturally as we lie down blood races to our hands and our feet and also our head and we start to release that heat trapped in the core of our body and by releasing that heat at the surface our core body temperature drops hence the outer surfaces of you hands feet and face have to warm up for your core to cool down for you to fall asleep and in fact there was a great nature paper some years ago they just measured the temperature of someone's feet and they looked at how quickly they fell asleep and when they fell asleep sure enough the warmer your feet the faster you fell asleep why because the Warmness reflects the blood dilation and the pumping out of the blood to the periphery and then they did it in rats where they started to warm the pores of the rats and the Rats fell asleep more quickly and I love this notion of again I we don't do an but kind of love the notion of wrapping a beautiful little rat up in Cotton wall and I'm I'm warming its feet with this pad and it's just Bliss out out and then poof he's gone his after she I respect their privacy um so that was the early evidence that then led to a series of manipulation studies the most notable is brilliant it comes from a colleague uh in the Netherlands usan summeran and his group they created essentially what was a a wet think about a wet suit but that wet suit is covered with all of these thin tubes almost like veins that go all over the suit to all territories of your body and then what they would be able to do is peruse water warm water or hot water exquisitly to different parts of the brain or the body cool amazing yeah no pun intended thank so what they did was then they started to manipulate these peripheral regions sort of and sure enough when they did this they were able to have indiv uals fall asleep 25% faster and these were healthy individuals who are normally sleeping within a very natural quick period of time but they were able to Lop off 25% of that time simply by warming these certain parts of the brain to lift the blood away from the core of the body and by doing that they accelerated the temperature core deceleration and therefore increased or accelerated the the speed with which sleep arrived to those individuals sleep appeared with much greater alacrity than it would have done otherwise even though it was quick anyway so then not being satisfied with that they moved on to the deep sleep trigger Zone and this isn't you need to stay cool to stay asleep and here now they started to just continue to cool the core the central aspects of the body what they were able to do is increased the amount of deep sleep by somewhere between 25 to look at some of the data almost 40 minutes they were able to boost the amount of deep sleep with the thermal manipulation and when they were measuring the electrical brain waves and they decompose those brain waves even the power and the electrical quality of those slow waves was increased very impressive too next not being satisfied with that they turned to older adults for the reasons that we've just described what they found was that in those older adults when they were not manipulated with this thermal temperature in the second half of the night there was a 50% probability that they were going to be awake for some part of the second half of the night when they did the thermal manipulation they dropped that number down to 5% so they reduced a 50% probability of waking up down to 5% in older adults and again they improved the quality of their deep sleep Think About by by the way why that was so effective for older adults I guarantee you you've probably seen you've been in a warm climate or you've been down on the beach you know here sort of um in Los Angeles and people are out in shorts and t-shirts or crop tops then occasionally there will be someone and I love seeing these sites where you know a child is sort of Wheeling along their elderly parents it's a beautiful sort of scene of caring but the older adult they're not dressed in the same way that every one else is dressed on the beach they are wrapped up some of them have a Woolen hat on why older adults cannot Thermo regulate anywhere near as well as young adults is that right and it's the reason that older adults will always be saying I'm I'm just so cold and my hands and my feet especially are always cold now that's a problem for sleep because if you cannot Vaso dilate at the level of your hands and your feet you can't get the blood out from the core you can't drop your core body temperature as much and we started to understand from those types of data that part of the Aging sleep related problem equation is not just that the brain deteriorates in sleep related regions which we've been doing most of our work on it's also part of a body equation and a thermo regulatory equation there was also a great study unrelated from Australia they looked at insomnia patients and they put their hands or their feet in warm water and by doing that it's a manipulation you can see how quickly their hands and their feet what we call Vaso dilate filled with blood healthy people Faso dieted very quickly in response to that warm water meaning that their hands and their feet sort of you know had this red or at least for my feet they would be this red tone to them however in the insomnia patients they did not Vaso dilate anywhere near as well so once again it suggests that when you have problems with Sleep part of the equation may be that you have imper Thermo regulatory ability and we do see this in insomnia patients so that's that was I think a brilliant causal manipulation the problem is that most of us don't have access to a sort of come to bed eyes thermal suit so what can we do as a con please don't cut that I get myself into terrible trouble rightly so I should be I should be punished you'll be right what they did then was to say well okay let's look at this is there something that we could do that's cheaper and more accessible to the general public and if you look there's a literature that preceded that manipulation and it's so reliable that we now have a term for it in sleep science it's called the warm bath effect and many people will say look I love to have a a warm bath or a hot shower before bed and I think when I get out I'm nice and toasty and it's because I'm nice and warm that I fall asleep and I stay asleep it's the exact opposite when you get out of the warm bath or the shower you have once again vasod dilated at the surface of your skin you get out of the bath you get this huge thermal dump of heat away from the core what happens you fall asleep and you stay asleep more soundly now there are other reasons that that has a benefit it's relaxing you decompress you're staying away from technology Etc but that is one of the the thermal benefits and in fact there were Studies by a legend in my field who passed away just a few years ago um Jim horn at lury University in the UK and they did some of these pioneering studies they were able to improve the amount of deep sleep by almost 40 minutes in some individuals what was the protocol there as I recall I think they were in the bath for somewhere around or the bath duration time was somewhere around 30 minutes but they were doing sort of segments where it was maybe it was 40 minutes 10 minutes in and then you could sort of get out I think the temperature because it was UK was around about 40° celsus somewhere in that region I may be getting those numbers wrong because I know we like to protocolized some of this but they were able to show some really Pleasant benefits to to Deep Sleep it also helped people fall asleep helped them fall asleep by about 25 minutes faster in those people who are really having a hard time with sleep I'm going to take a hot bath tonight I sometimes do the sauna in the evening before sleep I'm a big fan of cold in the morning cold shower cold Plunge in the morning reverse engineering the the equation you're trapping the heat into the core of your body you're waking yourself up right and then the and in the evening I've used sauna the one issue with sauna is I really crank the heat of the sauna and then sometimes if you do that right before bed you take a you know warmish shower right afterwards you get into bed oftentimes I'll wake up thirsty and then um because it dehydrates you and then if I drink a lot of water to hydrate after in the sauna then I'm waking up too much in the middle of the night so I think sauna is great but um right before bed I try I would love to I don't have a a sauna at home or nor an access to I mean there are saunas in and around where I live but what I want to do is have it proximal to my bedtime and my bedtime because I'm a neutral type you know sort of around 11-ish nowhere is open and willing to allow me to sit in the S how long do you you sit in there usually I I'm a little Bonker about this I well if it's in the evening and I just want to relax I would say maybe 20 30 minutes and I I tend to go really warm warmer than I want to stay here P to do pet our friend I've done Sonic cold plunge with pet he usually does it in the evening goes Sonic cold Sonic cold Sonic cold okay uh warm shower um and I don't know how many nights a week he's doing that but terms of the temperature of the sauna you know generally somewhere between 175 and 210° depending on how heat adapted you are but I think a hot bath is great or a nice hot shower yeah I've certainly done that and when I'm traveling with jet lag I will absolutely that's part of my sort of jet lag protocol I'll make sure I do I'll because I don't really struggle too much with sleep at least at present but when I go through jet lag and I go back home to to London of course it's tough the worst The Living Daylights out of that and do as much as I can so I think that's probably the end of the the thermal story although we are now trying to see if we can take lowf fire approaches where we're going to do some footw we're trying to develop some footw technology that can be built into um maybe a mattress and some mattress companies uh there are some great ones uh I know obviously Mato at 8 sleep and they are they are doing amazing things I think his company again I have no affiliation but I we connect very well and he's brilliant so they're doing something like that I do uh use and love my eight sleep here's what I'd love somebody to engineer and we got a lot of people who listen to the podcast you think about product development it would be wonderful to have a portable pair of socks so that you can use them when you travel or when you go you know sleep anywhere at home or elsewhere that would warm your feet up at the beginning of the night so this is a place for us to recap warm up to cool down to fall asleep right stay cool stay cool to stay asleep and then warm up in the morning to wake up and so that is pretty straightforward to build into a pair of socks somebody can do this somebody do this okay uh so that's so we've done electrical we've done thermal what about auditory auditory so acoustic stimulation in a very similar way to electrical stimulation where you're trying to Target that deep sleep and see if you a better analogy is probably a metronome and you're trying to see if you can kind of force the metronome further over back and forth with these types of Technologies so auditory stimulation came on the map again I think probably yam born's group in Germany was some of the first to do this they initially started with this same generalized approach where they would take acoustic tones and they would first assess what is your level of awake weening threshold so you would be asleep and they would just have these tones very light tones like a sort of ping ping and they would gradually increase the volume up and they would look to see what is the point where that volume of the tone wakes you up and then they understood your specific threshold what's called an Awakening threshold and they would set the volume to a sub Awakening threshold great so you've got that locked in place and now you start and they did this within the first 990 minutes of people falling asleep they started to play these sub Awakening level volume levels of tones but they were playing them at this very slow frequency as if again they're trying to syn and match the slow dancing Rhythm of the slow brain waves and sure enough in that first study and it was indiscriminate meaning they just set the tones PL like a metronome set the tone set the and sorry set the volume and then set the Cadence of the volume the speed the frequency of those tones to just a little bit less than one Hertz a little bit less than one cycle per second and then off you drifted to sleep and they played it for the first 90 minutes CU that's the rich phase of deep sleep and they were able to increase the amount of Deep Sleep significantly the problem in that first study was that they also did a memory test because in all of these studies including my own even if I boost your sleep tonight Andrew hubman my next if that's the result that you show me I have four words for you as a scientist yes and so what is it functional because if I boost your sleep but it doesn't change anything to you the organism the next day I'm going to suggest that that enhancement is Epi phenomenal not functional so it has to improve some um some reasonable metric in wakefulness that like improves improved memory um improved uh task switching ability so it's outcome measures strength correct something yeah so even if I for example you know lower your blood pressure with a new drug if I'm not changing your cardiovascular disease risk then the question is why am I just continuing on with the drug if it's not really changing much same thing here and what they found was that when they did the memory test the next morning by enhancing that deep sleep there actually wasn't a memory benefit so perhaps what was happening is that this was just non-specific so again they then returned and now others have returned to the closed loop mechanism where now I've got electrodes on your head and I'm measuring your slow wave brain waves and literally I am next door in the room and I'm watching those slow brainwaves go up and down and then I've got a computer algorithm that is watching those watching in quotes watching that too and it's predicting when the next wave is going to come and when it does auditory tone clicks Awakening you don't wake up and sure enough when you sort of tone into the brain at that time you boost the the size of that brain wave and once again they boosted the size of those deep sleep brain waves they also improve those more quick burst of activity the sleep spindles and now sure enough they were able to improve memory however if you look at that paper and here's why I think the first method may not have worked very well and why I don't suggest people start trying to set this up themselves when they kept stimulating the brain slow wave after slow wave after about three or four strikes of the metronome to boost those slow waves the benefits stopped and if they kept going you started to inhibit the amount of naturally occurring deep sleep brain waves why would it do this deep sleep brain waves I told you in the first episode are a Act of incredible neural coordination it's Mass coordination now one of the extreme versions of mass coordinated propagated activity that is maladaptive that is pathological is called an epileptic seizure and your brain has in place for the most part stop gaps to prevent that type of spread of vast amounts of coordinated spontaneous electrical oscillations because the brain is such a conductive device that once you get it going you've got to be careful because it may start to conduct out of control so we think that these checks and balances that were in place even though you can artificially stimulate it for a while after a while the brain says you've got to back off for a while because this is getting a little bit out of control you do a breath pause and then you restart again and you get the benefit and then you breath pause so You' got to do it a little bit intimately now you've got to read the what we call the supplemental materials of that paper you've got to go it's like the fine print on a legal document if you dig into it you can see that that was the case but um it it wasn't necessarily evident so those were really the data on acoustic stimulation and now with this closed loop acoustic stimulation that we've got going on it seems to provide these nice benefits some people then will probably be asking what about these noise machines what about white noise Etc I've taken a look at this and so far I think for White Noise machines the data is equivocal there was a recent study review article I think it looked at about 37 different studies I could have this wrong and what they found was that there was no reliable robust directional effect of white noise machines on sleep some studies demonstrated that it helped sleep some studies didn't change sleep some studies suggested it may make sleep a little bit worse just nothing reliable but maybe it's masking external sound correct so I think if and the one of the positive studies in that scenario was a study that was done in New York City and it was in a region where there was a lot of um external sound pollution and noise as you could well imagine it's New York City and sure enough that's where they got some really nice benefits of the white noise machine so I think it is you're right context dependent there was a an interesting recent study that came out from uh eaman Learners group at uh the University of Texas San Antonio and they didn't use White Noise they used pink noise now what's the difference pink noise has a little less what we call power or intensity in the higher frequency ranges of the sound spectrum and it's more enriched in the slower domain of that power Spectrum which you could argue is a bit more fitting with sleep and I think this study may have been a nap study or I may be wrong but anyway what they found was that they increased Total Sleep Time by I think it was close to 30 minutes with the pink noise they did not change the amount of deep sleep but they did inhance the amount of stage two non-rm sleep which we have spoken about before and we will in subsequent episod episodes that is beneficial for things like learning in memory including motor skills and they increased the amount of REM sleep to a much more modest degree but those changes were significant so I'm not trying to rule out noise machines right now and I have no affiliation with any company or anything in that space um I don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water I just simply think that right now we don't have enough evidence but as you and I know as scientists absence of evidence is not evidence of absence just because it doesn't exist doesn't mean that I don't think that it's still a potential root these types of machines what about kinesthetic stipular uh tools protocols um you know body position is something that has an interesting relationship to propensity to fall asleep based on brain cooling that we talked about in another episode but what about manipulation of the body's mov movement um uh yeah what is there anything in that domain it sounds wacky at first yeah it does but but I said it so you I still want to know come on social media just be be nice be friendly um I would say that if you look back in again the annals of human history from the very early Inception you will see mentions of a child being rocked in a Manger or rocked in a crib often parents will have will take their young infant and you will quote unquote Rock them to sleep and we as adults will sometimes get in a hammock and if you're rocked what happens you will fall as it's that prototypical image of someone with their hat over their face and in a hammock and they've sort of fallen asleep so it was very clear that something was going on in this space and then a group from the University of Geneva um led by another fantastic sleep scientist Sophie Schwarz did an epic study that again it's one of those studies that I probably once more wished I'd done here's what they did they took a bed frame and then they suspended it on chains from the ceiling now stick with me I'm not going in that you know there's no hot candle wax being applied here don't worry I'll I'll keep it PG again and then the next thing that they did was connect a rotating arm to that bed at the side of the bed and that arm would start to simply just push the bed laterally from left to right left to right and they started just swinging the bed in a very controlled manner but here and I should ask Sophie exactly why they made this choice they were rotating the bed not at this sort of around one Hertz which is what we've done with electrical stimulation or acoustic stimulation they were doing it at25 Herz which is much slower still almost imper is rocking you know once every four seconds it's a very slow lull and sure enough what they found in the first series of studies they did a nap study a 90-minute nap study when you did this rocking Motion versus when the bed was still they increased the speed with which people fell asleep they boosted the amount of deep sleep and they boosted the amount of those sleep spindle oscillations that we described not satisfied they then said well what happens across a night of sleep they did it then across a night of sleep they replicated the same findings and now they got a memory benefit now the memory benefit you could argue is modest it was 10% of a memory improvement benefit when you woke up from sleep relative to the already able benefit that sleep naturally gives when you're not rocking the bed but you think well 10% if I were let's say a student and I got you know a b and someone the professor said Look by the way there is something that you can do and we can increase your grade by 10% and you can get to an A or an A plus depending on the grading system would you take it would you take 10% benefit absolutely you would s grade point average in increase so it's it it isn't trivial necessarily well I also I'm I'm positively surprised how important this um but so what uh condition is for you sleep researchers you know that that an enhancement in say deep sleep or rapid eye Moon movement sleep needs to translate to some Daytime benefit um in order to really get you guys excited but but here's why I I think that's great it's always great to have a high threshold for excitement um but one of the things that that one could argue is that you know there are only so many tests that you can have in a Laboratory um of daytime functioning I think I am on board the the fact that sleep is the Bedrock of mental health physical health and performance so an improvement in in you know sign a statistically significant Improvement in deep sleep or REM sleep to me just seems like that's got to be good for something we might not know what that something is to test in the laborat but it could be that the threshold for improvement of say gut microbiome production of neurotransmitters is you know .1% Improvement in deep so we don't know I made that up so don't quote that statistic anyone but I so admire the the the um kind of extreme thresholds of what you what gets you guys excited well no your point is a very good one because you could argue based on what I just went back and said regarding the exercise study with Ronda Patrick I've just reversed my own threshold logic I said to you well okay exercise was able to overcome some of the deficits that occur by way of sleep deprivation for your blood sugar but don't assume that that necessarily means it overcomes the detriments the other detriments that you'll have for your hormonal Health your you know Thermo regulatory capacity your cardiovascular disease your brain function so I've just said look simply you know one thing doesn't mean that you've assessed all things and now now I'm saying okay if you don't show that it improved that one thing then it's not functional but Matt by your own logic you've said that but you didn't assess many of the other things so even if it didn't improve memory as you said it's the Bedrock of all things Health you need to assess all of them before you make your conclusion of the yes and so what failed test so you're absolutely right to point that out um so what was interesting after that data came out in humans which is usually the opposite way around they started to look in in animal models and you mentioned the vestibular system this ability for us to understand motion and movement and there's lots of mechanisms for that they looked at mice and they started doing this rocking again and sure enough the mice fell asleep faster but then they found a strain of mice that did not have the lateral vestibular sensation mechanism and they rocked them just the same way zero change in their sleep because you could imagine well it's important to understand the mechanism here is it that when you're rocking there is it's not just about vestibular stimulation maybe that rocking sort of modestly changes friction which changes temperature you could come up with all sorts of wacky reasons this was a very clear C caal manipulation of the lateral vestibular system and if that is not in place you fail to get the benefit so it clearly has something to do with the vestibular system can I Venture a guess as to why that is yeah I interrupted but in case that happen to be right by some chance I previously talked about the um the need to lose uh a sense of one's posture in relationship to gravity in order to fall asleep right you have to go into this uh lack of proceptive awareness in order to fall asleep propri reception being the knowledge of where one's limbs are relative to the body and body relative to other surfaces and gravity yeah and um this is something that can be accomplished in these uh you know flotation tanks and things like that um and other ways go to outer space but um the cheaper version the cheaper version um so could it be that the rocking at that very slow frequency um is tapping into the vestibular system in a way that that propri receptive feedback about body position is somehow um uh starts to vanish and because I'm intrigued by this idea that you have to lose perception of your body's positioning and and propr receptive awareness in order to fall asleep uh and maybe your a description earlier of a protocol of going on a mental walk um in order to fall asleep I I just feel like these things are starting to converge on on on some themes here central Comm pathway that could be the absence of I think it's entirely possible in some ways right now we think that these two things are associated that as you're falling asleep gradually you will lose propri receptive sensation okay but simply the fact that two things are associated doesn't necessarily mean they're causal but your suggestion here is a very elegant way of testing that hypothesis which is that perhaps if you could show that the symmetric of proprioception becomes compromised when you start doing lateral sort of kinesthetic or movement stimulation that's a very powerful demonstration that it's not just so here with the study in the mice they lacked the lateral vestibular sensation and you lost the Sleep benefit but maybe there's one step down which is that when you lose that vestibular stimulation you lose the benefit on the thing that really is augment ing the Sleep which is the change in Pro reception so this is the first step in a chain of command and you've missed the final common transactor of that ingredient called better sleep and those I would say are probably the the four current bastions of sleep augmentation hopefully that describes to listeners the range of where sort of sleep 3.0 sleep enhancement 3.0 is going and also describes the way in which which we can come down the strata from high friction low friction to no friction um and also in terms of cost where you can have high cost minimal cost low cost I mean hot bath or shower is Pennies on the dollars so especially if you take a cold shower in the morning and save on your heating bill so you can take a little bit longer hot shower in the evening and then you net to zero difference um it's just my way of saying take a cold shower in the morning feels great when you get out what about some ways to enh rapid eye movement sleep beyond what you've covered up until now so I think there are probably two emerging data sets that I've been intrigued by one of which we've been doing some work on and it comes back to Thermal what I fail to mention is not just that you need to warm up to wake up which you do but you also need to warm up to REM sleep but not too much if you take an organism or a human being and you strip them of bed sheets and strip them of clothes so they're basically almost on natural if you warm the body up to what we call the Thermon neutral point so it tends to be and this sounds extreme and it you don't have to do this because you're under sheets and that makes a world of difference but if you warm the room to about 30° C which gets close to at the surface ambient level for your skin something that can bring your core body temperature up back up to operating because I told you when you go when you're in that deep sleep trigger Zone the middle Zone your core body temperature drops and it drops significantly and to wake up you have to warm up but on the journey to warming up you also have to get to Thermon neutrality for you to have REM sleep if I keep you too cold I can reduce the amount of REM sleep if I get you too hot but I can imper the amount of REM sleep so it's a Goldilocks phenomenon not too little not too much just the right amount if I keep you there in terms of your thermal um net neutrality I can boost your RAM sleep now that's fishlyn they run at different hot temperatures they've got different partner situations so you need a Clos loop system again but it's something that very interested in because almost all of the methods that I've described and you are smart to pick this up all target deep non-rm sleep but we spoke about in the first episode every stage of sleep is important and in subsequent episodes I'll tell you exactly why REM sleep is so critical so how can we boost that that's one way that we're starting to explore it but nothing I think solid yet the other is some of the drugs the newer sleep medications that have come onto the market and um again I think I mentioned I I did take the task and I feel perhaps rightfully so about the classic sleep medications that if you look at the scientific data if you can avoid them it's probably best to do so things like ambient Etc we call them the Z drugs because they all start their sort of generic names are sort of start with a zed you know um ambian for example um has uh has a zed at the start of it for its generic name but but I don't want to get into naming any necessarily yeah but um for ambient what's interesting about those medications again they're in a class of drugs that we call the sedative hypnotics so again sedation not sleep and also there's been some great work again by der and dyin colleagues if I were to show you the that that electrical signature of your deep sleep it does look as though those drugs kind of increased the amount of electrical activity in that slower deep sleep range except once you go all the way to the far left to the slowest of those slow brain movies which turns out to be the the types of waves that are most beneficial for most health related brain and body functions you get this huge dent in your electrical brain wave activity it's almost as though those drugs take a bite out of that realm of of electrical activity and of course there are issues with daytime sleepiness and some safety related issues that has been Health associations not necessarily causal and so I was you know I I offered one scientific Viewpoint of those medications in the book and um and so be it it's not as though i' I'm anti-m medication as I said and some of the new medications are very interesting brings me back to REM sleep there's a new class of sleep medications called the Doras and it stands for it's d o r a small s and it stands for Jew orexin receptor antagonists oh my goodness mouthful that just sounds like word salad to anyone who's not a neuroscientist orexin which is part of that um set of words is a chemical in the brain and ereen became prominent with the study of noopsy and what we we as the Royal Wii people like Emanuel Mano and others um at Stanford what they discovered was that noptic patients have a found deficit in this this chemical orexin and receptors also called hypocretin and it has a function both it turns out for wakefulness and a function for feeding and eating related behaviors hypocretin was probably more related to it when it was because it was discovered right around the same time um two different groups yes exactly beautiful two different groups named it differently but noopsy as some people may know is it's a condition to sleep disorder and one of the symptoms is called excessive daytime sleepiness where you have inappropriate invasions of sleep during the day when you want to be awake why well it turns out that this chemical ereen acts like a finger on the light switch of all of the apparatus in your brain that switches on to force you awake it reaches down into the it's released from a central part of your brain called the hypothalamus and it releases down into the brain stem to activate what we call the ascending arousal system or the reticular ascending arousal system of the brain and when that lights up it's like the light switch which says on for waking brain activity and so what was happening was that this ereen up higher up was not forcing the finger of wakefulness on during the day so almost instead of a switch which is what you want it was more like a dimmer switch and you know when you get to that dimmer switch point right in the middle where it's flickering it's on it's off it's on it's off that's almost the state in which the narcoleptic brain was because they had a deficiency of orexin so that was the ereen story in nopy so why is it relevant for insomnia well people realized the problem with Epsy is that they're asleep during the day when they want to be awake but the opposite problem is true of insomnia patients they want to be asleep at night but they're awake so why don't we selectively de develop a drug that goes after this finger that flips the light switch on for wakefulness but now let's block it at night so we flick the switch back in the off position we turn out the lights of the brain and we remove the problem of insomnia which is excessive wakefulness at night which is one of its problems but and therefore when you remove that indirectly what comes in its place is this thing called more naturalist sleep and that's why it's being more favored now as the principal drug um it's still not necessarily well known by physicians or it's not very well prescribed it's not very well covered here in the United States unfortunately with insurance so it's a very expensive option right now Health Providers will choose not to do that unfortunately so what's interesting about that drug though is that it's mixed in terms of the studies but quite reliably it does seem to improve sleep very much so but it seems to unlike those classic sleeping pills which artificially look like they're increasing deep sleep even though they're they're not doing sedation these drugs can improve most all aspects of sleep but including REM sleep which those classic sleeping pills did not why is it doing that we still don't know but one of the things that the these Dora drugs do that block the erex in that take off the the the on position of the light switch and flip them off when you switch it off it can actually then then allow the activation or the stimulation of something called melanin concentrated hor hormone or MCH in the brain and that when it is um triggered on can stimulate another chemical called acety choline in the brain which is a neurotransmitter if there is one neurotransmitter in the brain that seems to be responsible almost exclusively for this thing called REM sleep or dominantly I should say for REM sleep it is atile Coline this was discovered way back in the 1970s by my former um uh one of my former mentors Alan Hobson at Harvard and what this drug may be doing is indirectly boosting the amounts of acetal choline in the brain particularly in a region of the brain called the basil forbrain which is a REM sleep regulating region and that's the reason that you get boosts in REM sleep and people also report dreaming a little bit more too on those medications so thermal manipulation getting you to net neutral thermal zones helps increase REM sleep but also there are some medications that were not necessarily designed for REM sleep enhancements selectively but there is evidence that they do that so if you ask me where are we at with REM it's it's certainly more bereft of methods than deep non-rem sleep but we are starting to find some now given what you just told us about the role of ACL choline in Rapid eyee movement sleep what about taking um precur cursors to acetylcholine I mean certainly a good number of them exist yeah um you know even like over-the-counter supplements like Alpha GPC um and then of course there are uh choline donors and things like that that can increase uh col energic transmission um is that get into issues of um you know if one does that globally is it possible that you increase arousal and have trouble falling asleep because some of those coleric agents be activating so one of the problems the second is you may stop because you're going to have to take them before bed you may Brute Force REM sleep to arrive earlier and you may therefore come at the cost of of deep non-rem sleep and so you'd have to get uh some kind of timed release capsule which you can do you can coat these capsule you can get a timed release and you would want to take it before bed and then maybe after about four or five hours you would want to kick it into gear because now you're in so it's a littleit gets bit tricky yeah this is one of the reasons why I personally this is just my experience I'm not a fan of of supplements that tap into the serotonergic system for sake of sleep because um certainly serotonin plays an important role in sleep but anytime I've taken something you know 5htp or something like that to try and improve sleep I find that um I fall asleep and then I wake up very deep deep sleep and then I wake up um very alert and I have trouble with the later phases of sleep and I think that is because yes serotonin is involved in sleep but it's involved in sleep at a very specific point in this as you refer to it this like Symphony or ballet of different sleep stages and how they evolve and um interdigitate with one another across the night so um while I do think there are things that one can use pharmacologically or supplement based to improve sleep generally I I like to think of those as the kind of thing that kind of pushes a away front of the whole sleep process yeah as opposed to trying to tap into one specific neurotransmitter within the sleep ballet exactly yeah I I like that way of thinking and you you do have to be careful because in biology it's often rare that there are any free lunches in truth you know Nature has optimized our system so exquisitly that when you start to try and gain the system for one thing be very mindful that it may come at the cost of something else and that's why whenever we're doing these types of sort of developments of Technologies for sleep we are very cautious not just to say did we improve the thing that we're targeting but first call of business in medicine is not will this drug help you but firstly is there any downside in terms of will this drug hurt you and then you have to understand the cost ratio benefit between those two things yeah just one more anecdote uh that is in agreement with what you said nowadays there's an increased excitement around peptides the use of peptides there is um and I I currently don't use any but I did a short run with you know occasional use of cellin which is a secretagogue which is a growth hormone right SEC it promotes the secretion of growth hormone not growth hormone itself I took it not many times and I was tracking my sleep and what I noticed is it um put me into a little bit of a hypnotic State dreams were very intense but um deep deep sleep but according to my sleep tracker I only ran this for maybe three nights um according to my sleep tracker it completely eliminate all my rapid eye movement sleep at least as measured by the sleep tracker but the amount of of Deep Sleep of slow wave sleep just like massively expanded so that that can't be good that that can't be good I mean know you don't want to mess with that cocktail ratio that we described in the first episode presume that it's it's emerged as the correct you know Da Vinci Code of sleep stage recipes and there may be a time and a place where you want to over index on one of those things for whatever reason but to do it consistently and permanently I would again say if if you think within the space of a lifetime that you know something that you know 2.6 million years of evolution has not understood chances are you're probably wrong I agree um um and certainly later in this series we will touch into some of the over-the-counter supplements and other things that one can do in order to augment sleep that do seem to have some benefit because there are uh such things um but in the meantime thank you for providing this incredible Arc of description of basic sleep hygiene and regularity light dark temperature getting out of bed when you can't sleep alcohol food caffeine cannabis unconventional protocols and let's call them Advanced protocols electrical protocol brain stimulation in other words um thermal manipulation auditory stimulation kinesthetic and then these rapid eye movement enhancing um drugs and on and on um Matt uh I can't thank you enough this has been a just uh replete with actionable tools and considerations and I love that you took us to the the The Cutting Edge of of what's Happening Now I think uh it's wonderful to talk about the history of a field and what was discovered it's wonderful to talk about the present but it's wonderful that you've um put our eyes uh a bit into the future of what the technology for Sleep uh enhancement and monitoring holds so once again thank you um you're so welcome if folks haven't already seen um or listen to episode one highly recommend they do and of course we will be back soon with episode three which is going to get into all the science and acual protocols related to napping and caffeine and some other exciting things that I know impact people's daily lives and that they can get moving on should they choose right away and by moving on I mean to sleep thank you again Delight cannot wait for the next recording thank you for joining me for today's episode with Dr Matthew

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Coleman Ru Coleman Ruiz is a former tier one Navy SEAL special operator I think it's fair to assume that most of you have never heard of Coleman ruy before and in fact it was part of his former life job description to be largely covert such that only his family and friends really knew what he did for a living he is however now living as a civilian and the reason I invited Coleman on this podcast was essentially to tell us his life story which of course includes his time in the SEAL Teams but includes so much more that I'm certain is of value to everyone today Coleman shares with you his remarkable Journey from childhood through his teenage years into the military and some of the things that happened during his time in the military which then informed his postmilitary civilian life and what it is to be a father a husband and somebody who has experienced tremendous loss at various stages of his life as well as tremendous Triumph indeed if ever there was a life that could be framed within the context of the so-called Heroes Journey it is the life of Coleman Ruiz Coleman ruiz's life is one that embodies focus and pursuit family and friends and love all the things that we think of in terms of having a rich life but also one that includes many unforeseen tragedies many unforeseen challenges both internal and external Coleman also shares with a rare an extraordinary degree of vulnerability the extent to which challenges in life both external and internal have helped shape him as a human being what follows is a discussion that everyone male female young or old and regardless of position in life is sure to derive tremendous benefit from before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is betterhelp betterhelp offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online I've been doing therapy for over 30 years initially I started therapy because well I was required to in order to stay in school but eventually I just decided to keep doing it because I found it to be very beneficial there are essentially three things that great therapy provides first of all it provides a rapport with somebody that you can trust and talk about all issues with second of all they can provide support in the form of emotional support or directed guidance and third expert therapy can provide useful insights that you wouldn't have otherwise had access to in fact I consider doing regular therapy as important as working out one's body in the gym or through cardiovascular exercise and with better help scheduling and doing therapy becomes extremely convenient they can match you to a therapist that can provide those three things excellent Rapport support and insight and they can do so on a schedule that matches yours if you'd like to try betterhelp go to betterhelp.com huberman to get 10% off your first month again that's betterhelp.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by Maui Nei venison Maui Nei venison is the most nutrient-dense and delicious red meat available I've spoken before on this podcast and with several expert guests on this podcast about the fact that most of us should be seeking to get about one gram of quality protein per pound of body weight every day not only does that protein provide critical building blocks for things like muscle repair and synthesis but also for overall metabolism and health eating enough quality protein each day is also a terrific way to saave off hunger one of the key things however is to make sure that you're getting enough quality protein without ingesting excess calories mauii venison has an extremely high quality protein per calorie rate ratio such that getting 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight is both easy and doesn't cause you to ingest an excess of calories also Maui Ney venison is absolutely delicious they have venison steaks they have ground venison and they have venison bone broth I personally like all of those in fact I probably eat a Maui Nei venison Burger pretty much every day and occasionally I'll swap that for a Maui Nei steak and if you're really on the go they have Maui Nei venison jerky which has 10 g of protein per stick at just 55 calories if you'd like to try try Maui Nei venison you can go to mauii venison docomo to get 20% off your first order again that's Mau NE venison tocom today's episode is also brought To Us by eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity now I've spoken many times before in this podcast about the critical need to get sleep both enough sleep and enough quality sleep when we do that everything our mental health our physical health performance in any sports or School Etc all get better and when we're not sleeping well or enough all those things suffer one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is that your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees in order to fall and stay deeply asleep and in order to wake up feeling refreshed your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3 degrees one of the best ways to ensure that happens is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and with Aid sleep it makes it very easy to do that you program in the temperature that you want at the beginning middle and end of the night you can even divide temperature for two different people if you have two different people sleeping in the bed and it tracks your sleep it tells you how much slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep you're getting it really helps you dial in the correct parameters to get the best possible night sleep for you I've been sleeping on an eight Sleep mattress cover for well over 3 years now and it has completely transform my sleep for the better if you'd like to try eightsleep you can go to 8sleep.com huberman and save $150 off their pod 3 cover eight sleep currently ships in the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com huberman and now for my conversation with Coleman Ru Coleman Ru welcome thank you very excited to see you it's great to have you here I'm guessing most people are probably not familiar with Coleman ruy so let's start at the beginning where were you born what was the context of your home life and maybe let's get up to maybe elementary school middle school and uh whatever top Contour or deep details you want to get into yeah we're all yours okay I'll bring us up to seventh grade because I would say that was probably the first big inflection point in my life I grew up in I was born in New Orleans in a suburb called East New Orleans East we call it and uh have older sister two younger brothers my dad was a welder my mom was a dental assistant and we had a couple of boxers in the dogs and we had a very modest very modest upbringing I won't overd dramatize it but you know admittedly you know sometimes we got cheese from the lady across the street who didn't want her welfare cheese and it was one of those you know I could tell my parents were fighting for every nickel and but it was great I mean my cousin grew up across the street from me he's exactly my age we had that at least some of my memory Andrew of it was it was very very pleasant I learned later that you forget a lot of things in your childhood were unpleasant but my initial memories when I started thinking about this kind of thing and you know as you and I have discussed getting professional help and you start to learn a little bit more about your childhood but I remember it being very pleasant you know we've you've told me about your background and skateboarding and stuff you know we skateboarded the neighborhood BMX was a big thing when we were kids it was very much a rat the streets upbringing there was a park behind the neighborhood we would cut through the fence and go you know this kind of thing I played football and baseball and very normal in that regard went to the neighborhood school and then in sixth grade I went to what was my high school but it went it went fifth through 12th called Holy Cross High School in the Lower Ninth Ward which that spot is now vacated because the school I went back after Hurricane Katrina the whole school had to be moved and I went there in seventh grade and it was a hellacious start I mean it was detention after detention you know fist fight after fist fight and damn near were you the instigator of those fights probably some I definitely fell in with the wrong crowd initially in that sixth and seventh grade years and um I wouldn't say it was so extreme that like it was complete Mayhem but I was definitely on you know problem situation number whatever when my parents were called in and it was kind of the last straw type thing and um I got cut from baseball my grades were fine I was always a pretty good student it was just teenager Shenanigans and then I went out for wrestling can can I just uh pause you for a second so on the the violence part um have a little bit of experience with this but uh violence can come from trying to protect others yeah uh instigating uh it can come from the wild just trying to you know see what it feels like experimentation and any number of other things all the way to Pure sociopathy which we know you you are not um and weren't do you recall feeling something inside that inspired this was it for attention did it feel good afterwards um yeah can you recall what it was about I think it was the wildness thing Andrew honestly it wasn't I mean I believe I don't have a malicious Bon my body like we all have that in us obviously my profession later in the military you know I was able to activate that and I feel like I still can and I was certainly able to in sports which is why that seventh grade year was really pivotal but even now it's funny it's even funny you ask about the wildness because let me put it in movie terms like one of my favorite movie scenes of all time is in the movie The Town when Ben Affleck walks in the room J rener is the you know his his partner essentially and he walks in the room and he says we're going to hurt somebody I can't tell you where and I can't tell you when and he pauses and Jeremy rener takes maybe a 3se second pause and he says whose car are we taking he doesn't even ask you know he's just they're just wild and excited about doing something wild I don't promote like going to hurt somebody of course sure were you the Affleck or the rener Affleck excuse me or rener in that I was I I feel like I was mostly the rener put it this way if if you have some good idea this afternoon like let's go try this I'm good I'm ready and I think it's just exciting you know I I I hate rules I hate being told what to do it's one of the things that was so frustrating about the military I the rules are in place for a reason they're Written in Blood I get all that but we're so constrained sometimes I think that was just all coming into fruition that seventh grade year and I enjoyed going wild like it was just fun and frankly we weren't these fist fights and this trouble wasn't like going to get some kid those other kids wanted the wildness too you know and so but the school didn't want that and then I went out for wrestling that year and I could put it all into the wrestling room and it was awesome before we talk about wrestling and why it was so meaningful as a channel for you uh a little bit of neurobiology or else I wouldn't be great uh Andrew huberman uh there's a really interesting phenomenon that one observes in both animals and humans which is that somewhere around adolescence MH when the hormone surge begins but even before that there's a phenomenon called dispersal um it's very different than fighting per se or sexual activity per se it's a it's a literal dispersal from one's home environment or an animals a nest in which animals and humans and we're animals after all start forging new environments in in a very as you point out chaotic way it's not organized it's a little nuts and it um and biologists and neurobiologists in particular have observed changes in neural circuitry that that drive this so some of it's hormonal but a lot of it is the brain taking all this input that one has been exposed to sun earth food others social interactions and starting to essentially throw the different Paints the different colors of paint together and just trying things um some kids are more uh prone to this than others certainly has a hormonal component boys and girls tend to do this differently but they both Do It um and psychologists and neurobiologists see this as a fundamental shift in our underlying circuitry so um just a little bit of food for thought to put what you just described in context with that said tell us about wrestling I mean Andrew in many ways like I said that was the first inflection point it was like immediate I mean immediate uptake within a week I knew this was my thing maybe maybe the first practice what do you think it was so when I was younger my aunt and uncle when I was like seven years old they started taking me to road races and I'm sure uh just running races one mile and 5K races when I was really small kid for you to run mhm to run with them they were into the road racing thing back in the day when it was brand new you know the ' 80s um I'm 48 so I was born in 75 so I was seven you know 8 years old at the time and I was into like obviously can I win this race I just the pain of the effort was so comfortable and then it's kind of silly but like I won the P PT competition at like the Boy Scouts thing in otan park PT is physical yeah physical training physical training so I won like the whatever when I was young in Boy Scouts or something and and then it just snowballed then I was just like the physical activity still today is I mean if someone said what are you really in love with it's it's that and so when I walked into the wrestling room it was so extreme compared to anything else I had ever done football baseball whatever I never really liked any of those Sports I played them all um but I didn't like him and always my dad wrestled in high school and college and um we were we were you know always rough and tumble in that regard and I haven't have a couple of buddies in the teams you know who obviously we're College wrestlers there's a lot of wrestlers in the teams and people would always joke about how we're so handsy and you know our hands are always on each other and that was just a thing for us like I loved the close contact I love the fight of it what I really love about Combat Sports cuz I boxed in high school between wrestling Seasons um was the respect tell me more about that you just don't have there are some of course like you can see guys hyping it up and doing their thing in UFC these days and that's totally fine but for the most part if you have fighters of any type like in a setting when they don't have to do you know the stuff for TV and whatnot they respect each other because and they respect the effort and because you know what it takes and you know how hard it is to face another man in the middle of a mat with no equipment and nowhere to run and no timeouts and no one to tap in that's extreme you know and it may not seem like high school wrestling is Extreme but as you just mentioned something about you know development when you're 14 and you're facing another like that's the first time is someone trying to take your life no they're not but it feels that way and then you go and you put in all these hours of training and you don't eat during the week and you run stadiums or you run levies and you know fireman's carries and and all of it while you're not eating and making weight and you're in the sauna and it's just a very tough thing to do Combat Sports and I love the respect that it engenders between the people who do it I think it was Sam Sheridan who wrote A Fighter's heart uh an excellent book and for anyone male or female age who's interested in the human Spirit uh I recommend a Fighter's heart because it's about the different fight sports but it's really about um the path of self-discovery that occurs in various martial arts and as you said like especially boxing is very gentlemanly you touch gloves you start you know then the you know the Bell goes off you go to your corner like it's you know sometimes people lose it bite off people's ears and things like that but but for the most part the sport is very um structured um as you were doing this uh what was happening with school um did it help uh your academic studies did it keep them more or less the same and how did your family and your peer group view what you were doing were you considered strange for liking wrestling so much I mean you're dieting right you're a young male dieting for purpose of sport and performance you're sitting in saunas you're running in wrapped in plastic bags all this like I mean uh a good friend of ours who was also in the Ste teams uh said one said to me he said you know wrestlers are different and I think he meant different in quotes yeah I think that's true um I you know School my grades immediately went up Andrew it was like oh my gosh the discipline of all of it my grades were always better in wrestling season than out of wrestling season interesting like when I was cut loose out of the structure then it wasn't good and and and you know between seventh and eighth grade and all that I didn't have any crazy Shenanigans going on I wasn't going to get kicked out of school whatever I was doing normal stuff for the age but so the fight stopped totally totally because I could put it into I could put it into the wrestling space you know and I think I grew up obviously in New Orleans and I think you know down there it's baseball football basketball wrestling is not I mean I was lucky to wrestle in college at all because it wasn't like Iowa was looking to recruit me you know they have plenty of people to recruit and they don't need any Louisiana wrestlers although Daniel Cormier grew up like north of the lake was four four years younger I was telling this to somebody we don't know each other I'd love to meet him super impressive athlete we heard that hey there's some kid up in the NorthShore um I think is where he grew up whooping everybody's ass and his name's Daniel Cormier and then you know obviously the rest is history but the sport is not big in Louisiana which is all to say that we were kind of a unicorn we had was very odd at my high school specifically we had one coach his son either National runner up his name was Willie Gatson Willie's Willie passed away I think his son ended up at Iowa State and within the last five or six years was either a national champ or a runner up Willie when I was in eth grade Andrew Willie was at my high school like I have no idea how Willie got and ended up in New Orleans but we ended up with this cluster of wrestlers at that time with the right coaching and a few kids were going to Junior College and coming back and wrestling in college and coming back and there were three or four guys I remember specifically in eighth grade because I started at least in the junior high ranks I started to take off my second year these guys would abuse me in the wrestling room they were seniors in high school I was 112 PBS or 132 pounds my freshman year and they would just in my eighth grade year and they would just abuse me Define abuse in all the legal normal wrestling ways like there's the wrestling gets broken up obviously by weights you got the heavy weights on one end of the room the light weights on the other end of the room and the young kids stay with the young kids for the most part and a few of these guys would drag me down to the varsity end and I would wrestle with the middleweights and they would beat the out of me and eventually you get to the point where you're like this I have I had enough you know and that's when sort of things started to turn but I think that wrestlers are different and my peer group one or two of my really good friends wrestled but most of them played other sports and so but in in every sense of the word life got better for me because of that sport it changed my life so you wrestled all through high school oh yeah yep at at that point were you discovering relationships girls um were you partying were you a drinker use drugs no drugs I mean it's New Orleans right it's like one of the things it was tough I'm glad I got out of the city frankly because it was Party Time Out outside the season yeah girls Girlfriends normal stuff in that regard lots of drinking lots of rat in the streets you know in those days in the 90s um but you kept it inside the lane lines sounds like no drunk driving no arrest we did a little bit of that but not nothing crazy in that regard I think I understood the consequences and I really cared about my career I really wanted to wrestle in college my grades were excellent my SAT scores not so much but um I started winning really fast and you know my last two years in high school I was 89 and0 and I almost won my sophomore year so I was runner up in the state my sophomore year I always joke with the with the boys I my all my boys are way better athletes than I ever could think about being son yeah yeah and um but in eth grade I made varsity and it was like was eighth grade yeah and I lost like 75% of the matches you know but you just grinded out and it's how I got into the Naval Academy which is a whole another story but so let's talk about that so you finished finished high school mhm uh you head to the Naval Academy why the Naval Academy there's actually a crazy story behind this which maybe we Circle back to but um the summer gosh I had forgotten that this started in 7th grade too the summer between my seventh and eighth grade year my grandfather was too young to joined the Navy and he wanted to go to the Naval Academy um during World War II and he lied to the recruiter and got into the merchant marines his I'm pretty sure first cousin my uncle and my cousins are like first cousins once REM removed my Uncle Jim THL was at a family reunion in Mississippi which we were at and he didn't mention to Naval Academy family reunion ends they all go home and he starts sending me Naval Academy paraphernalia I knew nothing about the military and I just thought about it you know and he would send me stuff you know you didn't we didn't have the internet right you sending these booklets and you don't like Authority no so I I've not been in the military but I've done some work with yall and um there's a there's a lot of uh hierarchy and Authority yeah that's true it it the truth and was like it was just it just seemed exciting I wasn't really thinking about the implications as 18-year-olds you know it looked very exciting to me and having gotten some professional help in the intervening years what I really think was a big part of it was my parents got divorced my senior year in high school and the family unit just blew up right and so it also represented an escape you know get out and go get your life out of the New Orleans and just go just go do something were you a part of that uh that obviously you were part of the family that got divorced was it chaotic was it uh controlled you and I are the exact same age we're both 48 born in 75 um back then it was a lot less common for um people being they called them broken homes back then yeah you know um nowadays I don't think they call that everyone just cites the statistic that you know more than half of marriages end in in divorce as if it perhaps to normalize it um but that's more than half um do you recall feeling um distraught about that or was it just kind of the natural consequence of something you had observed a long time like oh that kind of makes sense that no it was a shock to me it wasn't shock to my older sister um I just remember com this was the thought at the time I this is like seared in my brain this has nothing to do with me that wasn't like some sophisticated view it was mostly this I'm not dealing with this I have my own life they're going to have to do what they're going to do meaning my parents I'm getting the hell out of here not a bad mindset for a kid at that stage if it had been four years younger that might not be the the best mindset but as you're heading off to college that's reasonably healthy mindset as opposed to getting am mesed in the what happened in and this and that can I ask you at at that stage you're 17 18 years old at that point um were you journaling at that point no no no journaling no introspective work zero no school psychologist no no thinking about or talking about your feelings it's wrestling Naval Academy social things School SATs like like very standard we're almost like talking like a superficial list of like what happens at the end of high school in 1992 Andrew it's a the the word superficial and I carried this forward for years which I'm sure we'll talk about here in a second those binary Focus areas like I was literally just going after them at Full Steam Stronger Faster more intensity with zero introspection no excavation of the of the psychology of anything just full steam ahead like let's go no meditation no breath work zero which was not adaptive in the long run and we we'll get to uh how that played out in the long run but nonetheless um you got into the Naval Academy well didn't first okay so I applied I I get you know my uncle's doing all this stuff anyway I applied and I didn't I still have the letter the thanks but no thanks you know you're not qualified how'd that hit you at the time it hit me kind of like everything I did when that age when it didn't work out it admittedly Andrew it was it was like there's got to be a way around this like has to work out but it but it feels terrible right like it you have a moment of what do we do and my kids have heard the story a million times my wife was a blue chip swimming recruit for a navy and so she was into the Naval Academy when she was at the beginning of her senior year of high school right what's a blue chip I I mean in my understanding a blue chip is like you are at the very top of the list and the coaches put you straight into the admission cycle saying nobody else gets in until this person does so they wanted her they didn't want you I Not only was she a blue chip and I was and I got the no um I guess well the wrestling coach called me a couple of weeks after my no which is now in may I'm about to graduate from high school I'm not accepted anywhere you only applied one place actually to which you may bur bust out laughing when I tell you what the other one is because no internet I got a mailer in a pamplet from Stanford the wrestling coach I didn't know what Stanford was I had no idea that the college was even prestigious I didn't know they had a wrestling team I filled out the application and wrote the letter thing and I sent it into Stanford and of course never heard back from them but I applied to two places Stanford and the US Naval Academy well for those that follow wrestling I'm I get into either right uh that's a great story and I'll just briefly mention that a few years ago there almost wasn't a wrestling team at Stanford they uh had plans to cut the wrestling team despite having a NCAA champion at Stanford but you know the power of people Gathering and and petitioning works and um wrestling and a few other sports that were being cut from the curriculum um were spared it's amazing yeah rescued so happy to see that yeah so that so it Stanford does have a wrestling team so the coach the coach back to like how I ended up getting in I appreciated my my college coach called and he said there I'm recruiting I have one more spot at the prep school which is in Newport Rhode Island I'm recruiting another kid from Pennsylvania if he takes that spot then I don't have anything left and we were exploring going to prep school and stuff like that oblique ways to get in and he called me sometime in May like right around graduation and said can you be in Newport in July that kid went to I think he went to Lehi and I I went to the prep school so Newport Rhode Island yeah in Newport for a year and been there it's a nice place yeah it's great yeah and so you wrestle for I mean you do school you know you're you're in West Point has a prep school and Colorado Springs has a prep school and so we joke that my wife was first person in our class accepted and I was last which is highly possible actually I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 by now most of you have heard me tell my story about how I've been taking ag1 once or twice a day every day since 2012 and indeed that's true I started taking ag1 and I still take ag1 once or twice a day because it gives me vitamins and minerals that I might not be getting enough of from Whole Foods that I eat as well as adaptogens and micronutrients those adaptogens and micronutrients are really critical because even though I strive to eat most of my foods from unprocessed or minimally processed Whole Foods it's often hard to do so especially when I'm traveling and especially when I'm busy so by drinking a packet of ag1 in the morning morning and oftentimes also again in the afternoon or evening I'm ensuring that I'm getting everything I need I'm covering all of my foundational nutritional needs and I like so many other people that take ag1 regularly just report feeling better and that shouldn't be surprising because it supports gut health and of course gut health supports immune system health and brain health and it's supporting a ton of different cellular and organ processes that all interact with one another so while certain supplements are really directed towards one specific outcome like sleeping better or being more alert ag1 really is foundational nutritional support it's really designed to support all of the systems of your brain and body that relate to mental health and physical health if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs with your order plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman so you're in Newport does that have a a portal to the naval Academy yeah if you graduate prep school you're you're straight into the Naval Academy like they fully expect you to be there the next year when junior year rolled around MH um and Senior rolled around of high school didn't anyone pull you aside and say Hey you might want to like apply to a few other places uh you might want to consider what you do if this doesn't work out what did they assume you were going to do they just head into the City of New Orleans and um bus tables zero guidance Andrew really like from my high school and I think think the ecosystem I was in like people just didn't really know how to do that you know how to apply to schools I mean my parents obviously helped when I applied to the Naval Academy but when I when I look at the system that kids go through now to go you know their process to find the best college experience I never had one conversation with a guidance counselor about what to do I just didn't I mean I just got very lucky a few people my my high school wrestling coach intervened I think at some point and called the Naval Academy to speak to the coach to say you should give this kid a chance but he didn't they didn't know who he was you know I'm so lucky and so fortunate that I ended up where I ended up it's it's why I took it so seriously like the focus with which I applied my time in high school the I took that to 10x degree when I got to Newport because I knew this was my chance there's something magical to that I can relate to that so uh so you're in Newport yeah and describe what a day was like is it all wrestling you're taking general education classes like one does in the in the first two years of University yep so the way the way the prep school is set up for the Naval Academy is they're basically teaching you the first semester of the Naval Academy so you take calculus physics chemistry I think you take an English class Etc and um you go through like a pretty hellacious first couple of weeks cuz you're away from the flag pole where no one can hear you scream you know you're up in Newport you're not in Annapolis where Everyone's Watching and you do a couple hellacious weeks for an 18-year-old who's never been in the military before so you're in the military technically if you go to this you're actually enlisted in the Navy okay so they they own you to some extent yeah yeah yeah they do and then you do you're wearing uniforms you're jogging in the morning you're doing salutes and marching Yep bugling they're doing Taps in the evening yep all of it got it yep and you live there's 300 people at the prep school it's distributed basically amongst folks coming from the fleet so guys who did four five years in the military somewhere and they're coming into the Naval Academy from the fleet and then athletes and then sort of a mixture of other folks who need a little extra school right and so and then you do a full school year you're competing it's basically a red shirt year that's not a red shirt year I competed up and down the East Coast against you know all the other prep schools and you finish that year in May and then you know you're done with the prep the prep year is fine it's a little bit of a a shock when you're 18 but it's fine always been curious about these military schools and the people that go to them and what happens to people there uh did you have any sense of patriotism prior to arriving at this prep school and did that sense of patriotism you know I'm talking like love of country uh understanding the the history of our country and its position in the in the international landscape are you thinking about that stuff are they feed you that or is it really like wrestling get through the March shower up go to the next thing is it is it very like plug and- chug no no the the feeding of and I really appreciated this the feeding of those Concepts starts when you get there but I was deer in the headlights and like I didn't think about my life in this way at all when I was headed there I mean what what you get very early because the school very quickly starts to bring really high level accomplished people Colonels Admirals whatever generals to expose you to this people I do remember sitting there that within weeks like this is way bigger than I thought it was in terms of how serious this situation is you know um and how serious this ecosystem of people take this because I didn't have my dad wasn't an admiral he was a welder in New Orleans you know I didn't understand the bigness of of it one of the reasons I asked this is that various times throughout my life I've had this experience of like seeing people close to me doing incredible work you know like when I was a post talk at Stanford I had Nobel Prize was given that one week to the guy next door to me yeah so you see him in the morning and like you're hearing it on the radio and uh obviously I didn't have that kind of um stature or talent in science I think I'm a good scientist but um good enough to you know get tenure at Stanford but then there there are levels within the game yeah but there is something very special to the experience of having people close to you physically and in the same ecosystem as you described it achieving amazing things I also saw this in skateboarding I mean there were a lot of uh let's just say uh failures uh to uh integrate with normal life but there were also some guys that I grew up with who started companies and set world records and you know had their Pro Models and then if you zoom out from that and you go wait I'm in this community it changes one's self viw about what's possible so I think that's what you're describing and I think it's such an important thing for people to experience at some point even if the goal isn't to be at kind of world scale you know for people to realize that the town they grew up and the family they grew up in that context can expand yes and so do you recall being at this prep school and kind of third personing yourself and thinking like well I'm Coleman Ruiz I'm from New Orleans I went from this to this to this the way you've been describing it and I'm here and they're like I'm around some incredibly impressive people and I'm here like once you make that recognition that you're there a whole bunch of things can open up no I actually came at it from the opposite way and this has been a hard thing for me my whole life and I have to watch out for this perspective is I felt like every day I had to wake up and earn my place there I was never good enough for myself ever so next day up is a restart to prove myself again on whatever standard I'm picking that day right looking back on it I realized it was somewhat arbitrary because it was just day by day I didn't think I'm Coleman Ru as I made it here look I'm part of this e i I was afraid like Mike Tyson talks about being afraid every time I was afraid every day and I fought for like a position in this place every day now that was adaptive in some regards right mm very because to me it was let's go like today's another new day and it's 100% Allin full go I hope everybody's ready did you ever recall falling asleep at night and thinking like well like I had a good day I had a good day or or I'm scared you know they're going to discover I can't keep up or I can't keep up all the time so a lot of fear I mean yeah yeah a lot of fear all the time and and some of it I do I I I genuinely know and believe Andrew that it was well-intentioned like I wanted to do a good job for the group whatever group I was in my platoon my squad in the case of the prep school you know that first experience I I mean I I was talking about this with with my wife the other day just because stories come up you know we had a 25th reunion at the Naval Academy and this kind of thing and um I was a really good runner for my group in high school like the people I was around I ran cross country when I was young and anyway I did I suppose I'm going the other I I sort of did have some level of confidence in my ability then I got there and like all these college cross country Runners are like my son is now just crushing me and I think sadly because it was just sort of in me that fed my fear like I thought I was better than this clearly I suck I have to get to their level so um I did have a very well-intentioned excitement around just do a good job with the people you're around there's something fun to that and wild you know as we spoke about um but I was operating out a fear for decades but there was a I need to get to their level statement in there it wasn't I can't keep up I better find a different path no no no no I knew I could I knew I could get to their level with enough work you know was that something that your your father or your mother or both had instilled in you that for sure MH yeah and my high school wrestling coach was um let's call it maybe from the old school MH if you worked hard enough you could you could you could get there you know so this is the essence of growth mindset long before Carol ja coined the the phrase growth mindset yeah yet when I first read a book I'm like when don't people teach us this when we were kids yeah you know well some of us got it some of us didn't and it can be very context dependent right I think that's one of the more important often overlooked aspects of Carol's work and Ali crumb's work is that we can develop growth mindset in one domain of life but then another domain of life we get you know kicked in the teeth once and we're like I can't do that there's a carve out where I can't function some people do that some people don't and um and we don't understand enough about it um to understand you know whether or not it's a global circuit you know and it's there's a lot of context but okay so you're you're hanging in there at least you're surrounded by some very impressive people there's a lot of structure so we're a long way from the pre- wrestling days when yeah this is the opposite of chaos totally this is structure yeah you told what to do every five minutes more or less and this is um scary feelings fear is a scary feeling uh but you're channeling it and you said the unit of the day became important it's like what can I do today yes you're not thinking about the week you're not thinking about the season you're not thinking about becoming some war hero down the line you're just 24 hours and do the next day yeah how was your selfcare at that point or is that built into the system it's not built into the system and it was Zero I mean it really was Andrew like it was the old school we were not doing anything sophisticated back then I mean there was no we stretched and in the grand scheme of things is going to sound weird because there still is a lot of you know primal nature to Combat Sports but in the grand scheme of things we were probably on the upper end of sophisticated like wrestlers jump rope they stretch they do aerobics you know um been in auna since 1993 you know it's like not purposeful not for to cut weight in a garbage bag but there is some level of some level of balancing out your training you know wrestlers like to swim in the like during the season because you're getting out of that room like you end up accidentally doing some of these things but there was no selfcare so you eventually go to the Naval Academy MH 94 the actual Naval Academy and that's where you met your wife yep in '96 my sophomore year so when you get there what what's different than the prep school first of all it's big in the macro not just geographically big or footprint square footage wise it's big the concept is Big you know like the superintendent of the school is a three- star admiral you hear about his career you know you're 19 years old you meet so there's two incredibly important people in my life at in those early years at the Naval Academy a guy named Doug zbec who's dead now who most people of my service time will know who he is um when I was on my recruiting trip to the Naval Academy and I was in high school this is complete accident Doug was a sophomore we call him youngsters at the Naval Academy he was a sophomore and we're the same weight class so coach matched us up because it was my recruiting visit and my first this is back to being wild literally my first night on the grounds of the Naval Academy I'm sleeping on Doug zek's floor of his of his room with his other two roommates and sometime around 3: or 4 a.m. I get woken up it's like a bomb goes off there's a bom didn't go off but there's 12 other gorillas in the room all wrestlers maybe one or two other guys and Doug is hustling I don't know any of these people Andrew like I just met Doug the previous evening we just flew into town he wakes me up he's hustling me to get my shoes on again I'm just this High School kid and then within 2 to 3 minutes all 15 of these gorillas bolt out of the room and Doug grabs me and I'm just following them right so we race out of boft Hall it's maybe 4 in the morning 3:30 4 in the morning we race out of boft Hall the barracks we run across the parking lot into Lun Hall in Lun Hall is the swimming facility and the wrestling room that's it that's the only thing that's in there right the doors we run up to Lun Hall the doors of Jun Hall are locked with a chain on the outside and one of our Doug pulls on the Chain so that the do open enough at the top that the 142 pounder can climb up and like get inside that little Gap in the doors and run over and open one of the doors that isn't chained this is what you'll later do professionally I still have exactly and what I frankly did as a kid like back in the day and so I'm terrified cuz I don't know what's coming you know and so you don't bother to ask what are we doing there's no time there's just no time like these guys are to me they're full-blown war heroes they're not they're college kids but I'm 17 they're 21 all these wrestlers I'm hoping I'm going to come here and be their teammate you know we run into Lun Hall go to the Second Story we climb up the utility ladder where Public Works goes to get in the ceiling above the white foamy ceiling tile things so we're now on the catwalk where the HVAC guys would be working and I'm starting to get a sense of what's coming we go a couple feet down the catwalk everyone stops someone reaches over the catwalk and pulls one chalky ceiling tile out so now you can look over the edge of the catwalk and see right through the ceiling into the diving well remember the diving well has a 10 meter platform and then we're another I don't want to OV exaggerate this we have to be another 20 feet into the ceiling so you're above the diving board what most people we're way above the diving board okay we're 5T above the ceiling which is 20t above the 10 meter got it right and so um and now I've realize what's happening and two or three wrestlers they sort you climb over the catwalk get you know backwards get your hands all the way down and then very lower yourself in a reverse pullup so you don't kick the SE in tile and three or four guys go and you can hear them hit the water after what is a terrifyingly long time when you're you know my age and SC in the dark oh yeah no one's supposed to be in there um and then one of the guys looks over when you're a recruit you're called a drag they're like drag you're up and I'm lowering myself Andrew and I kick the adjacent ceiling tile and it hits the dive tank and it turns into pancake batter and goes to the bottom of the pool oh my and one of my teammates is like you one of my future teammates you know he's going nuts I drop I live and this is back to Doug I come up Doug clearly goes behind me but I don't hear him and one or two guys are going nuts you high school piece of like you're going to go down to the 15 ft and pick it all up and Doug comes up and he just blasts everybody he's our responsibility this is not his fault we brought him here like just totally backs me up and then the rest of the visit happens I end up there Dougs no senior I'm a freshman and he's just the legend he was all American and to this day Andrew you need to hear this loud and clear like for all the people you and I both know and the people I've been around no other human in my life have I met with his physical and mental toughness not even close the guy was born in the wrong century is the way I describe him and he was like my mentor and he was my guy you know and uh he was killed in' 07 Marine mhm yeah we we'll talk about Doug you've written about him he's unbelievable I feel like I know him a little bit thanks to you we'll get around to that uh for sure I think people are getting a sense of where we're headed so that's the that to answer your question about like that the bigness of the Naval Academy that's how it started for me like everything was just on steroids you know all these kind of people I get the impression at least up until now that you're kind of just you just go with what's right in front of you 100% like there there isn't a lot of pause and reflect although your R your Rudder is not halfhazard it's not random no well yeah I can say right now you and I as similar as I you know we may be in certain respects like we're very different in this way like there isn't a there isn't like a foraging you know in biology we call them random walks you know a lot a lot of organization that comes out of biology is through random Walks Like animal or human like finds a node and moves and and life is like that Steve Jobs talked about not being able to connect the dots except retrospect and and I subscrib to that and his life was a bit of a random walk but that we Guided by some Central beam of of uniqueness uh Robert Green was when he was on the podcast talks about that your beam is is um more narrow it seems narrow and the propeller behind that beam is uh high RPM yes that's very clear and what I'm not hearing here is like um yeah you know at one point I paused and wondered whether or not I wanted to you know be here wrestling in the Naval Academy or or even like what I might do when I get out am I going to work for an investment firm what am I going to do you're re Your Horizon it seems to be about 24 hours at that point yeah I hope not anymore but at that point at that at that point I'm no psychologist but but um but it just seems like you're uh it's not like you're playing checkers but you're you're optimizing for a fairly um short Horizon there's no question that's right and the other part that was probably the most important to me Andrew was the the person or the group mhm because this is going to sound very arrogant but when I got to I'm going to this prep school I'm going to Naval Academy I think on day one I'm going to literally meet the cream of the crop in the country and that was not the case and it was not the case at the Naval Academy and frankly it wasn't the case in the teams either like I'm not saying I'm better than anybody but I thought every single person when I got to the Naval Academy was going to entirely focused on whatever our mission was and I didn't even know what my mission was there right I just knew I was going to be told what Wright looks like and Doug not only did I meet him in high school and have the the luck of having him as a teammate and a mentor for me he is what Wright looked like so a focused beam and a propeller running at high RPM with the right you know quote unquote swim buddy so to speak was literally all I cared about that was it everything else was White Noise were there other interests at the time I mean presumably you listen to music every once in a while but I mean I would whatever but didn't fall in love with it didn't feel the need to pursue anything else learn an instrument do anything else it was it was it was a that was it it was that that narrow beam so you met your wife in 96 sophomore year at the Naval Academy yep uh and was she as driven is she as driven I mean she's obviously a very talented swimmer presumably works hard as well um it's kind of interesting I didn't um realize until a few years ago that the both of you were you know military yeah she definitely just different different driven way smarter way more you know it's obviously not one to one for men and women but way more successful by gradient standards she's in the Navy Hall of Fame she was Patriot League swimming champ she was on Junior National trath on team when she was 20 I think um really talented in every regard um ninth in our class I think first female graduate number one female graduate our class tell me more about that how's it how's that work you have a I don't even know exactly how the grading first of all her grades are her academic success is just remarkable and then you get a military grade and you get a physical grade not for your Athletics I don't think but it's like your PR RT scores which is your physical Readiness test all this military stuff you do you get this other cluster of a grade that goes along with your academic grades and she was number nine in the class and the first female graduate based on that cluster of grading and I mean she's an amazing person was her success in academics and swimming was that part of what Drew you to her uh no no no and she was just nice and you know I I didn't really care about the achievement it doesn't it certainly sounds like I care about achievement because of the narrow Focus but it it wasn't really that you know she was just really normal in a group of a lot of abnormal people frankly like there's some Cooks at these schools you know um and I'm probably in that category I don't know but everybody's just really different there you have this athlete group you have I mean you know Andrew I mean you you went to Stanford I mean some of the you know the group of Naval Academy and West Point like these schools who produce like the road scholar level person like that cluster of group like at Navy I remember they're super impressive I mean and then there's the rest of us like doing our best getting pretty good grades and stuff but there's very different groups inside you know the school yeah yeah I looked at some of my colleagues like a former guest on this podcast Ali crumb you know she's incredible scientist was a division one gymnast and uh is a licensed clinical psychologist also maintains a a healthy relationship with with children in the home like I just go who are these people you know it's I mean you know every once in a while we talk about the the person with the quote unquote extra gear you know like some people just seem to have that extra gear and I don't want to take anything away from Ally or anyone else's um incredible work ethic that goes with what people perceive as an extra gear who knows if they have an extra gear or not uh I always just want to know what their parents did yeah and it out Allie's parents I hope I have this right uh but recollection of this is that um her mother ran a theater group and her father was a martial arts teacher okay so you know there's nothing that speaks to academics per se and and I find that really important to me and to highlight because I think people hearing this conversation and hear about people like alleys and other examples like that you think oh yeah you got to come from an academic family to end up at a at a top tier institution or or to win a Nobel Prize in fact there there are so many exceptions to that or you have to um be a natural athlete um or be born with some some genetic gift or or or some extra gear as it were in order to succeed but I think so much of success is the thing that you seem to operationalize really quickly which is um to really focus on that 24-hour Horizon and where one has seen failure to just keep going I mean a big part of it is just to keep going but also to make make sure that you're continuing to go um in a direction that is adaptive and functional because imagine had you not found wrestling and you had gotten into some you know some group where the the the metrics of success were around you know dealing weed or doing something which back then was highly illegal now is very varying levels of legality but you know where that where the points came back for effort in domains of life that could take you down into the gutter and and you see this so I'm I'm convinced that the work ethic is is the fundamental piece but there has to be that Rudder and your Rudder has to be pointed in the right direction so along those lines you meet Bridget yeah and was it instantaneous no we kind of had a friendship first I felt like at least we've discussed this I mean I instantaneously enjoyed her company so I met Bridget in February of sophomore year I was on the campus of Naval Academy is called the yard I was on the yard all winter because the wrestling season is in the shittiest time ever right it crosses over the holidays you have to make weight during Thanksgiving you have to make weight during Christmas we were on campus on the yard and it was easily waste deep snow and we were doing two a day practices everybody else is home on vacation that winter I considered leaving and thank goodness for no cell phones and stuff because I didn't know how to leave I was like you consider leaving like leaving the ne leaving the I was just but it didn't have anything to do with the na Academy really it had everything to do with that moment I was miserable like I was making I wrestled 190 my freshman year and Doug graduated he was the 177 pounder so sophomore yard dropped into his spot I went down to 177 fighting weight for me is like 193 but you know back then Andrew lifting a lot I was 210 to 215 in the off season and I cut to 177 sophomore year and I was just really miserable and um if it was easy to leave I probably would have and then I met Bridget in February and I was like it I'll stay she's better than this place anyway having followed my high school girlfriend off to college and not gone to college when I got there I just lived in the parking lot outside her dorm room I I can relate you know there's a uh I probably wouldn't be sitting here today were not for for eleny I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors plunge plunge makes what I believe is the best self-cooling cold water plunge over the last decade and especially in The Last 5 Years there's been an increasing amount of excitement about cold water plunging for a sake of mental health physical health and performance and that's in large part because one of the most robust effects of cold water exposure are big increases in Adrenaline also called epinephrine and dopamine so while some people do cold water plunging in pursuit of increasing metabolism or reducing inflammation it's it's really those big increases in Adrenaline and dopamine that lead to those long lasting increases in alertness and feelings of well-being not just in the seconds or minutes after the cold plunge but indeed for several hours afterwards I've been using a plunge for several years now typically first thing in the morning or after cardiovascular training I do agree that doing cold water plunging after a workout designed to generate hypertrophy or strength gains is not a good idea but doing cold plunging at the other times of day can be tremendously beneficial I use the version of plunge called the Allin ice bath and plunge now also makes saunas that get up to 230° F I love how the plunge ice bath and sauna can both be controlled from an app on my phone so that if I'm headed home I can turn on the sauna and it'll be hot when I arrive so if you would like to try a plunge ice bath or SAA you can go to plunge. comom huberman to get $150 off either product again that's plunge. comom huberman so at what point did you decide you wanted to aim for the SEAL Teams is a great question I mean things you know as compared to at a Gunnery Sergeant in the Marine Corp at Prep School who I thought these are back to the first people you meet in this environment gunny Flynn and he was great like he was super hard on us but I obviously kind of love that and I thought I was going to go into the Marine Corps and Doug wanted to go into the Marine Core I'm a freshman at the Naval Academy he's my wrestling partner Doug could literally tell me to jump off of a building his as long as he came with me I'd do it no problem and enjoy it all the way down Doug was going into the Marine Corps I thought I was going to go into the Marine Corps and I did a summer training in quanico between freshman and sophomore year and it was okay it was good but I didn't love it and I met a couple other guys who were going to compete for spots in the SEAL Teams who were years ahead of me but to answer your question junior year you get you can sign up and say I want to start competing for a Billet we had 16 spots in my class I think there's 32 spots these days you know the force has grown since 911 obviously and um and I I want to say maybe 150 or so people they put you through this weekend overnight two-day hell two-day things at Navy some people quit I don't know how many go to what we used to call Mini buds in the summer between Junior and Senior year you go out to cornado and buds instructors they still have it it's called something different um you spend two weeks at the buds compound and they run you through a mini program and so find buds for the some some folks listening to this won't know won't know the acronym the acronym is basic underwater demolition seal school that's our school in Coronado screen process for who gets in who doesn't yeah and when you're at when you're at the Naval Academy it's obviously different than guys coming into the listed ranks you have this pool of people 150ish guys say they want to go sometime junior year they run you through this weekend pretty hard at Navy because we have seals station at the Naval Academy and then I'm just going to guess that goes from 150 to 80 maybe 80 guys go to the summer program in Coronado when you're still you know a midshipman at the Naval Academy I've never maybe people have quit mini buds I don't know but I don't know if I really saw anybody quit the two weeks we're out in Coronado and then you get you know graded on your performance and stuff and then you come back for senior year and you go through a series of interviews with a bunch of seals Who come out and do interviews and you don't really know what you're doing and then they select down I don't want to again overdo it but it's probably seven I don't know maybe 50 or 60 qualified guys they select you down to 16 and so to answer your question about when I got interested was when I knew I didn't want to go in the Marine Corps I never ever had the Top Gun Fever thing I wasn't interested in flying I just wasn't interested in anything else but something super physical and that seemed like the best the next best thing and because I grew up in New Orleans and spent a lot of time in the water that wasn't intimidating that screens a lot of people out obviously yeah and got selected in the group of 16 and was at buds after graduation you know a couple months after graduation there's been a lot put out into the world around buds you know people have seen the log carrying and boat carrying and the screaming and the set set screaming of the the uh instructors and the and the running and the you know clasped arms in the in the water and hell week no sleep and on and on it's obviously tough it it calls 85% of the people that go out there thinking that they are the the absolute last person who would ever quit ring the bell so to speak um you obviously got through uh a while back you mentioned to me three things that you think predict whether or not somebody's going to get through Buds and um before you tell us what these are I just will just uh tell people that yes of course you made it through buds successfully and went into the teams um very successful career in the teams but you've also been a buds instructor so you've been on the on the um on the other side of the equation too what are those three things yeah this was as you know this was very anecdotal but it lined up we when I was back there in ' 05 as an instructor Andrew I feel like we're not scientists right but I feel like we tried every correlating data pull that we could pull from pull-ups to runtimes to you name it to regions of the country that people grow up near water at least back then nothing correlated and so I was a first phase OIC officer in charge and so our team in first phase we can talk about what that is in detail if you want to but first phase isn't charge of hell week you know hell weeks in the first two months of training and a couple of the guys said all this about this can get you through that can get you through I bet that every single person we talk to out here on the grinder has one of these three things they were a varsity athlete in high school or college their parents are divorced or they got suspended from school I guarantee it and we would walk around the grinder and ask and I mean you know this isn't going to pass it independent review board but it's got to be 90 to 95% so that's incredible because you know so much has been made of buds and hell week and just to just fill in a few of the blanks for those that aren't familiar hell week is what it's uh five nights no sleep you get an hour a couple minutes on on one day but you're basically in constant movement for about a week are and that's when most people voluntarily ring the bell and most of them do it before Wednesday okay and I know it's got chaotic components going off blast it's got hard work boring components people the the people trying to make it through have no sense of how long a run is going to last or what's going to happen and you hear all this stuff like okay you just don't quit or you just go meal to meal but what you just described is really interesting uh let's break those three things down because um playing a varc sport has certain elements um having divorced parents has certain elements and getting sus spended in school has certain elements let's start with divorced parents first because vars sport I think we can probably just quickly say okay there's structure you have to listen to somebody you have to be able to push yourself you have to have some level of physical competence coachable mental competence work with others so there's something there right um and you presumably have to go through Junior varc to get there so there's some oomph and required um in any event um but the divorce parents pieces is was surprising to me still is what you have divorced parents so do I divorces occur for any number of different reasons what in the world do you think is the uh the consequence of or the of a divorced household that would predict so well at least in this back of the envelope measurement that you made but as an instructor that people would get through this excruciatingly difficult period of time for me it was one thing specifically I felt like I was alone if I didn't have the team so I don't know what it would be for other people but I was like if I don't have this team then what team do I have so I'm not leaving you could crank up the cold and misery as high as you want but I'm not leaving yeah that hits deep um I didn't do buds I didn't even know what the Seal team was were but I certainly know the the feeling of um looking outside of the household for uh a sense of family and belonging and the feeling that like I'd much rather like from almost from a place of Joy like I'd much rather die for these people hopefully not with these people but much rather die trying to save others and to do well in that than to quit yeah yeah that's that's a powerful thing that you just shine light on I don't think of the hundreds of interviews with Team guys ex- Team guys buds instructors Etc that are out there I don't think anyone's ever highlighted that I don't think I was aware of it then Andrew but I just you know again it's in it's in retrospect well the retrospect is in large part what we're here for um to go a little deeper on that I think that a lot of people have challenging homes the parents aren't necessarily divorced and we're talk Talking of course about um trying to understand the the human Spirit uh certainly not accomplishments per se but the human spirit so I think that a lot of people especially nowadays they look to their home life and if you know God willing they had a great home life that is the base it's like the it's like the Touchstone for them that they can return to but for a lot of people even people who go home for the holidays or who touch in with their parents whether or not they're divorced or not that they don't feel like that family unit is really a a solid thing maybe they're in a place I see this a lot of where like they're the parent they had to grow up taking care of the parents I see that a lot on both the male side and the female side I see that um so you're saying that one strong predictor of getting through is a feeling of people want essentially making it their like almost like biological identity to get through it was certainly the case for me I mean when I got and again I don't really like to overdo these things because it tends to feed the Mythos a little but when I got to buds Andrew like I when I got to the Naval Academy I had a very strong sense of this is my chance and you know you develop over the years and you spend time thinking about this and having mentors when I got there that was very much my first time of you better bring the nastiest on the planet because I'm not leaving here like it's just not I'm not I'm just not going you know and there's a Navy bit to it too like I didn't want to do anything else in the Navy so back to fear I was afraid I would get stuck doing a job I didn't like but there's some people are not wrong you know about buds there's some very difficult days where you do start to wonder like is this really worth it and I and that I never once thought about quitting it never crossed my mind because I just had these other things that I really had to do for myself in my life or else I felt like I was going to have nothing and so again I don't think operating out of fear is particularly adaptive but sometimes it you know the bit in your teeth is useful yeah certainly in my own life I could say you know getting real scared about being 19 and essentially realizing I'm not good at anything I'm not good at anything and I was terrible at a lot of things and some of those things were taking me down a dangerous path that that was the fear I'm grateful for the fear piece it it would it it scruffed me and uh let's talk about the suspended in school yep um he's uh first of all that implies getting caught yes not just misbehaving but getting caught um yeah what do you think that's about so we're really talking about a sense of rebellion against Authority or the system that one finds themselves in which is super important for our line of work like for me again I can only speak for myself for me it was the wild you Factor like you have to there's just a nasty reality of the work we had to do you know I was in from 98 until 2011 in the seal teams in the SEAL Teams from 98 until 2011 everybody knows what was happening between 911 and then um it's not that it didn't stop happening I know you know from my own experience from 03 through 2010 was extremely intense and um obviously the military has rules and we need rules and you follow the laws of onc conflict and you follow the rules of engagement there's no question about that ever um but the that happens to you out in the field for real does not follow any pattern and so if you are a complete you know nonsuspended from school rule follower I'm not saying you won't be successful I'm sure plenty of people are but in our line of work if you ask people most of them had a weird streak as they were coming up like they have a little bit of a a side eye when somebody tells them this is how stuff is like maybe it's like that but you don't know that and where it really became clear for me Andrew was look at every stage in your development you're still looking for what right looks like and when I was a I'm now a Naval Academy graduate not that that means anything special but I'm smart enough I'm now in my 20s I'm at Buds and I have this recollection later like you people are always telling stories about the teams and when you're a new student at buds you're you kind of believe everything the instructors tell you because it's pretty impressive and then you find out later when you when I checked into Seal Team 3 and you actually start to understand the Arc of the job it's like all these guys were telling training stories those weren't real Combat stories those they they never said that that was a story from training and so my point is like what what you I hope guys are getting it now but what we didn't get a lot of was the real story in a sense meaning I will say definitively my first combat deployment was 03 when we invaded Iraq I was a platoon Commander we invaded Iraq and I remember within a week of being in that situation thinking not one single instructor had the experience to mentor and Coach me on this not one and so you have to go back to that wild suspended you factor mindset like all your silly rules about how the military Works none of that shit's happening out here like all this other stuff is happening that doesn't have anything to do with your training manuals except for the things you don't violate which is to your best of your ability stuff happens but the rules of engage the laws of armed conflict everything else is a tossup the tactics aren't that's not a tossup but you know what I mean like the environment is it completely chaotic it's a new sport it's a brand new sport that no one coached you on and and it's high-risk High consequence for you and your teammates but also for the other side I mean every 15 seconds is a new consequential decision yeah because you obviously don't want to kill civilians on the other side either of course not yeah so you obviously get through buds you probably weren't surprised given your mindset probably weren't surprised no no I wasn't surprised at this point I'm maybe building a little self-confidence and just operate out of fear but happy presumably oh yeah yep and I feel obligated to ask well I'm just curious to ask that you you know you've been in a system of military for a long time is there a a bigger um pole of patriotism there or that's just it's there but I mean are you thinking about country or are you thinking about team you think about the day yeah I mean at this point you know I'm fully indoctrinated in a sense you know the Naval Academy really does give you a sense of again bigness and you meet people from World War II and Vietnam and you know an amazing guy which you know we can cover later I don't I wasn't around when he was coming up but Colonel John Ripley is a guy who won the Navy cross in Vietnam um the book The the bridge of donga is about him he knew my this is back to I was my Uncle Jim who introduc he and my Uncle Jim were buddies and I met him he's since passed away I met Colonel Ripley when I was a ple at the Naval Academy um I work with one of his sons now friend teammate Mentor is a great guy um colonel Ripley he's a legend like this guy's a Navy cross winner should have won the Congressional Medal of Honor by all accounts if you read the B the book to Bridget dong High you you are going to have no ability to understand why he's not dead and these are the kind of people you meet so back to the patriotism you know Thing by the time I was in the teams I I knew where I was sort of in this ecosystem admittedly though what I didn't really have Andrew because it I mean I love the country of course but it wasn't again I didn't grow up with a dad who was like you know this was always in our house or just wasn't that big of a thing this this came for me after 911 obviously but yes the patriotism and the importance of the jobs there but what when I remember checking in Seal Team 3 what what emerged very quickly for me because we had Vietnam vets in the training cell at se team 3 and just some amazing people what I realized away was okay playtime is completely over and that was very useful like early lesson not that anyone was around in buds like you know it's serious but you meet a guy like Master Chief Martin who's got 100 combat missions from Vietnam he's about to retire he was like the third person I met when I checked into the team and you suddenly are like a kid again where there was just no around so you're in the teams presumably liking the work loved it loving the team component it's hard it's unpredictable and that's part of the the fun it's amazing yeah the job's amazing you do a number of different deployments MH and at some point you get called to try out for the tier one uh tier one division within the within the SEAL Teams um maybe just explain a little bit of what tier one means um and you know we don't want to speak in code here but we you know just inform people that there are levels within the teams um and that uh yeah tell us what tier one is yeah well I'll just refer to a special Mission Unit it's probably the easiest um we have a bunch of teams on the east and west coast as a lot of people know nowadays this was not public knowledge years ago yeah so so you've got the these different units within within the SEAL Teams yeah so you you have to raise your hand you know I was 10 years in Andrew I was at I had had been platoon Commander during the invasion of Iraq we came to Monterey I went to school and went back to be a budge instructor it was 10 years I felt like it was time to you know take my shot it's a little risky because it's hard to make it through you know Green Team and stuff at the at the special Mission Unit it's a 9month Advanced Training Program you're 10 years into your career you're not 22 anymore and not everyone gets called The Green Team not everyone can go you can't say I want to go I want to try out you can say you want to try out and you do a pre-screener okay so the command training staff I'll call it the command for purposes of this conversation because I'm familiar with that term for us the command training staff comes out they put you through all this stuff some of it's psychological some of it's physiological I don't think we did a blood test but they checked the trainers checked everything on me um which I thought this is actually a description of why the units tier one I was even in the pre-screening it was the first time the way I joke about it is like I really felt like I was doing what was in the brochure like it was real varsity stuff you know I'm presaging a later conversation that we'll get to but um at this point Have you ever sat down with a psychologist and done a therapy session that was no therapy but I sat down with psychologist because they put us through the battery the neop The Raven stuff like that they're asking you how do you sleep at night how do you feel what do you dream about how much do you drink and you say two beers a week and and you're lying every ly yeah but now it might be two beers a week now it's zero zero right um but yeah so it was good screening process like I was like oh these guys are not messing around this is exactly what I wanted to do MH and the physical tests ramp up and uh coincidentally I worked for him later still friends with him now on my interview board was uh bris Linsky who won the Congressional Medal of Honor BR was on my interview board and he's great guy and so yeah then you just wait and if you get picked up you go out you know to the east coast and you really rolling the dice because I was on the west coast you move your whole family sell your house you mean have to sell your house but we did and you move and you're going to do a 9month advanced training program at the command just to get into a Tactical Unit you know which we call squadrons and the best way tactically for me to describe the difference and look my time at Team three was amazing I'm not diminishing it but let me just use freef fall military freef fall for anybody who's you know even done civilian free fall so it's jumping out of place jumping yeah so if you go if we go to the Drop Zone and we go jumping right FAA regulations have you jump at 12,999 FT CU soon as you go above 13,000 you have to use supplemental oxygen which is not a huge deal but it's a pain in the ass for the airplane to have it and so 99% of your jump all your jumps well at any standard Drop Zone your civilian jumps are going to be below 13 Grand for all of our jumping at Seal Team 3 is below 13 Grand it just makes the training more efficient and you'll jump during the daytime maybe a little night jumping you probably have some lights for safety um and if you look out of the airplane you would be able to see the orange te on the drop zone right that's your standard jump profile maybe you'll jump with some weight you'll certainly jump with your weapon probably your helmet but not all your jumps because you're bringing guys from zero to be able to do tactical military freef fall as a group when you go to the command your jumps are from 25,000 ft you do 30 minutes of pre-breathing on oxygen helmet night vision zero lights and a attack board that has your navigation system on it 100 pounds of gear your weapon your oxygen all your and 45 dudes piled up in a c17 and you drop miles away from the Drop Zone because you're over ground speed at 25,000 ft is hauling ass you know because of the wind and if you take your hands out of your gloves at 25,000 feet it's curtains like you're not going to be able to use your fingers cuz it's so cold and you jump from way away obviously and all your jump is completely blacked out everybody turns IR lights on their helmets and INF infrared lights so you can see through night vision um and you got to fly that canopy multiple multiple miles and land everybody on a drop zone you know that's if you take every tactical thing we do and expand the same way you would expand freef fall that's the difference at the command which is look I was I want to own this when I was at Team three because you think about this I had many many moments where I was thinking ah it man those guys aren't that much different like we're we're super highend right and we are and then when I got there I was like this is this is another level MH what what percentage of people that go to Green Team get through and get S uh I think I have had 65 in my class you don't drop that many maybe 10 guys didn't make it or something maybe 15ish so then you were why do they call it tier one no idea it must have some official reason like because if you go into like real documentation Andrew like there's there there's echelons in you know this this command is echel on this this command is echelon this and the military Congress sets end strength numbers it's says the Navy you get at the one time CU I took some class the Navy had like 355,000 people and that's the Navy's end strength and they have to distribute those numbers across everybody in the Navy so I don't know why it's called tier one but I think it has a you know has a reason so you got through M you were accepted and then you're doing very different sorts of things than you were doing previously very so my understanding is this is largely counterterror work um so all the work in the military and SEAL Teams is high-risk High consequence but now it's Special Operations as as the name um implies um where things have to be worked out on a on a case-by Case basis it's highly unusual it was unusual before but now it's highly unusual circumstances um what was it like to be there did you like that family I loved it it was the best place to work MH um and this is 200 this is 06 through 2011 for me okay so it's post 911 uh through 2011 yep okay so I'm sure a lot happened and most of which we can't and won't discuss um and that's not what's important here yeah um but clearly you met and worked with some amazing individuals um I happen to know because we've uh spoken before and we have some common friends in in the in the that Arena that um you had both the privilege of doing this work in this really important wartime but also um the unfortunate experience of of being close to and working with uh quite a lot of people that uh were killed yep um how many so I mean I don't know why I did this or why anyone does it it it's way over 40 but I try not to over affiliate myself with a larger group than I actually knew but the people that I personally knew Andrew it's exactly 40 and um and we could spend probably weeks detailing how impressive uh each and every one of those people was in their individual cases this is perhaps a an opportunity to um put a call out there's a a wonderful book I think an important book that isn't so well known in the in the array of quote unquote military and seal books um which is the book about Adam Brown Yeah The Fearless book I heard they're going to make it into a movie but but what I um what I like about the book is um actually has very little to do with the SEAL Teams totally that's thing is that Adam um had a serious serious problem with addiction that he masked at times and it came back to pull him under various times while he was in the teams and um I know you worked with Adam and you're close my green team yeah yeah so um that's a great book for anyone that wants a a different sort of book um it's really about addiction and family and his discovery of the path out of all that his tenacity is incredible awesome awesome book and human about an awesome awesome human um so you do those years um and then you know what happens when you know 40 people close to you die uh I have to imagine involves a you get pretty good unfortunately at taking what each and every one of those is a tragedy and and just continuing yeah so um let's just talk about that for a bit if if you're willing yep so um guys are getting shot and blown up and you're close with them to to say the least and what was your role in the in the aftermath like like how what do you do you you you go to a funeral you you you um toast a few beers and then you go back to work I mean it's that's kind of you know in the most simplistic terms Andrew that is exactly what happens um there's obviously you know a lot more that goes on but if you script the diary so to speak it's it wasn't you know a funeral every 3 months but on average if I averaged out because I've done this in you know Excavating the last few years we were at a funeral or Memorial effectively every 90 days and um in that time period but it wasn't obviously you know that simple like for for me and our family Doug was my first super close teammate killed and it wasn't in the teams right I'm now at the command I was back from Afghanistan from Kandahar this is way before the Marines built up 100 kilometers west of Kandahar we were operating six of us with like 180 Afghans kind of the wild west back then and Doug was killed that summer of ' 07 and and I got a phone call from a friend I was standing in my kitchen in Virginia Beach and it was like like the whole scaffolding of the world was just gone because at that age and here I am like I'm some kid I was in my I was in my 30s but I'm thinking you know things get more and more serious as you go like at that time but when Doug was killed and I was a Paul Bear in his funeral and you know we came up to Anapolis he was living in Anapolis cuz he was working it's it's now been publicly released which is nice for Pam because she can talk about it more he was working at the agency and um when after his funeral and just the days around that and then I go back to work and what I mentioned earlier about Doug and what I knew about him just as an operator he had been a company commander in fujia he was on the front page of the LA Times like Tony Perry is a reporter in San Diego he was in fuia following Doug the guy was and Doug is not a like a public people people just attracted to him to tell his story um I have so many stories that I heard later from his bosses his regimental Commander you know told stories about his unit in fuia his sergeant major and his amazing guy I've talked to him about like what went on in fuia Doug is just a Legend I mean he was awesome and the dominant thought after his funeral was if things it's not that you don't think they're serious and I and I mean just about life Andrew it wasn't just about Combat Action and hard deployments it was about if Doug can be killed all bets are off they're all off like if I didn't respect the rules before and didn't think Society was particularly ordered in a way that I respected you know that I think is made up I knew when Doug was K that it's all made up like he was supposed to be the immortal one and if he's not none of us are like everything has to be re-evaluated you know how old was I was 32 and and you've got kids at this point yeah yep um yeah olly wasn't born yet my youngest because you you now have three boys yeah three boys 21 18 and 14 and um the older two were born my my middle son was two at the time and did it occur to you at the point when Doug was killed or maybe some other point that you know at some point you could die oh I mean that's what I mean Andrew like I you know personal work and therapy afterwards it it was then that I started looking over my shoulder just in general like everything was suddenly like has to be watched with a Vigilant eye something that um close friends close male friends of mine have told me um these are friends that are married with kids um and I've heard this from people that were in the military and and as well as those that weren't was that it was very important to them to marry somebody who were they to die they knew their kids would be well taken care of oh that one's not even there's no question about that yeah so um that that was a like a primary criteria and I think in your line of work I mean that that must be especially important because the the probability of of dying is well let's face it is is much higher as as my uh sister who doesn't like sharks once told me she said you know the best way to not get eaten by a shark is never go in the ocean you know there is a way to limiting probabilities she'll swim in the ocean a little bit but but the point being that when you're in the military and your your uh shoot move and communicate is a big part of the the job description and the uh the enemy is also taught to shoot move and communicate that there's there's a decent probability that you could die so um did you ever think okay well if I die my kids are okay because Bridget's solid or were you still just operating on this 24-hour schedule that you had adopted way back in the seventh grade no I think well maybe I'd have to ask her that question um I think I was backed away from the 24-hour ledge a little bit MH I I knew that the boys obviously would be taken care of with my wife like that was never even had never crossed my mind probably until you just asked the question that was almost just like table Stakes mhm um back to this adaptive but maladaptive behavior when Doug was killed I just realized I had to work even harder to try to stay alive because if you met the guy there is I'm going to say it probably multiple there is not a human on the planet that was as tough and as focused and as hyper dialed in to how to do the job 100% effectively as he was and it happened to him you know and it I just never it it's almost embarrassing and to say I never thought about it like that until Doug was killed and and yet and I'm not challenging that at all of course uh I mean life circumstances the other team gets a vote too totally right I mean I mean somebody can be um seemingly indestructible oh so capable and talented and get T-boned in an intersection and die right like like that yeah we've known people like that all of us you know you hear these things that's why they're called tragedies yeah we just just like to put it in context we have to remember is part of the beauty of taking a young person and taking all the ingredients that a person comes into Special Operations pick your service I'm not I'm agnostic I mean some of my best buddies are army and Marine Corps like I'm agnostic to the service head is it when you end up at a certain point like and you look back you realize for 10 or 15 years I've been indoctrinated in a very adaptive way to believe that I'm Immortal because if you didn't you certainly wouldn't jump out of aircraft at 25,000 feet with no lights and you for hell for sure wouldn't go into some of these towns we go into and end up in these firefights like you have some weird I'll speak for myself I was entirely convinced that I couldn't be killed and I I just because I was in some way Andrew convinced that our training was so good that that wouldn't happened to us let's take a step back for a second and acknowledge the the truth uh all around that set of statements which is that um I think most people can think of the government and the training programs as um honing the body but um it's probably not lost on you at this point in your life that the you were you're a weapon your mind became a weapon right your your body became a weapon um uh you were a weapon of the military from the inside out and the statement you just made encapsulates that y um and that weapon honed itself for a long time but then that's what the military is it creates weapons and of out of humans and I'm not demonizing the military whatsoever I want to be very clear I realize that statement could be construed differently but um but that mindset encapsulates that so um so with the other guys I want to make sure I finish your question so it started with Doug and then you know I don't know what direction you want to go here specifically but then it just kept going Andrew right like at that time Doug was 07 and then we went to Iraq in the winter of 0708 which was complete Mayhem and the troop was I mean my my troop in the winter of 0708 were like superheroes and a guy named Tommy Valentine was the troop Chief and we got home and he was killed in a parachute accident after all that we went through Badger a guy named Mark Carter was killed in that deployment we got home and Tommy was killed in a parachute accident and me and a guy named Dutch we went up to Minnesota to notify Tommy's parents and his sister and his brother and we're not the Navy calls him Kos like casualty assistance officers these are jobs in the military where you're trained to do this stuff you know one of the things that's amazing about us is if a guy gets killed we send a team guy there but think about the team guy like it's great for the family that you send the team guy but we don't know about sitting with a family who's about to be notified that their son in this case of Tommy was killed Brit went to Christina's house lab Brit slinsky he went to Christina's house and me and Dutch went up to Minnesota and I'm shaking right now like I was shaking the whole drive we had to get to International Falls all way up North The Valentines are incredible people and I I mean notifying a family was just it was brutal and so this is this is the this is' 08 and then it just keeps coming it's Nate and it's Mike and it's Lance and it's extortion in 2011 and in the middle of that Adam gets killed right like tons of people know about extortion because it was a helicopter obviously full well maybe we just just briefly want to mention that was August 2011 as I recall yes yeah August of 11 yeah so but in 2010 Adam is killed and I got a phone call and and I wasn't best friend I mean Adam had some very close friends as to command that I I don't want to make some anybody give the impression that like me and Adam were boys we were we knew each other well right we went through green to him together he was in a different Squadron though so you sort of get separated a little and I got a phone call in the middle of the night from one of my buddies who's still in who is is another Legend and um I answered the phone and it's midnight I knew something was wrong and we were kind of in this pattern then and you're like actually a few of the commands were like our partner command and a bunch of other guys we work with in other units it was a hard time like guys were fighting hard overseas and um that just comes with the consequences we know you know and I get the phone call the middle of the night I'm like and so this guy tells me you know get your uniform you need to come in something happened and I'm like I know what happened like tell me who it is and and they you know didn't want to say it over the phone which I get and uh I I had like one of those moments where I told him no I I can't I can't do that again like you have to get somebody who knows what the they're doing and he just didn't let me off the hook you know get your and come come into the command because you got to do all this prep stuff and um I walked into the conference room I mean I remember clear's day Andrew I walked into the conference room and I could see it on everybody's face again this is 2010 now they were more terrified than I was and these arei you know civilian guys guys who retired who are now civilians they work at the command and amazing people and they looked like I don't know if you've seen um Peter Jackson's remake they shall not grow old oh you have to watch it they shall not grow old is Peter Jackson took Real World War I footage oh I did see that yeah he put the color in the lip reading and it and there's a scene I don't know if it's a Battle of the Bulge or exactly there's a scene where um this young unit army unit is about to go up over over the top and you know run across open field and the camera pans over and there's a young kid with his rifle in front of him the bayonet a fixed to it his helmet on his lips are sort of flat and pursed and he everybody in that conference room looked like him when I saw that movie later I'm like every single person looked like him and they told me it was Adam and we were going to go notify Kelly his wife and he had little ones at that point Savannah and Nathan yeah they were small and um we knocked on she had a sort of a stained glass like window and I could see her at the top of the the stairs that was the worst man it was the worst so we sat with Kelly and a bunch of other guys were there of course it wasn't just me and we did our best and I learned later and you know reading Paul's work Dr kti and other people and like that was it dude I was like a um I don't know if it's a locust or whatever that sheds their skin I literally like left a shell of myself on Kelly's front porch and walked out of my skin it was that was tough that was tough and so that was kind of the tempo to answer your question like it wasn't exactly every 90 days but almost every 90 days from ' 06 to 2011 for me I got out in the fall of 2011 it was Memorial at the theater Memorial at the people's house you know and our neighbor across the street in Virginia Beach she lost her husband in ' 07 so one house over so she was best friends with us you know and so you are trying to live two lives you have this military life with all these consequences where every bone in your body is telling you to go full Spartan like know not that the Spartans didn't have families because they did whatever did nothing else like just cut off every other thing in your life completely you have to go do this and you have to do it full on because clearly all bets are off like we're barely making it through we're losing our best guys and how the do I survive if at this pace and so because we're all in the same community in Virginia Beach you're around it all the time when you're home you know and you should be because you're supporting your teammates families and that's important but it was just it's almost like a dream you know when I think about it now how do how did we live like that how does anyone live like that and I know you know my experience as the military people go through you know all sorts of tough situations and different walks of life but I have so much compassion for anybody who's trying to live in an environment like that where you know you are going on the next deployment and you know I mean look Andrew we left bakan in ' 08 before Tommy was killed three weeks later guys are getting blown up in the same area like and they they got all the debrief from us they knew exactly where to go but it was just such a kinetic environment [Music] um we it was almost like you couldn't stop it you know it was just like the balls rolling and when I think about people overseas and you know different situations that countries find themselves in right now um I can feel it for for them you know what they're what it takes it's a it's an intense environment yeah certainly uh that comes through uh I think years ago you said to me um and this will be an important way of of um setting aside uh which side people are on you know whether or not you side with one group in the Middle East or the other you feel for everybody that uh one of the things that you said that really rung in my ears for a long time is that the warriors on both sides in their own minds each and all of them are just doing what they think is right for them and their families totally like you cannot erase that fact like like whether or not the government of this country or the government of that country or group was correct or incorrect whether or not you're even talking about a terrorist cell versus a military a formal military group or Special Operations group that in the minds of the Warriors they're doing what they truly believe is right for them and their families and sometimes country as well and when I heard that it was sort of a you know it's it's sort of an obvious statement on the one hand but it's a very important one I think to the psychology that you know everyone's fighting tooth and nail because they believe that they are right or they're just fighting tooth and nail for whatever reason and that was an important thing for me to hear and I think about that a lot when I see any news stories about International conflict or terrorist military conflict terrorist civilian stuff even people there's something about the human brain people get this into their mind like this is my job and they're doing it doesn't justify it right but going back to this thing of being a weapon yep humans can be trained as weapons and and it's often not the weapons themselves that are making the decisions about where to go and what to do sometimes it is um at this time Coleman what's going on with the three boys with Bridget I mean you're um I mean your boys have turned out really well um amazing they're amazing um and there's no coincidence there and obviously it was a team effort with you and Bridget but you know there are a lot of things about the way the scenario you're describing here that speaks to like how can a home function but obviously it functioned well and um you know it's uh it's remarkable but it can't be due to chance so the were you able to compartmentalize like the moment you hit your front door your dad at home your husband your um and was that a pause in a conversation with your yourself at the front door that's just something that becomes reflexive uh I mean I I think it was just reflexive it wasn't really a pause at the front door and admittedly the story I would like to tell is that I was super Zen about it and I had this process and I would come home and I would take this off and put on regular dad things and I think I was just about by the same level of effort that we put into what we were doing Bridget and every other wife mom at least the ones that I knew they put that level effort in as well it made our home life just very comfortable so it was easy like I didn't have to go through some process right it was it this is how I remember it was easy for me I don't know if it was easy for Bri she would have to answer that question it was easy for me and so I felt like for the most part like I was I wasn't like platoon Commander dad you know some movie you know the great Santini type dad you know I think Pat Conroy GRE WR the great Santini um his dad was crazy apparently it's like that's what he writes about it wasn't like that it was more of this this home is such a relief and Bridget is so dialed that I don't have to unfortunately hard for Bridget I don't have to do anything you know the time that I'm here I can be here and then you know go away again and and so it's as we know what trauma does to the mind like there are many many stretches of that time period that I just don't remember and and and what I do remember is mostly obviously the fun times the front yard the whatever playing with the bo boys um doing rough housing and going on vacation and stuff but the when I was in the grind when we were in the training cycle of our cycle or deployment or whatever I don't really remember sections of it so a lot far too many I guess even one would be far too many uh doorbells ringing on doorbells you decide to get out MH uh was that a conscious decision based on time conscious decision based on like I would like to have the rest of my life you're done I like to call it a regret you know but it's just kind of emblematic of where I was it was the right decision I do not regret getting out at the 13e Mark not for a second it I needed it we needed it as a family um it was a snap it was a snap decision it was like a what do we say 24-hour decision and 24-hour Horizon I was standing on the ledge of the 24-hour Horizon right um and you said what year was that again that was the fall of 2011 2011 yeah okay so that's about four or five years four five years before you and I met yeah so extortion we can just we don't have to touch into it too deeply because people can look it up but this was a a massive loss of Special Operations included a lot of seals um it was basically helicopter shot out of the sky with a uh with a rap with a grenade right yeah RPG RPG um people can look it up if they want to and um there's a lot of material out there about it um it's just can only be described as a tragedy so um and I'm not trying to make light of it I just think you that we could do there's a lot to explore there for in a different discussion um okay so you're out now the probability that you're going to die is much lower provided it's not what my nervous system said right but you're you're out mhm and what do you do meaning what do you do with all that energy the energy of the way you've been operating up until now these intense battle rhythms vampire schedules as you call them but also what do you do with all the energy of what happened you know I think this is where I think our conversation really hopefully has been related to other people as we've been going but that you know sometimes I stop and I'm like I know I'm supposed to process all this stuff you know that's happened but it's like what do you do when so much is happened or When Something's Happened that you know you have to move on from you know you need to compartmentalize but that lives in our nervous system so are you thinking about that no you're Coleman Ruiz at that point you're just uh you're just going forward it's just crazy I mean I just didn't know you know it's 2011 doesn't sound like that long ago but still in 2011 this was not a topic for conversation you know and I took maybe one week to process out I turned in my gear I turned in my badge and my next visit to the command years later I had to be escorted on by people I worked with in the same Squadron like so within a matter of one week I'm a stranger like I can't get on the base I there's reasons for that I get that but I'm just using it as a I mean there was nothing dishonorable about how you went it's just that there's security reason once you're out like you can't just drive on the base anymore you know and this is like emblematic of of course I didn't talk to anybody about it not even Bridget but um at the time in those first call it couple of years or even couple of months I don't know the question you just asked me is the question I was at like what do I do like not with work like what do I do period with life like how do I manage my time and I'm not some bumbling idiot it's not like I was walking around the neighborhood like trying to figure out where my house was I I had just been in that environment for so long to your point that um I didn't know what to do I didn't know what to do with my thoughts my feelings my you know I could go to the Buddhist five Aggregates my thoughts feelings perceptions physical form and kind like all these things I've learned about and thought about later that have helped so much I didn't know what to do with any of it like I didn't know what to do with night sweats I didn't know what to do with I thought the term PTSD was the was the biggest joke on the planet until I read all the symptoms and I'm like wait wait a minute um sounds sounds like sounds familiar and so it's that and was like and so I remember like even the little things that kind of make the point of the big things I didn't know how to get a dentist like just go to the dentist in the military I you know I I thought when I was walking around the food line that somebody was going to call me and say come back to the base because like the bubble went up you just I had zero context and didn't have the c or the not even not even just the courage but know who to ask right it wasn't the mentoring one of the most important books in my life in the last 12 years has been Joseph Campbell's the hero with a thousand faces for the back end of the hero's journey and I haven't read it I know I should I know I should you should actually listen to it to listen to it it's better to I've probably only listened to five audio books in my life I prefer to read in paper because I can take notes in the margin that book is better listen to hero with a thousand faces a hero with a thousand faces could you just highlight a couple of the things that you took from the back end of that um that somehow shifted your mind toward like like cued you I'm thinking Coleman ruy uh Circa 2011 is like like what do I do now and then something cues you there's like a beacon someplace it's like I like a texture something like I want you know you want to feel it more to get a sense of what it is that is that about right it was in that case for sure um so Joseph Campbell wrote that book in 1949 and the her with a thousand faces is effectively the 17 stage Heroes Journey which by the way George Lucas says and has said many times publicly he built the Arc of Star Wars around the 17 stage Heroes Journey he credits Joseph Campbell's book for helping him and if you ever read it or you go through the 17 stages or you see it or watch a short video anybody you'll see how damn near everybody's life which is why it's called the monomyth he describes it as the monomyth or the cosmogonic cycle there's a little weirder term for it um but what he lays out in the book is I don't know maybe supposedly 2,000 years of culture across multiple cultures book is incredibly complicated in that sense Andrew when I so I listen to it audio first I went back to it and listened to it in paper I could not believe how a human could put this narrative together honestly and so but the summary I struggle with the first 10 stages a little bit but it I'll try to come back to them if you if you look at the image when you lay out the 17 stages the way it's in a circle is the Ordinary World and the extraordinary world is on the bottom of the page and there's a horizontal line the diameter of that Circle goes horizontally across and the extraordinary world on the bottom the ordinary worlds on the top okay and so let me talk about the back end of the journey first CU what I was mostly concerned about with when a friend pointed me to that book was my return to the Ordinary World and he told me you Coleman you got to read this book and so the back end of the hero's journey in the return section is three seven stages of the 17 it's the ultimate Boon which is you learned something big in life it depending on everybody learns something where you you sort of realize something big happened to me that's the ultimate Boon and you have this incredible desire to do something with it it's either knowledge or it's experience or whatever and the ultimate Boon you have and you feel like this life thing and then the next stage is typically uh refusal of the return you really don't want to come back to the Ordinary World cuz you feel that there is some level of consequence that maybe you can't handle or somebody won't understand you know or maybe it's too mundane you'll be maybe you'll feel uh a drift totally yeah that and this is in the description of the stages what you just described as part of that description the next stage you're coming up back into the Ordinary World and this return is Magic Flight and the way it's described in you know um myths or in real life is you have to escape that extraordinary world and a and take one more dangerous flight or or sneak away or something is catapulting you to take that ultimate Boon and fight against that refusal you're you're taking Magic Flight amazing and then there is um is it it's it's assistance I think yeah it's like assistance from a um like a special power or something which could be your own or somebody else right and then and then suddenly you're into the last three which is crossing the crossing the return threshold into the Ordinary World master of Two Worlds where you finally realize through help Andor process where you can hold these two opposing life experiences in place and then the very last stage 17 is freedom to live and when you can I'm going to give you my little pet theory in a second when you can work your way through those stages you can have the freedom to live what I realized potentially happen to me just my internal feelings about you know my coming in out of the military and back is if you skip or you don't figure out how to deal with the refusal to return and and you just pick I'm going to call it the next big thing you catapult yourself into a new cycle and you never finish and one of two things has happened you're either two people trapped in the Ordinary World or you're one person trapped in the in Two Worlds I don't know which it is like it's either Two Worlds in one person or it's two people trying to live in one world but gets crazy right because you just haven't done the cycle and it sounds very misul but if you read a here with a thousand faces you're like this journey is not new like this is thousands of years of very typical human cycle now if we go back to the top of the circle let me try to scream through the first 10 which will be very obvious for Star Wars fans just think about what Luke does and I'm not like a super star wars person I've seen the movies but it's a call to Adventure most of us have have a call to Adventure of some sort in our life refuse to call help from a mentor crossing the first threshold the belly of the whale which is described as when you first truly separate this was me leaving for college when you first truly separate from the Ordinary World Road of Trials meeting the goddess Temptations atonement with the Father apostasis which is kind of like dying uh death while you're still alive and then you're into those return stages and when I first read that book Andrew I was like I'm trapped in the return I'm trapped somewhere in the return just emot Al and one of the places that I was absolutely trapped in the return was I didn't have the mentor to help me cross the threshold I knew I had to move on in my life I knew I had learned something extremely valuable I knew that there was a way through because people across thousands of years of humanity have done it I don't think I'm special and I never had the mentor I I got mentor later you know a couple years out um and it reminds me that in the so I got out in the fall of 2011 in the summer one of my very good friends who lives in Connecticut he works in New York he brought me to a lunch at some fancy Club in New York um with a guy named Buddy bua Paul buddy bua who won the Congressional Medal of Honor he's a West Point grad he won the C in Vietnam I've been around a lot of you know famous military people lunch was very normal but buddy was amazing it it was a normal lunch we didn't talk about much like impact we didn't talk about Combat Action or whatever there was a green velvet set of stairs we were leaving the club the upstairs we were coming down the green set of stairs if I remember Buddy's a little bit shorter than I am he reached out his left I was on his left he reached out his left arm I was a stair one stair below him he stopped me I turned to my right to look at him he looked at me he said Son you had have it you know that you have it pts and you're going to have to deal with it and we left I got in a cab and I left and I remember thinking you might have it but I don't because that's the old days like we're we were prepared for this I was still convinced that I'm good like nothing happened to me nothing in the military happened to me that's just normal stuff and all of our training it's a story I told myself all of our training prepared me for that like this the rest of my life is just going to it nothing bad is going to happen because I'm good whatever that meant and when I started to learn more and read more and talk to people who are helping me I remembered buddy telling me that and back to those return stages Andrew it's just incredibly important for me to understand that my journey is not special we are part of a long history of evolution that people go through very chall and I mean the 17 stages in Jose could not be more accurate to like to my life particularly the return and of course if one looked from the outside they would agree with your mindset then and say you're alive MH you certainly done very hard things extraordinary things you're married you got three kids they're thriving PTSD postraumatic stress disorder order uh and things like it CU I don't think any single acronym or diagnosis can capture anything I think Paul kti made that very clear to us in the mental health series these are names by necessity but it's a framework that certainly taught me something absolutely and and and certainly those who haven't been in the military maybe had a seed event of something challenging or whatever it is you know um many people uh struggle with with these kinds of things that live inside them um in the nervous system they pack it down maybe they don't but um that was inside you at that point M I think you and I first got acquainted in somewhere around 2016 when you and some other folks from tier one community and related communities started coming to lab and my lab and I never really talked publicly about my lab has been involved with various things in Canada and the US um not trying to create any Mystique there but it's it's not not a point of Interest what we did and and um but I recall at that time just thinking like this guy's just an amazing team guy but in any event um you know we got to know each other a bit and my since then was like it's like a that's kind of indestructible right you know and now I realize nobody's indestructible we're flesh and Bone but um but if we may let let's let's fast forward a bit um to uh a couple years later um if you're willing to talk about it um maybe talk about some of the uh the evolution that happened so you started working a job MH um you're getting back into civilian life yep and um I recall a conversation about this time of year probably about three year three years ago yeah and you had done what um a lot of uh vets from um tier one operations have done and are now doing which I actually have um mostly uh favorable outlook on which is um there now these are uh I want to be very clear legal and sanctioned explorations of the Psychedelic space right and I remember you called me and you described uh the experience that you had uh had um and some of the connection with Warrior culture that that had helped emerge for you so you could you explain what happened there you know probably the entry Andrew is as important you know meaning it's not all about books but this is actually another thing I've really learned you know I was very intellect and achievement Central and as you can see how easy the emotion comes out now I kind of very frighteningly understand people who like feel stuff a lot more it's a whole other landscape it's miserable well wait yeah it is yet it's I I agree I it's a very uncomfortable space uh you know but we'll get we'll get there it's it's a journey for me let me put it that way so you know there's a bunch of other I'm a vicious reader and I really enjoy it and you know my entree and little window into the world of getting that kind of help came from a lot of different areas um I found in our area a cranos cyal therapist who it still seems like because I mentioned it to people and it sounds Fringe to them it's a very light touch not even Chiropractic like and it's closer to myof fasal type of massage some some tapping very like Ta on the top of the head the part I actually love the most is the back of the neck sort of manipulation is you're lying down relaxed yeah you're clothed super easy in terms of that um couple years of that just because of Athletics I love massage and that's kind of my entree and um so through the body sematics yeah which frankly in many ways is my favorite back to the physical orientation to the world is is what I is what's useful to me um but also I I mean I read Sam Harris's first book end of faith in 2006 and so I've followed him for 15 years religiously read all of his books um lying moral landscape and his I I don't know him personally so public stuff notwithstanding that's not important to me but waking up and I took um I took an online course with Robert Wright who who wrote why Buddhism is true but that's really not what he's known for you know Princeton Professor um he's so funny he's very humorous and I started to work my way into I don't I don't have some like I don't want people think have some like whizbang like spiritual practice that's whatever you know I but it it became very interesting to me Andrew this this I I needed to find I started to realize I needed to find a way to back away from the 24-hour ledge like that Super Hyper Focus I needed to get a little bit of perspective one of my favorite short videos is Richard Fan's pale blue dot I needed to just back away you know that reminds me thank you so much for talking about time space bridging I think the other day yeah we make we I'll cue people to that clip in the caption it's a way of taking oneself out of one's immediate sphere of vision and looking literally looking further out into one's environment and then back again as a perceptual exercise of understanding that as our visual field expands our perception of time also expands um the binning the chunking of time yeah that and my and your conversation years ago about um Horizon and activating the parasympathetic system instead of sympathetic I I just very slowly started to realize I needed to back away from the small picture and the reading and the cranial sacr and massage and I was still not really getting consistent real help but I thought I could do it through educating myself intellectually and um I thought it was time to and it was it has short-term consequences but longterm it's been amazing [Music] to you know deal with the plant medicines in a in a controlled and Cur ated environment and that experience was super safe and quite amazing actually the weekend or the three or four days was super intense but I didn't leave there thinking again I kind of thought I'm good that was great yeah uh couple things um one we've covered psychedelics on this podcast before um I say this not for liability reasons but just to really to emphasize uh for people safety uh to protect them um plant medicines are illegal most places still um this is changing MDMA is uh has been filed with the FDA as a potential treatment it's not yet legal um these things have great power of of he to heal in the right circumstances and they also have great uh potential to harm in the wrong hands or circumstances um people with uh you know potential for psychosis Etc but um with that said um I remember I was on I was driving I was on a phone call with you around this time of year about three years ago maybe it was four but I think it was three years ago and I said what was your experience with um iigame DMT like um and you said you know it was among the most profound experiences of my entire life and I recall you saying that you felt that it had connected you through time to all the warrior cultures that had preceded you not just US military but all Warrior cultures and you sounded great you sounded like better than great you weren't high but you just sounded like man like like something had had had synced up yeah and I thought this is great you know and I hadn't explored plant medicines at least not in a long time because I had done them recreationally as a youth which I do not recommend it took me down a bad path um but and more recently I've explored them in controlled conditions but I thought awesome this work you got this new job you're you're uh you did some um very controlled and again physician assisted abigan DMT uh experiences and you're telling me how great everything was Y and then about I think it was about 3 4 months later I got a very different call yeah and and um if you're willing you know I remember that call um maybe you can tell me about that yeah so I mean this yeah the experience it it was incredibly powerful you know humor is such a powerful way to get through hard times just why laughing yeah but it it really was Andrew I mean to be fair to thousands of years of you know people having experience with these things we often joked about like what poor sucker reached down and grabbed that root for the first time and chewed on it iboga tree boy he found out or she or she yeah to be fair to be fair probably you know some session that wasn't supposed to go that direction and someone chewed on the wrong route but um it was extremely powerful um I've heard that you know the 5 Meo for some people is not much it's like black for me it was just liftoff and um I saw an entirely perfect geometric Mosaic in light blue and white and that was the warrior Culture Connection like that whole 20 minute ride was just something else um as you know I guess I haven't done it noetic is the word no yeah that people use very difficult I don't have the language for it and a couple months later the bottom dropped out yeah and it and I want to talk about that now I I also want to emphasize I know a good number of people that have uh had the same experience you did with aiga and DMT through the veteran solutions group um uh and I know Marcus and Amber Capone very well actually a bill just got passed in Congress that uh Dan krenshaw helped um helped um spearhead to bring funding to use of psychedelics for PTSD treatment in in military um and I should mention because this was interesting to learn that that bill was highly bipartisan if I'm not going to name off the names because if I do there's going to be a lot of cringing screaming and yelling but if it's like if ever there was a bill that was supported from both sides of the aisle with the like the most diametrically opposed names who came together around that funding it's that bill yeah and um just striking it's a and um so is a very bipartisan thing so I will say a number of people uh have been greatly benefited by the veteran Solutions work um but and we can't causally link what happened to you afterwards to that at all there's a lot of contextual stuff um so we're not doing that but we're we're an open book here um and I think that's a great group by the way veteran Solutions is amazing um a few months later you said the bottom dropped out so what happened and when did you start to notice it and then maybe we can talk about that phone call yeah I think um you know looking back Andrew I think a couple things most people who call me about you know friends who say hey should I go do this I initially tell them well 100% of the time I tell them no until until you get I was having this conversation last week with a guy who I never met before you need to stabilize your situation whatever your situation is through some very slow deliberate Dr kti level help because in the case of I'm happy to see that some people they're using just a wider spectrum of on-ramp not the nuclear option to start I can tell you unequivocally abigan and 5 Meo DMT 2 days apart is the nuclear option and it's not right for everybody just I'm not a scientist there's no question that cannot be right for everybody that just doesn't make any sense there's other ways to enter I believe and when you say the cont option well just for those that didn't see the series with Dr Paul K we'll put a link to in the show note captions but uh what Coleman's referring to is talk therapy with somebody highly skilled yes and perhaps also prescription uh medication if that's necessary maybe hormone therapy if that's necessary that's up to the physician but but clearly talk therapy of with a skilled clinician I believe I need needed I don't know what other people need I needed a mentor to help me contextualize what I was coming from and what I'm going to and my experience you know with the plan medicines was it um kicked the door wide open and took that beautiful ice sculpture perhaps at a person's wedding and shattered it on the floor and I was again left alone my fault anybody else's left alone to figure out how to put that ice sculpture back together piece by piece and you my belief is I could have avoided that by having a much more deliberate process so when suddenly the ice sculpture was on the ground and every bit of intellect that I built over you know however long four decades I was I was flat on my back and and as as I told you Andrew and I've been you know really verbal about with so many friends who only want to talk about it in quiet circles which I totally understand and and respect and if you want to talk about in a quiet circle like email the humor life pod podcast and you can give them my cell phone number because I know how important it is to people when they're in that stage is um that was another thing that I never thought was possible for humans it was severe depression severe and and I was so because I guess I just never thought about it again or never had a mentor the shocking thing Andrew was how shocked I was it's like if I had known something like this was real not that I would have listened to anybody if they said it but the most shocking thing was that again this could happen to me and when it did happen I was completely unequipped to deal with I could it took forget how weak forget every other thing in my life it took 10,000x the energy of anything I've ever done in my life before to just put my feet on the ground in the morning I could not PT I couldn't run and you're like I could not function I did function somehow to some level but it was so terrifying I I just have for any one listening who has been through I just have such incredible respect for people who have dealt with it and have learned to get through something like that depression oh yeah or any pick the pick the title right whatever tough situation someone's in emotionally I have such tremendous respect for them because I would have been years ago the guy who like just tighten up your boots and get to it it's not possible like you have to get help from people who care about you and you have to like you have to step back away from the problem set somehow and and work through it you know step by step the one of the most helpful things and I'm so feel so fortunate that I never really had like the chemical dependence thing it was easy for me to stop drinking when did you decide to stop drinking that was it was around three years ago or so is prior to prior to this lapse into depression no no right during yeah right there you just figured alcohol is a bad thing right now yeah and I mean you and I have been friends for a while now do some of the things you and I have discussed and I hear you talk about publicly they were just good reminders you know um one of the things I absolutely hate but I do every day which is wait 90 minutes to drink coffee oh it's the worst I cannot tell you how much of a difference that's made in my energy throughout the day and the drinking was similar you know I I like look I'm just going to drop it for a couple weeks and then suddenly my sleep's better my fitness is better you know so you know we all even my friend you know you chat about stuff oh what are you doing at this age you I'm approaching 50 that helps you stop drinking everything else like all the other recommendations come second at least for me um was that pretty easy for you to do because I know there's a big culture of drinking in the teams yeah I was just lucky so um so my point there is you know the just the respect I have for people who who work through stuff like that and I was going to say the reason I referenced to drinking is because I started reading a lot about the 12 Steps AA I've never been to AA meeting but the the Simpson the PTSD in the 12 Steps like oh my God this is me like I need to go through these steps in my own way not for you know not for drinking but for whatever this low grade the way I've described it is you know the Buddhist obviously call Dua it's unsatisfactoriness this low grade irritation that I carry around every day um the one amazing thing that that couple of months did for me and the way I describe it visually is if someone cut me from neck to belly and filleted open my chest and took a propane torch and scorched me from the inside and then put me back together and said start over that's how it felt that's literally how it felt I mean I could not believe Andre and you can obviously you know Dr kti can articulate this better I couldn't believe how emotional pain could be so physically painful that whole experience again the shocking part was the shocking part I just I I just didn't think it was real and so then when it was and I'm like how many things do I have to deal with you know and I realize everybody deals with a lot of stuff and um it was challenging and then slowly you know it got better and better and um guys like you know friends very close friends a very very small tight group were and what people do when you finally tell them and you think oh this guy's gonna he's never going to talk to me again they do the opposite they rally immediately for you you know and then guys that aren't in your inner circle necessarily helping directly and they're in the neck Circle cuz now it's very weird it's back to like the feeling thing I can not 100% of the time but a lot of guys in my community if I speak to them and they're in a bad spot I can detect it within 5 Seconds just the tonal and kind of like the tempo and when you tell that ring of people not your super Inner Circle they dump it immediately as soon as you open the door they're like hey man I had a couple of tough like months you know boom they're right in for the most part they open up Y and that really scares me Andrew because I know like if we need if we need to flip the switch this afternoon like we can flip the switch meaning meaning like I can go to Old School 20 you know 15 years ago that that's that's what you and I have discussed in the past has kind of come back to you know the fighter mentality is the the problem with that the hardcore intense focused that's easy like it's so easy to do that tough stuff that's easy this is the hard part and that's what you know was so challenging it was to go to people who normally we do you know the yeah yeah let's do this let's do that let's do something crazy and okay well tell that same person who you've built Persona identity you know around them and with them to like you're this guy and then you have a tough spot now you have to go tell them the opposite like I'm really not doing well it's terrifying it is terrifying and I uh but I I second W with with both arms um your statement that when we actually open up to somebody trusted uh hopefully a friend or somebody close to us but like some people go to clergy or AA or any any number of the different uh resources and those resources really are out there at zero cost they really are there if one one has to look a little bit sometimes a lot unfortunately but they're there um my experience has always been and and in observ in others that um there's something about the human spirit that wants to help totally and sometimes that help comes from somebody who's really been through it but even if somebody hasn't been through it there's something in our nervous system that sees real pain in somebody and contrary to what we think they don't judge and think that everything that the person who's hurting was before was a fraud the contrary they they see it as a as an act of strength mhm and but it feels like like hell to reveal that it feels if and I totally agree I think all the tough stuff all the um anything physical is is like a fraction of the emotional pain and I thank you for highlighting the the physical aspect of of emotional pain especially if one isn't accustomed to it if one isn't accustomed to it [Music] um if you're willing you know how bad did it get I mean the call you we had suggested it was bad I I sometimes refer to a line and I I'd be lying if I didn't admit that I've seen that line a few times in my life I've been right up next to it a few times and now if I ever see it I know to do many things when it first comes into my my uh my visual sphere um the line of course being that the point at which one is considering taking their own life y something that happens far too often even once is far too often and we've sort of skirted around this topic after all the wartime stuff and the gunfights and people dying in the doorbells been a lot of friends of yours and some of whom I know but most of whom I don't but two this year uh who continue to kill themselves to put it bluntly where were you at with respect to that line because depression is one thing there's mild depression there's severe depression there's recurring depression there's Manic and on and on and on but ultimately that's a thing that uh hopefully everyone's seeking to avoid um and it's a yeah how close were you I would say that was probably I really want to say one day and the truth is it was one day it lasted one day being that close to the line but it only takes a moment to go that's the scary thing right it's and it probably lasted a couple of weeks but there was only back to the budge thing like I never thought about quitting I thought about it one day um what was the thought I don't it was I mean sort of like the classic sympoms andreww I I was up all night sweating and shaking and um it's back to the shock of it it was okay I actually was able to step like one of two things is happening either I am fundamentally bad there's no way you can feel this bad and be good so one of two things is happening like I'm just bad a bad person which I know is not true or something bad got inside of me that I have to get rid of and I don't know how to get rid of it and so sweating shaking you know up at 3: in the morning and legitimately thinking this is just the scariest thing and for anybody in the situation um you think with every ounce of your being that people are better off without you and then somehow thankfully Through Chemistry neurobiology past learnings um I stepped back away from that very quickly but the feeling of putting me up to that line didn't go away I just intellectually was able to is kind of where the maladaptive behaviors you know back to training work in your favor which is I'm not quitting like this can't be just me even though it did feel like just you I mean you suddenly become the core of the entire existence of the universe you think like you're it you know but in the negative side of it not the Adaptive side of it um because the pain is just so extreme and um but I was able to back away from it and then over I'm so grateful to so many of my friends I can't imagine how many hours if we collect up those hours how much time I spent with them on the phone um and one of my in the like in those really hard weeks maybe a little bit after that in one of my buddies I was actually was talking to him yesterday because I had time in the car um the tough love side of it at when you're feeling that poorly is a little tricky like I wouldn't I probably wouldn't deliver tough love unless I really thought the person could handle it I think it's you got to really deal with with kid gloves at that Mo those moments um but one of my buddies told me if you do something to hurt yourself you will have proven to every person who knows you that you are a liar and a fraud everything you've been about your whole life is a fraud and Andrew I was we were on the phone I was like whoa my God he just went 10 ring I mean dead center and it that was a pivot like that really helped me a lot that's what you needed I mean I I don't I don't know that that's what I would have needed um I recall when we spoke uh because I obviously not professionally trained in any of that I just remember thinking how do I put in this this into language that Coleman's going to understand and I just said you know I think uh your goggles are I know one thing for sure which is that your goggles are foggy so you got to so you have to Outsource your decisions now I think you might have also told me to Outsource my identity mhm and and that helped a lot because um it was that idea of you at Foggy goggles you're clearly like not on stable ground everything you believe about yourself just let it be the spokes of a wheel that somebody else can hold for you for a period of time I was like well I can do that and then my other buddy I didn't want to be a liar and a fraud I was like I can do that and yeah I I mean I'm grateful for the opportunity but you know unfortunately had a few circumstances where people close to me were at at that edge and and i' I'd be lying if I say I've been at that edge so I knew where I had some sense of where you were at um and under those conditions I don't think there's a Playbook I mean obviously when people are have a plan and they're thinking about implementing that plan that those people need to be put under protection from themselves um Ely didn't come to that yeah and you know a few friends just did the basics Andrew which was I really wanted to talk to you at that time because I knew you would give me some advice you know I was so uncertain about just the I'll just say the chemistry but the chemistry and neur like something is not right yeah uh and you know different friends offered different and some friends just sat and listened to it allh and when I think back it's like I would take a bullet for them cuz I just took it you know you know and let me offload it it's it's an amazing experience for let people help you which I was never willing to do no and you were we have to highlight something that might have been overlooked earlier because we went through it quickly but that you were you know you're a commander of a unit so you're head of a family I know Bridget's also head of family there's a there's a trade you go back and forth right exactly um but you're used to you're used to Leading and and protecting others and um like I think it's awesome that you're um able to have access that that uh raising your hand asking for help you have to it's it's it's such a it it's such a a a sign of strength and skill and doesn't and it feels like the exact opposite in the moment the exact opposite and then we go to these narratives like oh if I've ever done that in the past people didn't help that you know we come up with a million excuses but in the end it's it's it it's such a PO a thing of strength to do that um so you did ratchet yourself out of that very very dark hole slowly and um I I I want to place this in the context of this uh hero's journey would you see that you talk about that the Magic Flight the you're against you're like the refusal you won't go back but so was accepting it seems that there was that some pieces of you needed work yeah that there was this PTSD this gentleman that you mentioned yep saw that and you refused to kind of deal with it and so shine a light on it and um God the universe whatever your beliefs are um forced you to see it Y and you went to the very bottom but not out the bottom yep what was the process of putting things back together I mean really I mean a lot of it Andrew was cutting I so as a practical matter I mean I'm going to go just go back to regular therapy because I don't that I mean my therapist is amazing she so you're you at what point did you enter quot talk therapy immediately then so you got a quote unquote therapist because oh yeah yeah I mean effectively you know Bridget n and multile at some point it was it was Bridget was like this is this is it like full-time help effective immediately and I knew it was necessary but if if I'm really honest like I would have avoided it I would have somehow like tried to gut through the situation without like full-time help and I mean once a week therapy yeah so the idea of sitting down with somebody and talking about past present and maybe some ideas of future was was worse to you than jumping out of plane at 3,000 ft or going into a gunfight not even close not even close and hearing yourself say that D you realize how how ridiculous well how how um untrue that must be at the physical level but but the the nervous system doesn't know as to quote uh Dr pa kti um the lyic system that it experiences or or creates this sense of fear and dread doesn't know the clock or the calendar if it's like if you go the meaning if you experience that there's the idea that it's going to go on forever I think that's the fear that's correct yep that's exactly right thank you for saying that it the fear was this will go on forever um but so yes it that I just did not want to you know back to Bessel Vander when I read this word in his book body keeps the score Lexia if that's a real thing where you can't put um language to you know what's going on um I didn't want to put language to it I couldn't I I just didn't feel like it like I just felt like gutting through it and then I got you know once a week therapy amazing people and I don't know Andrew the first three months was you know I mean gutting through I just couldn't I couldn't seem to shed that emotional like burden of pick the category of stuff from the last to say 20 years it was just and but it was all I couldn't stop it from coming out and obviously that's a good thing and so that just continued and every day got and when I say in this is the tough part for at least me and I know a lot of guys like me the gains are minuscule you know but things improved slowly but surely were there ever moments where you felt you were drifting backward not really and that's that was nice you know you see that there's some install you know plateaus um you don't have to share this but would because I'm a believer that talk therapy can be very effective certainly that's my experience it's I wouldn't be here if it weren't for for two in particular amazing um people who really help me along the way but um in that way but I do think there's a place at times for pharmacology to assist the process sure um I know nowadays people hear ssris and they demonize those that that wasn't uh I'll come clean so um and then maybe if you feel like it you can uh I hit a a bout of depression in my during my postdoc did a a short run of well buin BR buproprion which is more of the dopaminergic noradrenergic Y agonism mostly adrenaline nergic um it really helped it nuked my memory at the dosage they suggested um which meant I had to take a very low dose and then eventually I came off and I think that that's one thing I learned from Ki which is that most of these medications were designed to help people get over a bump as opposed to be taken continuously some people need to take them conv I I have been able to be away from that for a long time but but I think Pharmacology can help oh yeah I think I'd have to go back and look four months maybe of pretty low dose of Wellbutrin thanks to okay that sounds yeah that's about right yeah thanks to my buddy Jimmy you know I called him and asked him what he thought and he said well you use a gun site on your weapon don't you and you use glasses if you can't see no I need reading glasses you need glasses if you can't see right it's like take the warb man chill like just get it get some space back to the SpaceTime bridging concept just get back away from the danger for a few months that really helped and that's very different than the backing away from the danger with say alcohol or or drugs and and look I my stance on cannabis is some people can use it safely most people probably cannot but some can but there's something different about the drugs that have a addiction potential or the drugs that disrupt sleep like ultimately if you look at people who commit suicide and I've spent a lot of time with this literature in almost every case in the preceding weeks there's a disruption in sleep schedules meaning disrupted from what they were doing prior to that when they were not feeling suicidal so so then you think about alcohol disruption of sleep even if you think you're sleep sleeping and like it's there's a story like a common theme starts to emerge um so you stabilize sleep you were getting some um dopamine and neurogenic assistance from the low dose rutrine and you're basically also just you're just letting it all out yep with a therapist with a therapist and the thing that strikes me as to your point about my resistance to the therapy versus jumping out airplanes or whatever the most important people in my whole life since day one have been people that have helped me coaches parents friends boom Doug work colleagues the guys that I work for now like other you you have all these people helping you and then you hit this thing that's so unusual I'm like I don't want anybody to help me and I don't want to tell anybody about it it's like what is that Andrew that was the it's like what is that and and it's not like I wasn't in these environments where I've been coached and mentored I I've had coaches and mentors on my ass my whole life like instructors you know it's a nonstop and I I don't know like I couldn't I just couldn't do it until I did it and then and you know it's been a process since and I'm super grateful for it and I don't know where we are in the journey but in terms of like the hero's journey but I hope I'm at Freedom to live some version of it because with my re this is dangerous cuz I only say this like with my really really really close friends I know was going to more people in my CL I feel like a completely different person and none of that stuff really ever goes away it's all a process right and I'm never going to stop the process but I don't even recognize myself in some ways anymore and that's been a good thing because in those times when I was just on the 24-hour Horizon sometimes I just did not know what the was going on other than exactly what I was doing you know and it's just an odd experience to be in a different place and it's scary to know that without that experience and without people really kind of forcing me to get help and things forcing me I might be doing the same stuff which is a hard way to live you know or worse or worse you might not be here or Worse which has happened to many of our buddies you know and I want to go like retroactively hug them and collect them up in like a net and say guys just stop for a second you know like we it doesn't it doesn't have to go there um yeah I feel that the yearning in that statement uh I I suffer from a terrible um very destructive debilitating um desire to travel back into time and fix things it's like it's like I know I don't have my my graduate advisor who un unfortunately all three of my graduate advisor are dead but she used to say um my time machine's broken yeah anytime I'd raise something if you know that the could have would have should have my time machine's broken and and we know that but I listen I felt that statement in every cell of my body it's clear you would but you're also in sharing this this experience and this information you're you're you're doing that now in what we call biology in the interrog grade fashion and you know somebody many people are going to hear this and and cue to the the recognition of what's happening to them hopefully before they get to that line yeah you have to and you just got to tell somebody you know it's like it's crazy how simple that is Andrew I mean months like I can't tell anybody I can't tell anybody well well and maybe we drill into this a little bit deeper because I think that this really speaks to the the the global experience of of Being Human where unlike a physical wound where you know if you see bone exposed you're like this is pretty serious you know we all have different thresholds for what we can tolerate in terms of pain and and seeing ourselves wounded we all don't have to decide what's the difference between hurting and injured but when it comes to psychological stuff we don't know you know we also are dealing with a a world now where some people feel psychologically injured by everything you know so that's the extreme there but what we're I think I think um what comes through and I think people need to perhaps highlight in their minds is when something's kind of nagging or scratching at you Beneath The Sur that voice what do you think that voice is I call it the lowgrade pain okay for me it it was there was a lowgrade just slight hot burning starting in ' 07 probably before that but it was for me it was a weird mix and of like an uncertainty a seeking a this just doesn't feel right like it has to be fixed there has to be an intellectual and achievement way to sort of get around this is where the Buddhist writing and thinking really helped me a lot there has to be a way around this lowgrade unsatisfactory somehow my sense for me and I'm obviously not you know the Dr kti in the room just because of all the things I've learned how it it it it just had to be the this constant I'll use the word trauma but for me it was it was like something had to happen to our system obviously it does something happens to our system that is a little bit of a there's a shock there boom and then a buddy gets killed and then you it's not even always with that then you have extreme firefight or you know close call and then it's just boom boom shock shock shock shock it's almost like getting TBI for the nervous system it's just a constant High it to me it always felt like that constant highend now if you keep going perhaps if you never recognize any of it and you just keep jacking the dopamine and the adrenaline your whole life maybe you can just never recognize it but for me when I shut the engine off and I decided it's not really how I wanted to live and I was trying to work out of that low grade whatever I was residue that I was left with it was like every time I came from home home from deployment I would get sick that night like I would have a fever that night headache and fever and um I tend to get sick at the end of the year last two years it was Christmas this year it was Thanksgiving and um you know bridg and I always joke about it it's because I slightly turn the engine down a little and then the you know the immune system yeah that's the way it works everyone thinks stress depletes the immune system and indeed it can yeah but if you think about it in evolutionary adaptive you know ways go go go go go allows you to saave off the infection or at least to not have the symptoms of combating infection and then when you relax a little bit go on vacation boom you get sick which is not to say constantly stress but um you need to modulate right you got to modulate but when you're on deployments you don't have the option you're in gunfights every yeah so as soon as you turn it off you get sick right but in for me in this particular instance what do I think it is I think it was all of those experiences at once turning the generator all the way off or the electric panel fully off and then it just all came out well for people or anyone listening who is facing that feeling that underlying feeling or who is um challenged with like a breakup a loss of a loved one fear about the future languishing because they don't know what the future holds or the feeling that quote unquote so much has happened or some combination of those five things where do you think the healing process starts I hope again back to the hero's journey I hope hope for every single person that it's not a rock bottom moment but it seems like if you follow a lot of enough people and you hear enough stories um you talk with Dax right Dax shepher yeah he talks about it nonstop like unfortunately I think a version of bottom is where the process starts all the people I know the stories they tell me the process started when they hit some version of bottom what's the quote that I love is um you don't change until the pain of staying the same is worse than the pain of change yeah Amen to that um I have experienced that more times than I would like to admit and that brings me actually to this more macroscopic question my understanding of the hero's journey from obviously I haven't read or listened to the book is that we don't complete this cycle and then rest at the Ordinary World where we are um uh living in Bliss and peace forever we actually have to go around that wheel over and over and over again hopefully not going to Bottoms that put us our lives in danger but um it is not a a process in which we we ever really get to cruise so let's Orient Coleman ruy in that cycle um you seem to have returned to the Ordinary World um for those listening and not watching you've been whenever you describe the uh the feeling of getting through but also the that people assisted you you smile MH as friendly a guy as you are I think in the first three years I knew you I didn't see you smile once that's probably true I didn't see you smile once I just thought like and these like dear one team guys they're they're serious they're locked in they're locked in but um you smile a lot now yeah so I think you're back in the Ordinary World mhm um what are the things you're watchful for um like like you're not drinking you pay attention to your sleep you always trained you always did it you call it PT but physical training yeah yeah I Train Cycle run MH swim lots of kettle bells yeah every morning uh I train probably five out of seven days and the two days that I don't train I'm in I have a sauna at my house I'm in sauna at least for an hour mhm it's so funny how uh Team guys talk about getting into cold or getting in the sauna like it's just a regular thing like they they don't they never post it to social media for them it's just it's part of the routine yeah but I say that because I think a lot of people think it's like this esoteric biohacking thing wrestlers and and uh people in the military are accustomed to like sauna cold sauna cold just like cardio lifting weights it's not this esoteric thing no no I mean I think on average there's a sauna in Finland for like every single person in the country so we didn't invent some amazing recovery process by doing SAA right what do you think um what do you think it is about physical movement that helps the Mind obviously it's not it's I consider it necessary but not sufficient like you you need to do the talk therapy the working through the writing the reading the inpe the talking to other people maybe pharmacology but it's it does seem to be so important for resetting us what do you think it is about physical movement I mean since it might go back to John Rady's little anecdote and Spark you know the SE squirt I guess swims around then as soon as it does whatever it needs to do it just dies when it stops moving oh yeah when the so the SE squirt is this uh aquatic animal uh apia as it were that that when it um lands on a on a rock and stops moving it actually digests its own nervous system that movement uh is the great Nobel prize winning scientist sharington that said that movement is the final common pathway that movement is the way that the nervous system tells the brain and rest of nervous system that it's still needed here on Earth Earth H which I like it's it's like a it's like a a it reminds us of our own utility yeah in a neural way I mean whatever that is Andrew right the chemistry and the neurobiology of it all this goes back again going back to seventh grade I was at the end of the Rope on the detentions and the suspension and I have this very clear memory that before my dad got home like I ran laps I don't know how many but a lot around the block and by the time he got home I was like whatever my punishment is I'm good like I'm not worried about it that physical activity for me all the time I don't want to overdo the runner's high thing but whatever that is that's what I think it is like when I'm in motion or my heart rate's up for the most part everything's fine and I'm clearheaded and I cannot be again dropping and drinking I can't be lethargic and sit around like I have to you know take care of myself in that regard um I watch my sleep super close if it gets past 10:30 I'm in like a full-blown panic I need to get to a pillow the the basics like I don't do anything crazy really um you eat what you want no no I would say on the neurotic scale of things that's probably my most extreme there probably a little bit of cutting weight kind of like eating disorder issues if I was guessing not that extreme you eat meat vegetables yeah yeah yeah but I'm I'm a really light eater I eat like a bird and probably eight times a day maybe more um eight times a day oh easily I'll have you know I'll thanks to you I'll wait an hour and a half to have coffee which is miserable um you're welcome but oh it's amazing thank you it's helped me so much well you know I I take some some uh some for it because some people say do I have to well if I train first thing then I'll have my coffee first thing it was really to stay the afternoon crash but a lot of people find that experiencing that natural wakeup and look it's 90 minutes it's not it's not like cutting out for two days or two weeks or Michael Paul and I think quit coffee I was like why the world would you do that yeah why in the world um I love coffee love yber M always have um from from from first sip which by the way I had my first gourd of M Caffe mon when I was four there's a picture of me and my grandfather's up that's hilarious Argentine side yeah so but the the point here is that um you know these practices these things I think they involve a little bit of discipline but they they they really can't have an outsized effect I think oh my goodness yeah the it's incredible I mean the eating thing and then maybe you know one more mental thing in this regard um I'll probably have maybe an avocado in the morning and then two hours later maybe one hour later I'll have sliced cheese and apple and then so you're a light Grazer really light I probably have the smallest plate at dinner in my house um we've always been in great shape like visually you always you're tall you're lean you're strong yeah yeah I I think we're realizing now that you can still train on uh you have to be like gorging oneself with calories yeah especially now right like we're both approaching 50 it's actually surprising how much I've discovered we can do on how few calories and I'm not trying to like test it some crazy way but then just eat throughout the day and you know macro life experience Andre I just cut a bunch of extra out of my life big end little things like I don't I try to just do my job and you know do a good job at it and hang out with my people friends and and family and uh all the extra Shenanigans like I'll maybe do you know I was always doing some big race or some big mountaineering Adventure or I was just piling stuff into my schedule I might do One race in like in the spring everything else is casual I work really hard at it I like cycling a lot it's one of my favorites and go hard but I'm not trying to race cat too or you know win some event or that release of extra in my life has been as big as anything else and your boys presumably take some time and attention and you're they're great yeah uh um son's a runner for University level Runner um a lot of our conversation gets to some kind of core uh features of Being Human and the psychology of Challenge and thinking one is or others are invincible discovering that none of us are invincible but that we are renewable you clearly illustrate that uh there's a there's clearly a message that everyone is gleaning from this many messages but um like what if any revision uh or um adaptation do you think we need of of the concept of of being a a man growing oneself into a man you know I'm not a gender studies sociologist psychologist neuroscientist but setting all the the sociology and the the nomenclature aside like if you had a short list of things like seems like you believe that it's important to be able to do hard things mhm but sometimes those hard things are not the hard things that you are uh we think they are like sitting down and telling one story being more terrifying than than going into gunfights overseas yeah yeah I mean funny that the Prelude a little bit is I'm not a gender study scientist either a sociologist I stay away from most of the conversations you know um their Barbed Wire yeah they just people seem to be so overactivated over stuff it's very odd um but for me in my life experience Andrew it's range like to use David Epstein's book title right it's range um and I've noticed this so much because of parenting and watching my boys grow into men if I think about come back to range if I think about myself at 177 or 18 not my parents not my coaches unless I really wanted it you could not tell me what to do you can't tell me what to do now like if I want it I love the mentoring and the teammate ship and the things that get you where you want to go but if it's something I don't want to do I'm not doing it you know no matter what and so if I think about that in terms of being a dad or manhood is let's take it back to my kids like I think one of the most important parts of my job is to release the grip and take the reins off and just barely keep them inside the boundaries of a alive you know because they're going to make all their own decisions anyway and they have to right and so I think a big part that I see and I saw myself a lot for years was we grip sometimes as men like we are so afraid of losing control in an already uncontrollable world that we overgrip everything and I over gripped everything and suddenly when I'm not over gripping stuff things are going better and um when it comes to range it's okay for me it's okay to have your tough guy moments your fighter mentality moments I would never want to lose that because no matter how much help I get when I'm out with my family or my wife or my boys my head is on a swivel and if somebody touches them it's curtains and we need to keep that because that is just a part of life like you have to be you cannot move through life with blinders on like there are people who are not good people and it's okay to have range and have that in your toolkit what I don't think is okay to do is to let that slice of the traditional whatever you want to call it aggressive manhood be your whole life like that's just not functional you know it's not good for relationships it's not good for Parenthood so every other little tool you can put in that toolbox that takes you all the way over here to what we might consider oh Coleman's he's soft now no no don't mistake my kindness for weakness there's a category for everything and I think that makes you such a much more complete person um it's made me a more complete person it's it's difficult I feel like I'm brand new at being able to do other things in my toolbox like you and I like this part's easy I'm go jump to that in a nanc this part over here of normalizing you know life across across a whatever 8090 is it's really hard to sort of excavate the normal but that's what I think we need to do you know I mean it's okay to be kind and calm and gentle and you know that's there's nothing wrong with that and I'm guessing the word surrender probably held a far different meaning for you in the past but a lot of what you're describing is surrendering to the realities of life that we can't control everything and and just how painful it is to to undergo that surrender and and here I'm talking to myself too it's been it's a process I'm still deeply involved in you know somebody who's tried to you know go rung over rung as best I can doesn't Andrew speak to our like Evolutions like that is so difficult at least for me and guys like me I'm putting you in my group here that is so hard to do like that just tells me more about the evolution of our male system like that part's so easy and this part is not so easy but man it's a it's a battle to remind myself you know slow down listen just the basic you don't have to go attack every problem like a fist fight it's tough it is tough and I think that the more that I uh resist surrender the more that um well I believe in God so I'll just say God but God the universe or whatever it is for people but for me more that God places me in circumstances that make the the uh the act of surrendering harder like if I would just do it on my own it wouldn't have to be so hard I wouldn't have to good friend of mine um I've been mentioned by name Tim Armstrong he just said like you got to hit every branch on the way down you know he was he telling me I had to you know he's like you're a stubborn punk rocker you have to and he was talking about himself too like there's certain there's certain phenotypes where we have to but but like the universe just screams out um you don't have to you can actually just like lower yourself down on a rope to the ground and walk away but but then there's that stubbornness but I think that the stubbornness is has its uh evolutionary adaptations too and and the hero's journey nothing in the hero's journey says that the transitions between these different states are linear no are of equal duration are of um certainty only that they exist and that there's no way as you point out before to skip steps you can't skip yeah I couldn't skip if somebody skips Ian like you hit every BR nobody skips and and whether or not somebody tries to skip through psychedelics or through being the toughest or through the acquisition of money or just focusing on family you know family obviously is super important but but that's not going to accomplish the other aspects of of the of the journey it's a huge part of it but it's not it's not the only part again necessary not sufficient yeah it's like again it's the 12 steps are some I'm not that experienced in it I just read about it a decent amount it's like hitting every Branch you got to follow the steps man or you can live with that low grade pain non-stop you know it's that's not a good way to live no because because even if you're not conscious of it it erods you in ways that are very destructive I wasn't conscious of it at all you know until the universe as we say came in with a Wrecking Ball and said fine you're not going to listen sent you all these messages you're not going to listen okay I think it's important that we at least briefly touch on where things are at right now um because it would be remiss for us to give the impression that like you're sitting there meditating you're drinking your coffee 90 minutes late late after you wake up you're uh sitting there in Bliss and thinking about all the great things that happened how you made it through like there's still a lot happening right now so um to the extent that you can share um you're working all the time you're what what are you doing nowadays as a vocation I was in private equity for a while before I met you run a company for companies for really good friend of mine and Tom Ripley amazing guy and then I stepped away because I was exhausted and I didn't know how to say it I didn't know how to tell anybody like I needed to escape again take Magic Flight somehow you know and um and he and I are incredibly close like he was one of the guys who is in that super tight Inner Circle um and then I came back to it um with you know with this team that I'm on and I serve as the chief operating officer at lid Sports Group the largest brick and mortar licensed Sports retailer um in North America we have 200,000 stores during the holiday we have 88,200 employees and amazing team the private Equity Firm that I work for is an amazing team and the company's an amazing company and am just incredible group of folks um and so yeah I work a lot I was out here doing store visits in San Francisco and la and that's it's all good and I think um I do those little things all day long all the time but no I am not sitting on a Mountaintop like most days there's no meditation at all Andrew it's meditation is a workout Tom and I throw kettle bells around multiple times a week and um I do those other little things but the difference for me is I'm okay with it and I say that because I was incredibly busy you know before when I first got out of the Navy and I wasn't okay with it because I thought again this is back to the hero's journey I thought like the return to ordinary life was going to be sunshine and rainbows like look I have the ultimate Boon I had this big experience not that I wanted to be like front and center in the media but here I am world it's calm out here right like we get to chill and have a good time and sleep and nothing is stressful in the real world right wrong I just wasn't ready for that like I really genuinely thought that it was just gonna be easier and so when we talk about the lowgrade pain inury and like the you know what is that to me that was one of the biggest frictions like holy I did all this stuff all these deployments lost all these buddies and there's no rest like the regular world just it's not it's supposed to be easier at least that's the story that was in my mind going through all the stuff we just talked about now I'm okay with it like I like it I know how to manage my life I know how to manage my time for the most part I have a different relationship with my teammates and my mentors and my bosses and my own work life and I love it like I feel like I'm back to in a very different way where I was when I was in the Squadron back in ' 07 I I feel like I'm on hope this doesn't get clipped but for me I'm on another level like I really feel good about where I'm headed and I haven't felt like that since I went into college you know I felt like was just deteriorating and now it's it's not which is which is nice well the beauty of what you just said and everything you've shared today is that I don't know if it occurs to you or not but um you've been providing mentorship to millions of people uh in the form of sharing your experience of uh your own Heroes journey and uh I want to thank you for making it so clear as to what your experience was and being unafraid or perhaps afraid and doing it and telling us anyway exactly very afraid what that felt like even better in that sense you know and and stepping into that fear um but also making it so clear that while while your your life experience is you know extraordinary SEAL Teams tier one teams all all and all you know all of it that you know everyone's life has these components of extraordinary and the opportunity for Extraordinary and the return and renewal through the Ordinary World um so much of what you shared is has meaning regardless of people are male female young old so thank you for being a mentor to today and um for having the The Bravery for stepping out into the the quote unquote Ordinary World which is oh so unordinary unordinary and um if you're willing I think it'd be great to have you back in a maybe a couple years and see where you're at meanwhile uh you and I will be T in touch often as as we as we frequently are so thanks Andrew appreciate it Coleman Ruiz thanks for everything you've done thank you uh thanks for everything you're doing and um thanks for coming out today and

Title: Dr. Matt Walker: The Biology of Sleep & Your Unique Sleep Needs | Huberman Lab Guest Series
Published: 2024-04-03 12:00:00 UTC
Description:
In this episode 1 of a 6-part special series on sleep with Dr. Matthew Walker, Ph.D., professor of neuroscience and psychology and founder of the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of the book “Why We Sleep” discusses the essential role that sleep plays in our health. We cover how sleep affects our hormones, immune system, learning and memory, mood, appetite, and weight regulation.

We also discuss what causes the urge to sleep, how sleep is structured throughout the night, and the biology of the different phases of sleep. We also teach you how to determine your individualized sleep needs, including your chronotype (best waking and to-bed time), tips for combat snoring and insomnia, and your QQRT (Quality, Quantity, Regularity, and Timing)—a key framework for optimizing your sleep and therefore daytime energy and focus, and overall health.

The next episode in this special series explores how to improve one’s sleep.

[Music] welcome to the hubman lab guest Series where I and an expert guest discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine today's episode marks the first in our six episode series all about sleep our expert guest for this series is Dr Matthew Walker professor of neuroscience and psychology and the director of the center for Sleep science at the University of California Berkeley he is also the author of the bestselling book why we sleep during the course of the six episode series for which we release one episode per week starting with this episode one we cover essentially all aspects of sleep and provide numerous practical tools to improve your sleep for instance we discuss the biology of sleep including the different sleep stages as well as why sleep is so important for our mental and physical health we also talk about how sleep regulates things like emotionality and learning and neuroplasticity that is your brain ability to change in response to experience and we discuss the various things that you can do to improve your sleep everything from how to time lighting temperature exercise eating and the various things that can impact sleep both positively and negatively such as alcohol cannabis and various supplements and drugs that have been shown to improve sleep we also talk about naps dreaming and the role of dreams and lucid dreaming which is when you dream and you are aware that you are dreaming in today's episode one we specifically focus on on why sleep is so important and what happens when we do not get enough sleep or enough quality sleep we also talk about the various sleep stages and we also talk about a very specific formula that everyone should know for themselves called qqr T which is an acronym that stands for Quality quantity regularity and timing of sleep four factors which today you'll learn how to identify specifically for you what your optimal qqr is and then to apply that in order to get the best possible night's sleep which of course equates to the best possible level of focus and alertness throughout your days both Dr Walker and I are very excited to share the material in the six episode series with all of you and as we March into today's episode one I'm sure it will both provide a ton of excellent practical learning for all of you as well as spark many questions that are sure to be answered in the subsequent episodes of this series before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity many times on this podcast we discuss how in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually needs to drop by about 1 to 3° and in order to wake up feeling maximally refreshed and energized your body temperature needs to heat up by about 1 to 3° eight sleep makes it very easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment so that it's easy to fall and stay asleep and wake up feeling refreshed I started sleeping on an eight- Sleep mattress cover several years ago and it has completely and positively transformed my sleep so much so that when I travel to hotels or airbnbs I really miss my eight sleep I've even shipped my eight sleep out to hotels that I've been staying in because it improves my sleep that much if you'd like to try eightsleep you can go to 8sleep.com huberman to save1 15 off their pod three cover eight sleep currently ships to the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's eights sleep.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by betterhelp betterhelp offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out online now I've been doing therapy for well over 30 years initially I had to do therapy against my will but of course I continue to do it voluntarily over time because I really believe that doing regular therapy with a quality therapist is one of the best things that we can do for our mental health indeed for many people it's as beneficial as getting regular physical exercise the great thing about better help is that it makes it very easy to find a therapist that's optimal for your needs and I think it's fair to say that we can define a great therapist as somebody with whom you have excellent Rapport somebody with whom you can talk about a variety of different issues and who can provide you not just support but also insight and with better help they make it extremely convenient so that it's matched to your schedule and other aspects of your life if you'd

electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means plenty of the electrolytes magnesium pottassium and sodium and no sugar as I've mentioned before on this podcast I'm a big fan of salt now I want to be clear people who already consume a lot of salt or who have high blood pressure or who happen to consume a lot of PR say foods that typically contain salt need to control their salt intake however if you're somebody who eats pretty clean and you're somebody who exercises and you're drinking a lot of water there's a decent chance that you could benefit from ingesting more electrolytes with your liquids the reason for that is that all the cells in our body including the nerve cells the neurons require the electrolytes in order to function properly so we don't just want to be hydrated we want to be hydrated with proper electrolyte levels with element that's very easy to do what I do is when I wake up in the morning I consume about 16 to 32 ounces of water and I'll dissolve a packet of element in that water I'll also do the same when I exercise especially if it's on a hot day and I'm sweating a lot and sometimes I'll even have a third element packet dissolved in water if I'm exercising really hard or sweating a lot or if I just notice that I'm not consuming enough salt with my food if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element

Dr hubman it's an absolute privilege and a delight to be back that's right you've been on here before but I have during this episode in this series we are going to go a lot deeper by the way you look very well rested thank you very much I actually slept pretty well last night um despite it being a foreign location um same time zone that helps just astronomically amazing well rather than ask you what a great night's sleep is for you because I'm pretty sure you're going to tell us that there's uh some individual differences that people need to pay attention to in terms of what is quote unquote optimal sleep let's start off with the basics what is sleep so sleep I think in some ways you can Define as at least in humans and in fact in all mamalian species is broadly separated into two main types of sleep on the one hand we have something that many people will have heard of called nonrapid ey movement sleep or non-rem sleep for short and non-rem sleep has been further subdivided into four separate stages and they are unimaginatively called stages one through four increasing in their depth of sleep so stages three and four that that's the really deep sleep that we can speak about and I should explain a little bit at some point what happens during that state with in the brain it's stunning it's astonishing so you've got stages one and two light non-rm sleep when you sort of look at your sleep trackers and it has light nonrem deep nonrem and then REM stages one and two that's light nonr stages three and four that's deep nonr and that's non-r encapsulated on the other hand we have rapid eye movement sleep or remm sleep and it's named not after the um popular Michael styp band of the 1990s but because of these bizarre horizontal shuttling eye movements that occur during this stage of sleep hence the rapid eye movements and REM sleep is the depending on your definition and we'll probably come to this in in uh later episodes It's the principal stage in which we dream but if your definition is quite loose which is any reported mental activity when I wake you up or when you wake up then it turns out that we dream in almost every stage of sleep but I'll describe REM sleep from here on in as perhaps you dream sleep and I'll make that faux poop so you've got these two types of sleep non-rem and REM sleep they will then play out in this beautiful battle for brain domination throughout the night and that cerebral war is going to be won and lost on average for the average adult every 90 minutes and then it's going to be replayed every 90 minutes and that creates the standard cycling architecture of sleep so whoever is listening to this when your head hits the pillow tonight what will happen you'll start to go down into the light stages of non-rm then you'll go down into the deeper stages of non-rm sleep and you'll stay there and after about 45 50 60 Minutes you'll start to rise back up again and then you'll pop up and you'll have a short REM sleep period and then back down you go again down into non-rem sleep and up into REM sleep and as I said you cycle through that on average about 90 minutes but I'll come back to that what's interesting however is the ratio of non-rem to REM within your 90minut cycle is not stable and what I mean is as you move across the night the the the domination of those two types of sleep within the 90-minute cycle changes such that in the first half of the night the majority of those 90 minutes Cycles are comprised of lots of deep non-rem sleep but very little REM sleep but as we push through to the second half of the night now that ratio balance that seesaw balance shifts over and instead we have much more rapid ey movement sleep and very little deep sleep so when people think about okay I just go to sleep I lose Consciousness my brain is still firstly nothing further from the truth could be the case in in terms of your sleep second your sleep has a very specific pattern that has consequences to real life so let's say that you're someone who normally gives yourself an8 hour sleep opportunity in bed but the next morning based on what I've just told you you say okay well I want to I'm going to get a jump start on the day or I've got an early morning flight so I'm just going to come up with numbers here I'm not suggesting that this is the ideal sleep schedule by any means but just to make the numbers simple let's say someone normally goes to bed at midnight and wakes up at 8: so there's their 8h hour opportunity but today they're going to wake up at 6: a.m. rather than 8:00 a.m. to get this push on the day how much sleep have they lost well technically they've lost 2 hours of the 8 hour so they've lost 25% but that's not entirely true they may have lost 25% of their total sleep but because of the strange structure of deep sleep first and then REM sleep later they may have lost 60 70 maybe 80% of their REM sleep so I only make this point because understanding how sleep is structured can have consequences I will come back to the 90 minutes though it's fascinating we've often and some people probably have heard this before it's a 90minut cycle well there's huge variability some people can have a sleep cycle on average that's maybe 75 minutes others 120 Minutes is it consistent within an individual it is relatively stable within an individual so I would say that the size of the difference from one individual to the next is much bigger than the size of the difference within an individual from one night to the next to the next not unlike a healthy menstrual cycle in a woman which can range from a short is you know 24 days to 31 days and still be considered a healthy cycle that regular but and it will change across the lifespan of course but for a good number of years it's going to be pretty consistent within a given woman uh and yet Between Women it can vary quite a bit immensely yeah and what's also interesting is that speaking about um some sex specific things there are sex differences so on average men if you look at them will have a sleep cycle that's about 15 to 20 minutes longer than women which on a 90-minute average is actually quite a lot and I bring this point up because you may have seen some of those sort of claims or devices out there well firstly probably on social media and people send me these things and say is this true which is you really have to structure your wakeup time at these very distinct 90minut on the clock when the clock strikes the 90-minute midnight you know that's when you have to be waking up and you should set your alarm right these the the rational you'll tell me that it's wrong presumably but the rationale of those devices is that one would be better off waking up at the end of a 90-minute cycle as opposed to in the middle of a 90-minute cycle even if it means getting less total sleep because the argument is that waking up at the end of a 90-minute cycle allows one to be more alert upon waking right that there's something uniquely special about the completion of a 90-minute cycle that will have you Ed out of sleep feeling like an Energizer Bunny kind of that's some of the claims that they and if I were to ask now true or false false so sleep for as much as you possibly can sleep don't terminate that sleep artificially on the basis of anyone telling you that there is this kind of D Vinci Code magic 90 minutes that's unfortunately not true and I you know I've been guilty of saying you know it's a 90minut cycle and repeating that so if I didn't know any better I would believe that so I'm not trying to you know chasti anyone I'm just simply saying be aware of that and don't worry don't stress about this unique 90-minute cycle and there's some products out there that say they're going to time you on your 90-minute cycle and wake you up I would probably stay a little bit clear of some of those what about going back to sleep you said to get um as much sleep as possible if I get six hours of sleep and then wake up and I feel like I could go back to sleep would I be better off going back to sleep provided that my work schedule allows for that or um is it the case that after you've gotten a certain amount of sleep it's a good idea to get up and and go I would say that if you feel as though there's still more sleep in you MH there is or I love that this has become biographical instantly it's going to be a good episode when that happens I would say hold tight stay in bed with an asterisk that I'll come back to and see if you can get get back to sleep and we can speak about different ways of helping you do that but the reason I put a a slight asterisk there is the following if you're then in bed for the next 45 50 minutes wide awake the danger and it doesn't happen to everyone but the danger is that you start to associate this thing called your bed with this thing called wakefulness and not sleep and one of the things that we do in cognitive behavioral th y for insomnia is we try to prevent you from spending long periods of time awake and I would say it's probably about a 25 minute rule of thumb it's not a rule it's a rule of thumb if after about 25 minutes you just can't seem to catch it and this is happening frequently I would just be mindful of you then starting to build a bonded Association in your brain that your bed is also the place of being awake the analogy would be you would never sit at the dinner table waiting to get hungry so why would you lie in bed waiting to get sleepy and the answer is that you you shouldn't and so we need to break that Association now there's nothing stopping you however from saying there's still sleep in me I know that there is so I'm just going to get out of bed go to a different room I'm just going to read a book listen to a podcast and then only when I feel sleepy I'm going to go back to bed because my schedule allows for it that's the best way I would tell you if you still think the sleep that on the table to try and get it back that's immensely valuable uh knowing that there's sort of a conditioned Place effect of of being awake in bed um I must say I get pretty good sleep most of the time there have been phases of life including recently where sleep has been challenging and I notice as I head toward the bed to go to sleep recently the words in my mind are here's the battle Gra like it's going to be a night of going to sleep waking up going to sleep waking up we'll get to this business of of continuity of sleep a little bit later so we don't have to go into that now but I I should also note by the way that for some people when I speak with them they will and it's just because you mention it it's beautiful they will be saying I I'm so surprised because I am watching television and I'm falling asleep on the couch and then I get into bed and I'm wide awake and I don't know why and that's because in part you've built this this connection in your brain and it's and when you go into the bedroom that's what we try to do with cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia you spoke about it as a Battleground that it's almost this adversarial thing which in some ways infers that at that point you feel as though your sleep controls you and it is a miserable feeling and gradually over time what we would do is work with someone and at that point now you control your sleep your sleep doesn't control you and that is so of Freedom when you get it but sorry I interrupted you oh no uh I interrupted you but um thank you yeah I've prided myself my whole life on being able to sleep anytime anywhere uh I learned it from my Bulldog Costello or maybe that's what brought us together because he certainly had that I'm so sad he's not here around anymore with us CU I would have loved he feels like he is the best sleep Ambassador if there's a post to child for good sleep well he's here in spirit um sleeping um so this is interesting and I think it's important for people to hear if if you can't fall asleep or if you wake up in the middle of the night and you can't fall back asleep pretty quickly after about 20 minutes or so probably best to get out of bed um so these 90 minutu is cycles that include different types of sleep um prompt me to ask if you were to describe the basic characteristics of each of those four stages of sleep and especially the deeper stages three and four and REM sleep not just at the level of Rapid Eye movements during REM sleep but in terms of the types of Dreams or the characteristics of of kind of bodily State and you know maybe you just flesh out the physiology and neurochemistry and you know touch on kind of the the uh dream features associated with each of these uh different stages of sleep this just gets so exciting to me and even now when I go into the lab where I look at sleep traces um from my sleep center it I'm am still in awe in bewildered awe of what the brain does so as we start to fall into those lighter stages of sleep once you get past stage one sleep which is sort of almost the shallows where you're just wading out um then you go into stage two sleep and one of the Hallmarks of stage two non-rem sleep or something called sleep spindles and the way that we measure sleep in a laboratory by the way is that we place you look like a spaghetti monster you've got all of these electrodes on your head you've got things above your eyes and you've got things on your body and we're essentially measuring three main signals electrical brain activity we're measuring muscle activity and we're measuring eye movement activity and I'll explain why those three things are necessary for me to know are you awake are you in sleep and if you're in sleep which stage of sleep you're in so going into that stage two non-rem sleep we've got these sleep spindles and at that point I'm looking at the electrical signals from your brain what we call the EEG or the electri inogram and these sleep spindles are these beautiful short synchronous bursts of electrical activity and they last for about a second to two seconds maybe a little longer and they are bursting at a what we call a frequency of somewhere between 12 to 15 Hertz and what that means is that these brain waves are going up and down 12 to 15 times per second that's what our measure is 12 to 15 Hertz and then you go back and your brain at that point has started to slow down now when we're awake your brain wave activity can be going up and down maybe 20 30 40 times per second it's very fast and frenetic it's actually very chaotic electrical brain activity but as we're going into these lighter stages of sleep then the brain starts to slow down and at that point in stage two nonrem it's maybe going up and down just four to eight times per second so a huge deceleration in terms of brain wave activity but occasionally you'll get these s of it's going and then you'll get these beautiful bursts of these sleep spindles um I actually did I I've never published it publicly or um we did a project called the sonification of sleep and we took these electrical signals and then we turned them into sound waves and you can actually hear this beautiful sort of this it's almost this beautiful throbbing of a Slowdown in your brain and then you'll hear these spindles almost sounds like that beautiful delicious rolling R in Hindi so this it's just wonderful I'm not sure I can do that R how's it go yeah not too bad not not too bad I mean we're erring on the side of feline but that's okay Andrew um so so coming back to I'm so sorry um coming back to sleep we've gone into light stage two as I'm trying to desperately hold it together um and we're going down into deeper non-rm sleep now something spectacular happens and this is where I just almost lose it every time I see it the brain now goes back down and it's speed of of oscillation of going up and down is maybe just one or two times per second it's incredibly slow and this is whole brain activity or localized activity this is so we'll come on to this first the way we would measure it is just from these electrodes which are measuring hundreds of thousands of brain cells underneath them so a good analogy would be let's say you're at a a football stadium and it's Stanford playing Berkeley in in American football and what we've got is a single microphone dangling over the middle of the stadium and that microphone is picking up the summed voices of the 60 70,000 people underneath it's the same thing with when we place an electrode on your head you're measure measuring the summed activity of hundreds of thousands of neurons underneath but we've now started to use maybe 100 200 electrodes on your head and we can pick these up in local territories of your brain but that beautiful powerful slow brain waves um that were getting during deep non-rm stages three and four it's not just slow activity you would think okay that's that that sounds like the brain is dormant no no no the brain at that point the size of the w waves is almost quadruple maybe 10x the size of the brain waves when you are awake why is that meaning that the brain waves are going up and down very slowly but the size of them which is what we call the amplitude that is now huge it's epic so think about it you're on the beach and when you're awake the waves are coming in very very quickly but they're small waves and they're coming in in a random fashion but deep slow wave sleep are these kind of Epic things that would happen in Hawaii where you just get these 20 30 foot waves and they're coming in very slowly but they are epically big that is deep slow wave sleep and then what happens is riding on top of those big slow waves are these sleep spindles they just keep coming so according to the sort of the Sleep sonification project what you would hear now these slow waves would be that that's the slow wave and the Sleep spindle what is it that happens in your brain though to your question to produce these slow waves well let's go back to the football stadium analogy there before the game that's wakefulness everyone is having a different conversation in a different part of the stadium and and you just get this kind of incoherent sort of blabber that's going on that's wake your brain is doing different things at different sort of locations of the brain processing different information at different moments in time and that's the fast frenetic activity of wakefulness when you go into deep sleep all of a sudden for reasons that we still don't quite understand hundreds of thousands of brain cells in your cortex all decide to unite in their singular voice of firing and they all fire together and they all go silent together they all fire together they all go silent together and that's what's producing these huge big powerful waves so the analogy in the football stadium would be at this point now and I'll I'll come across to um to to your University Stanford is is is winning and the the crowd is buoyant and all of a sudden the Stamford crowd is singing Berkeley sucks Burkle sucks and they're all uniting the whole stadium cries out at the same time and then goes silent at the same time it's an epic display of coordinated neural activity in a way that we don't see in any other brain State it's phenomenal it's just in all you answered the question I was going to ask which is does the pattern of brain activity that you just described occur in similar or identical form during any waking States and I think you just said the answer is no meaning if I understand correctly this is a very very specialized brain State unique to sleep unique to a specific portion of sleep and that begs the question what is it doing so it turns out that all of these stages that we'll describe different stages of sleep do different things for your brain and your body at different times of night and it's very understandable that people sort of in the public will come over to me and say you know how do I get more deep sleep or how do I get more REM sleep and my question back to them firstly is why do you want more REM sleep and they'll say well isn't that the good stuff and I will say well it turns out that they're all important you need all of them but we can come on to let let I'll speak about non-rem sleep functions first and then I can probably I should unpack REM sleep um and then explain its functions but as an overview what we know is that during deep sleep first you switch over in terms of your body's nervous system to what we call the parasympathetic nervous system that you've spoke spoken about a lot before which is this kind of very quiescent calming state of your body's nervous system the sympathetic nervous system which is very poorly named because it's anything but sympathetic it's very aggravating and activating and um when we're awake that seems to be somewhat more dominant depending on what state you're in but in sleep especially in deep Sleep you shift over into this very strong parasympathetic quiescent calm State and that instigates together with other things um and we've demonstrated by the way that we published a paper probably about a year and a half ago that these slow waves and these sleep spindles and the cordination of them how well that they're coordinated seems to instigate a signal down into your body's what we call the autonomic nervous system which carries both the sympathetic and the sympathetic nervous system inside of it and forces you over into a parasympathetic state so these brain waves one of the things that they seem to be doing is transacting a message to your body's nervous system to say calm down quiet down what then happens firstly what we see is your cardiovascular system ramps down deep sleep you could argue is almost the very best form of blood pressure medication that you could ever wish for it's beautiful then something happens within your immune system we're start starting to unpack this but we still don't quite know why these pulsing deep slow brain wavves seem to be a trigger for instigating two things for your immune system firstly it stimulates the restocking of the Weaponry in your immune Arsenal so that you wake up the next day and you are a more robust immune individual so these are things like tea cells natural killer cells that sort correct all of that good stuff but what's also interesting there's a more recent discovery um it's not just that your body has um put back all of this Armory in place and in fact Amplified it but your body sensitivity to those immune factors has also increased so you've restocked the the weaponry and you've made your body more sensitive to those immune signals and that's why we will see in probably later discussions your immune system can start to become you know really markedly impaired when you're not getting enough sleep so that's a second benefit of the Deep Sleep um brain wave patterns the third benefit that we've realized is that it's very good at regulating your metabolic system and specifically your ability to control your blood sugar and your blood glucose and if we selectively deprive you of just deep sleep alone and we can do this now very cleverly it's not as though I see you going into deep sleep and I go into your bedroom and I wake you up and then you go back to sleep and which is how we used to do it sort of 10 years ago now we can use a very clever method where we play auditory tones to your brain but they are of a level that will not wake you up it's what's called a sub Awakening threshold and we determine that and by playing those tones it forces the brain to resurface out of deep sleep so you will still sleep a total eight hours but I will have selectively excised just your deep sleep and when I do that sure enough your blood sugar ability your ability to control your blood sugar I should say is impaired really quite demonstrably and it's for at least two reasons the initial thing is that your pancreas when it sees this spike in blood sugar it normally releases something called insulin and that insulin is a trigger to your body to say start absorbing the blood sugar so we don't get this toxic or we don't maintain this toxic spike in blood sugar your pancreas when you are underslept and specifically when you're not getting enough deep sleep does not release the appropriate amount of insulin worse still what we found is that's selectively depriving you of Deep Sleep means that what little insulin is released the cells in your body become less receptive to that insulin so you're not releasing enough of this chemical to say start absorbing blood sugar and the cells that are they designed to do the they stick a straw out into your bloodstream and they suck up the blood sugar they don't respond to the insulin anymore so on both sides of the blood sugar regulation equation you become imper and then I can give you an example upstairs in the brain one of the things that we found and we'll discuss is that deep sleep helps regulate your learning in your memory functions it helps start to move memories around in your brain and protect them and shift them from short term to long term deep sleep however we've now discovered is critical for drisking your Alzheimer's trajectory it's during deep sleep when you have a cleansing system in the brain that starts washing away the toxic proteins that build up by way of wakefulness and two of those toxic components are something that we call beta ameloid and Tow protein which are fundamental ingredients in the Alzheimer's disease brain equation so certainly I could then understand based on that Litany of things that I've just provided and those are only a few of what deep sleep is doing you could imagine that's the stuff that I want to get and that's the thing that I need to optim for not true because there is REM sleep I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens and is designed to meet all of your foundational nutritional needs by now I'm sure you've all heard me say that I've been taking ag1 since 2012 and indeed that is true now of course I do consume regular Whole Foods every day I strive to get those Foods mostly from unprocessed or minimally processed sources how however I do find it hard to get enough servings of fruits and vegetables each day so with ag1 I ensure that I get enough of the vitamins minerals Prebiotic fiber and other things typically found in fruits or vegetables and of course I still make sure to eat fruits and vegetables and in that way provide a sort of insurance that I'm getting enough of what I need in addition the adaptogens and other micronutrients in ag1 really help buffer against stress and ensure that the cells and organs and tissues of my body are getting the things they need people often ask me that if they were going to take Just One supplement what that supplement should be and I always answer ag1 if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer you'll get five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman before you talk about REM sleep um what about stages one and two of sleep are those just um kind of the jog into the into the Sprint that is uh deep sleep stages three and four or if I were to Stage the question I'm asking as an experiment let's say I'm an undergraduate or graduate student in your lab and I say um can we do an experiment where we selectively deprive people of stage one and two sleep only and and then of course the question becomes what do you put in there instead so there's a bunch of other experiments that one would have to uh do but has that experiment ever been done and if so uh what is the consequence of being stage one two deprived um as opposed to just deep sleep deprived so just as you already um elegantly demonstrated that stage one selective deprivation is very difficult because it's a denovo thing you have to pass through to get to the other stages of sleep is stage one the stage of sleep that I and other people have experienced many times where you're falling asleep and um you start to have a a dream perhaps about walking or running and then you kick yourself away that's right okay oh and I should have explained what happens stage one I love so as we're going into stage one obviously our eyelids are closed but one of the first signs that we know as we're recording I told you we're recording the electrical activity on the head with these electrodes but I also said that we're measuring IM movement activity and as you're going into light stage one non RAM for reasons that again we have no idea why your eyeballs start to roll in their sockets underneath your eyelids that change that we can start to see we call them Slow Rolling eye movements and they are the Hallmark of you entering sleep and if you are lucky enough to have a partner you can see this you can you know as they're falling asleep you will see these bizarre now granted if they wake up usually the relationship is terminated very quickly because the thing are you next time I'm on a plane if the person next to me is sleeping I'm going to be the guy kind of like you're a mirror yeah no don't do that I'm the only one who gets away with it cuz I'm a card carrying sleep scientist and even then yeah American Alliance sometimes take some bridge but um so you get these Slow Rolling eye movements and the brain waves start to to sort of slow down again but you mentioned something else and they are called hypnogogic Jer and as we're going into this first stage of sleep I told you that the principal stage in which we dream is rapid eye movement sleep that's not exactly true because everyone has had this experience that just as you're drifting off you start to have these little mini dreams almost sort of diet or dreams light lit and you you you can almost wake yourself up based on the fracture point of cognition and what I mean is you're thinking okay so tomorrow uh I've got to get to the studio I'm interviewing that desperately annoying British guy M Walker and then there was uh the elephant in the room with a helicop po the wings on its head and and you almost just think it wakes you up because you think wait wait sorry excuse me go back rewind what just happened that's the point at which you've transitioned over into the what we call the hypnogogic state where you can have these hypnogogic dreams but you also get these JS we don't fully understand what happens but the what we do understand is that as you're going into sleep you start to lose different aspects of your sensory perceptual apparatus not losing the sense of where did I where did they go and I can't find them but the the the processing of those now many will remain during sleep one of the things that starts to degrade is what we call proprioception and you've spoken about this before which is knowing how your body is sort of positioned in space so it propri reception is fascinating as you're walking with a colleague and you're crossing over a street have you ever had that feeling where you sort of you step off the curb and you're chatting and all of a sudden you have one of those really ugly wobbles where you can and it's because you had calculated non-consciously and computationally you understood where your foot was in space you understood the velocity force with which it was descending down onto the road below you you had miscalculated the distance and your brain had expected your foot to hit that that road at a certain time and it did not it sends an error signal back up your spinal cord and that's where you get that yeah this happened to me um uh just last weekend I was at the San Francisco Zoo and periodically throughout the landscape of the San Francisco Zoo they have these kind of squishy surfaces that are seamless with the concrete around them I think this is so kids can play on the the various sculptures there and if they fall it's a little bit more forgiving so I was just walking across this thing talking to the person to my left and I stepped on this now rather squishy surface and all of a sudden I like I don't know how to walk across this thing and I'm you know I've been walking a long a long period of my life and I really had to pay attention and then and then transition back onto the concrete and could stop thinking about it for a moment and you almost then have to stop the conversation that you were having because it takes over and you switch from non-conscious proceptive and you switch over so the issue is that when you are lying there awake in bed you sense the mattress underneath you you sense the support you're getting all of that feedback signal that I was telling you was absent when you in inappropriately calculated the distance down onto the road all of that is in place and your brain is saying everything's fine but as we're drifting off into sleep we start to lose that proprioceptive feedback now normally that loss of propri acceptive feedback and sensation of what's going on and where my body is is is is before the loss of consciousness and so you lose Consciousness and that's then thereafter when the loss of propri reception happens and you don't have this sort of you know mental freak out of of propri receptive break glass in case of emergency but sometimes the speed with which those things happen changes and you start to lose the propri receptive sensation before you fully lose Consciousness and at that point your body says oh my goodness mattress has just disappeared and I'm falling got and that's where you can have these these JS that's that's our current best theory I know we're going to talk a lot about dreaming in a later episode of the series but uh what you just told me forces me to ask at this moment whether or not in dreams where we sense we are flying is that possible because of the absence of proception we we're sort of we're on the mattress or on whatever surface we sleep on but according to the brain there's uh we're suspended in space is that right yeah so it's it it's one possibility as to why we have those experiences in some ways though it does bring us on to REM sleep during REM sleep and I'll explain what happens in the brain but what you're talking about is something that is even more unique about REM sleep as we go into REM sleep your brain paralyzes your body so you are physically locked into the incarceration of your body why why would your brain do this it's what we call muscle atoni now I was telling you that we measure your electrical brain activity and we measure your eye movement activity but we also measure your muscle activity why do we do that well as you're going into non-rem sleep that muscle tone decreases but there's still some muscle tone there but as you go into REM sleep in fact just a few seconds before you enter REM sleep I already know you're going into RAM sleep because bang you you become completely absent of muscle toone and if I were to pick you and I mean I'm I'm probably not going to be able to pick you up out of your bed um based on certain images I've seen on social media um I'm going to if I lift you up you'd just be like a rag doll you'd have no muscle tone whatsoever it's almost like those toys where it's like a donkey that sits up and it's got a button underneath and you press the button whoosh and it just falls down I used to have those as a kid too like the simple things that you and I had as children that would fate still own a couple of these but they but yeah I need to get a donkey one um in any event um I know what you're referring to so this this muscle and as we call muscle Aon and I think in sort of medicine usually with an a before it means the absence of something so sort of if you're if you have arhythmia absence of normal athm aasia yeah sort of or um and here it's aonia absence of the tone in your muscles why would the brain do this well the brain paralyzes your body so your mind can dream safely you would imagine how quickly you could be popped out of the Jee pool if just like you described you thought I can fly so you get up out of your bed and you go to the window and you launch probably not going to end well depending on what floor you're on so this absence of muscle tone this physical incarceration that we have is one of the things by the the way that defines REM sleep from when you are awake because if all I was doing in my sleep lab was recording your electrical brain activity and I was in the other room and I was just looking at your your brain waves as you go into REM sleep I would not be able to tell are you in REM sleep or are you awake why because the electrical brain activity is so similar when you are in REM sleep relative to when you're awake and what that tells us is that REM sleep is an incred incredibly active cerebral condition your brain is just firing away in fact some parts of your brain can be up to 30% more active when you're in REM sleep than when you're awake stunning particularly emotional brain centers so it's a it's a stunning state of of paradox and that's the reason that we sometimes call it paradoxical sleep your body is completely immobilized utterly inactive but your brain is fervant with its activity by the way people should not worry when I say that you are your your muscles are shut down and what happens is that as just before you go into REM sleep there's a bursting activity that will go up into your brain to light up your cortex but there's another signal from the brain stem that's sent down all the way down the spinal cord to the Alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord that will essentially create this inhibition it's only your voluntary sceletal muscles meaning that your involuntary muscles things for example such as your respiration that helps you breathe in your heart that's the reason that we you know survive and live another day after sleep so don't worry about that too much with two exceptions though there are two sets of voluntary muscles for reasons that we still don't know either that are spurred from the paralysis of REM sleep one of them is the extraocular muscles and that's the reason that when you go into REM sleep you can have these darting horizontal movements back and forth those should also have been paralyzed but they're not and then oddly there is a a muscle in the middle inner ear muscle that does not undergo the paralysis and it will also twitch too just like your eyes but I'm getting into the weed so that's what's happening in these different physiological States and to your question when you don't have any muscle tone whatsoever maybe that is imp part the reason why a you can start to have these dreams of absent gravitational pull meaning you can start to fly it may also be the reason by the way that coming back to proception you can sometimes have that feeling of some people will describe my teeth are always falling out I always feel as though it's a very common thing to to or you feel the absence of clothing on your body and you say I walked out and I was going to this meeting and I realized I didn't have any pants on and and you forget that proception is also about knowing that your clothes are on you and sensing those clothes you and I can now direct our attention and sense those clothes on us is it also the case that um when we talk about sleep we talk about falling asleep that the sense that one is falling back into their head I um is related to the progressive loss of propri reception in the early stages of sleep or is it just semantics no I often think that that may have being where it that that notion comes from we why would we not say that I am sometimes people say I'm drifting off into sleep but or I'm about to enter sleep and we say I'm I'm falling asleep now some of that may be that I'm falling into a sort of a deeper and deeper state of a brain wave activity pattern maybe but I actually think you're right now we don't know ultimately the origin of it but I believe it's imp pop because people have this sense of falling hence falling asleep along those lines um I've found that if I sleep horizontally on a bed or sofa um the sleep is Far and Away different than if I'm fall asleep upright in a chair or partially upright in a recliner yeah um for instance on an airplane now there are a bunch of other things happening on airplanes Bright Lights noises Etc um so it's not a a good experiment to compare those two situations airplane recliner versus uh in bed at night um too many variables temperature especially but um is there any evidence that one's bodily position during sleep or the uh orientation of the feet relative to the head you know the angle elevated um upward or downward has any impact on the uh pattern of of different sleep stages or uh quality or uh any other aspects of sleep there is a reason for it and we'll probably come on to this at some point when we speak about different methods for Sleep optimization or the new wave of of fascinating sleep enhancement tools has to do with temperature we think that for you to be able to fall asleep and stay asleep you have to drop your brain and body temperature by just a little less than about 1 degre Celsius or probably two two and a half degrees Fahrenheit and that's the reason by the way that you will always find it easier to fall asleep in a room that's too cold than too hot because the room that's too cold is at least taking you in the right temperature direction for good sleep whereas the room that's too hot the opposite it turns out that the body's ability to dissipate heat what we call Thermo regulation here and Thermo regulation in One Direction which is which is the reduction in core body temperature is superior when you are lying down versus when you are inclined versus when you are standing up really and in part it has to do with the distribution of blood throughout certain parts of the brain in the distal versus proximal regions meaning sort of the regions that are Clos to the core of your body versus the regions that are further away but your body's ability if we largely take most item items of clothes off you and then we measure the the core body temperature and the way that we do this um it's a delightful technique it's called a rectal probe and it's neither Pleasant necessarily for the installation of the the the the experiment of doing it and it's certainly not necessarily for the participant but putting that aside for a second they we can measure your core body temperature and we can measure using temperature sensors all over your body exactly what's going on with the blood flow and we can measure how the brain is starting to dis ipate the heat because one of the principal ways that we dissipate heat from our body is by moving blood around the body when we bring blood into the core of our body we're trapping it in the core and our core body temperature increases when we push that blood out to the surface it goes to these thin sort of capillaries and vessels on the surface of your skin and you start to dissipate that heat and you dissipate it more quickly so your core body temperature drops and the body's sort of vasoactive capacity for Distributing that blood and then releasing that trapped heat from the core of the body is superior when you are lying down and therefore your body temperature can drop more quickly which is one of the many reasons why it's not as easy to fall asleep when you're sort of at a 45° angle and why the quality of your sleep won't be as good now there are other reasons to just as you mentioned but coming back to position I would say that there are maybe there's perhaps at least two pieces of evidence that would recommend positional differences or positional changes the the first is very obvious if you are someone who is snoring and you have certainly if you have untreated sleep apnea which is um where you're sort of not just snoring but you'll have an absence of breath that's what the word apnea means here's another one with an a in front of it pinea sort of you know you've heard of pneumonia and it this is about breath and apnea is about an absence of that breath and with sleep apnea not only do you start to have an airway collapsing partially and that's where you get that flutter and that's the sound of the flutter that we're having but then at some point you just hear silence and at that point the person's stop breathing entirely absence of breath that is much more likely to happen if you are sleeping on your back because when you're sleeping on your back your Airway is giving way to gravity which is wanting to pull the airway down and close it and shut it off so one of the suggestions for people who have snoring or sleep apne is trying as best you can to train yourself out of sleeping on your back now there's lots of gadgets out there that can sort of help and ways can do that the old school way that we used to do it um sleep apne is more common in men than it is in women but women still have it but if you had a male you would bring them into the the clinic and you would say could you and it's often males who perhaps are carrying excessive body weight and so they're of larger Mass size You' say can you also bring a t-shirt in uh of your wife and it has to be a t-shirt that is that has a pocket on the front and then we would ask them to wear the T-shirt back to front so it's a very tight fitting t-shirt it's back to front and then you took a tennis ball or a hockey ball in the back pocket and as you're lying there in bed and you turn over onto your back you get this painful signal of the tennis ball pushing you in the back and it gradually I know who came up with this is this Matt was this um Matt Walker's idea this is not me I am not it's clever yeah I should now be on social media I should be changed to sort of like sleep torturer rather than sleep Diplomat um so that's one recommendation try to stay clear if you're asking me are there certain positions we should stay away from in that circumstance yes it would be the other comes back to something I mentioned during deep sleep when this cleansing system starts to kick into gear in your brain and wash away these toxins from the day what we've found a little bit of evidence and we and the Royal we because I um like you my lab doesn't do um animal research we only do human research but some animal researchers had discovered that when animals will sleep with their head on the side the the cleansing capacity of the brain is superior than when the animal is sleeping on its back or sleeping on its front and in fact if you look and you would love this project if you go on to Google and you just search for sleeping animals look at the head position and I will guarantee you that many of them if they're naturalistic are animals with their head turned to the side now the cute ones the funny ones are when a you know a kitten is SPL out on its back and its head is back that's how someone with sleep apne would sort of sleep on their back and but that's very rare we almost never see that so it's very interesting and what they found was that when those heads were in those sort of side positions the cleansing mechanism of the brain was a little bit better it wasn't night or day it's not as though oh my goodness I'm a front sleeper and you know I'm not getting any brain cleansing or I'm a back sleeper and not I'm not saying that there's no need to take it to the extreme but I I don't think there's any good evidence yet in humans that firstly that's the case and nor is the strong enough evidence to make any recommendations but I just bring it up because it's in the data and it's starting to emerge that if you were to ask me about sleeping position and are there any recommendations those are the two pieces of descriptive advice I would give you they are not prescriptive pieces of advice you mentioned the relationship between temperature and sleep and we're going to get into that uh in some degree of detail a little bit later because it's so critical but um prior to starting to record this episode we were talking a little bit about yawning um and you told me something really truly fascinating about yawning which was so there are at least four competing theories of yawning that we have and I think there is probably a emerging clear winner um the first theory was that it was just tiredness that yawning is simply a sign of you being tired and it turns out that that's not true because many people can yawn when they're bored and they are not tired and they've been very well rested so that doesn't seem to be true the next one was one that that seems to be very logical which is it's about trying to rebalance your blood gases and specifically oxygen and carbon dioxide and you would think that perhaps when you yawn with that sort of when you and you inhale a huge volume of oxygen what you're trying to do is pump back up the oxygen in your bloodstream or when you sort of and the exhale maybe it's about exhaling more carbon dioxide not unlike the physiological size that occur during sleep of a double inhale with a long exhale correct or that one can voluntarily generate for anxiety Management in wakeful St exactly Y and so that was a a theory that maybe you're trying to balance these these blood gases and there was some very clever experiments where they took it individuals and they artificially increased their oxygen uh levels but more specifically they increased their carbon dioxide levels by directionally they tried to manipulate it and they asked did those individuals start to yawn more because the idea would be if your blood oxygen is coming down and your carbon dioxide is starting to rise if this theory is correct you should start yawning with greater frequency and there was no difference whatsoever that's probably also the reason that you don't see people yawning on a treadmill or when they're going into more of an oxygen debt and higher levels of carbon dioxide so that theory was knocked out the third theory was one of contagion and it's fascinating yawning like several other things has a contagious element to it so as the audience unexpectedly they didn't know what you were going to say and before you said it you said you told us something interesting about and you did I guarantee you that there will be people listening right now who said oh I just yawned in response to Andrew hubman yawning it is very contagious in part it's the mirror neuron system and you've obviously understand this in depth your brain has this capacity to mirror the action states of other individuals so a good example would be let's say I'm walking out the door now I'm closing the door with my hand and all of a sudden I'm going to get my hand trapped and you on the other side of the room you are seeing my hand and as soon as I trap my hand and I Yelp out in pain you almost hold your own hand oh because why why why are you doing that it's not just because you know you're trying to be you know compassionate no you have experienced some degree of what I've just experienced how does it do that because your brain has a system inside of it that mirrors my action States and it's called a mirror system and you can imagine why it's very good to understand the action and emotional states of others for pro-social capacities and all of that good stuff and one of the things that can also happen with this mirror neuron system is that it mimics yawning so when you yawn my likelihood of yawning increases too because my mirror neuron system is matching your Y and what's interesting is that we know other species also have a mirror neuron system and that means that when you yawn there is a statistically higher chance that your dog will yawn and it's cross species so when your dog yawns there's a higher probability that you will yawn and we've got this St and it's it's very clear one of the other interesting theories though is that when um species that are Cooperative species for example a pride of life Lions when one of those Lions yawns firstly many of the other Lions will yawn in a contagious fashion but then consequently there is a collection of actions that happen after that contagious yawn and so some people have suggested that the yawning is a way to enact Cooperative group Behavior that's another theory the final Theory number four which I think has the best evidence for is not the gaseous exchange balancing of carbon dioxide and oxygen but when you inhale oxygen from the outside it's usually cooler than your core body and brain temperature and when we inhale there is a modest drop in brain temperature and when the brain temperature starts to rise that's when we see yawning frequency beginning to increase so next time you see someone yawn don't think oh they're bored or they didn't get enough sleep go over to them hug them and say I know your brain is getting warm it's okay and then at that point the friendship will be terminated because no one should be hooking each other and saying your brain is warm I'm so sorry but anyway that aside um I'm sorry we I took us down that that um tributary of my polluted stream of Consciousness but that's yawning explained those are the four theories and we don't have a definitive answer but I think the best one right now that will continue is that it's about brain cooling that theory makes a lot of sense um people tend to yawn when they get tired as you mentioned people can yawn for other reasons as well if I'm yawning because I'm tired and yawning is to cool off my brain that's too warm is that an attempt to put my brain to sleep because we need to cool the brain in order for it to go to sleep or something else going on there also and this um sort of merges with the previous question about body position I've lectured in the university for you know well over a decade as I know you have as well and occasionally every once in a while there's one student I'm just kidding there are several students especially if it's an afternoon class or a very early morning class that is falling asleep in their chair and then their head they kind of jolt awake and we all know that keeping the room a little bit cooler sometimes helps to keep people awake um as opposed to a warm afternoon classroom but in some ways what we're talking about here um violates what you were talking about earlier that it's easier to fall asleep in a cool environment as opposed to a warm environment uh the brain needs to cool in order to fall asleep but then when we yawn it's in response to the brain being too warm and so um and so I'm I'm having a little bit Circle for me yeah help me understand square square that Circle I like it yeah please square that Circle for me Matt um it turns out that for you to drop your core body temperature the opposite has to happen which is that you have to warm up to cool down to fall asleep and I mean warm up in a very specific way you have to have the outer surface of your brain warm up you have to get blood to the surface of your skin and that surface is almost acts like a snake charmer that it Dr draws the warm blood from the core and it pushes it to the surface and you radiate the heat out and as you radiate the heat out said your core body temperature plummets so why would people be falling asleep sort of you know in an afternoon meeting when it starts to get a little warm well in part it's because the warmth of the room is starting to make the sort of face a little bit more Rosy it's drawing the blood out to the surface so what's happening the core of your brain and your body temperature are starting to drop and at that point that's why you're going to start to feel a little bit more sleepy that's reason one the second that you described is that afternoon you know you're in meetings around a table and you start to get as you said those wonderful head nuts and people listening you you all know that where the of head goes down and snaps back up it's not that people are listening to good music and sort of doing this head bobbing it's that they falling prey to what we know is a genetically hardwired pre-programmed drop in your afternoon alertness it's called the postprandial dip in alertness and that infers that it's after some kind of a a meal it turns out it's not really related to a meal people say well I had a heavy lunch I had sort of pastor at lunch and I always feel sleepy afterwards maybe in part but if I remove if I prevent you from having lunch and we've done these studies too your brain still shows this very reliable drop and alertness somewhere between quite wide but somewhere between about 1: to 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon yeah for me it's always between 2 and 300 p.m. which uh is a time I'm resisting looking at my watch right now just to see yeah we might be in that in that uh phase of the day uh I can always feel it and um if I close my eyes for 10 20 minutes um it I usually can fall asleep pretty quickly yeah for a nap I know we'll talk about naps later um but if I don't and I ride it out I then you know usually by about 3 3:30 I'm fine get that rise back up don't you and it sort of swings back up and so that's in part the reason though explaining the yawning and that that warm feeling of I'm in the the meeting room the boardroom meeting and the the the blinds are open the sun is coming through I've got the sun on my back I'm starting to get very warm but I'm starting to get really really sleepy it's the it's the collusion of two things it's that you're going into this higher frequency sleep Zone in the afternoon this postprandial drop in your brain alertness and we can measure it it's very reliable you can see this dip in your brain electrical activity and you're getting warm at the surface which brings blood to the surface releases that heat from the core it drops and boy do you want to fall asleep I want to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals now I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term Health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test the problem with a lot of blood tests out there however is that you get information back about metabolic factors hormones Etc but you don't know what to do with that information with inside tracker they make it very easy to understand your results and they also point you to specific directives that you can follow in the realm of nutrition exercise supplementation even prescription drugs that can help bring the levels back into the ranges that are optimal for you insid tracker also offers insid Tracker Pro which enables coaches and

specific features around sleep and falling asleep Etc let's get back to the different stages of sleep and frame that under the question of what is great sleep what is mediocre sleep I think we all know what bad sleep is it's when you can't get sleep but I think there's a whole different category of bad sleep that you're going to tell us about which is sleep that we think is good but is actually not as good as we we think it is I'm always the barer of Doom and Gloom no but well and but also but also the um the deliver of of powerful tools to improve one's one's sleep and thereby wakeful state so along those lines you know what is sleep for truly and what happens when we don't sleep well is perhaps more intuitive to most people you know oh I feel cranky or I can't remember things or I just kind of you know um stress seems to feel a little more intense the same amount of stress feels more intense um and what is great sleep you know and and and this is I think all under the umbrella of of you know why do we sleep I mean why do we spend a good third to you know or more of our life in in this incredible state of mind and body that we call sleep and it really is quite a stunning state of idiocy when when you consider it because when you're asleep you're not finding a mate you're not reproducing you're not foraging for food you're not caring for your young and worse still you are vulnerable to predation on any one of those grounds but especially all of them as a collective sleep should have been strongly selected against in the course of evolution and in fact one of the founding fathers of sleep research Alan re shaen once said that if sleep doesn't serve an absolutely vital function it is the biggest mistake The evolutionary process has ever made and now what we've learned through you know almost 10,000 plus research studies over the past certainly 70 80 years now is that nature did not make a spectacular blunder in creating this thing called sleep so maybe I can firstly address what is what is sleep doing and what happens if we're not getting sufficient sleep and then the other question is what is what is good sleep in terms of what sleep is doing and why he was right in saying that mother nature didn't make a a blunder and it hasn't by the way because if you go back every species that we have carefully studied to date seems to sleep and what that tells us even you know very old evolutionary old ancient um earthworms seem to sleep they will have a period of what we call theargus which is they seem to be inactive so what I I bring that point up because it means that sleep appears to have evolved with life itself on this planet and then it has fought its way through heroically every step along the evolutionary path and that by itself must tell us that whatever sleep is doing it must be non-negotiable life support necessary in what ways is it life support necessary well we now know many of those first when you're not getting sufficient sleep I can speak about your hormonal systems let's say I take a group of really healthy young men and I limit them to four or five hours of sleep for five nights they will have a level of testosterone which is similar to someone who is probably 10 years older than them so a lack of sleep will agid you within 5 days by a decade we also see equivalent imp uh imper in female reproductive Health caused by a lack of sleep impermanence in estrogen in follicle stimulating hormone and also in lutenizing hormone what what about the uh effects of a single night's poor sleep on on hormones um and not to get too down in the details here but uh is it necessary to have four or five nights of minimal sleep in a row before you start to see these effects or let's say somebody's getting good sleep for three nights or four nights of the week but then the other three are kind of challenging for whatever reason does one see a graded effect a kind of intermediate reduction in sex steroid hormones like testosterone estrogen follicle stimulation there is some degree of a dose response curve but we haven't mapped it out with high so the way I would want to do it as a sleep scientist would say okay I'm going to do this for one night and I'm going to thin slice you to S hours 6 hours 5 hours and then I'm going to do it for two nights and you're going to again be in the 6 hours 7 hours 4 hours and I would like to build up this High Fidelity map and understand that we don't have that but certainly what we know is that a night of total deprivation will markedly imper those hormones and we know that after about you know a working week of short sleep you see those imp perance too um but let me come back to one night so that's the hormonal system as an example and we've already spoken or I'll come back to it um right now the metabolic system and another hormone um insulin what we found is that if I take you again and I limit your and you're perfectly normal healthy you don't have any signs of type 2 diabetes and I limit you to let's say 5 hours of sleep for four nights and then I measure your ability to dispose of blood sugar and um your level of blood sugar impairment is so disrupted that at that point your doctor would classifier as being pre-diabetic so I could take an individual and within five nights of short sleep I can move them towards a path that's getting very close to type 2 diabetes and as I said we've UND and we Royal we here um whenever I say we by the way it usually means that um well whenever I say I did something I mean at my Center we did something and when I say we did something I mean that they did something that's a a fair Shand for uh for attribution um and so so there there have been studies that have really decomposed exactly how that impermanent in blood sugar happens and we mentioned that earlier in this episode I can also then move on to for example your um your immune system this is a very good demonstration firstly there's a great study done by Michael ow and his colleagues at UCLA and he took individuals healthy individuals and he limited them to just four hours of sleep for one single night and he measured levels of critical anti-cancer fighting immune cells called natural killer cells and what he found is that after that one night of just four hours of sleep there was a 70% reduction in natural killer cell activity that is a striking state of immune deficiency and just to give people a you know a reference point these natural killer cells were think of them almost like the secret service agent of your immune system these natural killer cells they are very good at identifying dangerous unwanted elements in your body like cancer and going after them and destroying them so you wish for a very verile set of these immune assassins in your body at all times and if you're not getting sufficient sleep that may not necessarily be the case we also know that if you are not getting sufficient sleep in the week before you get your flu shot and this is just another example of how sleep is critical for your immune system if you're not getting that sleep in the week before you get your flu shot you produce less than 50% of the normal antibody response therefore rendering that flu shot largely ineffective in terms of vaccinating you we also know that if you're not getting sufficient sleep on average let's say that you're getting less than 6 hours of sleep or less on average you're almost three times more likely to develop the common cold common flu and I know that you at the time of us recording this um you've released some fantastic content about the the flu and and the Rhino virus in particular so that's a good demonstration of your immune system we also know that it's not just that it's also your cardiovascular system that suffers when you're not getting sufficient sleep and here again the data I think is very strong cardiovascular disease RIT large including stroke and and heart attack and there is one study that I think illustrates this and and granted now in terms of the replication the effect sizes may not be as big but the study was interesting they didn't do something radical like depriving you of sleep for an entire night nor did they just limit you to 5 hours of sleep for you know four nights there is a global experiment sleep experiment that has performed on about 1.65 billion people across 70 countries twice a year and it's called daylight savings time now in the spring when we lose an hour of sleep what they observed in that paper was a 24% relative increase in heart attack risk the following day yet in the autumn in the fall when you gain an hour of sleep there was a 21% reduction amazing in heart so it's bidirectional and by the way and I I said that that paper there are you can there are some aspects that you can sort of discuss but it has been replicated we see increased rates of hospitalization after that 1 hour of lost sleep in the spring there are higher rates of car accidents on the road after 1 hour of lost sleep we also see higher rates of suicide after 1 hour of lost sleep during the spring time change we even see this is great data they they looked at um the sentencing of federal judges in the United States and because it's the federal system the government system all of those things are cataloged and well documented you have a huge database and they went back and what they found is that in the spring when we all lose that 1 hour of sleep opportunity those judges doled out harsher Federal sentencing in the day after they had lost one hour of sleep because their emotional and mood states were imper and we'll speak about this in a later episode too so if you are up for sentencing or please try to avoid that spring time change as best you can go for the go for the fall date if if it's possible um so that's that's your cardiovascular system I could also tell you that it goes all the way down into the cellular and molecular state of your body and this I'm trying to do this to impress the fundamental importance of sleep there was a wonderful study done by my colleagues at the University of Sur back in the UK by led by duk Yandy and what they demonstrated was that if you take healthy individuals and everyone is going to act as their own control and you limit them to um 6 hours of sleep for one week versus allowing them to sleep at least 8 and a half hours or more time in bed and then what they did was they measured the change in their gene activity profile relative to when those same individuals as I said were getting a full 8 hour plus opportunity in bed versus the 6 hours of limited sleep and they found two interesting things first a sizable and significant 711 genes were distorted in their activity caused by a lack of sleep by the way that's relevant we know that almost one out of every three maybe even one out of every two if you look at the data people that pass you on the street is trying to survive on six hours of sleep or less during the week so it's a relevant ecological manipulation the second result was that about half of those genes were increased in their activity the other half would decreased now those genes that were imp purred by way of one week of short sleep were genes associated with the immune system so once again you can see this immune deficiency but now playing out at a genetic level those genes that were increased or what we call overexpressed were genes that were associated with the promotion of tumors genes that were associated with long-term chronic inflammation within the body and genes that were associated with cellular stress and as a consequence cardiovascular disease and to me that study impressed the fact that there is no aspect of your Wellness that seems to be able to retreat at the sign of sleep deprivation and get away unscathed it's almost like a broken water pipe in your home that sleep will leak down into every knck and cranny of your physiology and it will even tamper with the very DNA nucleic alphabet that spells out your daily Health narrative so I I paint this this picture which seems dire and it I think someone once said to me look your your Ted Talk which I think it was called Sleep uh sleep is your superpower they said that talk should have actually been sleep or else dot dot dot which was a completely fair thing because I think you know very early on as a public figure for sleeper um I did a terrible job I was very dictator I was very disagree um well I was I think I think I was very absolutist and I've I've learned my lesson I'm I disagree and and um and I'm going to interrupt intentionally uh not to to Puff you up just because but I I think that it's fair to say I know it's fair to say that the cautionary notes that you spoke about in those early TED talks and in your book why we sleep um while they may have stimulated some anxiety for some people uh they absolutely had and have a net positive effect in the sense that they cued people to the importance of this thing called sleep because prior to you doing that or those things it was the case that it was the I'll sleep when I'm dead mentality um and as somebody who's pulled many allnighters in his career many many um although not these days any longer thank goodness um I can tell you that that information was transformative for for my behavior and also for people in the Arenas of military Sports children adults I I it is fair to say that we have better parents better kids better citizens of every country as a consequence so I I uh won't allow you one of the few things I'll I you will have a hard line on I won't allow you to U malign your contribution um and the good news is this series is also going to include a lot of discussion about things that one can do anyone can do to improve their sleep so yeah and so enough with that for saying that I will I will stop trying to reject that um but I would also folks put in the comments on YouTube whether or not you agree with me or you agree with Matt and then um you know uh and thanks for agreeing with me um I would say though that please don't start as you mentioned there you're getting anxious if you're not finding it easy to fall asleep that listen to me is firstly probably not going to make matters any better but don't think even if you're in the general public that look I had one bad night of sleep does it mean I'm now going to develop Alzheimer's disease absolutely not there's we're not suggesting that we're talking about a model in which you know week after week month after month yes I've demonstrated that you know after just one night of something of short sleep you can see measurable impairments and we can and I can't you know I can't be untruthful about the scientific data but it's not as catastrophic as one may think and as you said in this series we will also speak and focus a great deal about what can you do to start to try to optimize your sleep so thank you for that opportunity absolutely so lots of things not good for us happen when we don't sleep enough on a consistent basis yes one poor night's sleep let's face it I mean our species would cease to exist if if that were the case because all these parents that have stayed up where you have a you know an emergency or that the neighbor's dog is barking or you you go to an airb B where it's too warm and and you can't sleep I mean um but clearly bad things start to happen when we are chronically sleep deprived we hear less often about the great things that happen when we get great sleep um perhaps we can talk about a few of those I mean obviously um many of them are going to be the inverse of what you just described but uh for instance learning neuroplasticity the nervous system's ability to change in response to experience uh sleep deprivation impairs learning yes yeah um and a great night's sleep makes it a lot easier to learn right so what are the data in terms of the relationship between sleep and learning again something we're going to go into in quite a bit more detail but can you give us a um uh can you can you throw us a bone about some of the can you incentivize us for getting good sleep not just through fear but we heard the sticks um you know throw us a carrot yeah so there are so many wonderful carrots so when you are sleeping your brain's capacity and its Learning Centers are so much more ready to absorb information so think about these memory centers in the brain almost like a dry sponge if you've been sleeping well and they are so excited to soak up new information and retain that information so firstly sleep before learning is going to help you acquire and imprint new memories very effectively and we've demonstrated that we I'll tell you about the studies in in a later episode we also know though sleep after learning does something delicious it will take those freshly minted memories and it will consolidate them into the brain meaning that it will start to fixate them almost like sort of setting them in concrete into the brain and so you are far less likely to lose those memories which is to say you are far less likely to forget if you've been sleeping after you've learned it's not just that though sleep does more than simply strengthen those individual memories sleep will start to Crosslink and connect those memories together and as a Consequence the next day you will wake up and those that memory back catalog has now been updated with all of the recent information and it's integrated and it's Associated so you are now able to come up with new Creative Solutions to issues or problems that you've been facing because you've updated what we call the associative networks in your brain and this is the reason that people will describe having had these insights by way of sleep and these problem solving capacities and really that's what to me a good student is not simply a student who can learn all of the individual wrote facts and then just regurgitate them an individual memory is not as sitting as an isolate island is not particularly useful that's why your laptop isn't well as long as it's not connected to the internet and and uh open AI it's not particularly intelligent I mean it has a storage capacity that is almost more perfect than your brain it doesn't make some of the the memory sort of mistakes that we do the reason it's not as intelligent as we are in part is because it has not integrated the information it doesn't link all of the wouldn't it be wonderful if you woke up one day and you'd installed a program on your computer and your computer just understood how all of the files were interrelated and connected and it was saying okay you you know you've double clicked on this file well now I'm going to tell you that there is this related information you should pull this in here and it would enhance this paragraph that you're working on or it would improve this experimental idea that you're coming it doesn't do that but your brain does that how does it do that in part it's because sleep is building these associative networks so it's not it's not simply the student who learns the rote facts it's the student who learns the facts and then understands what they mean sleep is not just about learning and it's not just about knowledge it's about wisdom which is knowing what it all means when you fit it together and that's one of the other roles of sleep so those are some of the beneficial things the sort of the the carrots that can come by way of for your learning and memory there are so many other carrots though we described for your immune system how there is this restoration that happens during deep sleep and it primes that but there are other benefits too one of the things that we've discovered and we hopefully we'll get to discuss this in more detail is that sleep provides almost a rebooting of your emotional and your mood States and as a consequence you wake up the next day and you are dressed with a very different set of emotional clothing and sleep when you're getting it almost it's like a set of emotional windscream wipers that it's just cleared those things off and you wake up it's the reason that people will tell you you know you if something is troubling you don't worry just come back tomorrow just give it a night of sleep and you'll probably feel better tomorrow that feeling better notion is sleep acting as this emotional bomb that just soothes that those Jagged edges that we've you know be sort of almost like a CD getting scratched if anyone out there knows all a CD is these days but you know these scratches that we get emotional wounds sleep is starting to heal those as well so those are benefits I could also mention some other aspects of your weight control and your weight gain and this is a huge huge effect size Sleep moves the needle on almost every aspect of brain and body health I think it's very clear at this stage that there is no single tissue or major physiological system in your body and no operation of your mind that isn't wonderfully enhanced by sleep when you get it or demonstrably imper when you don't get enough but when it comes to appetite and regulation of weight gain this is immense firstly what we know is that when you're getting sufficient sleep you can create a a nice um concentration ratio of two appetite regulating hormones called leptin and grin and let me go sort of in the reverse to probably give you a better example let me say I deprive you of sleep and what we see is that these two hormones that and I joke you know that sometimes sound like um leptin and grin sound like Hobbits from Lord of the Rings but they're not they're real hormones and leptin essentially is the signal that tells your brain okay your you're satiated by your food you're full and you don't want to eat more so hunger and appetite decrease grin does the opposite when grin increases now it's the signal of hunger and you get increasingly unsatisfied despite eating a f full meal if you've got still high levels of grin you don't feel satisfied with that meal and many people listening may start to say I have this feeling where I'm just eating and I just don't feel satisfied on some days and those days I suspect can be days when you are not sleeping well and I think everyone has had this feeling of saying I just didn't sleep well last night and I I just get ravenous and my I just unleash this Unholy hunger and an appetite that's in part because these two hormones so what happens is that when we're not getting sufficient sleep leptin the signal that says you're satisfied with food stop eating that is imper by way of a lack of sleep if that wasn't bad enough the hormone grin that says no you're not satisfied with your food eat more that's the signal of hunger that increases so it's almost like double jeopardy you're getting punished twice for the same crime of not sleeping once by way of a drop in leptin stop eating and once by way of growling foot to the floor acceleration I want to start eating that's in part why you're going to your waistline can start to expand when you're not getting sufficient sleep but when you do it's a it's a fantastic way of controlling I guarantee you if you start to implement better sleep your ability to regulate your basil levels of appetite and hunger will decline but it's not just that you want to eat less or you at least want to eat an appropriate amount for your body mass it's also what you want to eat and what we've discovered is that when you are again not getting sufficient sleep you start to eat more more yes you do but you eat more of specific things you crave things like these heavy hitting sort of stodgy carbohydrates like bread and pasta and potatoes and pizza and also you crave simple sugars and so those Foods we know in excess can be what we call obesogenic Foods they are foods that can lead you to a more rapid amount of weight gain whereas when you are getting sufficient sleep now you're reaching at the food bar for you're saying what I think the the salad and those healthy nuts and the fruits and those things look quite appetizing today versus when you are underslept all you want to do is go after the junk food and because you kind of got these Munchies what's interesting is that a recent discovery came back to that notion of the munchies when I say I got the munchies people sometimes think of a drug reference they'll say well been smoking weed I always get the munchies why is that because when you when you are bringing in cannabis into the body and these canabo these what we call exogenous canabo they will increase your appetite they will stimulate your appetite cannabinoids are appetite stimulating components but we all have our own version of cannaboids that we produce inside of our body that you've spoken about before called endoc canabo when you are underslept the brain releases more endoc canabo and that's in part why you get this strong impulse for and thus IO when you start sleeping better you moderate all of these hormones and these chemicals and your appetite is controlled when you eat you feel satisfied with your food you're not craving more when you make your food choices you're making better food choices we did a study with brain Imaging where we underslept individuals and we had them see food items inside of a brain scanner and they had to rate you know how much do I desire and how much do I want these items and those items range from very healthy items all the way to unhealthy items things like ice cream and sort of pizza and all of that good stuff and sweets um Candy as you would say over here and we looked at their ratings and by the way we to make this a more ecological because you could say Well they're going to know what's the healthy choice so they're probably just is going to be you know politically correct and say oh I desire the healthy food because the way that we tried to get around that was we said anything that you said was desirable when you come outside the scanner we've actually got all of these foods and you're going to have to eat them um so they were making more real realistics and each person went through the experiment twice one night after full nights of sleep one night with significantly less sleep and sure enough inside of the scanner they were rating unhealthier Foods as more desirable so your preference was going in that unhealthy Direction but what was interesting was what was going on in the brain we saw that the frontal lobe regions these sort of areas that sit above our eyes that almost act like the COO of the brain and they help regulate our deep emotional centers those regions of the brain had gone offline by way of a lack of sleep and these emotional centers that are usually associated with more honic reward and they're also excessively more active in people with obesity who have what we call honic eating patterns those regions were ramped up by way of a lack of sleep so it's not just that there are chemical changes in your body that conspire to have you eat more there are also changes in your brain that prevent you from making the healthy food choices but when you're getting sufficient sleep in the control condition when they were getting that sleep their brain was beautifully regulating the optimal food choices so that that's just another example of a carot carrot no pun intended now um that when you're getting sleep if one of the ways you want to manage your your body composition and manage your appetite is by way of getting sufficient sleep it's actually a very powerful tool that we probably underrate and then this other aspect I would say is emotional and mental Wellness everyone knows that your emotional and mood States will take a nose dive like a Dart into the ground when you're not getting sufficient sleep it's that idea of I just snapped dot dot dot and those are the words that usually you know are uttered by people who are not usually sleeping very well but when you're getting good sleep it's so much easier to regulate and manage those emotions and Michael Grand know great sleep research he did an interesting study and it was one of those studies many studies I read from my colleagues that my initial reaction to the study was jealousy because it was such a good study and I was jealous that I didn't think of the idea and now gradually with my senior age I've disabused myself of that ego and very quickly I then think this is the best favor and I can't wait to tweet it out but he did a great study and it was only quite recently he asked what are the reasons that people want to try to improve sleep you would have thought that we'd have known this you know decades ago and it's a relevant question to the point that you're asking which is about these carrots I know that there is still probably some degree of a sleep loss epidemic out there in the world there is still that sleep machismo mentality that I can sleep when I'm dead so how can we try to motivate people well I can do it with the stick and I can do the whole sort of you know if it bleeds it leads and do the Doomsday stuff and that can that can motivate but why don't I try to understand what it would be for most people that would have them try to enact better sleep behaviors and they asked all sorts of different options and the two things at the end of the paper when they did all the statistics that stood out like two sore thumbs I want to try to improve my sleep because I want to improve my mood I want to improve my sleep because I want to improve my body weight people know it they already knew it we didn't have to show them the data and so it's just interesting so I'm just bringing those two things up as a as carrot examples there are many others of course too terrific examples of carrots for uh that one can get if they get adequate sleep and we'll talk about quality and some other features of sleep that are important in just a moment but I'm curious how come when we are sleep deprived um we get bags under our eyes and our skin Health shows it like even one day you know if you know someone well and you see them regularly and they walk in and they they look particularly well rested yeah we you know we think they're you know kind of bright-eyed and bushy tailed um so to speak um but you can often see it in their skin and in their eyes how glassy their eyes are how open their eyes are but also the bags under under their eyes and of course folks um never say to somebody um you look tired um it's it's a the other way to um do it is just if if they look particularly well rested on a given day say you look well rested actually I told you that today you did that's right I would have forgot about that but now I remember um and and it's true you look very well rested being the the Sleep guy and all um why do why do we show our lack of sleep in our skin so rapidly it's almost like a a thermometer on on how much sleep somebody got the night before it it's stunning isn't it and you can almost see it you know if if you have a partner and they come through to the sort of kitchen in the morning and they look at you and because you're so familiar with that face because it's a face that has imprinted on you thousands of times you can notice subtle changes and you can sometimes sense you know they they do look tired but you're absolutely right you don't you don't say that you just say oh you know how are you this morning and is there anything I can do for you should I make you a coffee maybe you should go back to sleep and yeah yeah I think that's the that's the politically incorrect indirect way of saying boy do you look tired um two things on that that front the first it comes back to the immune system that that sort of pale paror in a face almost that sickly looking skin in PO is because you're already seeing the effects of the immune system and it's the same with the bags under the eyes that part of this reboot of the human being you know that human beings seem to have what I would describe as a recycle rate and it seems to be about 16 hours that after about 16 hours of wakefulness we need about an 8 hourish and it's 7 to n hours is the recommendation don't get hung up on we'll speak about exactly that in a second but it's that seems to be required to reset this whole panoply of of health and physiology of a of a human being one of the things is the immune system and you get this sickly look about individuals and you get the bags under the eyes so that in in part explains it there was a great study done by um a colleague of mine Tina sundelin and um working out uh in Sweden uh at the kolinska and this again was one of those studies that I just thought was so genius and it was a two-part study they firstly took individuals and they sleep deprived them for a night or they allowed them to sleep well in fact they went through both of those and after a full night of sleep or after a night of sleep deprivation they went into a studio and they had the picture taken they had a portrait shop done under identical lighting conditions so now for every participant in the study you've got two head shots one of when they were sleep deprived one when they were sleep rested great now came the second part of the experiment they then took all of those kind of head shots and they recruited a new set of participants who acted as an independent set of judges and those judges knew nothing about the experimental conditions and the manipulations that had just happened they were simply shown these images and they were asked to rate how attractive does this person look how healthy does this person look and how tired did does this person look and again they knew nothing about what was going on sure enough with very high statistical probability when the the head shot that was taken when they were underslept they rated that indiv idual as looking less attractive as looking more sickly in terms of their appearance and also looking more tired so first they had proven this thing called beauty sleep that you look a more attractive version of you when you are getting sufficient sleep but they also noticed this sickliness sort of composition to someone's face so that's a very long way of explaining the bags under the eyes I'm sorry I go off in these tangents Andrew and not a mentioned at all I asked you answered and um and here we are okay so you've been explaining the different dimensions of sleep the underlying physiology some of the psychological and physiological consequences of getting not enough sleep enough sleep Etc I think a question that everybody is asking themselves is a how much sleep should they get and B what is really great sleep and then of course there are all these other parameters of sleep you know leaving aside whether or not one sleeps you know a little bit reclined or on their side Etc you know how should we think about this activity that you're calling sleep you how should we break it down what are the variables that we need to think about in terms of being able to ask ourselves how well or poorly we're doing and for lack of a better way to put it to optimize our sleep so I think to me the question of what is good sleep at at first it seems to be obvious you can come through again to your partner in the morning and they'll say how did you sleep and you have an answer you know I slept well or I don't think I did sleep well so we all have some subjective sense but science for the most part um science and and medicine has usually used a singular rub rubric which I think is reasonable which is quantity so you would hear that okay how much sleep do we need and what would that look like to be good sleep and the answer is it's a quantity ative answer somewhere between 7 to 9 hours well actually I would answer it differently if someone said um how much sleep does an average person need I would say about 90 minutes more if you look that's the answer you would give every yeah yeah how much sleep do I need and I would say probably about 90 minutes more if you look at the average data but setting that 90 9 90 more uh if you look at based on the epidemiological studies of how much people actually are getting but that metric of quantity is the way that most of us and I've been you know certainly party to this as well have answered the question as what is enough sleep or what would be a good amount of sleep and good amount of sleep would be somewhere between 7 to n and that's the current recommendation that's the recommendation by many health organizations including here in the US which is the CDC they recommend or they stipulate a minimum of 7 hours for the average adult to me however that doesn't capture the true complexity that sleep really is and it is as we've now discussed in the episode a wonderfully complex um ballet of of of physiology and so I've stepped back and i' really tried to think to me what are the main components that would constitute this recipe for good sleep and I've conceptualized what I would describe as the four macros of sleep that there are you know we think of diet that we've got three macros fat protein and carbohydrate for me sleep actually has four macros and you can remember this by the acronym qqr T and it stands for quantity quality regularity and timing qqr T quantity quality regularity and timing and maybe I can just go into detail because I'm telling you you know these are the the rules for good sleep no one responds to rules they respond to reasons and not rules so let me explain the reasons behind each one of these so quantity we've already spoken about somewhere between 7 to9 for the average adult let me move on to Quality we measure quality in a variety of different ways the first principle quality measure of sleep is continuity so meaning was your sleep nice and continuous and you didn't wake up many times or was your sleep fragmented and littered with many Awakenings it was punctuated by these these Awakenings if it's very highly fragmented that's what we call poor quality of sleep that's low efficiency of sleep so maybe you would be in bed for let's say 9 hours and you still got 7 hours of sleep so if all you used was your quantity measure you would say well you've still had good sleep you've had 7 hours but two of those hours have been spent awake summed total so that is very low quality of sleep and it's what we would call a low score of efficiency so if you're looking at any of your sleep trackers that's probably best captured by Sleep efficiency what is sleep efficiency sleep efficiency is simply calculated as of the total amount of time in bed what percent of that time will you asleep so if I was in bed for 8 hours and I slept for 6 hours I would have a sleep efficiency of 75% because two out of the8 hours 25% of that time I was awake and an efficiency that is 85% or above we typically classify as healthy sleep and we would like to see you there or perhaps a little bit higher if you have a lower sleep efficienc score than that it usually means that you're awake too much of the time and we'll think about that and address that so that's one measure of the second Q of the qqr T that's quality but there's another measure that we can also use that measure comes back to the deep sleep that we spoke about and particularly the electrical quality of those brain waves so you can have deep sleep and it can be of different qualities electrical qualities you can have deep sleep that is is immensely powerful with huge epic waves or you can have deep sleep that still is classified as deep sleep but it's a little bit more sort of anemic in its quality and you can't really measure that with these sleep trackers we have to use electrodes and then we decompose the electrical brain activity using a fancy equation and that tells us what was the amount of sort of strength of activity what we call electrical power in that deep sleep regiment so that's another measure that we use for Quality next is regularity regularity and actually I should come back to to Quality for a long time in sleep science we were using quantity as our major metric for predictability meaning I look at your quality and does it predict your learning or your memory I look at your quantity and does it predict your blood sugar regulation I look at your Quant quanti does it predict your immune health I look at your quantity and does it predict your mortality risk and the answer has been yes that it quantity does predict many of those things that's great what was interesting is that if you look at the statistic of the predictability of quantity alone it was strong it was significant but it still left a lot of unexplained what we call variance so the it must be that there is some other things in sleep that are explaining these Health metrics in addition to quantity and quality has now come online I think in the past 10 years as carrying as much if not perhaps even more in certain domains of a predictive strength in determining your mental and your physical health that quantity has and it at least forced me in my own research to a always be me measuring quality in as high resolution as I can and always including it into a statistical model and we can do fancy things where we put those two things you know pit them head-to head and see which one actually holds more of the statistical weight but certainly quality sleep is as important I would say now at least as important as the quantity of sleep now you can't short Change on either you can't say okay did he just tell me that I should not worry about how long I'm sleeping but as long so you can't just get 4 hours of sleep that is incredibly good quality and get away with it but you also can't be in bed for 9 hours or 10 hours getting 7 hours of sleep but it's really bad quality of sleep you have to get both you can't short Change either one of those so at that point you think well isn't that the end of the story The QQ why do you need this R and T of qqr t the the regularity has come online I would say in the past 18 months as being a relevant metric when I say you you would say well hang on a second regularity and timing they sound like the same when I say regularity I mean when you go to bed and when you wake up if you keep that consistent that is the third piece of the the four macros that's regularity I go to bed at the same time I wake up at the same time plus minus how much so I would say plus or minus you know 30 minutes you kind of that's your wiggle room you don't want to try and everyone you know even I I have a I'm thly puritanical about my sleep not because I want to be some post a child and practice what I preach it's simply that if you knew everything I did about sleep it's an entirely selfish act to prioritize my sleep I don't want to die any sooner than I have to and I don't want to live with disease any longer and the greatest health insurance policy that I know of that is universally available largely free and mostly painless is this thing called the night of sleep so I'll gift it to myself every single night I don't see it as selfish because of course uh when we are ill or dead um there is a burden on others um it's it can be an absence burden or a or a presence burden depending depending depending on what and how people please look at me when you say presence about us but um that's interesting now when you say uh same wake up time same to sleep time plus or minus 30 minutes for each of those uh is that plus or minus 30 minutes uh getting into bed or are we talking about falling asleep entering that first stage one it's really from the time of lights out so okay I've been in bed and you know I I got into bed at the same time but last night I went to sleep about an hour later and then the night before you know I I got into bed I just turned the lights out and and then you know two nights ago I got into bed again at the same time but then I was kind of online shopping and I started chatting with a friend in a different time zone and then it was 2 and a half hours later before lights out that is what we would classify as irregular sleep and the reason that this this has really been forced on me as important there was a great study that came out maybe I'll get this wrong from about 5 months from the time of filming this ago and it was it used a huge database something called the UK biobank which is a wonderful database and they looked at over 60,000 individuals and they looked they were able to track the sleep from one night to the next to the next to the next so they had some Metric of this consistency this regularity and then they split those 60,000 individual into quartiles and in the St statistical model they looked at people who were most regular versus people who were least regular and they tracked them over years what they found and then they looked at their mortality risk How likely was it that those people would pass away during that study inter uh interval and they were also able to map what were they dying of if they passed away so what they found was that those people who are in the top quarti of being most regular relative to those people who are highly irregular if you had good regular sleep you had a 49% reduced risk of mortality relative to someone who was very irregular of that General allca mortality risk when you split it apart there was um a 35% decrease in cancer mortality specifically and there was almost a 60% drisking of cardiovascular mortality risk if you are regular versus irregular then they did this brilliant thing because they were measuring both the quantity of sleep and when these individuals were sleeping they did what I just said which is they put them into a statistical model sure enough the quantity of sleep just as we've shown time and in time again was very predictive of all cause mortality using that sweet spot of 7 to n hours and we can speak about what happens when you start to sleep longer because it's it's actually very unpredicted and it's very interesting but sweet spot of 7 to9 the shorter your sleep the shorter your life that's what the data seems to suggest but what they found was that that was true yet regularity or irregular sleep carried almost twice the effect size the magnitude of predictability that duration did and I think the whole field we knew that regularity I knew that regularity was important I don't think we understood how important and the strength of mortality drisking if you're regular or increased risk if you're irregular that this metric of R carried in the qqr T equation so I've started to be much more mindful myself at least and almost over index that um the final aspect comes on to timing and I should say that we've we've used this essentially this kind of equation this sleep algorithm as it were of qqr now in a lot of my work in the past at the Sleep Center in the past four or five years and it does seem to be a pretty good proxy of covering predictive wise many aspects of your health that if you use any one of these by themselves yeah they they help they predict things but if you use them as a collective that seems to be where you explain most of the variant now it's not a by far a perfect measure there are even more nuanced ways that you would want to split it and I want to split it but I would say that this is a pretty good proxy for the general public and it seems to be in our research a pretty good proxy for for health and wellness too the final aspect of the qqr quantity quality regularity comes on to timing how is timing different to regularity because regularity is about getting your sleep at the same correct time what I mean by timing is your chronotype so people may have heard of this phrase are you a morning type evening type or somewhere in between that it turns out is and it's about a third third split across the population maybe a little bit different does it divide up any differently according to male female and here I'm presumably we're not talking about children or teenagers that's a whole other business and we'll talk about that yeah yeah so once you are an adult and that because that pattern of your timing of sleep does change during development very much so despite you know we can all remember being kids and wanting to stay up with the grown-ups and and all of a sudden the last thing we remember was you know 7:00 comes around 8:00 comes around and you think great we're I'm going to stay up until 10: or 11:00 with them and then you wake up the next morning cuz you were carried to bed cuz she was lights out so setting that aside once you're an adult and you have your stable rhythm in place um it there there is variability now in sleep science we break it down not into three categories but five extreme morning type morning type a neutral evening type extreme evening type could you repeat those again so extreme morning extreme morning type so what what qualifies as extreme morning type so an extreme morning type would someone who would like to say go to bed around uh 8:00 p.m. and then they would be you know waking up and they wake up very easily around 4: 4:30 a.m. in the morning and they're bright as a bunny they are ready to get to the gym and I'm a neutral I just sit right in the middle so I'm kind of an 11 to 7:30 kind of guy okay maybe we could walk through the so the extreme morning type is um around 8 and they could be they could wake up at let's say 4: 4:30 and they would be fine um a a morning type maybe they would like to go to bed around 9:30 and then they're waking up closer to sort of 5:36 then you've got a neutral like me and I would like to go to bed probably around 11: p.m. and wake up around sort of 7:30ish I try to give myself about an 8 and a half hour time period in bed um and then you get get to the um the night owls um so then you've got the evening type and then the extreme evening type which finishes out the 4 five the evening type maybe they would like to go to bed like 12:31 and probably wake up around maybe 9 9:30 and then you've got the extreme evening type and they are not ready for bed until maybe 2:30 3:00 a.m. and they're waking up you know middle of the morning so what's interesting about your chronotype and by the way people you can if you want to find out your chronotype if you want an actionable suggestion you can just um go online and you can search for something called just type in chronotype meq and that stands for the morningness eveningness questionnaire meq just type in chronotype meq and you will see you can fill it out it takes 3 4 minutes series of questions and it will give you back a score and that will then bucket you into these different flavors and sort of say okay I've tried all of these and you okay and I I hate to admit it but if I had my preference I would go to sleep at 8 8:30 and wake up at 4:30 or so well let me ask ask you this question because rather than doing the meq I there's a single question I normally ask and say okay Andrew I now put you on a desert island alone and alone you you've got nothing to wake up for no electricity no responsibilities no nothing what time do you think your body would like to go to sleep and wake up and I say that specifically because if I ask you what time would you like to you're still biased in your head by all of the trappings of society and this terrible towards morning types do you think that naturally that's probably the regiment that you would do yeah great question I would go to sleep sometime between 90 and 120 minutes after Sundown yeah okay so that's why I I was going to answer I'm either an extreme morning type or a morning type I can go to bed around 9:30 wake up at 5:00 feeling great um or go to sleep early 8 8:30 wake up at 4:00 and really want to get up and write and exercise now that's not the schedule I follow I may uh start to follow that schedule I've tried for various um portions of my life but typically I end up defaulting to going to sleep a bit later 10 10:30 waking up around okay 6 630 and that's assuming that there are no events in my life that are disrupting my sleep because then I'm really going to sleep in if I can and a bunch of things to try and complate but assuming everything is cool in life um and in the room that I sleep um that's the spirit there you go I would say going to sleep at 9 and waking up at um yeah about 4:35 a.m. it feels great in fact I always thought of it as a bit of an anti-depressant feel I I don't consider myself somebody who's depressed but I can get a little low level malaise if I'm staying up till 11:30 12 and even waking up at 7:00 I don't feel quite right and when I go to bed early and wake up early I feel really really good you do all day long and what's interesting about that is it works both ways so that malaise that you're speaking about also happens for evening types who are forced to be M types unsympathetic no I'm kidding just kid just just kidding I mean Society is we are desperately biased towards the the morning types and we chastise and stigmatize evening types as being slothful or lazy that they just can't get it together why can't you be at the gym you know at 6:00 a.m. and in the office by 9:30 what's wrong 7:30 what's wrong with you I'm chuckling because I was weaned in Academia and the late Ben Baris who was my postto adviser and then later a uh a colleague that unfortunately he passed away in uh 2017 but he used to say I don't do mornings now he was our department chair at the time but he would just say I don't do mornings but he would come in around 11: a.m. or noon but he would stay until 3: in the morning I feel like there's been a a cultural shift I feel like um 10 years ago if you were the person who stayed late at the office or the lab you were considered a hard worker right but getting in early at that time it seems was not as rewarded nowadays maybe something's just changed in my world but I feel like the um the person who gets in first kind of gets the prize in terms of the the um psychological credential yeah I think there is there is that um reward bias that's given it's this notion you know the early bird catches the worm so I think the we we're desperately unkind Society is engineered towards morning types it's engineered against evening types the reason that that's not fair is that this and I'll come back to timing again and and how it works and why it's important and the fourth ingredient the fourth macro but coming to chronotype the reason it's unfair is that it's not your fault that your chronotype is largely genetically dictated and we Now understand that there are at least 22 different genes which augment your chronotype which determine your chronotype in other words it is gifted to you at Birth it's hardwired and it is not your fault yet we still have this stigma and this this I think disgraceful you know not only under appreciation but almost this kind of Ry look evening types are of a certain kind not very favorably viewed so think about it this way you would never let's think about another trait um eye color that is you know genetically determined and you were to look at me and you would say ah he's got blue eyes you know um it's just you're kind of lazy because you've got blue eyes oh you've got green eyes gosh that's wonderful that's well done congratulations wait a second it's not I I didn't get the choice it's genetic was the same with your chronotype but coming back to why me I included it in this sort of algorithm of what is good sleep if I were to take a an extreme morning type and force them to stay awake until midnight they're going to be incredibly tired they're going to be so tired and they're going to be grumpy and miserable and they will have no problem falling asleep the problem however is that they're still going to because of their C their natural chronotype which in which determines your Cadian Rhythm so everyone has this 24-hour circadian rhythm as you know you've been a wonderful proponent of that and done incredible work in this area we all have this 24-hour Rhythm and it looks like a sinusoidal wave it sort of goes up and we as a dial species were active and awake during the day and then you get this awesome downswing at night and we're inactive at night and it steps and repeats it's just 24 4our cycle everyone has that so what's why doesn't everyone fit the same chronotype timing model of sleep if we all have a 24-hour clock well what's different is that where that Peak and that trough sit on the 24-hour clock face varies from one individual to the next and that is what we call chronotype so this comes back to why it's important the morning type they are in their all their awesome Downs swing of the Cadian Rhythm at midnight and they are miserable they're desperate for sleep and when you put them into bed at midnight 4 hours later than they would otherwise they are gone the problem is their Cadian Rhythm now starts to climb back up around 4:30 in the morning and even though they went to bed at midnight they're probably going to wake up artificially before the 8 hour or 7 to9 hour completion and they're going to be short slept on the back end of sleep this happens to me many many times I want to go to bed around 8:30 or 9 but for social or work reasons I stay up until 11:30 or 12 I fall asleep very easily yep almost always have fallen asleep easily and then 3:34 in the morning I'm awake and you cannot get it's almost as though you tell I tend to do this yoga NRA non-sleep deep rest and sometimes I can fall back asleep that way but often times it's a struggle and so I've been and it's a struggle because of your chronotype and your Cadian Rhythm which is on its wonderful piston upswing now apologies for the Motorsport reference but I obsessed yeah I can't help myself I'm sorry Matt's a big F1 fan folks just as is Peter AA so anyway the awesome upswing that you're experiencing for your Cadian Rhythm prevents you from sleeping in further but now let's reverse the table let's take the evening type and I put them into bed at 900 p.m. or 10 p.m. when normally they will not be ready for sleep until 1 a.m. and they're lying in bed and they are wide awake and they cannot fall asleep and this is the principal reason that I will get evening types coming to me and they'll say look I think I've got terrible insomnia I just have and there are you know you can think about insomnia in lots of different ways but there may be two broad categories one is that you have sleep onset insomnia I can't fall asleep well the second is I have sleep maintenance insomnia which is the sort of the thing that you were describing which is where and you don't have I don't think you have insomnia but I'm just as an example you fall asleep quickly but you can't stay asleep that's the maintenance insomnia so they will come to me with the opposite of your concern which just they say I just cannot fall asleep and I say okay let me just ask you a few questions and we go through the chronotype questionnaire and it's very clear that they are an evening type and you know there's lots of different things that you would want to exclude to make sure they don't have insomnia and then you can say you actually don't have insomnia you you're just an evening type and you're going to bed at the wrong moment in time and if you to try to go to bed at midnight you're not going to suffer from the problems that you have and you'll sleep through later but of course their response is well I need to be in work by you know 8:00 a.m. and I've got an hour commute so I have to be awake at 6:30 so I need to be in bed by 10 so on both of these ends you can see that the morning type who goes to bed too late falls asleep easily but can't stay asleep the evening type who is forced to go to bed too early they can't fall asleep but then they stay asleep and when the alarm goes off at 6:30 a.m. they don't want to wake up so this is why when you sleep out of synchrony with your chronotype things do not look good so in those two circumstances let's say that I standardize it everyone is going to go to bed at 1 p.m. and wake up at 6:00 a.m. and let's say that we've got a a morning type not an extreme morning type who kind of likes to go to bed around 9:45 they are going to sleep very well it's very close to the Natural Rhythm so and then I get an extreme even in type who likes to go to bed at 2: a.m. and I have them sleep the same opportunity amount 8 hours at the very same time well surely they should be identical they're not going to be it's not that they don't have the same opportunity they do eight hours it's just that one is placed at the inappropriate time on the 24-hour clock for the evening type but appropriately for the morning type and thus the quality of sleep that they each have is very different and that's why you always need to build into a metric of what is good sleep it's not just about quantity or quality or getting it regular it's also about where do you place your sleep opportunity window on that 24-hour clock face to align with your chronotype when you fight biology you normally lose and the way you know you've lost is disease and sickness that's why to me that final te of qqr t is so critical does that sort of unpack and explain this this beautifully yes beautifully and as you were finishing up there I was thinking that um first of all we've heard of Corona types or many of us have but I the way you described it is um makes it extremely clear as to why this almost has to be the case because if we think about the extreme example of mistimed sleep which is shift work you know being awake at night and sleeping during the day you know essentially nobody has that chronotype yeah um but people force it upon themselves and by the way thank you shift workers we need you um you know if I have an appendicitis at 4:00 a.m. in the morning I'm very grateful for people who can help save my life right truckers Airline employees and on and on um nurses Etc parents taking care of kids in the middle of the night that shift work but we know that there are health issues associated with being nocturnal and sleep injuring the day um but of course there are a bunch of other variables like lack of a avability of sunlight if you're sleeping during the day and you're um and you're awake at night but I realized there's no reason to think that one can slide their sleep timing um around even by a few hours and still get away with it in other words this notion of chronotypes makes perfect sense it's just that the shift work is the most extreme example of being out of sync with with your with your chronotype so I'm certainly going to take this chronotype test but I'll tell you right now if I could get to sleep tonight at at 9: and wake up at 4: that would I that feel so good I'm going to put you in my car I'm going to do an intervention you are going to be in bed by 9:00 this evening non-negotiable fair enough this is um yeah well so we have q qrt right quantity quality regularity and timing how do we know if we're getting enough sleep and you know uh this is something that you know you say 7 to n hours um I've heard well if you're feeling alert during the day but perhaps have just a little bit of that postp perenial dip is it I get that right um then you're probably okay but presumably there's some other ways to to gauge whether or not we're getting enough sleep or not so there are certainly some ways that we do it in science and clinically but let's let's let those go for a second and just say for people listening what are some very easy tests I think the first test that I would offer is if you if your alarm clock didn't go off tomorrow morning would you sleep past your alarm clock and if the answer is yes which for many people it will be then you're not getting enough sleep you know no other species as well by the way artificially terminates their sleep it's so interesting but we humans will do it we'll wrench ourselves out of sleep now I told you that regularity is key and I do have an alarm clock I usually wake up close to it or a little bit before for it so I do Advocate an alarm clock in fact I would argue that you should have two alarm clocks you should have a toed alarm clock and to wake alarm clock you we only most of us only use an alarm clock in the morning why don't we have it to tell us when it's time to go to bed so I have both of those so I would say that it's it's good to use to keep yourself regular but truly if you would sleep past that alarm time then you're probably not you're not done with sleep your body isn't done with sleep and animals would not would never do that and so I think that's the first metric another metric sometimes it's not that incredibly specific but have you ever been driving day after day after day and sometimes you think I don't know if that light was red or green that I just went through inattentiveness your driving man um bite your tongue Walker bite your tongue so that was you may have been that's that's one you know potential concern in fact one of the ways that we've developed a metric for dose response to sleep deprivation is using concentration and alertness tests so in other words if there is a breathalyzer for a lack of sleep doing these concentration Focus concentration tests is they are so sensitive they're so predictive you get people just to focus on a screen and start to do very basic stimulus response and they can do that for the first minute two with stimulus response um for those that don't know might be uh uh three letters pop up on a screen and then you're you you pick uh two keys uh you you have access to two keys on a keyboard um if the if there're two letters that are similar you press right right key if there there's only one there aren't two or more layers that are similar you press left key simple simple things but we have to pay attention to a rule that's right you're just doing a lot of different um uh Trials of different rules and it just becomes monotonous it's not really very challenging you have P ATT and that perfectly mimics in some ways but we don't do it for two or three minutes we'll have you do it for 10 minutes and my goodness is it mind numbing I mean it's kind of just but it mimics very well think about you know just even a 1hour road trip at 10:00 in the evening and you're on the way the freeway all you've got to do is just focus on the road and the white lies are coming and there's nothing much to do and you've got to attend and focus not for 10 minutes but for 60 minutes when you are underslept one of the dangerous the big problems with a lack of sleep is that you don't know you are sleep deprived when you are sleep deprived and we know this because when I'm tracking your performance object ly it's going down and down and down but when I'm asking you subjectively how do you think you're doing in terms of your performance you say I'm hanging in there so far I'm I'm good so subjectively you think you're fine but objectively you're not the analogy would be a drunk driver at a bar you know they've had seven or eight beers they've had six shots and they pick up the car keys and they say to you look I'm fine to drive home and your response is no I know that you subjectively think you're fine to drive but trust me objectively you're not I'll just call you a taxi don't worry it's it's fine it's the same way with a lack of sleep so I make this point about going through the traffic lights because you can have these lapses of attention and these lapses of attention are caused by micro sleeps micro sleeps happen when the brain just very briefly it's almost like one of those toy ducks that kind of dips its bill into the water and then sort of comes back up again and dips your brain just drops down and has a quick sample of sleep and micro sleep and we can measure it in your eyelid that your eyelid starts to have what's called a partial closure and it just kind of goes half the way over or it closes fully shut that's a micros sleep even when it's half open your brain is essentially offline it's in a sleep-like state we can measure it and then it comes back online so I bring that that's a very long way of saying that's the second metric I would use are you having these absences where you just kind of lapse another is that you mentioned it before I just don't feel restored um you could say look I I sleep for probably around about 7 and 3/4 hours every night but I just don't I don't feel awake I don't feel refreshed I don't so can you operate without needing caffeine and have good grace good mood and good cognition without needing caffeine before 11: a.m. in the morning and if the answer is no you may be self-medicating your state of insufficient sleep but that metric of saying I sleep 7 hours and 45 minutes that's what my sleep tracker says but I don't feel refreshed that comes to the second que of qqr sufficient quantity of sleep my guess is that I would then look at the quality of your sleep and we probably find a deficiency in the quality of your sleep so there are these different sort of tools that you can use but a good one is do you feel refreshed and restored by your sleep it's not a guarantee any of these but in order to answer that question do you feel refreshed and restored by your sleep could we dig just a little bit into some of the Contour of the day so uh if I get a good night's sleep which for me means going to sleep early waking up early which tonight we are ABS that's the plan I wake up uh pretty quickly I'm alert upon wake up maybe 5 10 minutes to get out of a semi- groggy state but sometimes I'm just eyelids open I'm ready to go um is the uh latency from wakeup time to uh full alertness is that a relevant metric the other question is whether or not um the postp perenial dip is a relevant metric uh we established already that it's natural to feel a bit of an energetic dip at somewhere in the afternoon I think you said between 1 and 4 p.m. 1 and 4 yeah yeah something like that uh for me that's true between the hours of 2: and 300 p.m. um assuming all other things equal I just experienced that no matter what um but I could imagine some people are really dragging in the afternoon and they would like to know is that the normal postp perenial dip or is that a reflection of not getting adequate sleep is there any way that we could just dig into these two times of day as as a it's kind of a um a measure uh of evaluating one's duration and quality of sleep a little bit more beautiful questions I would say that one should not take necessarily either of those two as your best metric the reason is the wakeup component for some people like you you're waking up and you are good to go pretty much out the gate many people however will experience something called Sleep inertia which is this it's almost this just period of time it's a bit like a sleep hangover the first hour I'm going to have to come back to a car analogy it's like a classic car engine where you don't just pull out and you can rev it and it's you know it just needs you need to warm it up gradually bring the the oil temps up and the and at that point after about an hour you're up to operating temperature and you're good to go it's the sense of okay I walk through into the kitchen and sort of your partner maybe looks at the dishes and I say I know darling I know I said I was going to wash the dishes I I so sorry I forgot but can I just have my cup of coffee and I'll be the very best version of myself in about an hour can we discuss it then because right now I'm not the best version of myself that's sleep inertia and that is natural for many people now if you are an evening type and you're waking up early you're going to have a much heavier sleep inertia period than you would do that is natural to you but I wouldn't necessarily use that as the the direct measure because many people will have sleep inera and if you do you may get worried if I say oh it's the very best measure that you're not getting quality of sleep the postp prial dip as you mentioned there before even you the the the Monumental um organism called Andrew hubman even you can fall prey to that and do fall pre to so that's perfect I've actually learned to love it I just love it you know here it comes and I okay that's my circadian rhythm um we'll talk more about circadian rhythm in a few minutes but um and if I can get 10 to 15 minutes of shut eye time in that postp perenial dip then I really love it and you y and I bounce right out of that and we'll speak about how we were designed to sleep maybe in in a later episode two and whether that should be the way human beings are sleeping so I wouldn't necessarily use that I'm I always have this post penial dip does that mean I should be be worried about sleep I would say that if you have excessive daytime sleepiness throughout the day where you're constantly tired and that is a term that we use in in sleep medicine is excessive daytime sleepiness um or EDS um that should be of a concern I would use a slightly different metric of the same question but at a different time of day let's think about that Cadian rhythm again for most people even if you're a morning type or evening type by about 11 a.m. by about 11:00 a.m. midday you're really starting to get to your Peak you know most people are somewhere either side of the peak or around that Peak I would say that if you are feeling groggy and not alert and awake at 11 11:30 depending on your chronotype I would use that as probably the better metric of my daytime sleepiness but and by the way it's very interesting that that Peak if you look at that c Peak when you're at your optimal it's both your optimal for your brain but it's also for your body it's the point at which your core body temperat just starts to Peak that's the moment where you have optimal physiology and when you look at world records that have been broken in the Olympics and you plot them on the basis of time of day you see this incredible beautiful Spike where most people are breaking World Records right in that Cadian sweet spot around that midday Peri period why it's because that's the period where human physiology seems to be at its optimal thermal temperature at least it's fascinating fascinating right around sometime between 11:00 a.m. and 1 1 1 p.m. p.m. yeah depending on what time somebody goes to sleep and wakes up correct yeah and what time their chronotype is and that will very but on average because for me would be my Peak alertness and and physical ability uh work output um is somewhere between 10: a.m. and noon yeah y yeah and that fits both with your brain and my guess is that if we were to get you into the gym and have you go through your routine and see if we could do that routine once we've got a basil metric set of metrics I will have you do it at 7 a.m. then have you do it at 9:00 a.m. then do it at midday then 3 p.m. then 6 p.m. and then 10 p.m. same workout same human being but there will be definitive periods of time in the day when you are optimal and my guess is that that optimality of brain is matched by optimality of body such that your Peak Performance output and let's say your Peak jump height or your Peak muscle strength would be right around those time periods that fit with your own Cadian chronotype rhythmicity so you've been talking about this 24-hour oscillation in sleep wake activity called the Circadian rhythm maybe we can drill a little bit deeper into the Circadian rhythm you know what is it um what can shift it if it indeed can shift and I'm especially curious about forces other than the Circadian rhythm that have an impact on sleepiness sleep and wakefulness so the way we think about it in sleep science and there is some argument that it's maybe even more complex than this but for the most part there are two main forces two main processes that will determine when you want to be awake and when you want to be asleep the first of those we've spoken about which is your Cadian Rhythm and that Cadian rhythm is um you have a clock inside of your brain you have a central 24-hour clock and it's a master clock and that clock as you've spoken about many times is called the supermatic nucleus we don't have to get hung up on the the statement just think about it as your master 24-hour clock and it beats out this rhythmic sort of message of activity for us because we're dianal during the day and then inactivity at night activity during the day and it just goes up and down up and down every single day that's your Cadian Rhythm and that's the superism the reason I say it's the Master Clock we've now learned that there are these Cadian Rhythm clocks in almost all cells of the body you've got clocks all over your body in these sort of they're tiny little clocks but a little bit like Lord of the Rings just like there's one ring to rule them all well there's one clock to rule them all and that is the central brain clock the supermatic nucleus now you can dissociate those different clocks and you can get them kind of doing some funky things but for the most part it's the central Time Giver so you would think that well that's all you need to tell your brain and your body it's time to sleep or it's time to be awake it's not there is a second force in place here and it is called proc or we sometimes call it as process s or sleep pressure so you've got your Cadian Rhythm on the one hand going up and down every 24 hours but then you've got this funny thing called Sleep pressure sleep pressure comes down to a chemical that is called adenosine so from the moment that you and I woke up this morning and everyone listening a chemical has been building up in your brain that chemical is called adenosine and the more of it that builds up the sleepier and sleepier you will feel and after about 16 or so hours of being awake there is enough of that sleepiness chemical that adenosine um sleep pressure by the way it is a chemical pressure it's not a mechanical pressure you don't have to worry that your head's going to explode uh if you go longer than 16 hours a week but that sleep pressure is going to start weighing down you on your shoulders and you you can sense that feeling where you start to think ah it's you're watching television you you're starting to go down sort of the hill and you think I should go to bed I'm I'm tired now that's because of one of two things that's happening firstly you're getting to that Peak Crescendo of adenosine where it's just getting so powerful that it's knocking you over and you're ready for sleep usually when you are in synchrony with all of your biology these two forces your Cadian Rhythm that goes up and down every 24 hours and your sleep pressure align in this beautiful sort of frister Ginger Rogers dance partnership and they're in harmony the strange thing is that they know nothing about each other and they don't care about each other one does not influence the other they are completely too independent things but let me run it out in the normal circumstance and then I'll describe to you a good example of how I can separate those two and show you that they're truly independent so normally when we're in a sort of stable rhythm of sleep wake activity were awake during the day we've got this awesome upswing of orcadian rhythm and then in the evening let's just take you for example as you're getting into that sort of 8 00 p.m. region your circadian rhythm has finished its peak many hours ago and it's now starting to descend down and you're getting onto the Steep phase of its downward sort of stroke of its awesome downward movement but also don't forget that at that moment your sleep pressure your adenosine is also now at its peak you've been awake for now almost 6 hours so the moment when your Cadian rhythm is on its nice downward swing and your highest in your levels of adenosine in your sleep pressure that's the moment truly that will determine okay now is when I feel nice and sleepy so then what happens then you go to sleep you come down that curve of your Cadian Rhythm and you kind of hit its Nader its lowest point in the middle of your sleep phase but also when you go to sleep that second factor of sleep pressure you are your brain gets the chance to clear away that adenosine and it seems to be about a 7 to n hour period of sleep is enough time for your brain to jettison all of that adenosine that has been building up across the 16 hours of Prior wakefulness and then these two things align beautifully again when it comes to your natural wakeup time you've been asleep for let's say 7 and 1 half hours you've cleared out all of that adenosine so you no longer have the weight of that sleepiness pushing you down but also your Cadian rhythm is now on its awesome upswing and when those two things align when you've dissipated and jettisoned all of that sleep pressure and your Cadian rhythm is starting to rise now that's the time when you would naturally wake up so that's things when they are working well and in alignment let's say that I now take you and I'm going to deprive you of sleep for 24 hours so now coming into sort of 10 p.m. your Cadian rhythm is dropping down and your adenosine is starting to get high and by about 2 a.m. you're probably not going to be happy by about 4 a.m. or 5: a.m. you're miserable why because you've now been awake let's say for almost 20 hours straight so you've got all of this excess sleepiness adenosine pushing you down screaming at you you've been awake for 20 hours and your circadian rhythm is at its lowest point desperately wanting to pull you into this thing called sleep and you feel terrible but then something strange happens by 11:00 in the morning relative to let's say you know four you've now been awake for many more hours still so you've built up up even more adenosine so the prediction would be that if it's just adenosine alone that makes the difference you should feel even worse at 11:00 a.m. you don't you feel better despite being awake for longer why because your Cadian Rhythm has come to the rescue and it's now starting its upswing and it lessens the distance between those two and you feel a little bit more alert but then as I push through later into the day by about 6:00 p.m. 7:00 p.m. you're now on your Cadian down Swit once again and you've been awake for even longer and at that point there's almost nothing that can keep you awake you're going to be falling asleep on your feet and your toast but that's a nice demonstration of how you can separate those two and despite one continuing on you can start to feel better because the other has come to your rescue and that shows me that your Cadian Rhythm doesn't care about how much adenosine is in your brain it's just going to keep going up and down up and down every 24 hours and your Denine level doesn't really care much about your Cadian Rhythm it's going to just build and build and build the longer and longer that you're awake and then get dissipated whenever it is that you sleep the clearance of adenosine uh I'm curious about it how does that work um so this chemical adenosine is building up in our brain does it also build up in the body um it does but in the brain it has this very interesting influence now I've described it as making you sleepier and it does that's exactly what it does but it does it in a very very interesting way it's a a bidirectional way there are at least two different um adenosine receptors or adenosine welcome sites within the brain and adenosine is very clever in how it makes you sleepy adenosine as it's rising will turn down the volume on the Wake promoting regions of your brain but yet will increase the volume on your sleep promoting regions and by way of this Jewel action that's how it seems to instigate this feeling of sleepiness by temping putting the brakes on wakefulness but hitting the accelerator pedal on sleepiness but then adenosine seems to be part or one of the reasons that it builds up is because it's a metabolic byproduct of cellular activity of cellular metabol ISM and it seems to be that the longer that we're awake because our brain is very cerebrally active during the day even though I told you that the brain state of sleep is very active it is it's a very metabolically active state of sleep it is less metabolically active however during deep non-rem sleep and it seems to be that it's deep non-r sleep that is the principal time when we clear we get the chance to clear away adenosine now now adenosine clearance is happening all of the time it's just that the rate of accumulation when we're awake exceeds the speed with which we can naturally clear but when our brain goes into deep non-rem sleep and becomes less metabolically active it's not as though there's necessarily a more active or a very proactive state of Deep Sleep doing that cleansing it's not it's the same process of adenosine clearance it's just that there is no longer the accumulation that's happening so it gets the chance to catch up on the days adenosine accumulation and then reduce down that adenosine debt and then get you to net net neutral by the morning in fact the amount of Deep Sleep the quality of that deep sleep that you're getting specifically the electrical quality of your deep sleep is a very good predictor of how well you dissipate that sleepiness again it's not as though there's something special about non-rem sleep that is proactively doing the cleansing faster than happens when we're awake it's just that the rate of accumulation when we're awake is greater than the exceeding and exceeds the capacity of the clearance so it builds up when we go into non-rem less metabolically active it now the clearance exceeds the buildup and you're able to cleanse that debt I have two more questions the first is about growth hormone so I was taught that growth hormone is released primarily in sleep although there are some daytime activities that can promote the release of growth hormone as well certain forms of exercise maybe some thermal stimula Etc but that the major event of growth hormone release occurs in sleep is that true it is although it there is some argument that it is is it sleep dependent or is it simply sleep coinciding okay meaning that is it it's that at the time of day so is it a cadium process where it's just nighttime Nur means that you release growth hormone or is it nighttime plus sleep that is needed and it seems to be a mixture of both but it seems to be more sleep dependent than it is nighttime dependent and sleep independent I probably probably should have said before growth hormone critically important for growth of children during development but also for tissue repair and Metabolism throughout the lifespan throughout the lifespan when we're adults we critically need it right so if I understand correctly when one goes to sleep growth hormone is released but that there's a circadian component as well so it's a bit of an and gate as they say which is that you need this and that in order to get growth hormone release and the reason I ask this uh and I'm going to frame it this way because I think it's going to both clarify what you said um and also lead to a practical uh step which is about sleep regularity and timing I've heard that the growth hormone surge is greatest at the beginning of the night of sleep and that if we go to sleep a few hours later than usual we miss the opportunity to experience the same level of growth hormone release even if we sleep the same total number of hours right so um yet more incentive for uh regular sleep timing yes so you're right it's an and gate so it's night ESS does help but sleep helps perhaps significantly more meaning that I can have you experience the nighttime but I can deprive you of sleep and selectively of deep non-rem sleep and I can markedly imper your growth growth hormone release but differently I think it tell me if this is correct but differently if somebody has to work the night shift and they sleep during the day they'll still get a growth homeone release but not as much growth hormone release were they to have slept at night correct so we can do it one of two ways so my way is to say I keep you on a dial nocturnal sort of schedule where you're awake during the day and you asleep at night but I'm going to selectively deprive you of just your deep sleep at night so you're still sleeping and you're still spending the night ESS in bed which is not the shift work version but I can block or not block I can reduce significantly reduce your growth hormone because I selectively deprived you of sleep or I can do the opposite which is the shift work approach which is I'm not going to deprive you of sleep you're going to sleep during the day but now I have held sleep constant so in my version I have held night ESS constant and I've manipulated sleep in your version the shift worker we've done the opposite we've held sleep constant they're sleeping during the day but we've manipulated nighttime Ness and now as you said yes they will release some growth hormone even though that's not the natural time on the 24-hour clock when we would see growth hormone released why because they are getting sleep because it's a somewhat sleep dependent process but they're not going to necessarily release as much in part because they're not experiencing sleep at nighttime phases so you can you can elegantly separate those two out and that's why it's not quite one or the other but it seems to be both certainly it's sleep sensit I would say sleep sensitive is a very good way of describing it okay so translated to uh actionable protocol everyone should strive to get uh sleep ideally at night um of sufficient quality and quantity which you already discussed and getting sufficient amounts of deep sleep is going to be especially important for sake of growth hormone release correct got it my my last question has to do with the other end of the Sleep Cycle which is toward morning and waking which is the hormone cortisol we hear so often these days about cortisol and people often frame it as bad cortisol is bad you hear this that is simply not true remove cortisol from an organism they don't they will not do well right and um we need cortisol uh for immune system function for waking for certain forms of memory formation although too much cortisol is a Bad Thing indeed not enough cortisol is an equally bad thing indeed so um what is the relationship between cortisol and emerging from sleep and put differently what is the relationship between deep sleep and cortisol meaning is sleep one way that we keep cortisol at Bay during stages of the 24-hour cycle when it would be delerious to have elevated cortisol yes it is and that's one of I spoke about and we'll come on to this perhaps in when we speak about emotional and mental health and when we are underslept we shift over into a more sort of activated sympathetic you know agitated state of our nervous system that's that's one aspect of it but there's another aspect of the stress response which is yes you get elevated heart rate you're more sympathetic which is this activated State rather than parasympathetic but you also get when you're sleep deprived a greater release of the stress hormonal axis which is called the HPA axis which if you really want to go to detail it's the hypothal pituitary adrenal axis which is a fancy way of saying that it's a signal from your brain going down to release cortisol so when you go into deep sleep not only do you shift over into the nice quiet rested quiescent state of the nervous system but you also get a dissipation in that stress related axis and the relief of cortisol cortisol however seems to be also under the strict control of your Cadian Rhythm where it drops down at night and in fact you have one of the the steepest declines right at the moment when you're starting to get sleepy too almost as though your brain and your body know we can't have cortisol even at sort of normative levels that you would have during the day because otherwise this person is just going to still be a little bit too wired M this is the problem with a stressful event after say 8:00 p.m. at night if you see see something stressful experience something stressful I mean that um if it's stressful enough will spike your cortisol at that late hour can really impede your entire sleep structure it's a I would say it's one of the things that I would advocate in terms of a good sleep optimized routine and we can come on to that and avoiding stress and arguments and TR and disturbing news and things like that as much as as possible yeah um in the late evening and and early night hours even if you don't think you're necessarily someone who's sensitive to that now it turns out I am someone who is sensitive to that it can really quite trigger me so I stay away from it we often see this with insomnia too and we call it the tired but wide phenomenon and people will say to me look I am just so tired man I am so so tired but I'm just so wired that I can't fall asleep I'm desperate for sleep I know I want sleep but I can't fall asleep cuz I'm just so wide and that is a sympathetic hyper cortisol State and we you can see it in their physiology but coming back to your question cortisol will drop naturally throughout the night but then it starts to rise back up and will start to produce its fantastic sort of peak climbing rate right at the moment when you would naturally again want to wake up so what we we're mapping here is this wonderful tapestry this Kaleidoscope of coordinated biology that your adenosine levels are finally coming to their lowest point your circadian rhythm is starting to rise your cortisol levels are starting to rise your core body temperature is starting to increase because it's dropped throughout the night all of these things unite in this beneficial timing ballet of just brilliant that naturally has you waking up and feeling like you're ready to go if everything is aligned if you've got your chronotype right your sleep quantity your quality regularity and your sleeping you know in appropriate sort of timed amounts well your enchantment with sleep is indeed infectious uh I've experienced it and I know that everyone listening and watching has experienced it as well as you've taken us through this truly spectacular Voyage through this phenomenon that we call sleep I mean you informed us about what sleep is what the different sleep cycles are uh how they are structured and interrelated uh you talked to us about the four macronutrients of good sleep quantity quality regularity and timing it's highly actionable information and then of course some of the hormonal neurochemical uh interactions and consequences of good sleep bad sleep for mental health physical health and performance so first I'd like to just extend a giant thank you for taking us on this Voyage in this first of several or more episodes uh of this miniseries on sleep and I very much look forward to our discussion in the next episode about how to improve one's sleep and perhaps even optimize one's sleep so thank you Matt ever so much on be

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today we are discussing peptides peptides are a topic that's receiving a lot of attention these days in part because of the excitement about the so-called glp1 analoges or Agonist glp1 stands for glucagon like peptides these are drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes as well as drugs used to treat obesity today we are not going to discuss the glp1 analogues however we are going to discuss some of the other peptides that are receiving a lot of attention these days including peptides for tissue healing and repair as well as peptides that impact longevity and vitality now in principle any discussion about peptides could be enormously vast and that's because there are so many different kinds of peptides and by the way I will explain what a peptide is in just a few moments but for instance insulin which is involved in regulating our blood sugar or blood glucose levels is a peptide oxytocin which is sometimes called the love hormone although I wouldn't say that's the best description of what oxytocin is it's a neuropeptide hormone that is involved in everything from parir bonding to socialization but a bunch of other things as well those are just two examples of peptides that are familiar to most people at least by name and that exist within the tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of different peptides that EX exist within our brain and body today's discussion is going to focus on peptides that are increasingly being used for therapeutic purposes and I want to point out something very important about this topic area first of all it is a topic area for which there is a lot of confusion the mere naming of the peptides is confusing often times they're referred to Simply by virtue of acronyms and numbers like bpc 157 or mk677 etc etc such that if you're not really familiar with them it can be a bit overwhelming and Confused today I'm going to provide a very simple organizational framework that will allow you to understand what these different therapeutic peptides are why certain ones may be advantageous for certain purposes of course also highlighting the potential risks and in some case outright dangers and I'll tell you how they each work alone and in combination toward achieving specific physical and in some cases even mental health goals I'd be remiss if I didn't say at the outset here that a lot of what's happening with applied therapeutic peptide biology falls into one of three categories there are peptides that are being prescribed by physicians so these are prescription peptides for specific purposes these are FDA approved there are other peptides that reside in kind of a gray market area you can purchase them online but the safety and efficacy of those peptides is a bit questionable in some cases very questionable and I'll give you some filters to determine uh which category certain peptides fall into and then of course there's the black market peptides it is possible to buy peptides online through any number of different sources and of course I do not suggest people purchase Black Market peptides it's very clear that a lot of them are contaminated with things that both in the short term but especially in the long term can be problematic so if you're interested in understanding or using therapeutic peptides today's episode is for you before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is matina matina makes loose leaf and ready to drink yerbamate I often discuss ybba mate's benefits such as regulating blood sugar it's high antioxidant content the ways that it can improve digestion and possible neuroprotective effects I also drink yante because I love the taste while there are a lot of different choices of yamate drinks out there I love because again they have the no sugar variety as well as the fact that both their loose leaf and their Cann varieties are of the absolute best quality so much so that I decided to become a partial owner in the company although I must say even if they hadn't allowed me to do that I would be drinking matina is the cleanest tasting and best yeram mate you can find I love the taste of brewed loose leaf matina yerbamate and I particularly love the taste of maa's new canned cold brew zero sugar yerbamate which I personally help them develop if you'd like to try matina go to drink maa.com huberman right now matina is offering a free one PB bag of loose leaf yerbamate tea and free shipping with a purchase of two cases of their cold brew yerbamate again that's drink maa.com huberman to get the free bag of yamate loose leaf tea and free shipping today's episode is also brought To Us by levels levels is a program that lets you see how different foods and different activities and your sleep patterns impact your health by giving you real-time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor now blood glucose sometimes referred to as blood sugar has an immediate and long-term impact on your energy levels and your overall health one of the best ways to maintain focus and energy throughout your day as well as to keep your so-called metabolic Health in best order is to make sure that your blood glucose never spikes too much nor does it get too low with levels you can monitor how different foods and food combinations impact your blood glucose levels on a momentto moment basis I've been using levels for some time now and it's really helped me understand which foods and food combinations exercise schedules and sleep schedules are optimal for my blood glucose levels and how that translates to energy levels and other metrics of Health if you're interested in learning more about levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor you can go to levels. l/h huberman levels has just launched a new CGM sensor that is smaller and has even better tracking than before right now they're also offering two free months of membership again that's levels. link l nk/ huberman to try the new sensor and two free months of membership today's episode is also brought To Us by ju ju makes medical grade red light therapy devices now if there's one thing I've consistently emphasized on this podcast it's the incredible role that light can have on our biology and of course I'm always telling people that they should get sunlight in their eyes as soon as possible possible after a waking on as many days of their life as possible for sake of setting circadian rhythm daytime mood focus and alertness and improv sleep now in addition to sunlight red light and near infrared light has been shown to have positive effects on improving numerous aspects of Cellar and organ Health including faster Muscle Recovery improved skin health and wound healing even improvements in acne or that is removal of acne reducing pain and inflammation improving mitochondrial function and even improving vision itself what sets ju apart and why it's my preferred red light therapy device is that it has clinically proven wavelengths meaning it uses specific wavelengths of red light and near infrared light in combination that trigger the optimal seller adaptations personally I use the ju handheld light both at home and when I travel it's only about the size of a sandwich it's very convenient to use I also have a ju whole body panel and I use that about three or four times a week if you would like to try ju you can go to jv.com /h huberman ju is offering an exclusive discount to all huberman lab listeners with up to $400 off select ju products again that's ju jv.com huberman to get $400 off select ju products so what is a peptide a peptide is a small Protein that's made up of little chains of amino acids now the moment people hear protein they usually think proteins that you eat or perhaps they think about four calories per gram of protein and that sort of thing keep in mind that we have lots of different kinds of proteins within our body that have nothing to do with the proteins that we eat now it is true that many of the amino acids that comprise peptides as well as other proteins in the body come from the foods that we eat because the amino acids again are the building blocks of peptides and other proteins the basic way that we Define a peptide is that it tends to be a small protein meaning chains of anywhere from 2 to 50 amino acids that's really the strict definition of a peptide however of often times peptides that are a little bit bigger so maybe 75 or 100 amino acids in length will also be considered a peptide now if you start combining different peptides together you get what's called poly peptides and many of the proteins in the body are poly peptides so just to get a mental image of what a peptide is a peptide basically looks like beads on a string where there are two to 100 beads and each of those beads represents a different amino acid and the arrangement of each amino acid relative to one another that is their order along that string determines what the peptide is and what the peptide does the other thing that's important to understand about peptides is that some peptides are hormones other peptides are merely called peptides proteins others are neuromodulators meaning they adjust the activity of neurons and some peptides multitask and do many things in fact I think it's fair to say that most peptides have what are called pleotropic effects meaning they affect many different aspects of cells and this is very important to understand because unlike a lot of our discussion on this podcast about dopamine or about specific hormones like testosterone or estrogen when we talk about peptides especially therapeutic peptides often times we're talking about a single peptide that does a bunch of different things depending on the cell type the time of day or night that that peptide is present and even the different so-called Downstream effects of the peptide what do I mean by Downstream effects well when a peptide binds to a receptor on a cell surface okay and you can just think of that process as a little parking spot on the surface of a cell and the peptide if it's available will bind to that receptor and then set in motion a kind of Bucket Brigade a sort of conveyor belt of cellular processes for instance activating one pathway for cellular growth and another pathway for cell migration for the cell to actually move and maybe another Pathway to talk to another cell to stimulate say the growth of blood vessels in other words lots of different or pleotropic effects this is important because when we're talking about peptide Therapeutics rarely if ever are we talking about a very targeted and very specific effect of these peptides and this is important both in terms of thinking about what effects you're going to get of taking a given peptide if you decide to do that as well as potential side effects as well as things like how to adjust dosage and how long to take a peptide whether or not to cycle the peptide Etc so I just gave you a very simple description of what a peptide is and the fact that they have pleotropic meaning many different effects both within cells and across different cell types and of course across different organ systems so rarely if ever will you hear that a peptide does one thing most often a peptide does anywhere from four to maybe even a thousand different things and again we can go back to our basic examples of peptides like insulin like oxytocin and say for instance oxytocin it's known to be involved in milk let down during lactation it's also known to be involved in pair bonding in both males and females as well as pair bonding between parent and child maybe even parent and pet so the point is that if you want a specific biological effect maybe you want to repair a given injury or you'd like to get more growth hormone in order I don't know to get leaner or to recover from exercise more quickly or to feel more Vitality yes there are peptides that can impact those Pathways but always always always if you take peptides especially theraputic peptides designed to promote activity within a given pathway for a specific purpose you are going to activate other Pathways as well there's simply no way to remove the pleotropic feature of peptide Therapeutics nowadays there's a lot of interest and indeed growing interest in peptide Therapeutics and there really three different paths by which people obtain these peptides the first is by prescription from a board-certified medical doctor so some peptides have been approved for one use but they can be prescribed also for off Lael use and here we're talking about FDA approved clinically tested peptides but many cases they've been clinically tested for one particular area of medicine so for instance the peptide cellin which promotes the release of growth hormone has been FDA approved for the treatment of short stature but it is often now prescribed for other things as well where a physician and their patient agree that augmenting the growth hormone pathway would be useful now regardless of the specific use in mind it's absolutely clear that the safest and best situation if one is going to use therapeutic peptides is to use prescription therapeutic peptides where the prescription comes from a board certified physician and the reason for that is severalfold first of all sometimes these peptides come from Pharma companies other times they are made by a compounding pharmacy but in both situations they are cleaned of what's called Lippy polysaccharide or LPS LPS is something that can accumulate in the manufacturing process of some of these peptides and it's something that you really want to remove from the peptide before you ingest it or inject it most peptides are injected either subcutaneously or into the muscle although some can be taken orally or even a topical cream we'll talk a little bit about different modes of delivery a little bit later in any case getting the LPS out and making sure that the peptide is pure is very important the reason is that LPS causes an immune response and while a tiny amount of LPS might not cause a massive immune response the accumulation of many many LPs exposures can start to become problematic and the other sources of peptides which are gray market and black market often times do contain the same peptide that one would get from a prescription from a board certified physician but very often they haven't cleaned out the Lippy polysaccharide they haven't removed the LPS and that can start to create problems over time and of course in the case of Black Market sources especially often times the peptides are not what they claim to be on the label or from a particular source so that's especially problematic so I want to be very clear about my stance on this if you are going to explore peptide Therapeutics I highly highly recommend indeed I implore you to do so with a board certified physician and to acquire peptides through a reliable source where the LPS has been removed which typically means from a pharmac company or from a compounding pharmacy okay so let's talk about specific peptides for specific purposes today we're going to cover four general areas in which peptide Therapeutics can be useful the first is for rejuven ation and repair of basically any tissue but in particular muscle and connective tissue so Sports type injuries but also things like gut so for people that suffer from IBS irritable bowel syndrome or from colitis or from other gut issues there is a potential use for therapeutic peptides then we're going to discuss therapeutic peptides for metabolism and growth of frankly all tissues as soon as people hear metabolism and growth generally people think of fat loss and muscle growth and indeed those fall under this category but there are a bunch of other tissues for which you may want to improve metabolism and perhaps growth as well so we'll get into that then we'll discuss therapeutic peptides specifically for longevity both staving off tumor growth as well as potentially and I want to highlight potentially increasing lifespan although this is a very experimental area at present and then we'll talk about therapeutic peptides for increasing Vitality both mood and libido in both men and women okay so let's discuss peptides for Rejuvenation and repair of tissues now it's pretty common to injure a given tissue you know to uh you know strain a tendon or tear a ligament or break a bone or I don't know any number of different things this is just kind of part of life if you uh play sports or if you exercise frequently sooner or later people tend to get injured and when one does there's you know a lot of different things one can do there's a lot of debate nowadays about whether or not you should emphasize cold or whether or not you should emphasize heat there seems to be a growing now the answer to this isn't entirely clear and as I always say anytime you want to answer a question about kind of the why something evolved to be a particular way you have to remember that neither I nor anyone else was involved in the design phase it's just is what it is so we have to be careful about making up just so stories about why something is doing what it's doing or how it got there so why would there be a peptide within the gut that's involved in tissue healing and repair well in order to understand that it's important to understand that the lining of your gut all along it length involves a bunch of different layers of cells that turn over at a pretty frequent rate so unlike your brain cells that for instance after about age 25 you're not adding or deleting many brain cells at least provided there's no injury or nerve degenerative disease you're not removing a lot of those brain cells but you're also not adding many brain cells there are few areas of the brain like the olfactory bulb and the dentate dryers of the hippocampus where there is some turnover but for the most part the neurons you have at about age 25 are the neurons that you're going to have for the rest of your life your gut is very different within the millu of the gut you have a lot of turnover of cells and the turnover of cells in the gut is in many ways the same sort of turnover process that's involved in wound healing and repair like if you cut your skin another tissue or organ in this case that involves a lot of turnover of cells because as you know if you cut your skin at some point it will heal up you know first there'll be a scab then that scab will um give way as the tissue underneath it mends and that mending of the tissue is the addition of new skin cells as well as other cell types so the fact that there is a peptide in our gut that can be involved in tissue turnover and tissue turnover is equivalent to tissue repair is not all that surprising now it's important to understand that anytime we're discussing tissue Rejuvenation that is cellular turnover or tissue repair so any kind of wound healing a small wound or a big wound it almost certainly is going to involve angiogenesis which is the development of new vascular Supply or blood supply now of course vascular Supply arrives by capillaries veins and arteries and typically when we're talking about angiogenesis in the context of tissue Rejuvenation and repair we're talking about the addition of new capillaries and or blood vessels and that means the addition of new what are called endothelial cells which are the cells that make up the walls of those blood vessels so put simply if you want to rejuvenate a tissue or you want to repair a tissue you need additional blood supply and one of the clear effects of bpc-157 is to both encourage cellular turnover as well as cellular migration so new cells and cells moving into a given area as well as new blood supply through the promotion of this process we call angiogenesis so you can imagine for instance that maybe you U injure your elbow and you do so in a way that impacts a bunch of different tissues maybe some of the nerve cells the neurons there are severed okay or crushed so that might lead to some pain there but it might also lead to some inability to move that joint or that limb as well as you could previously probably also some damage or some crushing to some ligament tissue and some tendon tissue maybe even to some musculature a bunch of different tissues are impacted and one of the things that bpc157 has been shown to do in animal studies and I really want to emphasize animal studies because that's where the vast vast vast majority of data on bpc157 come from well it's been shown to increase blood flow to a given area by virtue of increased angiogenesis so basically to promote the development of new blood vessels to the entire injury site and the way it does that is very interesting bpc-157 somehow is able to recognize injured blood vessels and injured capillaries and then to promote the activity of a given enzyme called Enos or endothelial nitric oxide synthese which then causes more blood vasculature to form at the injury site and around the injury site that in turn allows for the delivery not just of blood but for the stuff that's contained within blood including growth factors that then promote the further Rejuvenation of different cell types in the given area so the things that could potentially lead to repair of muscle repair of ligament repair of tendon Etc and then bpc157 is known to further encourage the growth of capillaries and veins within the injury area so it both calls in the development of new vasculature and it promotes the growth of that new vasculature bpc-157 is also known from animal studies to encourage fiberblast migration and growth within a site of injury fiberblast are a key cell type within an injury and they provide some of the really firm strong substrate for bridging injuries and that allow different things like tendons and ligaments to restore themselves from say torn or partially torn to a complete tendon or ligament now there's a very long and kind of interesting history of the use of gastric juices okay I know the term uh might make a few people queasy but gastric juices to promote tissue healing and repair now there's a whole history of focusing on gast juices or at least the stomach environment for keeping given tissues alive so that they can be repaired later I know this sounds a bit gruesome but one can find in the historical medical literature instances of people say severing off a finger or even a hand uh or things of that sort and then it being placed by a surgeon of course or in some cases these were Battlefield um situations into the gut as a way to preserve that finger or hand and keep it alive essentially and then to graft it back on or to make an attempt to graft it back on so that the person could then use those fingers or that hand again and while not always successful it was clear or at least the idea started to form that tissues that were placed inside the milu of the gut stood a better chance of being grafted back on now you could think of a number of different factors that could impact the improved grafting of tissues placed in the gut until the graft could take place you know it could be uh the heat of the environment it could be uh the fact that the hand or finger is not exposed to things out in the world so less bacteria Etc nonetheless Physicians were intrigued by the idea that maybe something within the gut itself and in particular within gastric juices were beneficial for preserving and maybe even rejuvenating tissues and one particular peptide compound turned out to be bpc body protection compound which again is synthesized as bpc157 so there's a real logic here but what we haven't really addressed is if one has an injury let's say the hand or um to the arm or to the leg or to the ankle or to the Achilles tendon how is it the body protection compound that normally would exist within the gut actually access that injured tissue now this Still Remains somewhat of a mystery it is clear that bpc 157 can exit the gut but how it gets traffic to particular sites within the body that are injured still isn't clear that said within the community of people that use bpc157 for therapeutic reasons for tissue Rejuvenation and repair there's sort of been an ongoing debate as to whether or not you can take it systemically that is to inject it or even take it orally and that it will find the sight of injury right it'll go direct itself to the S side of injury or whether or not it's more beneficial to inject it directly to the site of injury and here there's really no formal science I want to be really clear when we talk about bpc 157 we can look to a pretty large literature of peer-reviewed studies dating back to about 1993 is when the first kind of rigorous study of bpc 157 really began and there animal literature I even would go so far as to say quality studies of bpc157 and its effects in animal models such as rats and mice and such a dir of formal rigorous exploration of bpc157 in humans and at the same time a gosh let's just call it what it is a really rich set of anic data meaning that many many people perhaps even most people who take bpc 157 by the way the typical route of taking bpc 157 is either to inject it subcutaneously or into the muscle and to do that regardless of where the injury is they'll do that in one particular site so subcutaneously just a few inches off the belly button or into um you know into the shoulder or something of that sort if they're doing it intramuscularly or in some cases people will direct it to the side of injury by injecting more local like if you have an elbow injury they'll put into the muscle right above the elbow or subcutaneously right above the elbow and we're now in a situation where we don't know if we're dealing with pure placebo effect or we are dealing with real effects and so because of the lack of the human clinical studies we don't know whether or not we're dealing with a situation of robust Placebo effects I did an episode all about Placebo effects and Placebo effects are and can be oh so real they really um can really trick you into thinking that a given compound is doing something when in fact it's not doing anything different than would an injection of saline of saltwater but in this case there's just such an overwhelming amount of what I call anic data and there are so many people using bpc157 now and are interested in starting to use bpc 157 that I'd be remiss if I didn't discuss it despite this Gap in the human clinical literature so what do we know from the anic data the anic data seem to indicate that the mode of delivery that is whether or not systemic or local doesn't seem to matter that much although some people for whatever reason will purport that local injections serve recovery of the tissue more readily than systemic injections now there are a couple things to understand about bpc 157 besides the fact that in animal studies it's been shown to increase fiberblast migration to a sight of injury as well as endothelial cell and Vascular growth to a sight of injury and the first thing is that injury seems to be important there does seem to be something that the injury signals to bpc157 to create new vasculature and fiber blast growth there at the site of injury there's no evidence from these animal studies at least to my knowledge that bpc157 systemically increases vascular growth although one could imagine that it might right and for that reason I'll talk about some cautionary notes about bpc 157 as it relates to tumor growth and Cancers and diseases in particular of the eye that involve overgrowth of vasculature but before I do that I want to talk a little bit about the safety of bpc-157 one of the reasons why it's being used so extensively is that it does seem to have very high safety profiles at least with respect to the lethal dosing right in order to find out the lethal dose of something as you can imagine unfortunately the way these studies are done is they give animals more and more that is higher and higher doses of a given compound find out at what point about 50% of the population of those animals starts to die and then that's the so-called ld50 at least that's one crude way of describing it the ld50 of bpc 157 is incredibly High okay it is as high as two grams okay two grams 2,000 milligrams that is per kilogram of body weight now that does not mean please hear me on this that does not mean that any one should be taking High dosages of bpc 157 the typical therapeutic doses that are prescribed are anywhere from 300 to 500 micrograms subcutaneously maybe two or three times per week and that is typically done for a course of about eight weeks and then people typically cycle off for anywhere from 8 to 10 weeks now when I say typically I mean typically because there are individuals that take bpc 157 consistently they just take it every day and they'll just take it indefinitely without any break I think that is a bad idea and I want to also state that I am not suggesting anyone run out and take bpc 157 today's episode is really about giving you information so that you can make the determination whether or not you even want to take bpc 157 or another peptide and of course to really seriously consider the sourcing issue that we talked about earlier now what would be a reason to avoid taking bpc 157 well the first relates to something that many people take bpc 157 for because they believe it's good for them and it's some cases potentially could be which is that in addition to increasing fiberblast migration and angiogenesis blood vessel development within a sight of injury bpc157 is known to have a small but nonetheless meaningful impact on upregulating growth hormone receptors now this can be a good thing if you're trying to upregulate growth hormone receptors at a given injury site so that growth hormone which comes from the pituitary and we'll talk a bit about more later then can have a heightened level of action at that tisssue and growth hormone is involved in tissue turnover and repair this is evident from childhood where kids heal from wounds much faster than uh adults heal from wounds there's other reasons why kids heal from wounds more quickly than adults that relate to things like stuff secret from the thymus Etc we'll talk about that as well but this idea of increasing growth hormone receptors at the site of injury or around the site of injury by injecting bpc157 locally to the injury or even taking it systemically is one thing that many people think of as advantageous and that's why they want to take bpc 157 however for some people perhaps people who have a tumor in a given area an increase in growth hormone receptors in and around the tumor could potentially increase the growth of the tumor and that's one of the major issues with bpc157 that's not often discussed which is that if you have a tumor and tumors thrive on increased blood flow because they like to consume growth factors and increased blood flow means increased growth factors and other things that can not just sustain but actually grow the tumor well then by taking bpc 157 you may be either maintaining or accelerating the growth of a tumor that would otherwise be removed or stay small in other words bpc157 is a potential tumor growth risk so if you have knowledge of a given cancer or you're concerned about tumors at all I would encourage you to be very cautious about the use of bpc157 in fact one way that bpc157 creates this increase in angiogenesis this increase in vasculature is through upregulation of something called ve F vegf which is vascular endothelial growth factor now there is a common treatment for cancers which is a vastin a vastin is a veg F inhibitor it's a drug that's designed to fight tumors to reduce tumor size and does so by inhibiting vegf whereas bpc 157 is doing the exact opposite it is increasing levels of vegf to increase angiogenesis so by logical extension if you're concerned about tumors or cancer of any kind bpc 157 is probably not something that you want to explore so if bpc 157 carries these risks why are so many people interested in taking it or taking it I think in large part that's due to the fact that um the anic data about bpc 157 is just so strong people report all sorts of things like you know they recovered from their shoulder injury much faster there are these kind of outrageous claims about people recovering from complete tissue trans sections and um indeed there the animal data are pretty impressive I went into the data that looked at sciatic ner nerve regrowth after injury Achilles tendon regrowth after injury and some of these studies in rats involved a complete transsection not just a partial tear but a complete cut of a given ligament or tendon or nerve pathway and indeed the data are pretty impressive that when bpc157 is applied systemically right so given you know at the level of the gut somehow it's able to travel to the side of injury recognize that something needs to be done there in particular angiogenesis and fiberblast infiltration and it does seem that on average that these tissues repair faster than they do if bpc 157 is not provided but again the tumor concerns and the lack of human data are a real concern that everyone should be made aware of I do not think that bpc157 is not without its quote unquote side effects I do think that we are now in a state of widespread experimental use of bpc157 even though it can be obtained clean without LPS from compounding pharmacies and by prescription there are a lot of people taking bpc1 15 7 and I just want to return to the point I made earlier which is that you know bpc 157 is typically taken in these dosages of about 300 to 500 micrograms you know two to three times per week maybe even five days per week if you're going to go down this path of taking bpc 157 I would encourage you to take the minimal effective dose to not simply do it every day and certainly to not do it continuously and of course to monitor your other health metrics for anything that could potentially resemble cancer or tumor growth because obviously stimulating angiogenesis for wound repair sounds like a great thing recovering and being able to do your workouts or play your sport or um move about more comfortably of course a wonderfully attractive thing to do isn't that what we all want but obviously not with the trade-off of growing a tumor or developing a cancer or accelerating a cancer I'd like to take a brief moment and thank one of our sponsors and that's ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens I started taking ag1 way back in 200 12 the reason I started taking it and the reason I still take it every day is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas for vitamins and minerals and it ensures that I get enough Prebiotic and probiotic to support gut health now gut health is something that over the last 10 years we realized is not just important for the health of our gut but also for our immune system and for the production of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators things like dopamine and serotonin in other words gut health is critical for proper brain functioning now of course I strive to consume healthy Whole Foods for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day but there are a number of things in ag1 including specific micronutrients that are hard to get from Whole Foods or at least in sufficient quantities so ag1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals that I need probiotics prebiotics the adaptogens and critical micronutrients so anytime somebody asks me if they were to take Just One supplement what that supplement should be I tell them ag1 because ag1 supports so many different systems within the body that are involved involved in mental health physical health and performance to try ag1 go to drink a1.com huberman and you'll get a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 and five free travel packs of ag1 again that's drink a1.com huberman okay so we're still talking about peptides for tissue Rejuvenation and repair and we spent quite a bit of time on bpc157 because that's one getting a lot of attention nowadays there's another one that's getting increasing attention that's worth mentioning which is thin beta 4 and a related peptide which is tb500 which is basically a truncated or a shortened version of the thymus and beta4 peptide remember the peptide are these strings of amino acids like beads on a string and thymosin beta 4 is something that the body produces naturally from this thing called the thymus which is present in children and then disappears as we get older and it's well known again this is correlative but it's well known that children recover more quickly from injuries and indeed the degree of tissue regrowth and the repair of wounds with minimal scarring is so much greater in young children and in children than it is in adults and this is what gave rise to the idea that perhaps some of the peptides that are secreted from the thymus such as thymus and beta 4 could be involved in tissue Rejuvenation and repair and that's what led to the laboratory synthesis of thymus and beta 4 the full length peptide made in a lab not by the thymus and then adults take it okay or tb500 which is this truncated slightly shorten version of thymus and beta 4 which acts similarly to thymus and beta 4 but has a kind of different mode of action lasts a little bit longer Etc now again we're in a situation where there are vast amounts of animal data studies on micer rats typically that show that thymus and beta 4 can increase the rate Andor thoroughness of wound healing and repair but again there are more and more people now taking thymus in beta 4 for the purposes of tissue Rejuvenation and repair and Report positive effects now when we say positive effects we have to stand back and say well um what's the control experiment you know how would they know how quickly they would heal without the thymus and beta 4 and there simply no way to address that question you know my whole purpose in doing this episode is to highlight how these different molecules ought to work how they've been shown to work in animal models and therefore how they might be working in humans but again in the absence of clinical trials we still don't know if and how they are working in humans nonetheless a lot of people are now starting to take especially tb500 it's often taken in commin with bpc157 and at the level of mechanism the difference between bpc 157 and thymus and beta4 is that thymus and beta 4 really promotes the growth and infiltration of all sorts of different cell types associated with tissue Rejuvenation and especially wound healing and repair it's been shown to promote stem cell proliferation it's been shown to increase the growth of the so-called extracell Matrix the stuff around the cells that keeps the area around the cells kind of rigid so that um the tissue or the organ has more stability right you can't just have a bunch of cells with um a bunch of empty space around them where they can move about you want to have some rigidity to the whole thing so the idea is that thymus in beta 4 is promoting the aggregation of a bunch of things associated with tissue healing I've noticed out there that a lot of people talk about tb500 that is thymus and beta 4 in the context of being growth promoting as far as I know it isn't growth promoting it doesn't impact the growth hormone pathway or other Pathways associate with tissue growth rather it's involved in tissue repair so what I just discussed are the two major players are the two most often used peptides nowadays for tissue Rejuvenation and repair we've got bpc 157 which you can just basically frame up in your mind as promoting angiogenesis and wound repair through a variety of mechanisms but mainly the addition of new vasculature to the wound site and then we've got thymosin beta 4 which is sometimes referred to as tb500 which is just a shorter synthesized version of thymosin beta 4 which is a molecule known to come from the thymus in children whether or not it's solely responsible I doubt it's solely responsible in fact for the better tissue healing and repair seen in children as opposed to adults we don't know and yet it does seem at least anecdotally that people are taking tb500 again either alone or in combination with bpc 157 and at least to their mind are reporting more thorough or more rapid tissue Rejuvenation and repair so the next category of peptide effects that I'd like to talk about are the effects of certain peptides on metabolism and growth and any discussion about metab abolism and growth by definition has to include a discussion about growth hormon so basically where we're headed is a discussion about peptides that can increased amounts of growth hormone that are released in our brain and body to have specific effects in particular increases in metabolism and increases in either muscle growth and in some cases repair of tissues as well although mainly muscle growth and fat loss for those of you that aren't familiar with growth hormone growth hormone is a hormone that we naturally make it's secreted from a gland called the pituitary gland the pituitary sits near the roof of the mouth and it extends out of the stock of the brain such that it can release hormones into the general bloodstream the pituitary is connected to the brain however so it can get input from a brain area called the hypothalamus and within the hypothalamus there are neurons that can send signals to the pituitary telling it to either release growth hormone or to suppress the release of growth hormone now early in life when we are infants children teenagers and so on WE secrete tons of growth hor hormone in particular during the early hours of sleep each night we also secrete growth hormone a little bit throughout the day but it's really in sleep in which we have the greatest degree of growth hormone release this is one reason why babies and kids and teenagers sleep so much is there's a lot of growth hormone release and we tend to grow that is the tissues and limbs of our body tend to grow during sleep now it's been well documented that after about age 30 which is typically when people experience their full stature their full height although sometimes there's a little bit of uh wiggle room around that age typically after 30 the amount of growth hormone that's released each night and throughout the day is reduced by about 15% for every decade of Life as a consequence all of the things that growth hormone does like encouraging higher metabolism fat loss the growth of muscle tissue Etc is dramatically reduced as we go from 30 to 40 to 50 and on and on it's also the case that naturally relased growth hormone tends to have positive postive effects on our mood and overall feelings of well-being so it's also tied to our feelings of Vitality or having feelings of energy to do things and that's because growth hormone potently increases ATP production which is involved in Energy and Metabolism in our cells and as a consequence our overall feelings of energy to just do things mental or physical now there's another hormone called igf-1 or insulin growth factor one which is produced by the liver insulin growth factor 1 does many things similar to growth hormone and it actually is Rel in response to growth hormone so basically the way this works is that there's a signal that comes from the hypothalamus called growth hormone relasing hormone and then that signal stimulates the anterior pituitary to release growth hormone growth hormone then is circulated throughout the blood it also can access the brain itself and it does different things in different tissues but again increases ATP production for energy it is going to cause tissue repair in some cases it's also going to encourage growth of tissues not just muscles but other tissues that's why it's involved in helping us achieve our full height our full stature when growth hormone reaches the liver it stimulates the release of igf-1 which in turn does a number of things that are both synergistic and different that is it works both similarly to growth hormone and does some things in parallel that are a little bit different as well in particular things related to regulation of blood sugar metabolism Etc all things associated with kind of youthfulness Vitality and energy so it's impossible for me to say that growth hormone and igf-1 do just one thing each they do lots of different things in lots of different tissues but hopefully from the description I just gave you could see why some people might be interested in augmenting or increasing levels of growth hormone Now growth hormone has been sequenced and synthesized so you can buy a synthetic version of growth hormone and indeed some people will take prescription growth hormone they'll take this by uh typically it's an injection that's given subcutaneously at night and they achieve growth of tissues including muscle Etc keep in mind that growth hormone is indiscriminate with respect to which tissues it grows so if you happen have an existing tumor on a given body part or within a given body part it will encourage growth of that tumor as well that's one of the reasons some people are cautious about taking growth hormone another reason why many people are cautious about taking growth hormone is that it is subject to what's called negative feedback if your blood levels of growth hormone are too high by virtue of injecting growth hormone well then the pituitary can register that and the Brain can register that and then there's a negative feedback that shuts down growth hormone as a consequence people have developed peptide Therapeutics that stimulate the release of growth hormone and thereby the release of igf-1 but not by directly stimulating the growth hormone pathway typically what these peptides are are these are peptides that mimic the sorts of things that are typically released from the hypothalamus onto the pituitary and in that way stimulate the release of growth hormone and downstream igf-1 so what these things are typically called are secretagogues these are peptide molecules that have been synthesized in a laboratory that stimulate the release of growth hormone and thereby stimulate the production of igf-1 now there are two general categories of peptides for stimulating the release of growth hormone the first category oftentimes are referred to as the ghrh peptides for growth hormone releasing hormone peptides now that name has certain problems that we'll get to in a moment but let's just leave it there for the time being the second category are What's called the growth hormone releasing peptides right before we said growth hormone releas ing hormones that's the first category second ones are the growth hormone releasing peptides you can already tell why this is getting confusing here's what I'm going to do rather than use that nomenclature which is the typical nomenclature that's used and I must say for which there's a lot of Errors when I look out there on various YouTube videos and I look within even some of the reviews that have been written people get things confused as to whether or not a given peptide that one would use as a therapeutic falls into one or the other category and you'll see in a minute it's a really important distinction instead what I'm going to call these are category one peptides and Category 2 peptides okay in general category one peptides are going to be the ones that have been most thoroughly tested in humans in some cases in fact in several cases are FDA approved for certain conditions and yes are prescribed for other off label effects again this would be under what I'm calling type one growth hormone secreting peptides is celin celin is a synthetic compound designed to mimic naturally occurring growth hormone releasing hormone that is FDA approved for the treatment of short stature so you can get this by prescription sometimes it comes from a compounding pharmacy other times it comes directly from PHA for the name brand in any case celin has been shown to mimic what is normally released from the hypothalamus and stimulates the pituitary to release growth hormone and it does indeed cause increases in circulating growth hormone and increases in igf-1 by the way the typical dosages of celin that are um taken are anywhere from 200 to 400 micrograms typically that's done at night before sleep for the reasons that we talked about before and typically people will take it anywhere from three times per week or five times per week there are some disadvantages to taking it continuously 7 days per week for long periods of time there's some desensitization that can occur not much but some can occur so taking in that way celin has been shown to increase circulating levels of growth hormone and igf-1 and the the reason why a lot of people seek to take cellin is because they like the effects it produces they like the Vitality they like the muscle growth they like The Fat Loss um it also can increase the amount of deep sleep that you get I'll just be completely forthcoming I've taken cellan on and off for the last couple of years I typically will take it anywhere from one to two nights per week and I stop taking it almost completely I'll still take it every once in a great while but the reason I stopped taking it is that I noticed that it made the sleep in the early part of my night very very deep very robust but then I would wake up wide awake or I would sleep till morning and then at least according to my eight sleep sleep tracker or my whoop sleep tracker I wasn't getting nearly as much rapid eye movement sleep as I normally would so at least in my case and again this is anic data it seemed to sort of replace rapid eye movement sleep with more deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep is critical for all sorts of things that deep sleep can't achieve and vice versa so you really want both so this is one reason why I've basically stopped taking Calin I'll occasionally take it every once in a while but in general I just you know stop taking it because uh whatever the positive effects might have been if I had taken it more consistently the effects in depleting rapid eye movement sleep were just something I didn't want and don't want and by the way that effect on increasing deep sleep that non-r sleep is something that's pretty well documented the other what I'm calling type one growth hormone promoting peptide is tesamorelin this goes by the brand name grifta and it's an FDA approved drug for the reduction of visceral adiposity in HIV patients so we have subcutaneous fat and we have visceral fat around our organs visceral fat can be really problematic and for some people who have HIV or and for people who don't have HIV the deposits of visceral fat can be problematic for their health and tesamorelin again also called AG gria has been shown to reduce visceral adiposity it also seems to produce some of the other same effects that celin produces the differences between the two relate to small differences in the amino acid sequence for one peptide versus the other tesamorelin is a bit more long lasting than celin and therefore is taken typically about three times per week not five times per week now the third most commonly used peptide in this category of what I'm calling type one growth hormone secreting peptides is cjc-1295 gosh I wish there was a um an easier name CJ c1295 is basically a variant of a different growth hormone secreting peptide that was sized previously to which they add what's called a DAC a drug Affinity complex it's a it's a sequence that makes it very longlasting so cjc-1295 typically is only taken twice per week or even once per week because its effects on increasing growth hormone in igf-1 last several days which may sound great to you especially if you're somebody that doesn't like um taking injections because these things uh in general have to be uh delivered by injection but keep in mind that cjc-1295 has entered clinical trials there was a death within one of the clinical trials that was related to cardiovascular dysfunction it's known to cause some fluid retention and increased fluid volume which may have been related to that cardiovascular death we don't know okay this is all kind of speculation but I would say if you are somebody considering using a growth hormone secreting peptide the type one category is perhaps and I'll give my explanation for why I believe this to be the case perhaps the most advantageous category to explore and as I mentioned before you've got the options of cellan and tessarin both of which are FDA approved and for which there's both animal and human data CJC 1295 despite still being in clinical trials does have this kind of stain of a death within the clinical trial and to my mind given that there are decent Alternatives in serel and or tesamorelin I don't know why anyone would specifically select cjc-1295 until all these safety issues have been resolved I'd like to take a quick break to acknowledge our sponsor element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means zero sugar and the appropriate ratios of the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium and that correct ratio of electrolytes is extremely important because every cell in your body but especially your nerve cells your neurons relies on electrolytes in order to function properly so when you're well hydrated and you have the appropriate amount of electrolytes in your system your mental functioning and your physical functioning is improved I drink one packet of element dissolved in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when when I wake up in the morning as well as while I exercise and if I've sweat a lot during that exercise I often will drink a third element packet dissolved in about 32 ounces of water after I exercise element comes in a variety of different flavors all of which I find really tasty I like the Citrus I like the watermelon I like the raspberry frankly I can't pick just one it also comes in chocolate and chocolate mint which I find tastes best if they are put into water dissolved and then heated up I tend to do that in the winter months because of course you don't just need hydration on hot days and in the summer and spring months but also in the winter when the temperatures are cold and the environment tends to be dry if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element spelled l.com huberman to try a free sample pack again that's drink element.com huberman okay so there are definitely other synthetic growth hormone relasing hormone peptides that are out there but I think these three that we've covered serel and testelin and cjc-1295 account for the vast majority of those i' put into category one the other category which I'm going to call category two you'll also hear a lot about and they operate a little bit differently these peptides encourage the release of growth hormone but they do so either by mimicking or stimulating the release of another peptide called gin some of you may be familiar with gin because gin is a peptide that increases in concentration when we are hungry so it stimulates hunger and it also stimulates anxiety somewhat so you may be wondering why would anyone want want to increased levels of growth hormone and gin and the reason is that the Gin itself can impact the growth hormone pathway pretty potently so you can get really robust increases in growth hormone but because there are gin increases as well you get big increases in hunger and anxiety in some people and lesser in others now the different names of the peptides in this type two category are ones that you'll hear kicked around a lot these days things like ipom marelin okay so don't get ipom marelin confused with tesamorelin right tesamorelin is a type one growth hormone relasing hormone pep iin is in this Category 2 so it's definitely going to increase gin which is going to increase hunger it does have certain advantages in particular that it increases growth hormone release by two mechanisms it increases it directly and it tends to suppress something called somatostatin somatostatin is a bit of a break or an antagonist on growth hormone release so with iper maralin you're essentially removing the break on growth hormone release allowing more growth hormone to be released such that you get a lot of growth hormone released it also tends to really improve sleep but again by increasing the amount of deep sleep we don't know whether or not it does that to at the expense of rap and eye movement sleep so iprom marelin is the most commonly discussed one in this type two category the other one that you'll hear about is called hexarelin hexarelin is available by prescription and it is the strongest stimulator of growth hormone release which leads many people to think okay I want hexarelin that's the one that's going to give me the biggest growth hormone pulse and indeed the growth hormone Pulses from hexarelin can be as great as two two or three times more than with the other growth hormone secreting peptides that we've talked about however we know that hexarelin can also dramatically increase prolactin which can cause suppression in libido it can cause fluid retention it can cause a kind of feeling of malaise especially a high levels and perhaps most problematically hexarelin can desensitize The receptors for growth hormone releasing hormone such that your system will no longer respond either to the hexarelin or to any other peptide or perhaps most importantly to any endogenous that is naturally made grow growth hormone excuse me releasing hormone that you would make okay so that's something to really consider if you're going to explore hexarelin make sure please that you're working with a physician make sure that you're not taking too much of it or for too long and keep an eye on those prolactin levels because those can be problematic if they get too high and you know by my read I can't see why anyone would use high doses of hexarelin maybe low doses of hexarelin if your doctor thinks that's what's appropriate for you but you'd really want to avoid that receptor desensitization because you could essentially turn off the system permanently now there are a bunch of other what I'm calling type 2 growth hormone promoting peptides these include ghrp2 ghrp 3 ghrp 6 again different amino acid sequences all designed to achieve the same thing which is more growth hormone things like ghrp 3 can potently increase growth hormone but are known to also potently increase prolactin and cortisol leading to more than a doubling of circulating cortisol ol which depending on how well regulated it is across the time of day can be problematic in other words you want cortisol levels pretty high in the early part of the day but you want them very very low in the later part of the day and at night and keep in mind that almost always these growth hormone peptides whether or not they're type one or type two peptides are taken before bed typically you know 20 to 30 minutes before sleep always it's suggested that they be taken at least an hour and a half after eating any food and that you don't eat for at least 30 minutes afterwards because if you happen to have elevated blood sugar or you've got food in your gut they're not going to have as potent an effect at increasing growth hormone and igf-1 so again you want to avoid uh food in the hour and a half probably two hours before taking them and certainly in the half hour or uh longer after which is why most people take them right before going to sleep and add or augment that big growth hormone pulse that occurs in the in the early part of the night and then many people have perhaps heard of what's called mk677 which is simply an oral version a non-injectable but oral version of these ghrps and it tends to have the same issues that the other ghrps have which are elevated cortisol and in some cases elevated prolactin as well okay so if we just kind to zoom out from all this we can say that yes indeed there are synthetic peptides that can potently increase growth hormone in igf-1 I explain the rationale for why people would want that or perhaps to explore that I'm certainly not suggesting anyone um do this again I am suggesting that if you do explore it you work with a board certified physician and that you get these compounds from a quality compounding pharmacy or by their name brand prescription in type one we've got cellin and Tess morelan both are FDA approved for certain purposes they're being used off label for increasing growth hormone and igf-1 for the sorts of things we're talking about here they are taken anywhere from three times per week to five times per week keep in mind tessarin lasts a little bit longer than cellan CJC 1295 is the third in that category of type 1 growth hormone secreting peptides but it may again may we don't know have some safety issues that still need to be resolved making suelin and testelin at least to my mind better options should you decide to go down this path the type two growth hormone releasing peptides include things like hexarelin which are very potent at increasing growth hormone but can potentially increase other things as well but of more concern is really that it can cause receptor defenses ation maybe even turn off the whole receptor pathway that would not be good hyper morelan again increases growth hormone directly and allows more of it to be released by suppressing its break its natural break which is suat Statin and then the ghrp 2 3 6 and mk677 all of which can potently increase growth hormone need to be considered in light of the fact that they cause big increases in cortisol and in some cases can cause some receptor internalization or desensitization as well although not as potently as hexarelin so hopefully that description clarifies some of what you've heard out there um about these different compounds and their different names Etc it can be very confusing I did take the liberty of designating a type one and a type two category I did that for sake of clarity because there are a lot of different acronyms and numbers Etc that can be really confusing to people and I hope that that will be useful in facilitating further discussions about these compounds going forward two additional brief but important points many of the peptide vendors that are out there and Physicians that are working with peptides will combine different growth hormone promoting peptides so they'll for instance have celin or testelin in combination with hexarelin or they'll use iprom marelin in combination with CJC 1295 while I'm not opposed to that approach you just want to make sure that the dosing or I should say the relative dosing of each peptide is such that you know you're avoiding unnecessary increases in prolactin and cortisol and that you're not hitting a pathway redundantly that's actually the logic of combining different things these different amino acid sequences these different peptides that is are designed to stimulate different modes of action for the same peptide so the naturally occurring peptide goes and does a bunch of things those pleotropic effects and these different peptides that are of different amino acid sequences are designed to you know reduce uh visceral osity a bit more or promote deep sleep a bit more or to promote muscle growth a bit more so when people are combining different things in cocktail it's not necessarily a bad thing but you want to make sure that you're working with someone who's very familiar with peptides you know really has been in the peptide space for a long time and understands how these things work alone and in combination and there are some excellent Physicians that are doing that um and we plan to have at least one of them on the Hub Lab podcast as a guest in the not too distant future and you can bet that this conversation will facilitate your understanding of that discussion the second point is that there are of course risks to taking anything but in particular to exploring augmentation of the growth hormone pathway when people take growth hormone itself there are common risks such as carpal tunnel syndrome um that has to do in part with the fact that it can potently increase cartilage growth there can be active changes in the structure of one's head and face and body there's a so-called um uh lean but distended gut so people that aren't carrying a lot of uh subcutaneous fat but that the gut becomes uh extended sometimes you can get changes in the face like the um you know kind of a a thickening of the of the bone above the brow you'll see that and sometimes people look quite different after taking growth hormone for a series of time than they did before it can really change one's stature and and shape uh to a considerable degree it also can create a kind of a uh kind of a a skin texture that is a little bit unnatural or unusual you sometimes can see this in people that take a lot of growth hormone in general when people take growth hormone promoting peptides the changes in body structure are not as dramatic as when people take growth hormone itself self but body shape changes and cosmetic changes aside keep in mind that anytime we augment growth hormone either by taking growth hormone directly as a synthetic compound or by taking a peptide that increases the amount of growth hormone that we release we are increasing our tumor growth risk and our cancer risk and that's because growth hormone and igf-1 are somewhat indiscriminant in terms of the tissues that they promote the growth of so if you have a tumor someplace and small taking exogenous growth hormone or increasing the amount of growth hormone that you release by taking one of these peptides that we discussed will increase the size of that tumor it's very likely and you can imagine that if you're taking a peptide to increase growth hormone and you're taking something like bpc157 something that a lot of people are starting to do nowadays you could potentially increase both the size and the vascularization of a given tumor so just keep that in mind just as there are anti-cancer drugs that focus on the vegf pathway to try and discourage vascularization of tumors there are drugs that discourage the release of growth hormone to discourage the growth of tumors so if you're listening to this you might be thinking well why in the world would anybody take this stuff well people like the effects of having elevated growth hormone they like the effects of recovering from an injury more quickly but there's always going to be a trade-off between potential benefit and potential risk the one thing that we can say for these growth hormone secretagogues serel and telin in particular is that they are FDA appr approved as compounds however they are not approved for all the purposes that people are taking them for such as cosmetic effects Etc so I'm certainly not being disparaging of people that decide to make the choice to take these compounds that's your right entirely but I do think that you should be informed about the potential risks and if you are somebody who's considering taking any of these compounds there are certain considerations that you definitely should pay attention to so for instance how old are you if you're younger than 30 I don't know why you'd want to augment growth hormone unless you and your doctor decide that there's a clinical need or some other urgent need to do so uh because you're already making a lot of growth hormone if you're older than 30 and you're interested in using these compounds to me it stands to reason that of course you want to make sure that you don't have any tumors or cancers that you could potentially exacerbate but in addition to that that you really think about using the minimal effective dose and that you use perhaps even the mildest of these different compounds in order to make sure that you don't desensitize any of the receptor Pathways and of course there is no reason why anyone should use these compounds unless they absolutely feel need to and there's a potential benefit there I personally as I mentioned before tried cellin for a short while the reductions in rapid eye movement sleep were problematic enough for me that I decided to just not take it and it's not something that I've returned to except every once in a great while I might do it to augment deep sleep just a little bit the next category of peptide effects that we're going to discuss are peptides involved in longevity and this is actually going to be a pretty quick discussion because really the main one in this category besides thymus and beta 4 remember thymus and beta 4 we talked about earlier this is a peptide that's naturally released from the thymus and the thymus is a structure that depletes over time as children age so some people will take thymos and beta 4 as kind of a longevity agent hoping that it will increase repair of tissues recovery from exercise Etc but it's not really aimed at longevity per se it's really aimed at replacing something that's present in Youth and then tends to dissipate as we get older that is the thymus and related peptides from the thymus but the big one in the category of peptides to potentially I want to highlight potentially improv longevity is epitalon epitalon is also sometimes spelled and pronounced epithin okay don't ask me why and as with bpc 157 there are quite a few animal studies exploring epithin and its effects on various tissues as well as the naturally occurring peptide that it's meant to resemble epithin is a peptide that's secreted from the pineal gland the pineal gland is a gland that most people associate with melatonin release and that's because the cells within the pineal called pinealocytes secrete melatonin at night it's what makes us feel sleepy and go to sleep melatonin is suppressed by light viewed by the eyes there's actually a pathway that goes from the eyes into the brain there a couple of stages they go up through the cervical ganglion from the brain stem and up to the pineal and suppress melatonin release now the pineal makes other things besides melatonin it also makes a peptide called epithalamion from the pineal especially early in life and that's associated with various anti-inflammatory effects on other cells and tissues in the body and it does appear to be able to adjust tiir length which is a feature of cells that's thought to be associated with the longevity of cells or how long they live keep in mind that the relationship between tiir and Longevity is a controversial one people were very excited about this some years back then people batted down that idea showing that kilometer length was not associated with longevity especially in hum and now it's sort of a back and forth within the field keep in mind that epitalon again also sometimes written and pronounced epithin is designed to mimic this naturally occurring peptide epithalamic clature can get a little bit confusing and what you'll find is that epitalon is available as a synthetic compound it can be obtained in clean form from compounding pharmacies and a good number of people will use it as a longevity agent based largely on animal data that it can suppress tumor growth it can increase tiir length and to some extent that it can recalibrate the Circadian rhythm changes and the disruptions in the patterns of melatonin that occur as animals and perhaps as humans age this is an important point the pineal gland despite being very very small about the size of a PE and sitting kind of in the mid area of the brain for you afficionados it sits you know kind of like right on the roof of the Dian sephylon and what it does is it it will release melatonin each night in darkness it can release epithalamion and at those times it can go and have these Myriad effects on restoring the brain and body during sleep there are other things that occur during sleep that are essential but those are key components of the restorative features of sleep now we know that as we age the amount of melatonin that we release is decreased such that if you look in babies and teens Etc melatonin levels are very very high compared to people of middle age and of elderly age likewise epithalamion levels decrease with time and as a consequence markers of tissue inflammation also increase as we age because you're sort of removing this anti-inflammatory compound that's released each night now there are a bunch of theories as to why the pineal regresses with age there's some kind of wild ones about fluoride and a depletion of the of the pineal I'll do a whole episode on the pineal at some point and we'll explore that some of them are very Niche some of them are frankly completely false and others have some Merit and are starting to um gain some data within the standard scientific Community the overall point here about peptides for longevity can be summarized very easily the logic is just as we have a thymus early in life the thymus secretes certain things and those things seem to accelerate robust tissue healing early in life and as the thymus disappears tissue healing gets less robust that's the logic for taking things like thymus and beta 4 tb500 so too we have a we know about the animal studies what we know about the naturally occurring compounds that these peptides are designed to mimic and yet there are still no clinical trials that point directly to taking x amount of epitalon several times per week as a way to extend life the fourth and final category of peptide effects that we're going to talk about are effects on Vitality both mood and libido and really the main players within this category of peptides are the so-called melanocyte stimulating hormon related peptides okay just to give you a little bit of background remember the pituitary the pituitary gland that stalk that extends out of the brain and can release growth hormone from the anterior pituitary well it's got a middle segment or a medial segment and there's a hormone that's released from there called mocy stimulating hormone melany stimulating hormone has the effect of stimulating pigmentation of the skin by activating what are called melanocytes that exist within the skin so the peptides melanotan 1 melanotan 2 melanotan 3 Milan 4 Milan 5 because there are five of them are different peptides that is peptides with different amino acid sequences all of which mimic naturally occurring melany stimulating hormone but that act preferentially on one set of melany stimulating hormone receptors or another in order to get different effects so let's back up a little bit and talk about the melanocortin system right the melanocortin system is a system whereby viewing light or getting light on the skin typically Ultra violet light of the ultraviolet B type okay there's two different types of ultraviolet light but basically sunlight is what the system evolved to respond to shown to the eyes and or to the skin stimulates the melanocortin system it goes from the eyes to the hypothalamus from the hypothalamus to the pituitary and then the melany stimulating hormone is then released into the bloodstream can travel to the melanoides and cause pigmentation of the skin this is what is responsible for SC there's also a pathway whereby the light stimulates the melany stimulating hormone system and in parallel stimulates the release of dopamine now for any of you that have lived in a part of the world in which it's very very dark with very short days in the winter and longer days and a lot of sunlight during the summer you're probably familiar with the fact that when the sun comes out people start feeling better they have more energy they're more motivated a number of different systems related to mood and libido tend to increase this is the consequence of sunlight activating the melano cortico system and by the way this system is very active in other animals as well animals that are white or tend to be of pale color during the winter then as spring arrives the sunlight stimulates this very same system and leads to darkening of the pellage so their hair goes from white or gray to Brown or even dark black or some combination of those and in combination dopamine is increased libido is increased and the animals start breeding in the spring and summer months okay so this is a a well-conserved system across species and it exists to some extent in us as well so there are essentially five different synthetic peptides called melanotan 1 2 3 4 and five Each of which is designed to mimic melany simulating hormone but Each of which activates different receptors to different degrees and some can cross the blood brain barrier and some can't and as a consequence some impact mood and libido and others don't the simple way to look at this is that melanotan one does not cross the bloodb brain barrier it does however stimulate the melanocytes of the skin so it leads to tanning or darkening of the skin melanotan 2 3 4 and five also lead to darkening the skin by way of activating melanocytes in the skin but because they can cross the blood brain barrier they cause effects that are at the level of psychology really and at the level of appetite and things of that sort in general the pattern is to increase mood in libido and to decrease appetite things that are associated with the transition from Winter to spring and summer months in humans and in other animals now one of the things about the uh peptide literature is that it loves acronyms and numbers and so there's a peptide pt41 that falls into this category of activating the melanocortin system and pt-141 is also known as the prescription drug VII pt41 or VII is FDA approved for the treatment of premenopause fusal hypoactive sexual desire so this is FDA approved for the treatment of women that have suppressed libido however men also will take VII um for hypoactive uh sexual desire um this is obviously prescribed off label um by physicians but keep in mind as with the other peptides in this pathway VII will stimulate pigmentation so whether or not you consider that a side effect or a benefit depends on I guess your Baseline level of pigmentation and how much level of pigmentation you actually want now there are some side effects associated with these compounds and one of the more common ones is nausea and that's because there are melanite simulating um hormone receptors all throughout the gut they can also cause flushing of the skin and they can cause blood pressure to increase also folks with melanoma should be very cautious about using any of the peptides that stimulate melanocytes because that could potentially exacerbate melanoma the next peptide in this category of peptides for Vitality in libido is kisspeptin kisspeptin is a peptide that wasn't discovered that long ago actually you can recall when the first papers about kisspeptin came out and basically kisspeptin is a peptide that is naturally made within the brain and it's Upstream of some of the hypothalamic signals that activate the pituitary for sake of hormone production and reproduction so I'll just walk you through this pathway it's actually quite simple you've got the pituitary you're now familiar with the pituitary and the pituitary releases two different hormon hormones in both males and females it releases lutenizing hormone and it releases follicle stimulating hormone if you watched the episodes that we did about testosterone and estrogen if you watch the episode that I did on male and female fertility if you watch the episode that I did with Dr Michael Eisenberg from Stanford or Dr Natalie Crawford who's an OBGYN uh specializing infertility we talked a lot about LH and FSH basically FSH as the name suggests stimulates the growth of the follicle the egg in the female and it stimulat Ates sperm production in males lutenizing hormone stimulates testosterone production from the gonad in males and it also stimulates estrogen production and to some extent testosterone production in females as well so we need LH and FSH to stimulate the gonads the ovary or the testes the hormone that stimulates LH and FSH release is called GnRH or gatot tropin releasing hormone and it comes from the hypothalamus so G&R is a signal that promotes LH and FSH release now that raises the question what turns on GnRH and the signal that turns on G&R is kisspeptin kisspeptin in other words is further Upstream from G&R and lsh and FSH it's a Cascade it goes kisspeptin GnRH LH FSH testosterone estrogen okay that's the pathway now it's very clear that kisspeptin is involved in the activation of puberty the transition from prepubertal to postpubertal stages of life it's also involved in any of the sort of Downstream effects of having elevated LH and FSH including elevated Vitality which includes both energy and in some cases libido so there's naturally occurring kisspeptin and there's now synthetically generated kisspeptin designed to mimic naturally occurring kisspeptin and it's actually prescribed for what's called hypothalamic amena hypothalamic amena is the loss or the absence of periods of cycles that are the consequence of deficits within the hypothalamus itself so not something within the ovary or a lack of the pituitary to make LH or FSH but a deficit of the hypothalamus to promote LH and FSH and the downstream hormones testosterone and estrogen incidentally there are also kisspeptin antagonists okay drugs that are designed to suppress kisspeptin and those are used to treat some of the symptoms of menopause including night sweats and some of the what are called vasomotor symptoms so peptin is obviously a key player in this whole pathway of steroid hormone release the steroid hormones being testosterone and estrogen there are other steroid hormones as well of course now there are folks within the landscape of peptide Therapeutics folks meaning Physicians and other practitioners who said ah well here's a a peptide that is known to promote all these hormone Pathways that are associated with Vitality libido Etc and so there are people who take kisspeptin peptides as a way to stimulate these Pathways and they're doing so for the specific purpose of increasing ing Vitality as it relates to libido and mood and to get the downstream increases on testosterone and estrogen and of course some people are taking kisspeptin peptides to treat hypothalamic amenorrhea and as I mentioned some people are taking kisspeptin antagonist they're trying to block the kisspeptin pathway in order to reduce some of the vasomotor and other symptoms of menopause I will say despite the fact that the ceptin pathway is well known and despite the fact that the ceptin peptide is designed to mimic a naturally occurring peptide that has a pretty constrained set of function in the hypothalamic pituitary system and their Downstream effects on the gonads the use of Kiss peptin to increase Vitality in libido is a bit of a um let's just say it's it's a little bit of a wild card we don't yet know all the effects of kiss peptin again it was fairly recently discovered we have it in mind that it's involved in these Pathways but I should say every time we look at a given peptide whether or not it's gin or hypocrite neurexin or it's glp1 what we find is that again are these pleotropic effects there is rarely if ever one specific effect and it's not just a concern about side effects that we want to take these pleotropic effects into consideration it's the fact that even though we know a lot about the human body and the various hormones and neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin Etc that are made this landscape of peptides is an enormous one and it's one for which we are just now really starting to appreciate how many different peptides the human body and brain make again I don't think it's an overestimate to say that they probably hundreds of thousands of different peptides each with multiple and sometimes even overlapping and synergistic effects so I do understand the excitement about peptide Therapeutics I think for a lot of people that want to improve their physical health and mental health they want to recover from injuries more quickly maybe they're seeking particular aesthetic changes or mood changes Etc I understand the gravitational pull and the excitement of peptides but I have noticed that the discussion around peptides because it's in contrast often to the disc discussion around hormone therapies like testosterone therapy and estrogen therapy people I think inadvertently assume that peptides are all safe or innocuous or that they are potent enough to do certain things that we want but that because they're not hormone therapies per se that they are free of side effects and risk and in addition to wanting to teach you about some of the biology of these peptides and how they work and what they're designed to do as well as some of their potential therapeutic benefits under the right condition again working with a really good board certified physician and making sure that the sourcing is really clean and that you're doing regular blood testing and you're monitoring for any potential tumor growth Etc I also want to emphasize that these are very potent compounds they have lots of different effects and we are in the early stages of exploring peptide Therapeutics again I'm not here to tell you what to do or what not to do but if you have it in mind that peptide Therapeutics because they aren't hormone therapies are not without their potential risks you would be wrong all that said it's very exciting to see what's happening with peptide Therapeutics I'm excited about their potential for both the treatment of disease as well as for augmentation of mental and physical health and I think it's an exciting landscape that certainly motivated my desire to do this episode and get you familiar with them or at least with some of them and it's something that we're definitely going to be exploring more on this

Title: Asi Wind: What Magic & Mind Reading Reveal About the Brain
Published: 2024-03-25 12:00:41 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Asi Wind. He's one of the world’s top magicians and mentalists. 

We discuss what magic and mentalism reveal about the human mind, including how memories are made, how to erase them, and how and why we perceive things the way we do, all in the context of how he performs his astonishing tricks. 

Asi explains that magic works because it involves storytelling, which is key to how we organize memories. He also explains how emotional connection allows people to co-create and believe a common narrative, even one that did not actually occur. 

We also discuss how Asi's love of painting and photography and his specific daily routine allow him to access creativity. We also discuss fear, perfectionism, and how feeling emotions deeply serves his craft. 

Whether you are interested in magic or not, this conversation with Asi will give you an incredible window into how you perceive, learn, and remember the world around you and how what you believe may or may not be based in reality.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is AI wind aie wind is one of the top magicians and mentalists in the world now you may be asking yourself why would the hubman Lab podcast host a magician Mentalist and the obvious answer perhaps would be that mag magicians and mentalists reveal to us where our gaps in perception reside that is where the human brain falters such that magicians and mentalists can take advantage of that and give us the impression the illusion that certain things happened when they didn't however during today's discussion you will learn that AI wins magic and Mentalist work which by the way is absolutely astonishing you can see examples of this in some of the links in the show note captions that will take you to YouTube clips in which aie did some of these tricks and mentally work on me directly in the studio and there are other examples out there that we've linked to on the internet as well that the work that aiwin does illustrates how we form memories how we erase memories and the specific things that we all can do in order to stamp down certain memories and to erase other memories indeed much of what aie wi's work does is to use an understanding of how the brain works in order to create false memories to erase recent memories and indeed to use emotion and empathy and storytelling in order for you the Observer to create a perception of something that happened that may or may not have actually happened indeed what AI reveals to us today tells us not how a magician or Mentalist fools us but rather how we with our own brains lead ourselves to believe that certain things happened when in fact they may or may not have happened and the way that we collaborate with others in order to create those either false or real perceptions it's a discussion that I'm sure everyone whether or not you're a fan of magic or not will find fascinating indeed I learn so much from the discussion with AI about neuroscience and about how the human brain constructs narratives of the past present and future that it informs not just my understanding of how the brain works but indeed how to learn better how to remember things better and to consolidate that information to really stamp it into your memory so that you never forget so while AI wind is a magician and Mentalist today's discussion is really a discussion about the Neuroscience of how to learn how to forget how to access creativity and how art and storytelling empathy and emotion all can allow us to access powers within us that make us far more effective in whatever Pursuits we may be after before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you don't that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the electrolytes but no sugar as I've mentioned before on this podcast I'm a big believer in getting sufficient hydration and making sure that that hydration includes sufficient electrolytes salt magnesium and potassium and the reason for that is that all the cells in our body but indeed especially our neurons our nerve cells are critically reliant on electrolytes and hydration in order to function properly element makes it very easy to get the hydration and electrolytes you need when I wake up in the morning one of the first things I do is to drink 16 to 32 ounces of water with a packet of element dissolved in it I particularly like the raspberry flavored element but then again I also like the watermelon flavor and the Citrus flavor and the orange flavor so basically what I'm saying is I really like all the flavors of element if you'd like toy element you can go to drink element spelled LM nt.com huberman to claim a free sample pack with your order again that's drink element lnt.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by betterhelp betterhelp offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out online now I've been going to therapy for well over 30 years initially I didn't have a choice it was a condition of being allowed to stay in school but pretty soon I realized that therapy is extremely valuable in fact I consider doing regular therapy just as important as getting regular exercise including cardiovascular exercise and resistance training which of course I also do every week the reason I know therapy is so valuable is that if you can find a therapist with whom you can develop a really good rapport you not only get terrific support for some of the challenges in your life but you also can derive tremendous insights from that therapy insights that can allow you to better not just your emotional life and your relationship life but of of course also the relationship to yourself and to your professional life to all sorts of career goals in fact I see therapy is one of the key components for meshing together all aspects of one's life and being able to really direct one's focus and attention toward what really matters if you'd like to try betterhelp go to betterhelp.com huberman to get 10% off your first

I first learned about Aeropress well over 10 years ago and I've been using one ever since Aeropress was developed by Allan Adler who was an engineer at Stanford and I knew of Allan because he had also built the so-called aobi frisbee so he was sort of famous in our community for developing these different Feats of engineering that turned into commercial products now I love coffee I'm somebody that drinks coffee nearly every day usually about 90 to 120 minutes after I wake up in the morning although not always sometimes if I'm going to exercise I'll drink coffee first thing in the morning but I love love love coffee and what I've personally found is that by using the aerrow Press I can make the best possible tasting cup of coffee I don't know what exactly it is in the Aeropress that allows the same beans to be prepared into a cup of coffee that tastes that much better as compared to any other form of Brewing that coffee even the traditional French press the aerrow Press is extremely easy to use and it's extremely compact in fact I take it with me whenever I travel and I use it on the road in hotels even on planes I'll just ask for some hot water and I'll Brew my coffee or tea right there on the plane with over 55,000 fstar reviews Aero press is the best reviewed coffee press in the world if you would like to try Aero press you can go to Aero press.com huberman that's a r o

discussion with aie wind aie wind welcome thank you for having me I can't tell you how excited I am to have you here today I've seen you do your live shows twice once in Los Angeles once in New York and both times there were three major effects first of all I was absolutely astonished there's truly no hyper herbally that can capture what you are capable of doing um just by way of example folks prior to coming in here aie agreed to do a trick he let me select a card uh an Ace of Hearts from a deck of cards I held it there was another card ace of diamonds I also held that I looked at them I turned them over in my hands he's not touching them he asked somebody in the room for a number number number everyone provides a number then he ask me which person's number I would like to select there's no prior agreements or communication here whatsoever I selected the number seven he says turn over the cards that are still in my hands he hasn't touched me I turn over the cards and now they are sevens not Aces unbelievable and uh and yet it happened and that's but a minor example of the sorts of things that you do so that's the first thing absolutely astonishing two you involve many of the senses not just visual perception memory Etc but many of the senses and groups of people you are able to somehow create Perceptions in people or perhaps these perceptions are accurate that certain things have happened and everyone agrees that these things happen so it's not just one person being quote unquote tricked and then the third is that you and I both share a fascination with the human mind and perception which is really one of the main reasons why you're you're here today because you are a scientist uh who I believe understands how perception Works understands the gaps in perception and memory and understands these things at a practical level that no neuroscientist not I nor anyone else who could tell you about the nuts and bolts of the brain and nervous system could ever approach so welcome I'm super excited for our conversation and my first question is when you do a trick with one person with many people how confident are you that you're going to get the answer correct meaning are you always operating at the level of 100% certainty that you're going to get it right or rather is there a little bit of a gap are you running a like a 90% probability um and the reason I start with this question is that I think it's a very different situation when The Mentalist the magician is certain it's going to work out as opposed to when it's not and I think it's the dynamic tension of the possibility that it might not work out that gets everyone so engrossed in what you do yes so um first of all a lot of people think do you ever fail do you ever get it wrong and the truth is there's something they don't know we're going to reveal some Secrets here um a lot of people don't know that we are very much like jazz musicians I'm not a musician I'm going to probably butcher this analogy here but we write the story as it goes in other words you might see me do a trick and think that's what I do every day but I don't so in other words if something goes wrong because every person is really unpredictable uh I said take a card maybe I'm trying to make you take a certain card maybe I'm trying to influence you and you're not going for it I'm okay with making a little detour you just don't know I'm taking a detour and I'm improvising and I we'll go somewhere else and I'm okay with that so a lot of the magic that I love to do we call it Jazzy magic is Magic that literally gets written as we go but I'm the only one who knows it uh and you go wow it's concluded beautifully right so there's there's some times when I like after a show and I and I go wow this did not work and that didn't work and people say what do you mean everything worked perfect they don't know what I see is a little different than what you see so in that sense when you're an amateur magician you're just starting out and you don't have you know the experience you can literally just get stuck and go sorry let's do it again and it could happen but for a season you know a season performer someone who does it again and again and again I I'll borrow from a pendulate analogy that I love it's like gr Hog Day the movie uh we get to relive the same night again and again and again and guess what what people are very much alike I'll hear the same hackling I'll hear the same thing or I I I start to see types this person is going to be confrontational this person is going to be is is a person who believes maybe in Supernatural everybody has a Vibe and you know even though I'm not a scientist I'm not a psychologist uh I don't have any degrees in any of those but I'm a practitioner of psychology I tried the same trick a million times and I start to see patterns Behavior patterns that I can use to my advantage like for example I noticed that it's easier to fool smart people as opposed to people are not so smart tell me more about that because you know I'm relying on the bank of information you have in your head against you it's ta chi I know what you know and I know that whenever you view anything you have to fill in the blanks with lots of information I show you a couple of things and you say okay this makes sense this and I know how you think and the fact that I an idea of what you know and what you don't know I can use it against you and that's a beautiful concept right as opposed to someone who's not so educate I don't know what he knows and they tend to think very simple and they're the ones to figure out magic the most because they don't fill in the blanks they take it for what it is uh you telling yourself a better story you enriching The Experience based on all this the wealth of information you have about psychology and how this works and how perception works and how memory works for example you just described the trick I did for you you did not describe the trick you described your your memory of that trick so my job you know and I'm boring from my master myestro Juan tamari who's my favorite Magician of all time and I consider him we'll talk about him quite a bit now um he taught me so much but he he talks a lot about memory like we are first first of all we encoding the information I give you something to encode then I'm asking you to store it either in short term memory medium-term long-term uh I don't know if it's even a real term but a chemical uh memory right when it gets embedded in your memory and then I'm trying to manipulate how you're going to recall the experience and what you did you described my trick in a way that I could never do I wish I could perform the trick you just described I can't but I was trying to create at least the impression you recorded a feeling you had you did not record what you saw and experienced you recorded a feeling it felt so amazing that the feeling was coted in the memory as well and therefore you you were the co-author of that trick you you help me fool you I'm very curious about the role of emotion in the co-authoring of these tricks and by the way folks the conversation we're having today is not just about magic tricks and mentalists this occurs at the level of interactions between people one to one this occurs at the level of media to the general audience of the world this stuff scales uh at every level and in every domain of Life we'll get to how that exactly that occurs I wonder if I could ask you about the verse engineering of a trick a hypothetical trick sure sure sure so tell me if this trick is possible and if so one of the possible ways that you would do this um I I think I've seen you do something similar to this or other mentalists do something similar to this you're standing in a room full of people let's say 50 people and you have a piece of paper and a pen and you say okay I'm going to write down a series of numbers and you write them down you fold it up you put it on a table next year you set the pen down there's no contact with it anymore and then you go around the room and you just ask people for numbers between 1 and 25 you ask a certain number of people and then somehow you return to the paper you open it up and that's the sequence of numbers that it seems like a straightforward but astonishing trick it's a classic a classic okay classic of magic for people like me we want to know at least one solution to that challenge how does what's one way in which a magician could do that obviously we start to go to the physical explanation okay somebody underneath the table that the piece of paper was on wrote down the numbers they heard and put it on the table uh another solution would be that there was a stack of papers up there with any number of different combinations but then it's a very large number big stack of paper then it becomes hard to hide and on and on um all going in the wrong direction of course um I can also think of the end uh product way of doing this where the piece of paper that you show has the numbers that the people stated but somehow we think it's those numbers when it's actually other numbers like there's some sort of visual illusion that we all agree on seeing but here I'm just guessing so how could one do that trick wow we need two hours to dissect this one um so here's the deal I just noticed something as you were going through all the options is someone I assume you're not a magician no um I just realized that a quality of magic is that it ignites your imagination and your creativity you just basically saw something that has no explanation and you're a knowledgeable guy you know a lot about a lot of things and it in a weird in a good way it bothers you why don't I know that answer I know so much about the mind and how we sleep and how we you know how certain exercises affect our bodies and blah blah blah but this series of number I don't know and that drives you nuts a bit but it's good cuz then your mind starts racing and and thinking of everything you said is a wonderful exercise in uh problem solving right how could be achieved and then you slowly ruled them out as too much paper too much work hiring somebody under a table to write maybe a solution but you have to pay somebody just to do that job um but it's nice because um we're teasing the mind we're teasing we're challenging the mind in an era where it seems like all the information is out there we have I my smartphone can do you know more than my first computer could right in in my pocket so we are we are up against and by every time I I tell you this it's a bit of a tangent here um every time technology advances magicians get scared say oh I people are when they can do all these marvelous things I mean how are they going to care about the number you just spoke or or carard changing in my hand and I attribute that to again your desire to see something marvelous without by the way there's there are people that don't want to see magic like I do something that's really is seems impossible and they go slide of hand they they come up with a very simple solution they not need picking about exactly how you did it they go oh he's fast he's fast with his hands or you know they come up with a very simple solution that I don't know why it satisfies them but it does and it's because they lack the desire to see magic so to me again and we're going back to the co-authoring I really need someone a partner when I whenever I do magic that someone has this desire to see something that's beautiful that's going to bend the rules of what we know is possible right and they're joining me so to your question how is it done there's many many uh ways to achieve this effect and because we don't possess I don't we can talk about this if you want about the supernatural I don't believe that anybody possesses Supernatural powers or even close to that um and because of that we we have to ch eat we have to do some dirty work which I don't want you to know about um and so in other words every trick that I do has a little scar a little a moment I wish did not exist and by the way a magician when they choose a trick like that they need to say oh I can go this route or this route they're going to pay a price with this version Oh I cannot do it this way here I it's not as clean here I cannot be as direct here I have to choose maybe certain people in the the audience again I'm tiptoeing around it so I don't reveal how it's done um but you're making a sacrifice with every choice you make the goal is at the end to make somebody as smart as you go how how and then start racing and and at the end you reach a dead end hopefully it's magic you Excel and I enjoyed it and and that's I want you to surrender and and it's a surrender it's not uh you're not being defeated you you you give into the to this place where magic could happen you you make room for something that should not happen in this world to happen and and that's why I love magic so much it it is a a bit of a reminder that I'll tell you a story there is a joggler who is not a magician he's and and I'm not going to mention names for a reason so he juggles on the streets and you know make some money on the streets and one day he goes to see a magic show and the magic the magician wonderful magician uh who does this wonderful act it's the ZIP code act he says to people um tell me your zip code and then he tells them where they live tell me where you live he tells them the zip code and then he describes places around them oh you have a Starbucks there and blah blah and like he describe it's amazing it's wonderful now this joggler not a magician watches a magician who is doing a trick there's a scientific explanation to how it's done it's not it's not anything beyond that um and again it's wonderful and he goes how did he do that and then he comes up with the solution that the magician must havee memorized all the ZIP codes in the world not the case but that's the impression he goes home and starts memorizing all the ZIP codes in America first he spends thousands of hours to memorize zip codes for real he's doing the real version of what the magician did and he performs it now all over the country he's doing the ZIP code act for real and the beauty of this story is that a false performance artificial present representation of a skill inspired somebody to do something that is real and therefore push his limits is human you know realistic limits to a level that a lot of people go that's not possible right and and I think it's a beauty about this and again goes back to your question how is it done so maybe the solution you just came up with is better than what I do but I least ignite you to to think about it so I it's it's it's really a a big reason uh an important reason why I love magic so much staying with my question of how a trick like that is done you really want to know well I don't think you're actually going to tell me the specific order of operations to make it happen I I don't expect that but I can think of um two kind of um end points for exploring this one is or at least two one is to manipulate what's on the paper right like the other is to manipulate what people say or are likely to say perhaps by selecting people that are likely to say certain numbers because you have some understanding of that I don't know how that would happen the other is to completely revise people's understanding of what just happened in a group and I think the last possibility is the one that intrigues me and most people the most the idea that even in the company of other rational well-rested sober meaning non- inebriated or on drugs people that sometimes it helps that there's there could be a collective perception that is not accurate but everyone agrees to confabulate together and the reason I ask this and I focus on this third possibility is that we know that the memory system is a confabulation system correct a good example of this would be people who sadly have some form of dementia they often will find themselves in a room doing something and if you ask them hey what were you doing they don't say I don't know they say oh you know I came in here to do something and they create these elaborate stories of what got them there which may make sense to them might not um but we all do this we all confabulate false memories there is a huge topic into itself but um we all confabulate memory is not perfect so um I imagine this third possibility is one that you work with and that you massage um how does one think about memory in the context of these experiments that uh I just called them experiments these tricks that you do I like by I love that word right and and here we agreed that we're were going to talk about science today as we always do when whenever I see you um and in experiments as people may or may not know you ask a question but you pose hypotheses so you say like how do we cure cancer but then you pose a hypothesis you say I think it's going to be cured by doing blank blank and blank and then you test that and you try and rule out your hypothesis it's a little bit of why I call it an experiment um so for instance um is there a way that you can get people to believe that they saw the numbers let's make it very simple 3 8 and seven when in fact you held up a piece of paper that said something very different is that have you done that before I I I see where you're going with this uh and I and I love use the word experiments one of my heroes Chan Canasta was a psychologist who who used psychology in his work uh as a magician as a mentalist and he didn't he never called his pieces uh tricks or magic he called them experiments and he was careful about it he it's not just uh an aesthetic Choice he wanted to to plant this SE in their mind experiment means it could fail okay which is a very good starting point for any dramatic uh because if something is going to work and but if there's something at stake something could fail people are more engaged so I love the word I sometimes use the word uh what an experiment yeah it's like a these um crazy people that climb up the side of buildings with no ropes I mean we don't want to see them fall but the possibility that they could fall is what's exciting the the movie free solo cor with Alex hell we all know at the beginning he lives he he lives and yet you want to see it in case he might not live and even though you know he lives in some ways that's a a magic trick into itself that's the Brilliance of David Blaine who I consider one of my dearest friend and my one of my favorite magicians in the world and what he does I mean we can talk about him at length but you know blending real stuff with magic and it's almost sometimes it's hard to tell what is real and what's not and I I I even love that aspect and a lot of people don't know but all the stuff he does is real when he's holding his breath night after night in now in vegus at the wind 10 minutes and you know sitting uh in the audience watching David do that is so inspiring because I look at it symbolically he is is showing us cuz he was inspired by a kid who survived um being trapped under ice for a long time in recovered to full recovery and and he goes if he can do it then everybody could and it's it's a beautiful to meets the message is so strong just beautiful I'd like to take a brief moment and thank one of our sponsors and that's ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens I started taking ag1 way back in 2012 the reason I started taking it and the reason I still take it every day is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas for vitamins and minerals and it ensures that I get enough Prebiotic and probiotic to support gut health now gut health is something that over the last 10 years we realized is not just important for the health of our gut but also for our immune system and for the production of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators things like dopamine and serotonin in other words gut health is critical for for proper brain functioning now of course I strive to consume healthy Whole Foods for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day but there are a number of things in ag1 including specific micronutrients that are hard to get from Whole Foods or at least in sufficient quantities so ag1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals that I need probiotics prebiotics the adaptogens and critical micronutrients so anytime somebody asks me if they were to take Just One supplement what that supplement should be I tell them ag1 because ag1 support so many different systems within the body that are involved in mental health physical health and performance to try ag1 go to drink a1.com huberman and you'll get a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 and five free travel packs of ag1 again that's drink a1.com huberman Orient me again the question was yeah so the question is have you done or is it possible to get people to think that you're holding up a piece of paper that says now I forget the numbers my working memory wasn't engaged enough to do it uh whatever um 348 that's not what I said earlier when in fact they are looking at a piece of paper that says something different is that is that something that can be done absolutely absolutely there's a there's actually a piece where you you have a piece of paper literally printed a piece of paper and you control someone's mind you say uh I'm going to make you see things distorted you're not going to see reality the way everybody in this room incling me will see it starting now and it's literally a piece of paper that says two plus two and everybody can see it the entire audience can see it's 2 plus two what's the answer and it goes 16 okay and let's try something easier 1 + one it goes 24 and he he he's this guy is cognitively Smart Sharp he's not on drugs it cannot answer those questions it's an augmentation of reality and there that manifests in many forms in Magic the idea of seeing something that is in in a sort you know in the optical illusion land of what you see is not what you see and that's probably applicable to every trick you you'll ever see what you see it's not what you see it's what I want you to see and and I I love that and again the the that Chan Canasta guy spoke to you about he would go it would take three cards let's say ace of hearts King of Clubs seven of Spades three cards he'll go to a coffee shop and say uh choose one and they say King of Clubs thank you go to another table and he will do it all night and people what is he doing he's not doing any magic to them nothing he's just surveying the audience to see how they think right and this is information that we collect uh over the years like there's a something called um I can influence you let's say to take a specific card but it has to be done in such way that it feels like it was a free choice it was not a free choice and the difference between a good or a great magician and a decent magician or an okay magician is that one makes you feel like I chose this card there is no way you made me pick this card there is no way and that's a sort of augmentation it's you feel like you have control and yet you don't and you feel it with conviction you could swear are you sure that's the one so there's a famous famous um thing that he he used to do he would say I can make people change their mind or not and he says it up front he says I'm you're going to choose a card okay any card you like I'll go to the audience you point to any person you want they'll choose another card whatever they choose will be the card you're thinking of and then I'll give them 10 seconds to change their mind and if they do it will still be correct they can change their mind as many times as they want and I don't care once they say that's it that's the card that will be the card you're thinking of how can that be so the truth is and I'll reveal a little bit about that there is no trickery here as far as you know slide of hand or anything like that he literally was a master at making people either want to stick to a decision or change it he would basically manipulate their insecurity their ego something about them to either resist changing or to really want to change and and and and to me and I I I I have a conflict a dilemma about this because my whole foolest act which if want we can talk about is really based on on this conflict or this uh problem I have um sometimes the the method is way more beautiful than the effect itself so that's why I have no problem telling the Chen did that Chen found a way with uh using specific you know language or or gestures or whatnot without revealing too much to make somebody either stick to their choice or change their mind he could literally control their bias toward one or the other yes um does it involve touching their body in any particular way maybe maybe yeah many many times in your um performances and the performances of other mentalists and magicians they will say you know I pick a number or pick a card and then uh right before the trick is about to advance they'll say are you sure okay oh that's a big one and they'll say yes I'm sure or no I'm going to switch okay um and based on what you told us already um it's clear that the skilled Mentalist or magician can work with either scenario is maybe it's a bit of a it's the improvisation um but what I want to know is when you look at somebody's physical body how they sit their shape um and other features maybe how they dress how they stand maybe something about their eyes or their face can you make better predictions as to what sorts of numbers they'll pick whether or not they're going to stick to their choice or change their choice okay I think there's a lot of interest in this and maybe you could um since we're talking in generic terms and we're not presenting you with a line of people and asking um you which which person would do what um would you be willing to share what some of those cues are so I'm um you know me I wear this black shirt I have other shirts but I don't uh wear them on camera and um you know I comb my hair a certain way I sit a certain way I mean what sorts of predictions emerge from that or am I striking on the wrong variables so it's not the big things that that will reveal to me what cuz I I do kind of like profile a little bit for the magic purposes uh what kind of trick I will do with you and what I can't do with you what I will do with this guy or that guy right uh and it's not the shirt it's not how you wear your hair uh it's really small things and uh I can talk about many people that influence me avner The Eccentric is one of my favorite performers um his name is literally The Eccentric it's a it's a different name but he goes by alar the Ecentric and he's a wonderful performer it's it's even hard to categorize what he does but he's I'm doing this service a clown a mime a jogler a magician and I've never seen someone who's better at what we call audience management there something we call audience management is how do you interact with people and he's able to get again I'm I'm butchering his his uh uh his his class to to something very simple but he gets three s's from a person meaning I can ask you nonverbally to agree to participate with something I want you to do MH and he will do small things like just a little gesture and they he can see if they go for it he sees if there's that dance can we is that person comp complying to something very small or is he resisting and then easily I can go to the next person so and he's a master a master at uh doing that even breathing if I breathe a certain way when I this is it blew my mind when I first learned from anner it's like when you walk into a place so you don't see me I'm behind a curtain something and I walk in and the first thing I do is or as opposed to do I take the breath in or out when I the first step I take on stage and the audience in a weird way mimics that really yeah so if I go you feel you you kind of tend to relax with me it now if you want a more uh exaggerated examp example of that if you watch a movie and it's really tense and there's tension you will start feeling tension right we're we're kind of like empathy is a big big part of what we do uh that's why one of the things I choose to do in my show when I first start is not to start with the most amazing magic to blow your mind oh my God he's amazing it's it's it's more I I gear the first pieces towards connecting with you I'd rather say something really endearing funny connecting truthful honest before I start trying to blow your mind why I want to connect with you first so we are you know a mother will be proud of her or her son's playing guitar and much more forgiving if he makes a little mistake or something but you'll every little achievement he will make she will be so proud of him because she has empathy she wants him to succeed she wants him to do well so I want you to adopt me I want you to to feel empathy towards me I want you to be I'm rooting for you this makes a lot of sense um I do some Live Events and I don't think about whether or not I exhale or inhale when I get out there but I definitely try and get out there and just kind of take it all in and relax and we have what I hope is a relaxing interesting conversation and you kind of work with the amplitude of excitement and and I'm not thinking about it in any kind of conscious way but this is actually a wonderful tool that I hope everyone will export from this conversation which is if you ever need to do public speaking um have probably a good long exhale as you get out there will be great everyone will relax it's also tough for me to see live theater because oftentimes if it's not going well for them I feel embarrassed for them I think people vary however in terms of their levels of empathic Attunement some people are very tuned into the emotional states of others and some are not so are there people in audiences assuming a relatively random array of people that are fairly rigid like you wouldn't want to you wouldn't call them up to the table okay um so when you select someone to come up in front of the crowd um are you uh basing that on some level of empathic Attunement that they're they're in sync with you absolutely so it starts with the first thing look you come in cold the audience as you said uh the first I quoting what a here the first thing they do is they say I hope this doesn't suck and also the performer says I hope it doesn't it's not going to suck uh the the starting point is it depends expectation could vary you know if something is really highy and go oh this is going to be great or you've seen the artist and you trust them but if you come in cold you don't know the person you don't know if it's going to be great or not you just happened to be there and there's a magic show let's check it out there's there's tension there's almost like they're auditioning you uh I I wonder if it's going to be worth my time so and I don't care if people bought a ticket to see my off broadberry show or not the first 10 15 minutes it's really about telling them in so many you without words but telling them I'm here for you I'm here to connect with you and I'm here to to create this some some wonderful thing that we're going to feel together I want him to feel that it's like an intimacy yes and that to me by the way is way more important than me fooling people like if somebody came to me after the show and said oh wow your magic is unbelievable I have no idea how you did it that's the lowest compliment I can get and thankfully and gratefully often I get the uh the most common one is you know the magic was great but you we liked you they feel connected to you and I love that because to me the magic is important it's I want it to be really deceptive I want it to be you know impossible and beautiful and whatnot but to me it's also a vehicle to connect with people because at the end of the day that's what it is and that's the only difference I can have because there's a lot of magicians a lot of people can do magic that's that you can't figure out that's the lowest bar you fool me good magician make me feel magic higher and maybe feel magic and connect it's like if somebody cannot even explain what I did in my show and goes you had to be there that's something Steve Martin says all the time you had to be there I can't tell you with words what it's like to see his show you have to see it in person that to me is a very high goal uh of of uh like I wanted to remember the experience and the feeling rather than particular oh the not I want to to care about what they experienced emotionally and that's how I recall the trick that you did outside U the person who initially connected us a just absolutely terrific um what I call close contact uh card magician Franco pascali yes here in Los Angeles um he has amazing uh card skills he does um something with his card tricks I noticed um I'll go to the magic assle as often as possible and I just watch and like to take this in and I try and think about the Neuroscience behind it as you can tell and um when he lands a trick um meaning when the person takes the card and says oh my goodness you know like how did you know it's like the the ace switches the card whatever it is Franco also acts surprised he joins you as an audience member momentarily he goes oh and then and then he goes back to being the the the magician and I find that especially important for people to understand because you do the same and I always say having studied the lectures of many many spectacular scientists and lecturers that the best lecturers in the classroom obviously are teaching the material from a place of deep understanding of the material one would hope right um so they have Mastery of the material in some case virtuosity with the material but as they're presenting the material to people who know nothing about it they themselves are showing their Delight in the material as if it's the first time they've ever seen it and so they are both student and teacher at the same time and you feel immense resonance with them that's nice and it reminds me of the experience of seeing you do magic or Mentalist work sure um I'm yet to see you go oh my goodness but I think it's the um the sense that you're collaborating in something and there's this giving over of self like I'm I trust aie to take me someplace with this so the resistant people the people that sort of like I'm not going to let him fool me right what's so amazing is that in your shows often times those people are the ones that are the ones walking out just shaking their heads I know because brought some of them along to your shows going there's no way there's no way and yet you you you got them so do the resistant people serve a role even if they're not called up of course yeah what role do Skeptics play in convincing other people that something happened that didn't really happen so first of all the transformation let's somebody's a Believer and you you show magic and nice it's it's wonderful we can celebrate magic together but if somebody's a skeptic really skeptical and have had really I and I and I sense that I could convert them I could transform them and the audience watches this transformation so we going from here to here that's a a wonderful thing so I every now and then I will recognize the person who's like and you slowly start to see him melt and softens it's almost like a musician at a wedding you know there are the people that jump up and dance immediately but if you're a skilled musician you get that person that you know their their wife is saying come on let's dance and M won't move and then maybe you hit a certain Motif in the music and the person Taps their foot a little bit moves their head and then there are certain people that they won't dance at all unless their song comes up and then they like Dart to the dance floor sounds a little bit like that and you've captured them you've captured their emotion you've captured their willingness you've captured their whole body willingness to participate in something that a minute before they were either too embarrassed too stubborn or too tired to engage in so here's the deal magic could be an often is intimidating I am basically challenging your intellect I in and some people if they take it the wrong way they what they hear is you're telling me that you're smarter than me you're telling me you know things I don't know and I'm not even close to knowing so screw you and and they they will reject it aggressively like I've had thankfully it's a percent uh a time when I you know we do walk around magic and I go and some people as soon as they see me go no no no no thanks they don't want to see it and and I I to me that that drove me knots like why don't they want to see they don't even know what I'm about to offer you're going to violate their sense of self trust that's I think the fear absolutely and and as a magician or as an artist if I if I use that but my goal is to also educate them as I do the magic that we're creating this safe space where these things could happen and it's clear that the I'm I'm using it for your own good I I you know I did a whole fullest act exactly about knowing and not knowing so I uh I'm not going to spoil too much if people want to see it they can see it um I'll tell you a backstory on this if you don't mind so Tommy the three major um Heroes of magic are Ju Tommy wander and Chan Canasta are they alive still Chan is not not and uh Tommy past Juan is still kicking butt in Madrid I think I saw him at the castle he's very um very um exuberant yeah okay he's so he's a a hero and and uh I'm his student so but let's talk about Tommy for SEC so Tommy for a long time he he did Magic that that magicians did not know how it works it's it was so devious that even magicians did not know how it works and at some point he released some DVDs to teach his magic and the trick is is very simple you borrow someone's watch it disappears and there's a table right next to him with a little box and a ribbon and he literally grabs the ribbon so he never touches the Box lifts the Box gives it to somebody he opens it inside there's an alarm clock they unscrewed the alarm clock and inside is their watch no I mean yes yes but even magicians who saw that they go I have no idea how it's done no idea and then I remember watching the explanation for the first time and I was thinking that the method was by far more interesting intriguing revealing just beautiful it made the trick less like I said you should perform the explanation don't perform the trick perform the expl and and I I I I I broke the rules of magic like my My non- Magician friends will come over and say let let me showare something and I show them the trick and they go wow that's amazing let me show the explanation and their mind was blown are you willing to share a little bit of what the explanation is or is that not no no okay but but I will explain a little bit so the EXP I tell what the explation was that it revealed that he's an engineer that he can build props that are like ingenious uh in some again I'm going around it but at some point the person who opens the Box is's doing part of the trick and he doesn't know it he's he's creating the trick but he doesn't know he's contributing something to it um and it's just beautiful metaphorically symbolically it's on so it hits so many levels at least and that planted a SE in my mind I want to create an effect that the method is prettier than the trick itself so I worked for 5 years to create an explanation a pseudo explanation to a trick that was just beautiful and it was an opportunity to I don't have you seen it I don't know if youve this the one you did for pen and Teller yeah I um you can describe it or I can describe it I mean let see how I remember it um you're right uh I I have more interest in listening than speaking um but I'll I'll tell you how I remember it okay um you're in a very you're in front of a very large audience that includes the um scientist slash uh show guys at pen and Teller who basically debunk stuff they're kind of they tried to figure it out they try and figure stuff out um some they are asked to pick someone in the audience they pick a guy as I recall you wore a green and white sweater wow you have a good memory yeah um he stands up and um ask him to pick a card I think I forget what it is a jack of clubs perhaps um let's just say for sake of example Jack of clubs you said are you sure you're now on stage mind you there are hundreds of people in the audience maybe more and you say are you sure and he goes yeah and then he goes and you say are you very sure and he say no I'm gonna switch so now you first of all you have a good memory uh that perhaps perhaps um I've been I've been accused of I have a little bit of an audiographic memory for certain things but not a visual uh memory that's perfect they're sort of adjacent we could talk about that sometime at something helps you if you need to learn neuron Anatomy that's about it can be cultivated okay so then he switches the card let's just call it um uh I don't know Jack of uh Spades right okay um or King King of Spades say let's say Jack of Spades and then next to you on the table up on the stage is a a table a round table um with a plexiglass Box Cigar Box Cigar Box it's clear no no not yet no not yet later later okay at first it's just a wooden cigar wooden box that's right and a mug a white mug not unlike the mug I have here except white you take a sip from that mug and then at some point during this exchange and then you um open the box yes and you pull from the box of course the card that he selected and everyone say goes oh my goodness how could that possibly be because obviously anyone could have been selected in the audience he switched his choice Etc um but then you reveal how the trick is done or at least seemingly reveal it which is that beneath the Box there's some uh a bunch of different decks of cards on 52 on a Turn Style So within each one a um right and I I missed a piece of it you you pull out the whole deck and only one card is turned over and all the other cards are blank all the other cards are blank right so there's more to it so then it turns out that there are 52 different decks underneath the table and it's on a Turn Style so you can actually dial it and let's let's keep the ending surprise right so there's there's a surprise ending to it right so so then it at least seemingly makes sense as to how AI did this he has a all the different option possible options available to him physically but the audience doesn't realize that also that the mug by the way engages a magnet system that allows him to dial the the deck of cards to the correct one that allows him to match the choice so it truly could be any card in the deck good meaning it's all the so the straightforward explanation is it's all physical trickery by way of props correct so here's the deal uh what I tried to achieve with this piece is first to make people feel magic so the trick it's a good trick you know name any card the the card he named was reversed and then it was the only blue card in the deck and then all the other cards were blank so it's clearly the only card he could have named and he did switch is uh which is amazing detail that you remembered he did switch from the King of Clubs to the King of Spades something like that yeah now so people felt what it's like to see a good car trik right and then I wanted her to feel what it's like to know and the lesson here is you know you could satisfy your curiosity oh that's how it's done and you can go on with your life and that's it and and that's what happens to a magician when you first learn the secrets to you know something that fooled you there's disappointment I remember the first Shak that was revealed to me um it was a little red handkerchief stuffed into the hand gone and I'm like what do it again and he did it again he did 10 times in a row I couldn't and then he explain to me how it's done and the secret was so simple and stupid no didn't that you share with us no no no but I gotta tell you it was primitive it was simple and in the moment he revealed the gimmick that caused the anchor Chief to disappear I could not see the trick again every time he do it's this yeah it's like falling out of love something like yeah that's really I mean a previous guest on the podcast Carl di Roth one of the best bioengineers nor scientist and psychiatrist in the world um went on Lex Friedman podcast and they were talking about love and Carl said something interesting that's very relevant here he said um he's a colleag you mine at Stanford very poetic guy um he said you know love between two people romantic love that is is one of the few things in life that we collaborate with someone to story something into the future H you know this is different than the love of a child or a sibling or a parent or a pet Etc or a friend right that you you're creating a story that's based on real experience of past and present but there's this storying forward of love that's great and um and falling out of love involves of course the ending of the story moving forward but also a in some cases sadly a revision of the events of the past I like I it's great it's it's very close it's very close to to the feeling you have as a magician the first time you a tree get exposed right it disappoints you because you have a desire for it to be real the the desire of a young magician is when I see something like that is that it's a supernatural power and the F the first thing you you you understand is that it's not Supernatural that it's quite simple and primitive and it fooled you because of all the psychology and and the desire like everything we spoke about my desire to be to see magic uh the the the fact of the idea of misdirection which we can talk about at length misdirection means I provide something very interesting for you to follow and you will follow that path because it's the most interesting at the moment to follow and in the background in the sh fad of of Life some dirty stuff happen but you don't pay attention because I don't feature it it's not important and I make you render it is not important so it does that right and it's disappointment but there's good news if you keep up with magic and you start to understand that to do a trick the secret the the the actual how you did it is 1% of the the whole procedure and there's much more to doing that trick effectively which is storytelling connecting uh doing it in such way that somebody cares about it and and that is a lifetime of of uh pondering and contemplation so you have maybe you'll find analogy with love again I don't know there's also this time when you start appreciating it again appreciate the secret again because you understand the Nuance you understand the complexity of this simple thing and that that's what happened to me so I in some magic which is the exception is the table that we spoke about that I didn't fool us or Tommy W's table where the effect is so so so magnificent that you do appreciate it immediately but those are rare most magic is simple dirty and to the point but it achieves uh something that looks very complex perhaps now would be the appropriate time for you to reveal the the the non reveal of the explanation of the trick because one of the amazing things about the trick that you did with selecting the card that the gentleman in the audience of pen and Teller had mentally and verbally selected is that at the very end after everyone believes they Now understand how the trick is done the Turn Style table the magnet the the coffee mug you proceed to strip away the the curtain the curtain around the table and pull out a piece of paper not 52 decks of cards it's a picture or 52 it's a picture which means that the explanation that they got while entirely plausible if that's actually what had happened is not at all what had happened in other words you pop out at the end that they don't actually know how it's done you know how it's done and I'm not even going to bother to ask you um how it's done because you're not going to reveal it in other words people were misdirected into thinking they understood the trick and therefore kind of there's a bit of a let down it's interesting but it's just mechanics magnets and and then you reveal that uh their understanding is actually not real yes and and the reason I wanted to go there it's so I wanted them to feel magic then to feel what it's like to know something and the the fact that it's irreversible you can't unknow a trick once you know how it's done and then I what I said look I made a choice I chose to learn the secrets to Magic and I'm paying a price for it I cannot see magic the way you can I cannot enjoy the way my audience can and in a weird way I'm experienced magic only through their eyes when I see somebody goes wow through you I can experience it but that's it I cannot firsthand experience magic the way you can so I said I'm not here to make that choice for you so let me bring you back to safety to the place you were at it's a place I envy to mystery and then I revealed that the whole explanation was Bogus the whole thing was just another lie and I'm establishing another thing that as a magician I have a license to lie to you and it's okay cuz that's my job and therefore it makes it honest and we're collaborating in that to some extent because when people go to a magic show they understand that another former guest on the podcast Rick Rubin who needs no introduction um but by the way he's a big fan of magic um has said to me before um that there are only two things in life that are absolutely true one is nature right they're real truths they're real laws and Rules of Nature yeah and the other is uh for him uh professional wrestling because uh Rick loves professional wrestling he's a lifetime member of the aw and the WWE I've gone to see wrestling with him and the reason he believes it's one of the few things that's real is that everyone knows it's not real and so everyone agrees to collaborate in this story this theater of these guys hate each other this woman and this woman are now friends they're collaborators and so unlike everything else which is completely made up and you're not sure what's real and what's uh fake with professional wrestling and with nature it's a real truth I would add to that magic because when we go to see magic we want to be astonished most people do we want our perceptions to be uh violated right what we believe is there isn't there Etc um and yet we are doing this consensually we we're doing this and so we're agreeing like let's collaborate in in a in a lie that there's this thing called Magic um I guess and that's a pretty ill defined term in its own right where you know this idea that physical objects can be made to disappear violate the rules of nature of physics um and unless you're of a certain ilk out there in the world that simply is not the case the laws of nature hold so maybe there's another analogy there because we know that professional wrestlers are faking it and we know a magician fakes it too he fakes Supernatural Powers right they're doing real things in wrestling but they're not actually trying to harm one another correct right they're collaborating but it's almost a cargraph fight right yes I think there's some my understanding is based on discussions with Rick and professional wrestlers um that Rick has introduced me to is that there's some room for improvisation and occasionally people will hurt one another um accidentally sometimes there are real conflicts that are created yeah just like in the theater people will have relationships off stage Etc and it creates conflict on stage and that's the where the theater of life meets the theater of the stage and vice versa so I would would add to that maybe maybe I'm wrong um that you do a magic show and you know an educated person a smart person who knows that what I do is trickery Conjuring uh but every now and then they might ask I wonder if that was real that little part he just did maybe that was real so there's there's a moment I think in Magic where even the smartest guy who knows I do tricks I go yeah this is all tricks but maybe what he just did now maybe that was real like make it when you say real you mean violates the rules of physics so um taking a card holding it up clenching your fist making it disappear I'm giving simple kind of silly mind reading or or is they say maybe he's able to do those things psychologically or whatnot right and maybe that happens also in wrestling they say yeah it's fake but I think that moment was real so there's an inkling or moment where because I think you to create this drama and to me that that existed magic is he real is he fake uh did I figure it out or did I not figure it out am I close or am I not there's constant conflict in a magic show that you go in and out of and I wonder if that happens in resting as well where you you know it's fake but maybe there's something that was real or this happened and that was not planned so I think that this just the thinking the fact that you invested into thinking what is is real and what is not is intriguing I'd like to just take a quick break and acknowledge one of our

insidetracker tocom I think um there's a much larger theme here that we're veering toward and I'm getting excited because this has to do with how the brain works and it and there examples in different domains but to come to mind now Rick and I sometimes hang out um here in Los Angeles and that there's a place where we do sauna and cold and it looks out on the ocean and um Rick once turned to me and said um you know isn't it interesting you know we know that there're all these animals under the water dolphins and whales and all this stuff sharks and uh but when we see a dolphin or a group of dolphins or we see a whale breach it's like people are just delighted now they're beautiful animals but often times it's just a tail slapping the top and I think and he said I wonder if it's because it reminds us of how much is going on there underneath the surface and and I love that because I think a he's right you know I've done some snorkeling some scuba diving you see lots of stuff and it's a it's a brilliant experience to see all that and to be a fish of sorts and be breathing underwater but there is something Magnificent about seeing an aquatic animal breach the surface and it and it goes beyond just seeing the animal it's like a reminder of all these other things that are likely happening that are outside our usual perception and so that's what comes to mind there um and then I had another example but I but I can't think of it now um where oh it's in um Sports you know I always think of there's unskilled skilled Mastery and virtuosity and and virtuosity in music like yoyo ma um or in sport I don't know pick up I don't know Michael Jordan whatever favorite sport this idea that maybe they don't even know what they're going to do next that there's some improvisation at the level of extreme Mastery where you're going to see something you've never seen before and I think that's what Delights people it's not just about getting the ball into the end zone or the ball into the basket or playing a piece of music it's the idea of something happening for the first time and maybe again as with the earlier example that the person performing The Athlete the musician Etc the magician the mentalists they themselves are delighted by what just happened they didn't even realize it was going to happen and you collaborate in this like wow life holds far more than I experience on my daily perceptual kind of framework yeah could very well could be and I think your shows bring people to that I I want to um return to a couple of ideas first of all we've been talking about emotion and collaboration a lot sure um we've had a guest on the podcast David Spiegel he's our associate chair of Psychiatry at Stanford who does clinical hypnosis uh which it brings people into a state of calm plus a very constrained context where they're more likely to think about certain things than others how much of what you do with an individual group of people in your craft involves hypnosis constraining the context in other words eliminating certain patterns of thinking to make other certain patterns of thinking more likely is that like a a storytelling like you start telling me a story a horror story or a mystery or a comedy story I'm shutting down whatever you're not talking about is that is that something that you do yeah so so first of we have theatrical hypnosis people that do shows where they get they gather about 20 people stage and they start making them dance like chickens right um I've never been full on with with this type of performances for various reasons I just I to me that's not the best way for me to engage with an audience or or or to manipulate them however there's some there's certain things that we do in in in Magic that if you say certain things in a certain way it will produce a certain answer and it amazes me too I like there's some SEC we call them psychological forces that you you see uh a string of words in a certain order and and it will produce with with with high percentage a yes or a no or I want this and that that and like would you you want to pick the this deck of cards or that deck of cards type leading that could that could be the simplest of of the idea but it could it could be even more complex than that um and and it amazes me because it's almost like a recipe you follow the recipe put in the oven boom okay you know but there's in Magic when I se certain certain things there's a moment when I I'm waiting for you to say something and I I I don't know if you're going to follow what I just did and then I hear it and I go there's a joy it's like yes it work and this reveals something fundamental about the brain for instance I could imagine if I have two mugs in front of me for those listening if I hover my finger on one of them longer than others and I say would you like to drink from this mug and keep it there for 10 seconds or this one and I just tap the other one briefly do you think you bias the probability of which one somebody will pick absolutely because and that's what that's a great example ER I could it depends on my character first I need to know who I'm doing it to are you the Challenger are you the guy who's going to go with anything okay let's say it's the guy who go with anything think there's a likelihood he will go with the one you touch longer but if it's the Challenger he will say oh I I see what's Happening Here Andrew is trying to make me take this one and therefore I'm going to take that one so and that's that's the simplest idea of of of challenges and I could challenge you again and say with doubt and then I could say are you sure you want the one that I tapped just briefly I'm not telling you it that way but I'd say are you sure and if you say yes you're challenging me again and now I'm certain you're a challenger so you're collecting data basically you're collecting data and and because I've done it thousands of times I do the exact same spell the same you know order of events and I and I and I get to to try it and sometimes I say okay let's phrase it differently you know there's routines where I do when I I need someone to say a certain something and and I don't just rely on the psychological Force I I have other Tools in my arsenal of of of tools and but it surprises me the am the the percentage this the the rate uh and that's Chan did a lot he understood the idea that if people feel challenged they do this if they feel like maybe that you're desperate for them to change they'll act a different way and again I'm tip toing again because I don't want to demystify Magic here I I'm trying to say that there's a real way for and and you know Daniel conman and Emma tersi they talk about it in in their work you know they're thinking fast and slow for example which which to us is a magic book how people make decisions and he they they often say if you you phrase a question one way versus another way and even though the same thing is at stake it's the same equation if you phrase it this way they'll prefer that if you phrase it that way they prefer the other one it and it makes no sense because that's the bottom line is like which one do you want well I think the brain runs algorithms and um some of it's historical in how we are raised I give an example A friend of mine has twins and I said uh how's it going with the twins um describe their personalities and how they differ and he said that one of his twin daughters um no matter what you tell her she says no she challenges you but not as a way to disengage engage as a way to engage nice interesting yeah interesting um and the other one is very willing to engage in things doesn't challenge but engages through you know active collaboration um when we had Chris Voss a former FBI negotiator here on the podcast he said one way to get information from people on in these uh scenarios he used to do before is instead of asking them a question you give a hypothesis you keep your hair really you know nice you got great hair you must um you must like spend a lot of money on clothes now people will respond he tells me by either agreeing yes or no I don't really spend a lot of money you just got information but you're not asking do you spend a lot of money on clothes you basically State a hypothesis yes and then they are either going to accept or refute your hypothesis and people almost reflexively respond to hypothesis about them from others by wanting to defend the truth and that's a way that FBI negotiators and others get information rather than ask questions give them hypothesis and people will defend their truth to the point of giving up information they wouldn't otherwise yeah and and if you want to I know you're here to for me to reveal my tricks so I'll reveal something hypnosis they do this quite a bit and it's a beautiful strategy of of of doing it they'll make a few statements and they're simple statements they're accurate they you can argue with those statements they they ring true and you believe them and then maybe the last thing they're going to say is not quite true but because of you average the information and you go okay it's he's speaking the truth now he's telling us the truth but in between those statements there's some inaccuracies there that are starting to manipulate you but they're half truth like it's it's like for example I say the this this is a round Table Right and uh and you feel you can feel the light right even if you close your eyes you could feel the light and you can even feel that even if you didn't know that this is a bigger light than this one because of the heat now this might be a false statement but it makes sense and you can start to feel heat on one side and you start to go yeah is is it's logical it it's very sensical therefore it's it's true but it's a half truth maybe if we measure that this is a stronger life who knows but and I and I say you know and you feel there's a bit of a hum here and the more you focus on it and it's get and it's getting louder now because you're paying attention to it it's getting louder it's not getting louder you know actually you're guiding perception but I'm guide exactly I'm I'm I'm directing your attention to the things I want you to you heard the plane mhm it's an illusion no it's a real plane so you know but this is something that hypnotists do very well you know guiding you you know going to NLP and all that it's all related the idea of like um sounding like they're telling you things that should make sense and they're accurate but they're not they're sort of accurate and it becomes more and more ridiculous until they tell you dance like a chicken and then you Dan like a chicken yeah it's so interesting because um perception obviously is governed by the brain at least in part brain and body but nervous system and we have essentially two attentional spotlights meaning we can pay attention to two things at the same time but probably not five and we can merge those spotlights and we can make them more intense so to speak or we can dim them and make them more diffuse you know there's a bunch of things that we can do with attentional spotlighting what you're talking about here is attentional spotlighting bringing people's perception to real things that are happening but heightening one's perception of those so getting more granularity on what's Happening like right now I'm in contact with physical contact with a pen in my hand but I wasn't thinking about how it feels but if I put all of my perception there close my eyes and really think about it the whole nature of the perception changes corre the physical object hasn't changed nothing else in the room has changed but that driving of attentional spotlighting and intensity is essentially what governs our whole reality I think of everything we're talking about here and I can't help but think about like media social media politics you know very like third rail issues uh things or top very third rail topics right and yet this is essentially what we do the brain people want um a short-hand way of navigating a very complex world and media marketing Etc is in large part designed to capture people's attention and then funnel it towards some specific endpoint vote this way by this way don't vote that way or don't vote that way and and it's uh I feel like given our discussion you one has to wonder to what extent we we are all living in that what I guess people call it a simulation it's not a simulation it's a we are all being biased by these external forces do you see examples of quote unquote magic and Mentalist work at the level of media at the level of politics without talking about sides or centers you know of course first of all I feel like social media has changed the way audience behaves in the theater tell me more about that so first of all I know now you have Tik Tok and Instagram and and it's really short clips of information and people go through them really quickly so there stimulation they need to be stimulated way more often than they used to so I can't do a routine now that really drags with long monologs and it's slow the speed changed and and the fact that you know and I and I I think about this a lot I mean there's a blackout when when I did Inner Circle there's a blackout before I appear so I I come in and I I can still see people to the very last minute on their phones and I'm like wow it's the going from one stimulation to a real stimulation with almost no gaph there's not even a second a buffer between this stimulation to what I'm and and it always bothers me cuz I want to to clean their pallet I want to reset their pallet and it bothers me that they're on a phone yeah it's like um going from the the Super Bowl to the NBA championships or from the ballet to a rock concert it's like um yeah I actually have a theory which is that for those that are willing to introduce gaps in stimulation sleep we'll talk more about sleep um rest walks where we're not looking at our phones or just kind of um not necessarily bored but that those gaps we know we know with certainty are when the brain both processes information stabilizes information that we've learned and comes up with new ideas there it's it's almost like nowadays if you want to get really good at some craft just introduce more gaps in between intense focus and learning around that thing and exposure to that thing I I I couldn't be more certain about this it's it's true and again Juan again Tamar talks about the the the the power of pauses and and one of the things we try to do is that people will embed um a memory so it's not just that you encode the information and you want them to store it you want to start long term and to be able to recall what they've seen now if you move from one action to the other it's just not going to work so there's a thing that Juan does where he's like he's holding a card and he says can you see the reflection in my glasses and every's like what is it doing look do you see reflection and and meanwhile he's holding a pling card to point to towards the glasses and then at some point he places the card on the table and accidentally en knocks a a glass filled with water everywhere and people p like they start cleaning it and and it's like it's inter a huge Interruption to what just happened and then he says uh does anybody know what card this is and most of the times nobody knows he goes you never saw this card and they go no you never showed it to us oh I never showed it to you and there was one event where he did where he replayed the video to them says look I'm holding it for 15 seconds in front of you in a very awkward way and they don't remember it because something dramatic happened immediately after no there's no moment for them to isolate the two events and the other event was way more uh impactful and therefore more memorable that it erased the small memory the small event the the there's a big event and a smaller event and that took over that's why maybe I don't people crash into they have an accident you know whatever they don't remember the 10 or 5 seconds before it kind of erases it m so we often when we do magic we do want to give him a moment to really relax and to digest what they've just seen so they can store it very well if it's something you want them to store but if it's something you want them to prefer to forget than creating a dramatic moment adjacent to it and with no Gap it's the way to go yes this is we clut it we clut their mind with information when we don't want to store it we will slow down and feature it and give it enough time to breathe and live when we want them to record it so the speed the emphasis the pauses all of those things are manipulating how they remember things can I share with you a little bit of Neuroscience please bit knowledge this is relevant both to what you just said and to learning of any kind there's a phenomenon called Gap effects which are very well demonstrated in neuroscience and psychology of learning um but but before I explain those it's really important to know that when we learn we're exposed to something and then the actual rewiring of Connections in the brain occurs typically during sleep or rest periods away from the learning there's the stimulus just like exercise you don't get better heart you know V2 Max and muscle strength Etc during the exercise there's an adaptation that occurs later and with uh learning of cognitive material or information of any kind even if it's very emotionally impactful experience or information the rewiring of connections occurs later typically in sleep or sometime later now during sleep the replay of the memory occurs but at a rate about 20 or 30 times faster and for some reason Nobody Knows Why in Reverse okay so a string of numbers 1 2 3 4 5 six seven in sleep is played 30 times faster and SE 7654321 nobody's NOS why this is the way the brain encodes information about space about information uh of any kind now Gap effects are the very well demonstrated effect of let's say you're teaching me how to um shuffle cards or a sequence of numbers or scales on a piano I'm practicing I'm practicing I'm practicing but somebody figured out that if every once in a while there's a gap introduced where I cannot perform the rehearsal I do nothing the brain does the same thing the hippocampus a center in the brain required for memory and encoding of new memories plays that same sequence at 20 to 30 times faster in Reverse so this way so what this means is that when we introduce gaps the brain is still processing the information but much faster and the introduction of the Gap somehow allows whatever we just learned to be encoded far more than if we don't introduce a gap which is exactly what you just said but with a bunch of nerdy Neuroscience speak to it but this has been shown for music for math for conceptual knowledge Etc and what it says to me is that if we want to learn things controlling the Cadence and the um the availability of gaps and the adjacency like how densely cluttered or spaced out things are is key and um I'll just share briefly and forgive me because I'm going long here but um the way I remember the video of you with pen and Teller and the green and white sweater and a few other you took a nap right after no what I do is I watch something or read something and I sometimes highlight and take notes but then what I do is I close my eyes sometimes I take a walk and I just think about what I just saw now I have a problem and I was recently referred to as neuroatypical which I'm starting to wonder if that's true but you know uh I'll get assessed and we'll see um that oftentimes irrelevant details are what get encoded to memory as opposed to the core feature but um we'll see um I I like to think the core the core components are what I remember um but often details that seem irrelevant get encoded like I can remember details of things that are kind of maybe trivial um to most so I these Gap effects are are a real neurobiological phenomenon there's no question about it and I suppose I should pause to let that sink in I know and people should take a nap right after this go sleep and think about this conversation I think it's so interesting because so that explains something about encoding of information but the causing people to forget something is equally important so often times when you do tricks or when other magicians and mentalists do tricks I notice that you'll get people to count with you okay let's all right let's just count the cards count them with me it'll be one two three is there something about the counting itself or the Cadence of the counting that is that is um valuable yes uh we we try to create tension you know it's a drum roll think of it as a drum roll that all the way to the punchline um and you you're trying to create this tension oh my oh my God oh my God and then it happens right and on the relaxation the moment right after that when you relax that's the moment to do the things you don't want them to encode the those are the the most vulnerable so in other words when you go to a magic show Do Not Laugh do not relax remain tense and you'll be good but the moment you relax you're off guard you're not scrutinizing you're relaxing uh um so we we do play a lot and slini was a master of that the idea of tension and relaxation so those are just one of the tools that we would use in order to do what we need to do at the right spot look here here's an interesting example you've heard the term misdirection I think every person in the world have heard and understands the idea of misdirection a magician is misdirecting you and yet that information does not help you in the real world right you know the concept you know it exists you know a magician will make you look at the wrong place at the wrong time and you would or maybe the right place at the right time and you would still follow in other words knowing the principle knowing that he's doing it it's still effective and that is amazing so to me that is uh the reason I don't TR to enrich people people's knowledge about magic and to give a little bit of information of of behind a curtain the things that magicians say oh we going to you know there's a beautiful saying that I just love and I don't know who who's uh responsible for this beautiful quote but I love it I quote it all the time uh people think that magicians are guarding the secrets from the audience but it's the other way around we are guarding the a audience from the secrets so um because we know that once you know how it's done you won't enjoy it but I believe also that there's a level of knowledge that you can know about magic that next time you see magician you would enjoy it more because you understand that to do one C trick could take months and months of work and we we think about every word in every move and how we interact and how we you know hook you into wanting to be fold create the desire for you to see magic and it's such an intricate process so maybe you know revealing revealing a little bit about magic is not a bad thing so you understand the complexity of this art which unfortunately is invisible art cuz a Pianist sure you can see how skillful I am but if you come to me after show oh you're so fast with your hands that's an insult I want you to say but you never touched anything so it's it's it's a bit of a a conflict here it's like uh the show that I saw that you did in New York right off Washington Square Park um uh you didn't touch any of the cards or materials the audience did it all for you which are the inner circle you had a people actually maneuvering the cards and doing things they weren't collaborating with you in fact it made it far less like that you ought to be able to do what you were doing um which is which is remarkable I think that um you know as you're describing this I I can't help but feel that the understanding of mechanism or how it's done just a little bit is is a little bit of what I've tried to do with the podcast where I think people obviously want to know what to do for their health but if they understand a little bit of the mechanism behind it maybe a lot of the mechanism in some cases then I think it enriches their understanding and gives them flexibility when things are perhaps not you know optimal sort of like someone learning a recipe uh versus understanding why you add a little bit of baking soda so that when there isn't any baking soda maybe there's an alternative or you make an adjustment someplace else right that's a what a real cook can do um as opposed to somebody just following a recipe I think that with magic this takes us back to the first question I think with magic um it's so exciting to me that the magician The Mentalist themselves might not get it right like if I know you're going to get it right it's exciting because for if I bring someone else along that's never seen it before but what I want to know is that you know the trapes artist could fall exactly I don't want them to fall but that the idea that they could fall is what makes it really excited absolutely and we fake it a lot there's a lot of times where I will intentionally create a scenario where it seems like it's not going right right you know I'm in trouble and I need to get out of it and you go he's okay he he's good good but this one no and then then you realize it was a part of the illusion and this is like even even the trouble was an illusion don't trust anything sorry I didn't mean to interrupt there you paused for me to remember and I inter want to digest it right this is like this is built into every script of every romantic comedy and every action movie like everything's you know there's a challenge then there's moving forward and then things are about to go well and then oh my goodness they're on the wrong trains it's going to be and then that's the tension build and then there's resolution of some sort and then sometimes there's a Twist at the end where the resolution isn't there and that's how you get a SQL right it's it's kind of the same yes thing I I wonder um and I hope that someday Neuroscience will understand the kind of what the core algorithms in the brain are for a story a story that involves a question and a hypothesis some characters and some trajectory a potential you know error and then some resolution and then maybe it opens up the possible possibility of mystery again because as you describe a magic trick or a mentalist act it seems to follow that sequence you introduce the people the cards the props Etc and then there's a story and here's what's interesting I see this in comedy also one of the things that's exciting is when we think we know what's going to happen next and it's it's either that we are very surprised there's a violation of the expectation but even more interesting sometimes is when we're like no no no no no this where we think that something's going to happen and you're actually taking us towards that unbelievable possibility this is something I find amazing that you know sometimes even when we expect something or especially when we expect something if it's an outrageous outcome there's no way that's when we are most excited CU we're involved we're part of the drama so I love what you said about the idea of a recipe right following verbatim in a passive way I don't know how it works but eventually I think this would lead me to a cake somehow as opposed to understand what what the chemistry is and why this happens and why this and that I think that um you become more invested and you are part of the act so it's it's almost like I I am obsessed you know also with painting something that I I I I just do often and I remember I can easily recall the experience I had be when I went to a museum and watched some art before I painted and the way I view it today as a painter as someone who's touched pigments mixed them put them on a on on a canvas or paper and all of a sudden I look at it a little differently and I think it changes the interaction that I have with the painting because I understand the language I understand the the struggle I understand the challenge understand all of that and it's the same with anything like when you read one of my favorite reads of all time and I to this date is ven Go's uh letters I remember you know I saw ven go before I saw it after and the story and that's that's why I think we can talk about AI for a second but the story of of the letters with the paintings make them complete different images when I see now the sunflowers or the chairs or the Landscapes and I have some context to go by uh they become a a part of a much bigger story and to me that enhances the um the experience so a few friend you know me and a couple of my friends uh went to a museum the met and there was a beautiful wooden sphere half opened like that and the detail was like you need a microscope to see and to appreciate the delicate carving of the wood and we all looked at it in awe it was like it's amazing and I said to them you know you look at it and you you see the year it's from the 1800s and you go wow the technology they had in 1800s to do that and the patience and the time all of it is part of the the artwork but if I told you I we fold you um this was 3D printed 20 minutes ago it took about five minutes and it's we can make a million of them right now it's the exact same object it looks as impressive but the story is different and I think that is Again part of the experience we have a recipe when you understand it the experience you have is different so I I I do I do believe that knowledge um really can enhance an experience change it completely so that's something I I'm being on uh stories seem to be the the kind of bento box that arranges information best in my opinion you know uh for those that don't know bento box right like a like a box a little different compartments and you have different things and you know the the brain can okay let's just a some some first principles ground truths um we can only perceive a certain number of things at any one time but we're sensing tons of information so the brain is a selective filter and a prediction machine and so and it does a bunch of other things to Keep Us Alive but that's basically it um all my Neuroscience colleagues are probably like wait wait wait but what about this okay but that's that's pretty much it Keep Us Alive predict things and perceive certain things that we can sense not others things outside our sensory apparatus like infrared vision and sensing you know certain forms of of heat and electromagnetic energy some yes some no depends on what animal you are so okay so stories and the sequencing of things seems to be one way in which we best learn information from the time we are very little we are read stories and um and our lives play out like stories so I think that the idea that um additional information about context this is from the 1800s not just the box that it's encapsulated in but it gives you a sense this is important it's old it tells you this was harder to do back then uh hard presumably and and as you said that it brings to mind all these ideas about what went into that like the pyramids they're very very interesting but especially interesting given when they were built exactly right and what that meant for certain people and and not for others so I think that so there's that which I think is so key because it extends way past magic is really about how the brain works and learns information and perceives the world in moments and what we remember what we don't remember and then there's another thing I'd like to touch into and maybe we touch into this first which is that you mentioned that you paint yes so I've come to learn that many people who are virtuosos in their craft as you are have hobbies or practices or things that they do that are sort of adjacent to craft C I think Joanie Mitchell the singer often talked about painting as a way to get into a mindset of singing even though that wasn't the specific intention it just kind of LED there a little bit like a like a sprinter might have I don't know some Dynamic stretching that they do that sort of like semi-related but not the main thing or maybe they would listen to music and kind of Bounce Around to the music maybe that's a better example so it's not directly in line with the practice but it puts the brain circuits that are required for that practice into a certain mode uh for you maybe it's painting for me it's drawing um how often do you paint what do you paint and do you paint with the intention of anyone ever seeing your paintings yes I I'm not sure I I post them uh in my show it was an opportunity for me to make a portrait of all of my heroes so it was a mini exhibition as people walked into the theater to see all those portraits of the people that affected me touch you know influenced me and so forth magicians to M I would say 90 most of them anner is was there too uh he's not a magician per se he's also a magician but yeah mainly magicians Houdini was melini uh Tommy wander Chan Canasta David Blaine uh people that really are part of who I am today MH so to me that's that's an aspect of its own why why do I paint these people is because it's an opportunity for me to meditate with these people that I adore and owe so much too um but why do I paint first of all it's intuitive I I didn't so it's was not a cerebral decision oh I I I think I need something to supplement my life you know and I I need painting uh I always love to work with my hands I always love to draw I love imagery I love design um and I I always gravitated towards wanting to paint and by the way most of the things I do they're not like I don't look at them through a scientific point of view it's I do them intuitively and then later I understand in a more scientific way why or I ask scien scientific questions why am I doing those things and I think for art is important start with intuition start with what makes sense to you or feels right and then start asking questions the whys and how's and what does it mean you know painting in itself there's lots of science you know if you if if you mix blue with yellow every time you're going to get green that's science but when you paint I think you need to forget about the science it needs to live in the back of your mind and you need to to to let your I don't know what your spirit your your your mojo take over and and paint with you so but I started to learn so much about magic from painting and I tell you why you need a bird eye every now and then you need to detach yourself from something that you do so so much of and you build all these biases right when I approach a trick or work on a trick I I come with a similar approach you know it's almost it becomes formulate and formula is poison for art when you when you approach something with a predetermined you know preconceived notion of of doing something you you might repeat yourself so much that it's boring and you're not allowing yourself to grow and to maybe find things that you never knew existed in you or outside of you so painting in a weird way when I when I read biographies of let's say Lucy and Freud which who I really love and he's talking about art at some point I I feel like I'm reading a magic book it's so applicable to Magic he's talking about intention he's talking about you know he I'm going to misquote him for sure he says every time I approach a canvas I approach it as if it's the first painting I've ever painted and this is to take it even further the painting the painting that was ever painted um because he wants to approach it with the attitude of a student with the naive with the virginity of of first time so you don't repeat the same stake oh I you do this skin oh I've done this before I can do this again you kind of want to divorce yourself from all these things you know and start the the search again from as close as possible to this first time because there's something beautiful about that there's a technique that painters use Andrew W did it a lot um he will paint the painting it would look at it it says something is wrong about it and I don't know what something is there's this something about this painting that just does not work then he will take the painting and look at it with a mirror so he looks at the reflection of the painting so he flips the image very much like the uh the way we think at night um and when he looks at the reflection he goes ah the nose is wrong he couldn't see it when he looked at it he couldn't see that the wrong was off or you know distorted but when he saw the reflection he could because he was able to cancel his biases he saw almost a cousin painting of the one he just made MH which is a beautiful thing but this analogy also I think acts for me with magic it's a it's a way for me to look at Magic from a mirror to look at it differently from a different angle cuz art I find that the Arts are very much connected there's so much similarities and when I I lectur to magicians about magic I quote art books more than I quote Magic books I I quote cantes from donot about magic you know someone wrote a book in the 1600s and he talks about the two imp what we like to call the two impossible Theory not the two perfect Theory the two impossible Theory and he he talks about that perfection in writing is is restraining exaggeration and and it's in it's a whole paragraph about that art needs to be believable there has to be truth in it to be enjoyed so and and it's so much true for magic I can't just even when we do something that's impossible I still want the ground to be plausible maybe maybe this could happen therefore I need to restrain exaggeration I need to restrain the impossibility and that that again this is uh a novel from the 1600s donkey my favorite book of all time teaching us about magic and Lucen FR is teaching me about magic and Andrew W and V go and all these people so I think that's why I love this diversity uh of you know I love photography very much I always have a c a camera with me film photography I love and composition the idea no one uses that word usually with adjacent to Magic they never talk about oh it's a composition but if you understand a composition and you apply it to Magic you have a whole new way of looking at how how to create a piece of magic just by using that word that term that painters and photographers use so that's to me just an amazing reason uh a good reason to to paint I love that you're touching into some of the core modular the the the ground truths of of Art and of magic and how they they overlap because what we're really talking about here are ways in which the brain works stories and this restraining exaggeration I'll just share two two things um I'll try and keep it brief um one is that again Rick Rubin um incredibly uh uh virtuoso in at the level of creativity and bringing out People's Best in in terms of Music other domains too um but mostly music um often says that you know that the art has to have some recognizable feature like this is this artist that people have perhaps heard before but then something new but you can't completely depart from what was done before there has to be some recognition um you also talked about wiping away of using a completely new canvas this example you gave um when Rick came to our studio here he looked around and he go I like this place he's very into physical spaces and uh the walls here are black there's some other stuff too he and he said uh you know well cuz both Rick and I came up through punk rock music he's like yeah I think a smaller place black wall I was like cool um his studio is mostly white and but then he said you know but I'd get rid of all the art and the plants and I said why and he said because it's distracting you know he doesn't have art or Awards on his walls it's all blank so that every new project is a completely new project there's no it's interesting previous stimula entering the picture it's a new project so you don't want pictures of awards that you won for that album or anything I go what do you do with all that stuff and he's like just get rid of it like me too by the way I I I I totally understand that very interesting So Clean Slate then the the other thing that just is is so striking to me is you know this idea that there has to be something that is a truth a a a mathematical or a physical truth present in art um one of the best ways that one can understand how the brain creates perceptions is that um the brain creates abstractions of what's out in the outside world light sound touch smell taste come in but that's all translated to electrical and chemical signals and then the brain reconstructs an image by the way the lens of the eye you'll find this interesting as a photographer inverts and reverses the image so that when it lands in the brain the neural retina first stage of visual processing you're actually I'm looking at you you're right side up but you're actually landing on my the the the perception in my brain is that you're upside down and flipped I am and then now you got me you had me for a second um I am too um uh so and then the brain reconstructs an upright image it's really wild so the brain is constantly abstract making abstractions about what's out there so if I were to say um take a photograph of you and show you a picture of your face you'd say yeah that's me but if I said aha but I'm an abstract artist and to me you look like and I basically do a bunch of squiggles and a thing and and I show you it doesn't look anything like your face you'd say yeah I don't see it however if I somehow have the artistic genius which I don't to create an image of you where the eyes are distorted their position or maybe the the shading something is different in a way that lets you see and other people see your face in a way that is similar enough to AI wind that we recognize you but different enough that it looks interesting we're effectively creating the kind of abstraction that the brain creates like some level of interest in an emotion or in a um something right a reflection in your eye could be who knows right and so the brain is an abstraction machine it doesn't actually know what's out there it's taking best guesses and so I think when when we see great art it's able to capture enough of the real physical truth of that thing but to touch into some of the ways in which the brain abstracts I'll give one more example rothos which are simply to some people who don't like them I love rothos are simply color on canvas but Rothco whether or not he intended it or not did something absolutely spectacular with his art which was he eliminated the white space and the canvas and in doing so was able to allow things to come forward in color space as we call in visual Neuroscience certain colors are not visible unless they are adjacent to other colors and when you eliminate all the white space the canvas and you take away the frame then colors that you haven't seen before and color transitions that you can't see Pop and that's the Brilliance of a Rothco it's not that it's two colors in a square and a rectangle and you know this is why they're worth millions and millions of dollars they're they're so spectacular because they capture a physical truth about color space that's inaccessible in a framed painting or a painting that includes some visibility of the canvas so rotho shows us color space the math of how the brain produces color contrast and Hue and wavelength intensity and color is also intimately tied to value in the brain in a very interesting way and we're not looking at it thinking all that but we feel something that's like if we appreciate Roth goes like hm that's interesting that captivates me does that make sense yeah yeah no I have a question to you do we do we know that Roth did it through that lens of understanding science you just described or did he just intuitively felt this is a great composition these are a great color scheme and I will do that like what do we know it's most most likely the latter yeah um I have a colleague Beville Conway who's at the National Institutes of Health who's far more versed in this stuff than I am so he might correct me I'd love to get him on the podcast sometime um but uh Co it's very likely that Rothco felt something upon seeing colors in a in a restricted kind of tunnel of vision and then realize that if this could be brought to scale because rothos tend to be pretty large then and um something special was happening sort of like Chuck Close took tiny little images of faces and now he had a visual issue with faces prop agosia Etc so people can look that up failure to recognize faces as faces um they just look like objects and realize that he could create you know composits of these things as a big face and it's very different experience to look at a a face that's made up of tiny fragments of many many faces now now here's where it gets interesting because there are many many artists that sit out in front of museums like the met and sell paintings that are very inexpensive that are very accurate Renditions of things picture of Taylor Swift picture of Bob Marley not interesting it's cool they can do it or the the real you know the kind of um uh uh you know curbside trickery take a painting paint in front of people what's what's he or she doing and then flip it over it's the person it's cool in the moment CU you're like wow they can paint upside down but actually it's not interesting at all because what they've created is BAS basically a decent photograph image just upside down so they might as well hang upside down while they do it it's not interesting it's not great art so what I think what we're converging on is that great art takes us through a trajectory that involves the I believe now after this discussion that takes us through the Arc of excellent storytelling it involves a surprise recognition of truth a return to mystery all these components that you describe for magic are present in art and presumably are present in a great song as or play as well yeah you know I I I I love everything you said and I I often contemplate about why I respond to a certain painting but the painting outside the mat of the guy I don't and I never I was never able to come up with a sufficient answer but this is as close as I got and and I often ask why do I like this but not this why do I like that and I don't like this I think that I making a judgment about the motives of the painter and do I believe him is it honest is it a true honest expression that extends out of him on a canvas and a lot of times and that's the closest I got I go they see these patterns and dripping paint and the splatter and this and that and it's super like like a lots of people wow this is cool and I'm the snob goes I think it's and and the reason is when I see it I think I think I see the motive he says I'm going to do something cool I'm going to do something that is eye candy and I'm going to use every trick in the book to make it happen as opposed to somebody like Lucien who pains with his guts I believe every brush stroke I believe it's an honest painting that comes from here and there's no motive to try to wow you or to to tell you look I'm I'm the best I'm I'm so great so that's as close as I got to understanding why I respond to a Lucin Freud but not to that street artist who does this you know Sparkles with his with tooth I don't know toothpaste I don't know I I I you know took everything I had all the top down inhibition to not go yes yes I think that the critical distinction is that the street artist is doing it for the audience for people and for the sale they're doing it to make a living audience pleaser right whereas the the the other artists the sort of let's call them the greats are doing it for themselves it's something in them that needs to get out and it's honest right and I have so many examp examp that just leap to mine I'll use one from a completely different domain um I grew up skateboarding I was not good enough to make it a career but I have great appreciation for there was a guy in the 90s he's still around sadly he suffered an injury had him paralyzed for a while but now he's walking cycling and skateboarding again his name is John Cardel John cardiel is is just a a legend in the landscape of skateboarding I I knew him back when still know him a bit and the way he would do things was just so spectacular he just like it just the energy in it it wasn't because it was so big and so far and all of that yes but there was something in the energy of it and I'll never forget there's there's a documentary about him I'll put a link to it um in the show note captions where someone's describing a conversation they had with him where he does something spectacular and then he he shows up he sort of goes up to his friend and his friend said yeah at that moment John turned to him and he goes that one was for me and I just I I think of that now like like joh like cards as they call him just it always looked like everyone was Delight just thrilled by what he does right he's a true virtuoso but it's the sense that like he's not doing it for your entertainment he's doing it for him it's the expression of something inside Rick talks about great art as your own offering to God this is not about your audience this is you and your thing whatever is inside you and it's your offering to God and I think it's such a key thing it's the it's the exact opposite of someone doing something to please the audience and of course one Delights in in audiences being pleased but it that can't be how you approach your magic it must be because it just feels so good the truth is uh the show I create Inner Circle uh it was created because I wanted to do that show I mean if you if you tell me somebody's going to come and watch an hour and a half somebody doing a bunch of carart Tricks it sounds boring um but I think every art form is an excuse to tell something bigger you know V go recorded his Sensations when he looked at the sunflowers and and recorded his emotions on a canvas every brush stroke the the speed in which he placed every brush stroke and the colors he chose to put every decision he made was a recording of his Sensations his state of being at that moment when he painted it so who cares about sunflowers we've seen a lot of bouquet of flowers and roses and this and that matis is this famous uh quote he says that the hardest thing to paint is a rose because one has to First forget about all the Roses he painted before were painted before and that's it's so true because to me uh a steel life is something that students do in in in art schools here's a bouquet of flower painted so why are we looking at Veno and saying wow the sunflowers what a beautiful piece of it's because the sunflowers are just an excuse for him to record something of him he recorded him himself on the canvas and that's what we're seeing we're seeing the personality the excitement the obsessiveness that he had and I think that's that's one of us to me I mean I always start with I want to do this show cuz I think it's beautiful cuz I think has something to say I hope people like it I love people too and to me the people are also part of the brush Strokes I make a lot of room in my show for people to flourish to become a part of the show that's part of the expression that I'm trying to create it's not just about me it's about them too but that's an artistic choice in itself where do you draw I don't want to say inspiration but um the components for a show so I can think of um you can look historically and see what people have done learned from Masters um teachers um from your own experiences like if you let's say you were to travel to I don't know Australia or South America could would you bring back components of your travels to uh the show you create um I don't know um or you know what's your process for for figuring out or sensing into what you want to do and I feel like discussions like this are very important for people to hear because not everyone wants to be a magician or Mentalist or scientist or podcaster but what we're getting down to here are the core components of of creative expression so where do you um where do you draw on the what what do you bring is it your daily experience does it come to you in the form of a bodily sensation is it in your dreams is it in your discussions do you try and resurrect cool things from the past where does it where do you draw from it's all of it it's really all of it I'm a sponge of of everything around me I I interact with art with books with information with friends conversations every everything is uh a source of inspiration everything is and it goes through my filter like I I'm always amazed at the fact that you know 20 students can paint the exact same thing the exact same say please this is a flower paint it and you'll have 20 completely different paintings is because everybody I think filters um this information through their sensory whatever it is and I think that's what we at least that's what I think I'm doing I'm constantly consuming not just art everything a flower this a conversation with a friend uh and social media maybe you know what yes yes I think everything affects me me sitting with you right now will affect me will change me will become a part of the the uh Mosaic of of of experiences I have and it will affect me like this conversation right now is changing Me Maybe I'm poetic about it but I I really think that way I I think that you know if I had any success I owe it to all of the people that surround me all of my friends you know uh terrific painter Laura Alexander who's unbelievable her contribution to me is IM immense I mean and it maybe you can draw direct lines maybe you can't but I feel like every person I've that was part of my life is the the reason the outcome that I produce is because of those of those people so I I don't know if I I don't look for I don't search for inspiration I think I what I do at least I I really want to let things sink in and I want to consume I'm curious I always want to know more to listen to more to see more like for example if if I go to a museum and I see a painting I I I like to dwell on why do I like it why am I responding to this why is this triggering me what is this revealing about me and I don't think there's one way that that I say oh this is this is the process this happens I do this then a trick is born sometimes sometimes it's the Tommy wander story right I see someone who is doing a trick and the explanation to the trick is way prettier and I go wow it's amazing that the things behind a curtain are more interesting than things in front of the curtain that to me it planted the seed and 5 years later there was a piece so I yeah I think inspiration is become a sponge let it you know you need to consume this I learned from my friend Jimmie and swiss he says to do good art you have to consume art create art get critiqued just do those three things consume art uh create art and get critiqued um also when you consume art it reveals something about you so at first when I start painting I loved everything surrealism pointalism give me Hyper realism and slowly it narrow down because through observing art I start to learn about what triggers me it the art revealed taught me what am I responding to what pushes those buttons right and I think that's a valuable important uh step in becoming an artist consume art and let it teach you something about you then create art and then critique it by yourself and maybe people you trust I think again you do those three things you you're pretty good I'm starting to understand that in your magic and Mentalist work you're a Storyteller and to some extent to some extent and and the characters uh can involve cards or numbers or information and you cast people in the audience often into those stories and depending on what they give you you might assign them a different role of course and you do know what the conclusion of the story could be and maybe ought to sometimes there's some element of surprise even for you but that you're working with a certain pallet of paints and they're predictable enough that you can get where you want to go but as you said before that the improvisation of it is is part of the Delight for you absolutely and because people are resonating with your emotions there's this empathic Attunement excuse me empathic Attunement uh that you create that people also feel like they're part of the experience it's it's not it's so very different to watch something that you do on YouTube versus to be in a small setting versus a larger setting um and all of these are spectacular and we'll provide links to these and if you get the opportunity to see AI uh live you absolutely should do it it's it's like um it will clearly fall into the the the far extreme of experiences amazing experiences that you'll have I I I guarantee it um I I think in discussing like what art is and and people thinking about um learning I think often we wonder like if you're a sponge are are you you're taking in everything but are you do you constrain your days in a way that you know like you're not you're hanging out with the Met you're not looking at the stuff on the sidewalk outside the Met as much you so you have a taste you have a sense of taste what you like corre um and you're drawing from different things I Delight in animals of all kinds and so much of what I do and so much of what I think about in terms of how the human animal works is based on some overlap with the kind of core modules that exist in other animals and I won't take us down that path but um I just Delight in animals why that's why I follow so many raccoon accounts on Instagram um so I'm trying to figure out like when you well walk us through a day uh you are Night Owl we talked about this before so so what time do you go to sleep at night you mean morning typically 4:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. is when you go to sleep and it's not just because you're a per a Performing Artist on stage it you've always been this way yeah okay and a lot of magicians are and my mom is the same way my brother maybe he's a little changed now but he he's also if he follows his nature he will fall asleep around 4: and I I wake up around noon 2:00 p.m. do you wear an eye mask or have curtains right yes yes I a little bit of light and I'm screwed okay so then you wake up uh what do you do I was about to call it your morning routine but your afternoon your hour afternoon your morning right your morning what is your typical thing do do you pay attention to your dreams do you recall your dreams is there information there we walk I I don't know I I I do know that a lot of my resolution I resolve a lot of you know tricks or magic in general it's problem solving and a lot of times I have a a problem and I can't solve it and as you said it happens a lot I sleep I I see everything reversed and then I I come up with a solution in the morning it's a clear as day to me that's what needs to be done you write it down or you just I immediately I put to practice I I literally just I'll grab it's if it's a deck of cards I would say okay I need to do this and I I will burn it into a a muscle memory but definitely nighttime is where most of the thinking happens I sleep well I I think I sleep pretty well I try I mean I try to start very relaxed I want the first few hours of my day to be pretty relaxed it's usually a ritual I have a coffee machine where you need to grind the coffee you need to do everything and I I love the ritual of making the first cup of coffee it's the first thing I do um I try to avoid answering you know emails or things that are Urgent or that I don't want to to start my day with this energy you are you on social media early in the day no no no I I I consume social media to a degree and I think it has a place I mean there's some beautiful things I found on social media that that you know shows I want to see friends that do beautiful work and they post it and it's wonderful paintings uh there's lots of things social media is not a black and white thing for me that oh it's just bad I think it's a platform and you can curate it in such way that is beneficial interesting and and could give you valuable information it's the obsessiveness it's the the the intensity that that's a little and the the fact that there are no filters or there's an algorithm deciding for you what you should see that's a little scary but no I I don't I I start the day with those things um and slowly I go for a walk or I I love walking I thinking I think better when I walk what's the what's the logic behind that yeah well I'm delighting this first of all the way you describe your morning routine is very similar to Rick rubin's morning routine he wants to capture some of the elements from sleep ease into the day gradually walk get sunlight um uh and allow whatever processing occurred in sleep and in the Lial states around the morning and the clarity that comes with the early day to crystallize into ideas and not deal with email and kind of um you know kind of operational things it it's just a set of mind if I start now taking care of emails and this and I need to send that in the package you know then that dictates the day for me well it's tactical what's interesting is it's tactical it's not creative in fact it's by definition it's not creative because it's being defined by what other people put on there there's an investor I forget his name great investor um hedge fund guy young kid I I'll I can't remember so forgive me um but this quote is not M he said that email is basically a public post to-do list so people are telling you where to drive your attention and behavior so your process is very similar to Rick's um I like to write and I have most of my clarity in the morning as well although um sometimes too many tactical things enter my my framework I'm working on that but um I think that what you describe is the life of of an artist and a creative capturing the unique um components of what was put together in your brain based on your unique experiences and it's from you and for you and ultimately people benefit because they they delight and are astonished by the by the end uh by the end result so what you describe it sounds to me like the an amazing kind of perfect day for a creative I think um it's so important for people to hear what you describe is also runs countercurrent to what most people do during their days which is to immediately allow the context and the tactics of their actions and thinking to be driven by some external Force that is not from them yeah it's from someone else's mind and and so and it's and it's incredibly there's a strong gravitational pull like what's in the news what are people saying where what's in my text what do people want from me what do people think of me Etc that but that is um that is absolutely uh poisonous for Creative work it's pollution it it really it it puts you in a panic mode uh and by the way we have so much stuff to do that would never catch up with anything so let's make peace with that you'll never catch up with what you need to do because it's it's just it's it's exhausting so I understand that you know the first few hours I can devote to me to to feeling good relaxed and slowly I I will introduce okay I want to what do I what do I want to do right now what's the first thing I want to tackle right sometimes I have an urgency you know like I was practicing the Rubik's Cube so I had a Rubik's cube right next on my side and the first thing I W the first thing I wanted to do by choice is to do and start solving a gik cube because I had to get good at it for a routine of mine so I tried I would like to start today with my as you said my own decisions things I want to do first this will make me happy then I'm going to or I have a deck of cards next to you know right next to me and there's a move I'm trying to get right and the first thing I want to do is try it in the morning um that's another reason I love card so much it's tectile even though in my new show which we can talk about I I decided there will be no more cards it's just you know it's a tribute to the human mind it's called incredibly human um and it's about the things that are possible and yet they're on the verge of impossible so uh a former rendition of it was uh when I memorized the entire audience I know everybody by name and it's just a skill I memorized 120 people every night so do you use a pneumonic approach where you you know like Andrew sounds like or reminds you of some other things so are you doing a pair pair Association sure so I tell you a story about it there's a there was he just died at 907 something like that old man but he he was sharp to to his last day Harry Lorraine was a memory guy he performed as a magician but also uh taught people how to remember things wrote a lot of books um so I and he was known for that he was on the Carson Show he memorized the entire audience and it was really cool it was a thing signature piece of his and I wanted to do it in my show so we called him and said can we get permission to use that piece and he says sure so can we meet with you and you teach me you know those little details the minutia and and I I came with a notebook and a pen I'm ready to take notes how do you remember 120 people every night 120 people's names so I'm say okay so what's the work on it and he goes you just remember them you're saying first and last names or first names first and last first and last names you can do first he did first and last yeah goodness gracious so he says just remember them yeah but tell me the techniques and I thought it was a joke I wrote nothing that day nothing and I was so scared of it and and I I tried to remember people and I couldn't and it was so daunting and I realized that in order to remember a lot of people's names the first thing you need to conquer is fear it's feir I was afraid I that I won't be able to do it and and one night I did a small venue with like 30 people showed up I said okay that's manageable I can memorize 30 people so I did it and you you don't know that you know their names until you do it because all I do is I say shake their hands oh thank you so much please take your seat I was the Asher sit down thank you now the show starts and this is a test for me do I remember their names I don't know and I go Susan B blah blah blah BL and I and I was able to do all their names do you still remember any of their names I tell you a story about that to remind me though I will I'll come back to that um so it felt like I had superpowers it was amazing to me I think as it was maybe to them and then some some then I started doing it in that venue with about 60 people so I remember I I have everybody sit down and there's a point in the show where I take two coins large coins and I glue them with tape on my head so I I'm blindfolded and I sold two Rubik's Cubes at the same time blindfold it and I forgot talking about memory I forgot to have somebody uh you just have a stopwatch just to to time me how long it takes me to do it I just forgot and I go guys I'm so sorry I forgot is does anybody here has a watch or or an app that he can measure take time and one guy goes yeah I can do it and I recognize his voice and I and I did not know I could do it I go Robert and he goes yes so I did not just remember how they look I remember how they sound and you didn't know that you remembered how they sound it was just part of your it was a surprise to meh and then to make and it's crazy you s you're sitting next to Susan right and Stephanie and I describe how they look like almost to a tea and it amazes me how much we do remember and that's crazy because the voice like your voice my voice people's voice are very distinct we and I now I know it that I can hear somebody peripheral you know and I I know um so that's that's about memory how do we we get how do we get to this memory so um to to your question you ask me if if if use the pneumonics or stuff the truth is we need to care if you care about someone's name like let's assume you see somebody in a coffee shop and do the one thing you really wanted is to talk to this person because I don't know you're attracted to them I don't know and you say hi nice to meet you I'm aie what's your name the moment they say they're name you will never forget it because you care you want a lot of times we say hey what's your name we don't mean it we don't care about the answer and that's a big part of why we don't remember it but if I say you you know you need to meet this guy this guy you should know him uh you will make an effort so the one thing I did the most was repeat their their name what's her name Andrew oh Andrew nice to meet you I repeat it a few times as I talk to them or we have a little conversation and I also realize that the more you interact with them the more you remember it so in the show I always I faked it I struggled on the last two people I said I I don't know your name remain standing I'll get back to you and it was geniv I remember the story geniv say you know I don't know her name yet so I said I don't remember your name but you told me you just came from Africa you were on vacation for two weeks and I start recalling so much information about her and it Genevie I'll never forget your name and she sits down and it's amazing but the more they tell you about themselves the more you retain and the more you remember because as you said it's a story and now there geniv is just not it's not just a random person with a name geniv it's somebody who's been to that place and this place and she's you know you can connect it to a story or to something you can visualize right every now and then you know stove is Stave and you know I would make those pneumonics uh um or try to find a feature almost like the way a caricaturist does you know exaggerate a feature and attach it to the name somehow like antthony maybe has lots of ants all over him you know stuff like that but the truth is I only did it with those I struggled it was a backup plan I but most of the people I hear the name I cared I wanted and I had confidence that I could do it and I did it the brain definitely remembers information that has an emotional sance to it it so caring about something some set of information name or otherwise definitely will um help encode to memory the other is to put things into motifs of song it is no coincidence that children learn songs to learn the alphabet A B C D the inflections the motifs within that song of the alphabet is what allows us to remember that our entire lives as opposed to a b CDE e f g think about the number Pi out past 3 14 out to some number of of um you know you know some people can remember it out very far if you set it to a song with some repeating motifs like the alphabet song or Happy Birthday song you can that's how people remember very very far because the brain creates these modules it doesn't um take bits of information and just throw it in there it it creates libraries of information where just as in the library certain books are grouped with other books and more disparate tops ICS are positioned further away in the library uh from one another um for those of you that are younger than than me you can look up what a library is just kidding um but this is how the brain works right and so it's amazing that you did that and and it also just um really highlights um that when we do this we are remembering far more than we think we remember um some people are more visual some people more auditory but it's all coming in there provided that people have access to those senses um it's just spectacular I have to return to something because I took us away from it which was you said is there something about walking that allows for Creative um thought um I'm of the mind now based on my observation of extremely creative individuals and um talking to them as well as some understanding of the Neuroscience of creativity which by the way there isn't a lot but it's sort of happening more and more um that there are sort of two polarized States um one is being very very still with the Mind active this is true of rapid eye movement sleep we're paralyzed the mind is very very active it's a state in which memories are encoded especially me uh emotional memories um many people his name seems to keep coming up but Rick Rubin Carl daero Einstein and others reported having practices where they would deliberately sit or lie down and to be very still and deliberately make their mind very active even thinking in complete sentences as a way to come up with ideas a deliberate practice the other is to be in movement but to not really try and force your thinking down a particular trajectory some people seem to favor one or the other I come up with a lot of my ideas while jogging or running or walking as as you do so there's something about either stealing the body or making the body just active enough that the mind is allowed to take off down novel trajectories um and that's very difficult I think for a lot of people just sit down with pen and paper and write things out so anyway um your practice of walking in the morning is one that perhaps people should uh want to explore I think that um when people hear about having a super memory for names or um being able to read people so much of what you describe as like being able to read People based on their physicality um all these questions come to mind and so I can't help myself do you believe in um these kind of Notions like if people are sitting arms crossed that they're more closed and difficult to get to whereas people who are kind of more forward leaning in their they're more willing to engage I mean does that stuff really hold in your laboratory of experiments of magic and mental mentalism so body language is something that I read much about I I believe there I'm not an expert uh when it comes to body language but I do I do think that I don't even control it it's just somebody can signal a closeness to them or an openness to them all right but I also found it to be very misleading a lot of times like people people do certain things because they're cold or this or they're shy and and being shy could be misunderstood as or perceived as snobbish and vice versa right so there's that could be really misleading what I rely on is interaction when I interact with people or if and and I I'm saying it in the the the slightest possible way when I challenge them with something very simple and I see how they deal with it that reveals a lot about them immediately cuz look we need to make decisions on the spot like even if I just can you please open your hand and I give him something how how eager they are to do it how they do it can they follow directions um I want also people that will you know that are able to do the things I want them to do for a specific routine and by the way certain some routines I would use this type of person this one needs a teenager this one I want an somebody a little older every every routine I I I kind of assign a different character and it's again it's trial and error I tried with a certain person for a long time and I I now I get it it's my relationship and by the way as I'm aging that also changes like but there's a piece where I used to do and I always preferred an older woman to and you could see there's some a motherly quality to it because that's kind of like the the role she was in but now as I'm aging it's this not it's not going to work as as well um I think there's you're creating relationships like for example I'm a guy and I if I work with another guy that's some sort of an energy if it's a female it's different if it's a young old my relationship with these people changes and how they feel do they feel comfortable with me certain certain things I can do with a a certain individual but not with another so that's something I constantly think about I choose my Spectators very very carefully you mentioned that you taken things from your environment and from many diverse sources um art and interactions with people Etc um you seem like a very positive person I generally upbeat and enjoy your work I get that impression um very much so but I'm assuming that you also experience anger frustration um Etc do you separate that from your creative work um do you try and buffer yourself against that and the reason I ask is that many of the creatives that I know are artists of which you are um they they're very feeling people it's it's required for the craft you need to be a permeable to some extent but of course you want to be semi-permeable you don't want every emotion or thing that you encounter to yank you all over the place but um magic is this thing of delight and it's this thing of of love and um and that all sounds wonderful but how do you deal with things that you know that upset you and frustrate you do you do you actively try and push those out from the creative process or do you kind of incorporate them into the creative process want the truth or what what do you need I only want the truth the truth the truth is I am I'm I consider myself a perfectionist and I demand so much of myself and also the people working with me I could dwell on the smallest detail I look at the poster and I say the font is wrong that would bother me the spacing the curing between the letters i i it's hard for me to let go of the the smallest smallest smallest details I drive myself nuts and I have no doubt that I sometimes hopefully sometimes drop my crew nuts believe me I can relate I I you know uh Grant aets uh chef from Mia a dear friend and one of the greatest Minds one of the smartest people I've ever met he's a chef he makes food but you know he cares about the plate that the food is going to live in so he has a guy designed the plate for the food that's going to be on top of it what's the smell in the restaurant what's the temperature what's the carpet like what's the color everything counts there's nothing like for example I know fine restaurants do this a lot but it's a nice detail in his restaurant when you go to alenia they know with you it's going to be easy because you're very recognizable but they immediately know your name no matter who it is the entire crew every person in the restaurant knows what you look like and what's your name and they will address you by your name that's amazing to me allegedly it's got nothing to do with food and yet it does because everything counts and that's the life I live everything counts every detail is important nothing is too small I drive everybody nuts that's the truth and and I'm included yeah no it's it's really important for people to hear because well I know for myself when I see things that that irritate me um because of the way they're composed or something um I've had to learn over the years to I always say I don't run other people's businesses you know I'm focused on my stuff I don't get involved in other people's art but when you when I see things that I love and that look right yeah it's so satisfying but to be in the world as as you are or as I am perhaps it can be frustrating so we need selective filters right so I I guess provided that it's it's aimed at our craft and that people aim at their craft and what they're creating um then it's great but um It's Tricky if one is trying to engage with the World At Large to not let this stuff kind of bombard the senses it can be uh you know like for somebody that loves great food it must be frustrating to walk down the street in Manhattan the smells are range from delightful to horrible um so uh we're A peculiar species us humans but it's the species that have these unique tunings and these preferences and they lean into those preferences and how they create that that produce the The Marvelous work that is your magic and and V goes um that's a you put me in a good category here we need we need you yeah we we need uh well you are and and and we need people like you so for you if you're drawing from many things um and there's anger about something you see in the world frustration are you able to transmute that into your craft or is it a process of okay I got to dump that move that out so that I can focus on beauty focus on uh positive inspiration or can anger and frustration play a role I think there is beauty even in the angly I mean I look I you you're right I live I live in New York um it's my favorite city in the world and it's it's a LoveHate relationship it's ugly and beautiful at the same time it's rich and poor it's it's sophistic itting simple it's it's it's a city of opposites um you know I I these are things I always think about like you go and you see um like this area that's really run down and the signs are kind of like fading and this and you can think wow people not taking care of it they're not cleaning this it's ugly but you you know what when I have my camera on me that's what I want to take a photo of of it has character and it tells an amazing story so to me the ugly the old the wrinkled the The Not So Beautiful is very interesting and beautiful so I and again it's not that I'm think about it and then I make the choice I first respond and then maybe I'll think about it I I usually have a camera on me all time and I the rule is very simple I don't take a photo until something tickles me says take a photo here and I take a photo some are some are good some are bad I don't care but something in that moment made me want to do this and take a photo and a lot of times it's not the obvious pretty clean stuff it's sometimes the the ugly the violent you know some of the most beautiful um photos ever taken are taken at War by ban right uh it's us it's us and and and we're interesting even when we're ugly and and when we're we're angry we're still interesting so I to me that's yeah I don't know if I make a distinction that's very helpful by the way it were you always um sensory and emotionally tuned to the world around you since you were little do you feel like you could feel feel your way through the world this I like this I don't like like kind of um sensing things at a at a it seems to me that you are able to detect things people experiences with a lot of texture you know like that um it's hard for me to think outside myself that's why I think I don't know any other way I'm not I'm not a therapist but I'm just reflecting on um uh creatives that I know and and you seem to fall into this category of like things affect you or have the potential to affect you and so your nervous system is tuned to observe and to absorb fortunately you have a selective filter there that can't be bombarded by by life um or stuck there but do you recall being a kid and like like do you have like Visual and emotional memories of things that are strong I think I'm I'm very sensitive I think I I I get it's I'm ticklish you know it's I I think with my heart as much as I think with my brain I really think so I am you know I want to think I have thick skin I don't I I I get hurt easily uh I have empathy it happens to me often that I I I remember walking in New York I I cry easily and I was and I saw just a person crying but I could feel their pain I don't know this person I start crying and I think [Music] um you know I I I a big part of why I love being a magician is because I'm a part of a family that I would not replace with any other family like my best friends John Graham shimshi Blaine Doug McKenzie these are very important people in my life and and uh I'm moved by the fact that you know I wanted I wanted to do a couple of cart tricks I wanted to do magic but I got something really way way I I it's a family I've joined a family Juan who I talk and caught a million times I feel like you know what a privilege you know this Master gave me so many gifts taught me so many things for no other reason than wanting to share something with me I'm in awe of that and it reminds me that I now need to do it with other people so when we did Inner Circle we we grew a family there's a bunch of kids you know uh uh Jacob Denny Luke uh you remember Nam yes I do Charlie uh struth uh Ari there's a b you know and we became uh a family I remember that um I got an award from the Magic Castle which is a flattering thing and you spoke about Awards I'm I appreciate Awards but I I have I think Awards could be very deceiving so I immed when I got when I got my award I got Magician of the year which is very flattering um I looked at for exactly 10 minutes I closed it and I gave it to somebody I did not want to own it but here's the real the story that I'm trying to tell you here is that so I had to fly from New York to Los Angeles to receive the award and one of the kids said uh can I join you sure but you have to buy your own ticket and you know Airbnb whatever um and then another one and another one all of them came with me all of them to see me get an award and I remember the award became secondary to the fact that they came to see me get an award so we went to get coffee and I took him to the Magic Castle for the first time I made him perform we went downstairs to the basement I said you're performing now and it you could it was a highlight for them and I that was my word it's so interesting because once again it's it's the story of the experience as opposed to the end product of the experience that is uh what captures us and what and it's clearly how we embed memory and how we come up with concepts of self and our life Arc it's really beautiful and um in your case it's about magic and Mentalist work but it it clearly um exports to uh all domains of life I I'm certain people are are getting it to put it that way speaking of the Arc of life tell us what's coming next what's the what's the next uh act uh what's the next um I don't want to call it a trick because it diminishes from your craft your art um what what what excites you most these days about what's coming next in your professional life so I'm I'm I'm now just about to to debut my next show which is incredibly human um I'm super excited about this show because you know in a strange way that show is this conversation we just had it's about the human mind it's about what we can do it's about pushing limits it's about kind of proving to ourselves of how magnificent we are um so that it's a it's a very you know it's very different than my first Inner Circle because this one is in theaters it's in you know thousands some seats you know theaters and um it's what I wanted to show to be visual ual I want to have a painterly quality to it so there's lots of things that are just going to paint the stage with lots of things I can't I don't want to spoil anything but it is a tribute to the human mind I'm excited about doing it we have so far announced uh six dates and there's two more big things coming up that I cannot talk about um that are very exciting but they're Brewing slowly but for me right now this show that I'm about to do is the most exciting thing figuring out how to make the best version of that show fantastic well aie I um I want to say on behalf of myself and everyone listening and watching um you are a truly unique and spectacular individual thank you um both for the work that you do and the way you approach it but also for what you teach us about ourselves about the human mind and brain about what makes us tick indeed what's possible in us I it's just ringing over and over again in my head that what you do is less about showing what's possible in the world a card can do this or the it's it's about what's possible inside of us both alone and in groups and as it relates to perception and Imagination it's really truly spectacular and I say that having again seen you do your acts live and seen some online and um I'll certainly come out to uh the upcoming show and the mystery shows that I'm not allowed to know about I also would be remiss if I didn't say that you know this empathy that you have and the fact that you as you described it you you think with your heart um uh I don't know much about your life aside from what you've told us here today but um I imagine that can be a a challenging experience at times to live life that way that sensitivity but I just want to say thank you we're we are all gifted this magic true magic that you do because of the way that you think with your heart and your empathy and your openness and willingness to share while you did not reveal how every trick is done sorry um you made it very clear that to do so would be to erase some of what's possible in us and um and so I also Place great value on the fact that you've kept some of the mystery or let's say much of the mystery of magic and Mentalist work a secret to us so that we can have it revealed to us in real time through your shows and other venues for magic and Mentalist work so on behalf of myself and everyone listening I just want to extend an enormous debt of gratitude for what you do and for being you thank you so much

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine recently The Hub Lab podcast hosted a live event at the plenary theater in Melbourne Australia the event was called the brain body contract and featured a lecture followed by a question and answer session with the audience we wanted to make the question and answer session available to everyone regardless if you could attend so what follows is the question and answer session from the plenary theater in Melbourne Australia I also would like to thank the sponsors for the event they are eight sleep and ag1 eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity now one of the key aspects to getting a great night's sleep is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3° and in order to wake up in the morning feeling refreshed your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3° eight sleep makes it extremely easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment at the beginning middle and throughout the night and when you wake up in the morning I've been sleeping on an eight Sleep mattress cover for nearly 3 years now and it has dramatically improved my sleep if you'd like to try eightsleep you can go to 8sleep.com huberman to save $150 off their pod 3 cover eights sleep currently ships to the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com / huberman the other live event sponsor ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens and other critical micronutrients I've been taking ag1 daily since 2012 so I'm delighted that they decided to sponsor the live event the reason I started taking it and the reason I still take it every day once or twice a day is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas for vitamins and minerals and it ensures that I get enough Prebiotic and probiotic to support gut health now of course I strive to consume healthy whole foods for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day but there are a number of things in ag1 including specific micronutrients that are hard to get from Whole Foods or at least in sufficient quantities so ag1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals that I need probiotics prebiotics the adaptogens and critical micronutrients to try ag1 go to drink a1.com huberman and you'll get a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 and five free travel packs of ag1 again that's drink a1.com huberman and now for the question and answer session from Melbourne [Music] [Applause] [Music] Australia hey Dr hman uh some some of your listeners are in or approaching our 50s okay same um and are thinking of doing all we can to prevent dementia same do you have any additional thoughts or protocols or research we could focus on yes so um for the next two and a half hours no I'm kidding the uh I'm not known for being succinct I didn't go over too much earlier so okay so uh ground truths so let's start with ground truths and then let's move to um emerging let's maybe get to a little bit of speculation let's avoid conjecture um ground truths um blood circulation is good for the brain perhaps most important for the brain so anything that is good for cardiovascular health is going to be good for brain health it's not the only thing but that's true we know this so you hear these days a lot about Zone 2 cardio I don't know who gets credit for that petera talks a lot about it I talk a lot about it none of us invented the notion but you know 150 probably more like 180 to 200 minutes of so-called Zone 2 cardio per week is good numbers to shoot for some of us get more some of us less what is Zone 2 cardio Zone 2 cardio is um cardiovascular exercise could be running could be swimming could be walking depending on your level of Fitness which you can just barely maintain a conversation were you to push any harder or faster you wouldn't be able to complete your sentences with much ease okay so is this zone two cardio for me no but if I were to jog and try and have a conversation at some point I would have a little bit of a hard time that's Zone 2 cardio um so we know that's true why uh well it seems to do a number of things at the level of release of growth factors brain dve neutrophic Factor at the level of um different let's call them I realize the immunologists are going to like roll their eyes but um anti-inflam flammatory cyto kindes and things of that sort you also have inflammatory cyto kindes um and things of that sort um it does seem that increasing blood flow in and through the brain is important for brain health which is not all that surprising there are species of animals that spend part of their life swimming about and then when they stop um a good port and stick to a rock or something good portion of the nervous system actually degenerates but neurod degeneration and dementia are not necessar neily the same thing and this is something that we don't often hear about um the age related decline in memory capacity in particular working memory can be related to reductions in dopamine Transmission in the brain so things that increase the catacol amines that we talked about earlier um this could be pharmacology of course but it doesn't have to be pharmacology it could be um anything that increases the camines um and we talk about this on the podcast we have zeroc cost protocols that you don't have have to sign up for you can just go to our website and go to dopamine regulation and it will list out ways to increase the catac colomines through zero cost and very lowcost ways are known to improve working memory working memory of course the capacity to maintain a string of numbers or information for sake of kind of immediate goals but not information that's passed to the longer term memory so that's that's different than neurod degeneration that's simply reductions in the amount of neuromodulators like dopamine being deployed as we get older so modul modulating dopamine through healthy ideally uh means but I do think we are going to see an increase in the use of selective pharmacology for this purpose and here I'm not recommending anyone do drugs or take drugs prescription or otherwise but it does seem that um certain compounds like nicotine believe it or not um even though it increases vasil constriction and blood pressure um Can offs set some of the age related reductions in dopaminergic and coleric aceto Coline coleric transmission um and you know you don't want to smoke Vape dip or snuff I'm not even recommending people take Zin patches but I think um there is some use cases for uh nicotine provided you're doing it with the you know a your physician knows and you're not getting into blood pressure dangerous blood pressure range or supplementation with choline donors and things of that sort to increase acetylcholine and dopamine some people are starting to take things like modafanil and adol in older age um but keep in mind these are not modaal but adderal liant Etc these are amphetamines they're amphetamines so I'm not recommending this but I think that's where we're headed I think you're going to see a number of different cognitive enhancers that are used to offset some age related um uh cognitive decline AKA dementia now in terms of um so we're going Zone 2 cardio to like prescription drugs we're kind of bracketing here and then behavioral protocols that can increase neuromodulators such as the catac colomines now in terms of um other things that can perhaps decrease the likelihood of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia as it relates to neurod degeneration um currently there are a lot of do not don't hit your head too hard if you hit it really hard don't hit it again hard um the so-call two hit model literally um you know and and we think of football or I guess rugby that's a sport you guys play down here where they use the head as a battering ram um I've seen this right some big necks on those kids and then it boom and they yeah but the problem is not necessarily just rugby or American football um or a I was told that someone told me I had to shout out an Australian football team and I know it's a setup so I'm not going to do it they're like when you're in Melbourne tomorrow you got to say that your favorite team is blank and I'm like this feels really dangerous um so I'm not going to do it um I'm not going to do it but what's that do it I can't remember the name of the team sorry um but I watched the document what's that um but I still don't understand the rugby thing they do they use the guy's head as or G's head as a battering ram cuz I they used to play you see outside the my lab we had this big field and my Bulldog loved watching he was like this this sport makes sense but um they were just like run and then the I I never understood it but anyway what's that got it I need a translator sorry so I need a translator um but I love the enthusiasm um yeah so we think about um head injuries and brain injuries mostly in the context of sport but that's not where most the head injuries occur most of them occur construction workers car accidents TBI things of that sort um there's some interesting data on hyperbaric chambers this is getting really into the you know kind of high level stuff here meaning most people don't have access to them I I look forward to learning more these are playing with different concentrations of oxygen in a little micro environment for traumatic brain injury um and neurod deener ation I mean do I think in 5 years that everyone's going to be sitting in hyperbaric chambers order to offset neuron loss probably not I think it's not coste effective but um I will say that most of the things that are good for the body are good for the brain um keeping kind of anything that plaques the arteries capillaries and veins of the brain because it's so heavily vascularized um minimal and and minding those neuromodulators um obviously drugs of abuse like methamphetamine can deplete dopamine neurons the data on MDMA by the way I don't know there's drug enforcement in the room um the data you know where they have most of the safety data or lack of safety data in some cases on MDMA keep in mind MDMA ecstasy is methylene dioxy methampetamine methamphetamine we know causes neurod degeneration no question it also causes bad teeth do you know how do you know how turns people into mouth breathers dry mouth and the teeth degenerate yeah we have an episode on oral health coming out this this is real that's actually why the teeth degenerates from excessive um dry and it limits saliva production saliva is very important for remineralization of the teeth they shout out to the dentist in the house so the the the thing about MDMA is interesting because it turns out that MDMA because it also it increases dopamine just as methamphetamine does remember MDMA methylene dioxy methamphetamine but also huge increases in serotonin seem to be most most of the effect of MDMA the kind of empathogenic effect um there was a study done of um people from the LDS latterday Saints sometimes referred to as Mormons um why was a study on MDMA done with people from the LDS community and I don't want to imply that everyone from the LDS Community does MDMA but why they're very interesting um test population because they don't do other drugs but for some reason dma is not on the nfly list so there's is it's a beautiful paper um in which they took people who had only done as any drug not even taking caffeine right either once or semi frequent or very frequent use of MDMA and they did a bunch of cognitive testing and there were some attention issues when people had taken over what was a couple hundred doses of of MDMA at the 80 milligram dose or more but doesn't seem to be much neurod degeneration which is not to say that it's all safe there is an abuse and addictive potential there the biggest issue seems to be contamination of batches if we have a feny issue in the US I I I don't know if it's happening down here as well very concerning okay so the point here is that I think very soon you're going to hear about drugs prescription drugs and supplements to augment the release of neuromodulators not for sake of empathogenic states or psychedelic States but to try and keep those dopaminergic neurons online to offset dementia because that's what the question is about in fact there's a Nobel prize winning neuroscientist at Columbia University whose name I won't tell you or maybe I will who when I went to visit his office chewed no fewer than five pieces of Nicorette in the course of a half an hour and I'm like what's going on he got a Nobel Prize but this looks kind of pathologic and I said why and he said well the nicotine is to offset age related loss of dopaminergic and coleric neurons I thought really he's like yeah when I quit smoking because I want lung cancer but this is him this is anic data I'm not sugesting you do this I think there are a number of things that we can do but protect those neuromodulators keep perfusion that is blood flow to the brain strong there's a a case for cardiovascular exercise and it does seem it really does seem that exercise that engages the neuromuscular connections more than cardiovascular exercise so not just resistance training but anything that invol involves coordinated bodily training learning new physical skills Dance Etc really does seem to offset some of the loss of cognitive fun functioning in adults so it's kind of interesting that physical exercise is great for cognition and probably cognition may or may not help physical ability but one probably can imagine why there's a bidirectional relationship there your nervous system doesn't really distinguish between physical and cognitive it's all working as a bunch of functional units I could go on and on about this but um hopefully that um at least gets your um the gears turning around some things that perhaps you've heard about and some things that you haven't and we'll do an episode on dementia and offsetting dementia in order to get into some of the fine details okay can we increase our willpower just like training a muscle group with your research into the amcc O I'm so glad that you mentioned the amcc I think of all the new areas of Neuroscience research um that are out there I think the anterior mid singulate cortex is one of the most interesting um structures and and areas of research nowadays you know I think I if I have my way then not only will most people have heard of dopamine and the amydala I guess you need a Star Wars character named after your brain part um isn't there one right I only saw the first three I'm of that generation but isn't there a Amidala or something yeah right don't leave me hang in here is there or not if I'm wrong just say no okay anyway the amydala um thanks the um the amydala is a brain structure that is involved in threat detect ction and Novelty detection not just threats the anterior mid singulate cortex is an area of the brain that we know is activated well let me tell you the best experiment the best experiment was done in my opinion by a neurosurgeon at Stanford Joe pery uh he's probing around in people's brains they got a little piece of skull missing he's stimulating in the brain he's asking them questions how do you feel what's going on how do you feel what's going on and he's got this electrode in the anterior mid singulate cortex and the patient says I feel like something really bad's going to happen like a storm's coming it's like okay well we can stop stimulating he's like no I'm going into the storm like oh that's interesting stimulate a little bit further back just by a millimeter or so completely different subjective experience for the patient that's interesting get a different patient in there map to the enter mid singulate cortex stimulate and the person says I like I'm going to get out of my chair and I'm going to do something hard wild right this is prior to any knowledge of what the interior mid singulate cortex is doing make a long story short people who successfully overcome a physical challenge a cognitive challenge that learn a new skill that um successful dieters I don't really like that term um their interor mid signate cortex grows or becomes more active under conditions that challenge the inter mid singulate cortex so this brain region seems to be the the brain region that puts us in a forward Center of mass physically and sort of cognitively and emotionally I often like to think that you know the nervous system as sophisticated as it is and psychology as sophisticated as it is as it is excuse me can be bined into kind of three categories things that we like to eat or don't like to eat or can kind of be bended into yum yuck or me that's kind of what the the nervous system has to do because ultimately you have to decide do I want to go toward it so-call repetitive Behavior do I want to get away from it do nothing people were either like yum or some cases yum yuck or in some cases like or like me right yum y me yum yum me this is the the sort of three tributaries that we have the option of moving down not moving down or moving away from so the enter mid singulate cortex because it has inputs from so many different areas and outputs to so many different areas it can access circuits related to dopamine norepinephrine it can access circuits related to memory and context it's a hub it's a hub that by All Views through all lenses of the existing research suggests that when we anytime we do something truly challenging in particular things that we do not enjoy this is key the an mid singulate cortex undergo some sort of plasticity everything's in the research data now point to the idea that the inter mid singulate cortex is the seat of so-called willpower which is linked to Concepts like tenacity or grit and Etc and what I love about this research is that it comes from a bunch of different areas human brain Imaging brain stimulation Etc here's what I don't like about the reality but that we all need to accept which is that the anterior mid singulate cortex is modifiable by experience by leaning into challenges at any stage of life that's great we talked about that earlier plasticity but lest we forget plasticity goes in the other direction too it seems that when we don't engage in challenges that the an mid singulate cortex it doesn't atrophy but it undergoes sort of a downshift in activation now here's what's really really interesting in relates to the previous question the anter mid singulate cortex seems to be especially active at Baseline and available for plasticity in what are called superagers superagers you know we've all heard of blue zones the superagers are these people who they don't just exist in blue zones they're spread around the world these are people that seem at least by cognitive measures and other physiological measures of the body seem to age extremely slowly so they shouldn't really be called superagers right they should be called super non aers anyway the anid singulate cortex seems to be hyperactive in these superagers as they're called and so it seems that not only do they maintain cognitive function later in life but that seems to be related to their regular engagement in challenging things so remember for so many years years we heard okay like nuns don't get dementia and then there's all sorts of things you can imagine could be related to that and then we're thinking oh maybe it's crossword puzzles maybe it's crossword puzzles maybe it's hanging out with other people maybe and you know and then you know that person down the street and she cycling on the weekends like crazy and she's 90 and she looks like she's 50 and she's sharp as attack it's probably leaning into Challenge on a regular basis leaning into Challenge on a regular basis as opposed to one specific cognitive or physical thing which means that if you love cycling or you love the cold plunge or you love a certain form of exercise it's probably not doing that much for your anterior mid singulate cortex but these super agers also live longer and so there is this notion that because the anterior mid singulate cortex has connectivity to a lot of areas of the brain and body that it is somehow linked to the will to live and this is being examined now in so-called terminal cancer patients so-called you you know terminal cases I don't like the language because there are these amazing instances and Physicians and oncologists have known this for a long time that when people decide they're going to fight cancer they don't always win that fight unfortunately but often times it's the people who insist on fighting it psychologically that they won't give in that end up still living more months more years and in some cases putting the cancer into remission with of course other tools right I'm not saying you shouldn't use other tools to combat cancer it's a very interesting structure relates to the question on dementia hopefully that was uh informative Julian thank you how would you recommend shift workers minimize the effects of disruption to their circadian rhythm oh this is so important you know why because like right now 92 uh 9:40 p.m. we're kind of doing shift work right now most people are on a shift work schedule now in the world this is true we think of shift workers as only the people who are up in the middle of the night sleeping during the day but most people are doing shift work the criteria for shift work is at least a 2hour varant at least in the US a two-hour variance in the sleep wake cycle more than three nights a week anyone here go to sleep every night same time wake up every morning the same time never stay up later than that more than two nights a week okay most people are doing shift work nowadays they're just on their phone or they're on their computer and I'm not going to argue that's NE you know you shouldn't uh and many times that's me as well so here's what we do know and I could we did whole episode on shift work but I'll try and summarize some of the key points you want to have your cortisol elevated early in the day and then subside across the day that's the ideal pattern of cortisol release cortisol is a great thing when it's high and then tapers off from early day into the later day it's a bad thing if that cortisol Peak is shifted late that cortisol Peak is coming every 24 hours you don't have a choice question is is it going to be early day or is it going to be late day late day cortisol is Peaks are associated with depression anxiety this was done by my colleague David Spiegel and the great Robert spolski at Stanford a study about that Robert another great beard amazing and and and I I always thought it was to blend in with the species that he studies cuz he was like the baboon guy you know I haven't quite figured out how to master that one you know like the Cuttlefish look but the um working on it working on it maybe I just have to no never mind there's a there's a story about you heard remember the earlier story The the made anyway the cuttle fish anyway never mind um again this is why I don't like to speak too late in the day I get myself into trouble but um the point here um is that having that cortisol Peak early in the day sets you up for mood focus and alertness immune system function and really um in a really great way shift workers have a serious problem which is that late peaks in cortisol are kind of Paramount in all forms of shift work and so what you need to do is to put yourself ideally in lighting conditions that limit the amount of blue light coming in at night or when you're doing that shift work now you have to do your work and I think in the next two years if I have my way one one idea that I'd like to of embed in people's minds is you you know we hear a lot now about how hyper processed foods and highly processed foods are bad for us sort of empty calories what are empty calories it's foods that are very calorie dense but micronutrient poor right that's what it it really is it's also the quality of food issues and people get you know like let's please not have the seed oil debate it's like people get really into this and it's unclear to me still and okay but we we sort of think of empty calories like alcohol sugar Etc calorie dense micronutrient poor light can be viewed in much the same way these days we live in a very blue light Rich World lot of blue light so short wavelength light blue light UV light and by the way in sunlight especially down here it's very UV Rich blue which is great during the day especially when it's offset or or sorry when it includes long wavelength light full spectrum light by the way for everyone that's obsessed with red light and I love red light and red light therapies remember the best source of red light is the sun it's full spectrum light it includes red it's just there's a bunch of other stuff in there too see it doesn't look like a Red Light Panel um that said if you are going to do shift work one of the best things you can do it's been shown to reduce cortisol levels at night while you're doing that shift work is to filter out some of the blue so that is a use case for blue blockers or even for glasses that put you into more reddish conditions provided you can still do the work work you need to do safely you will see a dramatic reduction in cortisol under those conditions this blue and UV pathway picked up by a certain set of neurons in the eye the intrinsically photosensitive melanops and cells Etc is a real thing and it and it's designed to activate you this is why so-called Seasonal effective disorder lamps sad lamps are basically bright blue whsh light so when you're doing that shift work if you can get into red or orange or light conditions if that's great you can do this very inexpensively by the way by just getting some party lights it doesn't have to be any fancy red light this is we're not talking about red light panels the other thing of course is when you get back to your nonwork environment you need to do some work to think about when is best to sleep when is not best to sleep you know is it best to sleep all day and be up all night or get that sunlight in the morning and I talk about that in the shift work episode and I'm tempted to go down that rabbit hole now but I would just encourage you to take a look at that episode and um I'll just cue you all to a resource the hubman lab.com webbsite allows you thanks to our wonderful Engineers to put in multiple topics so you could say shift work red light or shift work dopamine or shift work sunlight and it will take you to the exact time stamps across all the episodes where those specific topics occur is all zero cost as opposed to having to go and peruse all these different episodes you a lot of people have said why not shorter episodes it's like well the idea was to create a library of information that now ai is and better engineering of websites can allow you to just pull the relevant information just like you would a book I used to go with the library for those of you like me old enough to remember he actually took this thing called a book off a shelf he Xerox copied it in any event he very archaic and very expensive and you'd always get the margin of the book in the middle like the the spine it sucked now you can go to the website and just get that information and then we also just launched an ai. huberman lab.com webbsite again as all zero cost you can say hey what should I do for shift work but I wanted you here to come here tonight so I didn't tell you that until you got here no I'm just kidding I'm just kidding okay um and there are a few other tools about adjusting eating schedules for and what not for shift work but um hopefully that gets you going um Julia thank you what's the difference between nsdr and meditation um thank thank you for this question I am a huge huge huge believer and proponent and practitioner of nsdr nonsleep deep rest what is non-sleep deep rest well to be fair Yoga Nidra which translates to yoga sleep is a thousand-year-old practice um thousands of years little practice in which you lie completely still keep the Mind awake you're not thinking in a structured way it's more of a body scan directed relaxation Etc I discovered this in 2015 when I was doing some research for a book that I still can't manage to seem to finish on trauma and addiction and I went I have a friend very talented trauma therapist who's managed to help people with all sorts of addictions he'll be on the podcast in the not to distant future and I went down to this clinic in Florida and everyone there spent the first hour of the day doing Yoga Nidra this is pretty wacky I was still in my pure science quote unquote pure scientist naive scientist lens and I thought what is this about and he said well you know so much of addiction is about an inability to regulate impulses um to deal with agitation especially in the early days of trying to get sober or being sober and it just helps people learn to regul self-direct the their nervous system in terms of relax self-directed relaxation it also seems to help with their sleep it also has these components about time and and and sort of if you because he said you know it's kind of interesting if you take a step back you know if you can tolerate craving for a second you just did it so why couldn't you do it for another second why could you do it for another second another second it's not as if it necessarily increases linearly or over time so you know what's going on and so again sort of our ability to realize and regulate our states across time and to realize there's this funny thing where when we feel terrible we think it's going to go on forever and when we're happy we we were like certain it's going to stop there's a kind of asymmetry in our nervous system that we don't understand we showed he started talking about yoga NRA really seems to help addicts recover and stay sober if they do it regularly thought well this is cool what is it I'm a neuroscientist we started studying in my laboratory we discovered that the brain goes into these States during yoga NRA that are similar to sleep body still mind alert and that seems to be very beneficial maybe even accelerates neuroplasticity and learning and indeed there's evidence for that there's evidence that yoga at from a laboratory out of Scandinavia not my laboratory showing that it can increase dopamine levels in the striatum basil ganglia by up to 60% using human positron emission tomography Imaging so we're talking about how to increase dopamine through non pharmacologic means this something about body still brain active very very powerful way to do that I I made up this term This Acronym non-sleep deep rest because I have tremendous respect for Yoga Nidra and the the yoga Traditions but I was concerned for a lot of people un unfortunately when they hear Yoga Nidra the it sounds esoteric and they're not going to approach that practice also Yoga Nidra includes intentions and some things that are a little bit on the mystical side and I knew I was going to take some heat for it and I feel badly about it but that bad feeling is offset by I think when you call something non-sleep deep rest it tells you what it is and then more people are likely to come to the practice and I felt like it was worth you know kind of putting myself you know jumping on the grenade for that one so non-sleep deep rest is very effective at restoring cognitive and physical Vigor and can indeed offset some degree of sleep loss it also gets you better at falling and staying asleep and it's very simple and very easy to do and it's zero cost and if you want to try it you can go on to YouTube and put nsdr in my last name there's a woman named Kelly boy boys who has a much more pleasant voice than mine um who does them as well these are all zeroc cost protocols she's also in the waking up app um and there are many of them common deai as another person who has you know Wonderful yoganidra scripts so you can find these things and they're really about 10 minutes to 20 minutes sometimes 30 minutes long you can do it for an hour but most people won't do that consistently you don't have to do them every day and they're very very effective at restoring mental and physical Vigor when you're feeling depleted and it getting you to be a better sleeper so I figure that's a zeroc cost tool that is grounded in good mechanistic science and makes sense logically so why not meditation typically and if and there many different forms of meditation but if you're let's just say kind of um standard if there were such a thing um third eye meditation closing your eyes focusing your concentration on a point just sort of at your forehead concentrating on breathing redirecting your attention to your breathing if it if your attention drifts we know based on work from Wendy Suzuki's laboratory at New York University and some work out of the University of Wisconsin can improve memory can improve focus and does seem to have some stress offsetting effects but it's more of a focus exercise as opposed to an energy replenishing exercise now some people meditate and feel better afterwards they have more energy but then it's sort of like well compared to what um I don't think that's the maor effect of meditation and while we're on these topics I should just say that self-directed hypnosis of the sort that my colleague David Spiegel studies is more about solving a particular problem so hypnosis is more about engaging neuroplasticity remember earlier we said that neuroplasticity in adulthood can be activated by Focus followed by rest it seems that in the self-directed hypnotic States the brain enters kind of pattern of activity in which neuroplasticity can be accessed more quickly we think because the brain is both focused and relaxed in a particular way merging that focus and rest State and of course the hypnotic script is not about getting you to do crazy things on stage that's stage hypnosis but self-directed hypnosis is for instance smoking sensation by the way that the success with smoking Sensation from hypnosis is far greater than the cessation with smoking from pretty much any other protocol but unfortunately it has the name hypnosis which makes people think about stuff that people do on stage that's kind of wacky so we need a new name for it um because unfortunately names are a problem there there names can be differentiators as opposed to integrators they don't bring PE when people say I'm going to hypnotize you you should try hypnosis people like like yum yuck me they're like yuck so um by the way does everyone here remember how you know if you're highly hypnotizable do you know that the Spiegel eye roll test it's not what teenagers do David Spiegel and his father psychiat discovered the clinical application of hypnosis it's a clinically approved tool there's brain stem neurons that cause elevations and alertness and focus and they're associated with moving the eyes up they're brain stem neurons that close the eyelids and push and essentially Drive the eyes down that are associated with parasympathetic states which why you like this when you're tired you're out there I'm sure if you are capable of keeping your ey your gaze upward and closing your eyelids you score on a particular end of the so-called Spiel eye roll test which makes you highly hypnotizable because that state of hypnosis is one in which you're what alert but very very relaxed so if you go to Spiegel's laboratory they're going to look at you and they say look up at the ceiling and then close your eyelids and if you can still see the whites of if they still see the whites of your eyes as your eyelids close well then you're in the highly hypnotizable realm kind of interesting right there's all nervous system related and you can see this stuff is this is like real clinical tools okay how do we stop ourselves from mindlessly scrolling on our phones hard questions um I didn't look at my watch because I'm bored I'm just thinking how much time do you have um well on the way here to Australia my Rob who you met earlier my friend and podcast producer he said okay guys everyone's deleting social media from your phones for the whole trip the whole trip and I'm like I don't know if I can go on this trip Rob no I'm kidding um uh we got one we have one guy who's kept it on his phone so that we can post things um and we continue to honestly I think that's what it takes um if it's social media that you're scrolling I think you should do a delete and reinstall if I'm honest a delete and reinstall every day uh because I think and then you have to limit the amount of time and one of the members of my podcast team experienced this he said I just picked up my phone a minute ago and I went to like hit the Instagram Tab and it wasn't there and I know it's not there and that's where I say yeah at some point it becomes more compulsive than addiction these are just reflexive behaviors it's like walking in the refrigerator like I did every day of my life all day I just I walk into people's homes and just look in the refrigerator I don't even know I get into people's cars I look in the glove box I just do this I'm kind of like looking around I'm not going to steal anything but it's like the teenage boy in me you know just kind walk in I'm going to open your refrigerator um so I think it's it gets to the point of reflexive and it's compulsive and it might be addictive but it can't be good when it's like that um but I think social media can be really useful so I think um if you're you can set timers you can try graying out the screen getting rid of the color thing there's all this stuff but I think if if there are particular apps that you're struggling with I would just delete them from your phone and and do a reinstall because that's enough of a of a behavioral barrier there are enough steps involved enough sequencing to put the thing back on there each day and each time maybe twice a day that you're going to vastly reduce your use to be honest I think that's probably the best way to do it and there are probably people in this audience that are thinking this seems crazy like just don't turn it on just don't just don't open it and look if I was 65 years old I'd say that too but it doesn't work that way for certainly the younger generation it doesn't I know this because I gave a talk at Santa Clara University a few years ago and I was talking about limiting social uh social media use and phones and this kid came up to me afterwards he said you don't get it he like you're like back then I was like 43 he said you don't get it he said for you the phone was a thing that you like integrated into your like post 9s High School life like you watched The Breakfast Club or I don't know how he knew that movie I was like you're right I did watch The Breakfast Club a bunch of times and he said but for us it's like life I like I rolled my eyes and I thought wait no listen I'm going to listen because no one knows what it's like to be 16 years old or 24 years old in 2024 unless you're 16 or 24 like okay here we go listen he said when my phone he said when my phone Powers down I feel the energy drain out of me and when it comes back up I feel Life Energy come back into my body and I thought oh my goodness like we are hosed but that's but that's the reality and I'm of the mind you know I was a I was a camp counselor I worked with at risk kids I was a wild kid and you learn something especially when you work with kids like me when I was a teenager I was a Helen is be a channel not a damn you cannot block the system that's emerged this is here and it's here to stay so I think things like deleting the app is putting it back on there is the only way to go we have to listen I think we have to listen understand that you know we after all adults created these Technologies and these kids are using them and I don't think we're going to see a reversal I don't so we have to really I think that what he said to me as scary as it was to me I think reflects the reality it's part of their life energy it's part of their connectivity and we we're going to have to come up with better tools and I doubt those tools are going to be uh to the effect of eliminating it you could say unfortunately you know all the adult last I checked I'm an adult people in my life have argued differently but I think we're going to have to learn to be a channel not a dam with this uh I do if resources and ethics were not an issue what would your dream clinical trial to run oh my goodness this is a hard question okay um dream clinical trial what's that oh gosh the accent is killing me more cuddlefish yeah more cuddlefish like cuddlefish I like the idea of more cuddling um physical contact so key um I think we're all still recovering from the years we had a few years of just like no physical like physical contact so minimal um I mean there's the classic harlo experiments right the wire monkey or versus the cloth monkey I mean primates go to the cloth monkey even if they don't get food there I mean it's such a critical component of you know how our nervous system forms um the I think this is a this is a you know what I'm going to do something I've never done before I'm going to turn the question around I actually would I seriously I'm not trying to avoid answering this but you know we've worked on all I've worked on cuttlefish we worked on respiration practices we worked on uh Vision we've worked on neuro regeneration you know I've enjoyed um working on a great number of different things I'm sort of curious what people like what do you think we need more of I've never done this but I really want to know um I don't know how we're going to do this in any kind of non-chaotic format but what the hell um it's late enough in the evening we just do it um like really I mean so now there's trials on psychedelics we do this by kind of like I'll throw out some options and then we'll do it so right now it seems that psychedelics are a big thing um do they increase plasticity yeah I'm excited about it I'm a convert but I do think that one has to be careful and there are certain people in populations like people who um suffer from certain types of manic bipolar or schizophrenia that really need to avoid these things kids I mean being a kid is basically being in a psychedelic State the you know lateral connectivity of the brain is extend ensive um and you know I don't encourage it I mean that the trials with MDMA and PTSD are incredible what's happening with maps is incredible you know 60 plus perc remission rates done with licensed Physicians of course I don't get Cavalier with this so okay so I'll just ask so I mean it's going to be hard to draw out the denters but more work on psychedelics psilocybin Etc as ways to amarate depression are people like more like yum yuck or meh is that like yum okay or like yuck don't be afraid to say yuck I like a good argument is anyone like yuck on psychedelics sorcery it's sorcery I heard that um meh okay all right interesting okay so psychedelics get a strong push I think we have enough evidence that changing patterns of respiration changes brain States but I think that that's an interesting area um I don't know you can you just shout it out just shout it out one all first over here yes oh God the accent you guys are so good I love the accent listen I listen I I don't drink I don't drink anymore but when I used to when I used to go to bars I'll just say the Australian accent never fails um in the US yeah time Chambers time Chambers oh hyperbaric chambers yeah hyper that's an interesting one yeah I mean when I think of ways to modify physiology you think temperature light neurom modulators right you think by the way anytime you want to think about changing something in the body your brain you think mechanical and chemical so this is kind of this is changing the chemistry of the brain and body through hyperbaric chambers thank you appreciate it I think I re did we run into each other at the gym the other day no anyway um think I recognize you I um the okay one I'll get to you in one second yeah yeah love that okay so protocols for childhood trauma yeah so I mean I think we're finally at the place where we as a world where like this word trauma actually is Meaningful like because we knew it before but I think before people thought if like if you hadn't lived in a war zone which obviously is trauma um now I think people appreciate that trauma is inherent to a lot of Life by the way I love your shirt I that shirt it's like yeah a lawn stale shirt was Against Racism hey I love I love that shirt um you know the history of that shirt right it's like lawdale was co-opted by some Neo-Nazi groups as a brand so lawdale came out with an Against Racism and hate shirt which is like the best like to that which is yeah so anyway little side note there not sponsored by lawdale um but rad shirt yeah I think childhood trauma you know trauma can be best defined as an adverse event that changes the nervous system in a way that causes maladaptive functioning going forward it's not every bad thing right but it certainly happens and I think we need to learn to rewire the nervous system let's let's face it whether not psychedelics or it's talk therapy or it's hyperbaric chambers or it's cold plunges what we're talking about is neuroplasticity we're trying to rewire the nervous system so I love that one um we need some very structured um tools there's all sorts of stuff about soaz release for trauma and you know there's little bits like little Sil of things that are all very interesting breath work you know release work but so far there isn't like a structured framework for for treating trauma different groups doing different things EMDR Etc I think they all have Merit okay there was that shouting out cons Consciousness The Big C yeah um in my house Costello was the big ca he would always remind me of that but Consciousness I think that um and now with AI we have to ask ourselves like what is what is conscious and I think we need a clear definition of what that is do you guys know this story of like they were going to solve Consciousness a few years ago and and they didn't do it there was this bet in Neuroscience that um it was going to be solved by 2015 or something like that so I think we need and it's not obviously so we need better definition of what that means but I think it's very important uh problem indeed so thank you maybe a free will yeah that's a tough one that's one I usually avoid um R Robert Robert slammed me on that one on the podcast what was it in the back I heard as an Adaptive technique but oh yeah you know we hear I yeah we hear so much I I'm agreeing with you the um we hear so much about ADHD these days without an understanding of like what it really reflects except in the extreme clinical cases so I think a better understanding I did two episodes of the podcast by the way on a attention in 88 she one focused mainly on behavioral and nutritional tools it was positively received by about half of people and then the other half were like this is garbage what about all the drugs that are useful then I did one about all the drugs that can be useful and people said this is garbage you're putting kids on meth and I'm like wait a second hold on we try and cover it all so um because I I favor balance I heard a excellent things there was were all male voices we kind of got a sampling bias here unless I'm got a high frequency cut off thank you something negotiation sorry science of negotiation yeah so people being able to resolve differences better Lord please yes oh my goodness I mean this is yes thank you um if ever there was a call to action it's like um you know this is a big question right I'm a neuroscientist not a historian not a not a futurist or a politician but um thank goodness can you imagine what a terrible job I would do I like being outdoors I hate meetings I like dressing like this and and I and I don't like the news um it'd be the worst but yeah if ever there was a need and a question it's you know are we just going to continue in these like iterative cycles of like when the economy is good things seem mostly good and then a lot of people are still suffering and then like these cycles of and or are we going to finally just sit back and go okay what are we good at as a species what are we really bad at what are we like kind of good at and start coming up with some tools to try and function better on the whole with the understanding that there are Bad actors out there that are constantly trying to you know exploit and manipulate but there are also a lot of good actors too and by good actors I don't mean actors in the in the stage acting sense I mean I think that um look what we're we're we're a smart species we can think in past present and future terms we can look at mechanism we can communicate better with each other better than any species except maybe the cuddlefish and so I think the question is are we you know is there going to be some sort of sitting back and finally just saying like enough like let's just figure out a way to dialogue and I love that um you know it it's a it's a science we that there are problems and there are hard problems um and honestly I think it's going to come about if it comes about it's going to come about through groups not through individuals I don't think we're going to get like the world leader or world leaders of 12 people like let's get it done let's get it done right this time I think it's going to be a a more Collective Consciousness you know I'd like to see fewer individual leaders and more groups and panels leading things but anyway that's that's my bias and you know um genetics genetics genetics love it yeah okay well there's okay I'll say two things and then I think my team's going to make me close out [Music] wait um rad okay awesome now it's turning into like a like a science punk rock show so um the um genetics well I think the big things is in genetics are we're soon going to be in the place where we can do genetic well right now you can take human embryos and Screen them for mutations by whole genome sequencing it's very inexpensive compared to a few years ago it's still expensive and you can do selection you can select out based on lack of mutations maybe even based on over representation of certain genes um that's interesting has some ethical considerations but there soon will be you can do crisper um you could in theory you could modify the Genome of of adults um and certainly babies and so that's where we're headed it's already being done in certain countries it was done in China um it was not looked upon kindly by the International Ethics committees um but it was done a mutation in the in the HIV receptor um so those babies exist so it's happening uh it's going to be interesting times uh the microbiome I think is really exciting here's my big call to action is that there's a microbiome in the gut but there's also microbiome on the skin and the nose and the mouth and the genitals like these all these little niches and well I guess it depends the little or not so little niches um depends um I was thinking about the nostrils um the night's getting long um there I go again um the uh they they are all important and and there's a lot more to understand I think the gut microbiome is just one of the microbiomes so and female hormones certainly important topic it's received far less sadly far less attention than male hormone therapy or um understanding and and things are starting to change there it's been slow yeah yeah there's been it's been can you believe it it was like four only like eight years ago that the National Institutes of Health in the United States was like hey maybe you should start studying female mice too it's like like this I mean we're modern science is very far behind we're very far behind and I think it's a it's a resource issue it's also uh you know there's a bunch of um sociological consider considerations in science anyway I'm trying to change the story there but I'm but one person and you know I hope to live a very long time but you know um should I get hit by a bullet to bus or cancer um tomorrow I want you to know that it's going to be or late long time from now I have natural causes sorry I have a morbid sense of humor I work I worked with the Physicians they all talk like that I hope to live a very long time um but it's a collective effort so I just want to um before we wrap want to say a couple of things we can get on with the rest of the night first of all um I it is a collective effort um you know I as I've mentioned several times this evening I I look no differently on the massage therapy versus Chiropractic versus uh whole genome sequencing it's just all different lenses to look at the same sort of set of goals through and yes there's a range of quality and rigor and communication Styles and personality but if you can maintain some level of curiosity and discernment about what works for you or doesn't work for you where you think there's Merit um that's great but but it's going to be um a wonderful thing when we can all start to dialogue and see where the points of convergence are where we're you're basically talking about two different groups talking about the exact same thing through different language I think that's where things really can move forward um the discourse of public science and health communication obviously is something I'm very passionate about I would love to see more podcasts believe believe it or not not just my podcast but they more podcasts if you have something to say to the world please say it please put it out there on social media I do think that there's value there so I'm encouraging the every person not just usually they go the young people but like the every people to um you know get information out there and and to support the efforts and I also want to say thank you so much for coming out on a Saturday night here in Melbourne um and for listening to the podcast and for yeah it really means a lot to me thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you so much thank you thank you thank you I re I really appreciate it that the podcast is indeed a labor of love I feel oh so blessed to do it and um and my hope is that the tools protocols and information will radiate out as far and wide as possible I don't need or want credit I just want people to have the information I really mean that and to share it where you think it can be useful to people and last but certainly not least thank you for your interest in science [Applause] [Music]

Title: Dr. E.J. Chichilnisky: How the Brain Works, Curing Blindness & How to Navigate a Career Path
Published: 2024-03-18 12:00:44 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. E.J. Chichilnisky, Ph.D., a professor of neurosurgery and ophthalmology at Stanford University. He studies how we see and uses that information to build artificial eyes that restore vision to the blind. 

We discuss how understanding the retina (the light-sensing brain tissue that lines the back of our eyes) is critical to knowing how our brain works more generally. 

We discuss brain augmentation with biologically informed prostheses, robotics, and AI and what this means for medicine and humanity. 

We also discuss E.J.’s unique journey into neuroscience and how changing fields multiple times, combined with some wandering, taught him how to guide his decision-making in all realms of life. 

This episode ought to be of interest to anyone interested in learning how the brain works from a world-class neuroscientist, those interested in the future of brain therapeutics and people seeking inspiration and tools for navigating their own professional and life journey.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr EJ chelski Dr EJ chelski is a professor of neurosurgery Opthalmology and Neuroscience at Stanford University he is one of the world's leading researchers trying to understand how we see the world around us that is how visual perception occurs and then applying that information directly to the design of neural prosthesis literally robotic eyes that can allow blind people to see once again today's discussion is a very important one for anyone who wants to understand how their brain works indeed EJ spells out in very clear terms exactly how the world around us is encoded by the neurons the nerve cells within our brain in order to create these elaborate visual images that we essentially see within our minds and with that understanding he explains how that can be applied to engineer specific robotic Ai and machine learning devices that can allow human brains not only to see once again in the blind but also to perceive things that typical human brains can't and indeed for memory to be enhanced and for cognition to be enhanced this is the direction that Neuroscience is going and in the course of today's discussion we have the opportunity to learn from the world World expert in these topics where the science is now and where it is headed during today's discussion we also get heavily into the topic of how to select one's professional and personal path and indeed you'll learn from Dr chelski that he has a somewhat unusual path both into science and through science so for those of you that believe that everyone that's highly accomplished in their career always knew exactly what they wanted to do at every stage you will soon learn that that is absolutely not the case with EJ he described tries wandering through three different graduate programs taking several years off from school in order to dance Yes you heard that correctly to dance and how that wandering and indeed dancing helped him decide exactly what he wanted to do with his professional life and exactly what specific problems to try and Tackle in the realm of Neuroscience and medicine it's a discussion that I'm certain that everybody scientist or no young or old can benefit from and can apply the specific tools that EJ describes in their own life and Pursuits before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity I've spoken many times before on this and other podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health health and performance now one of the key aspects to getting a great night's sleep is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3° and in order to wake up in the morning feeling refreshed your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3° eight sleep makes it extremely easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment at the beginning middle and throughout the night and when you wake up in the morning I've been sleeping on an eight Sleep mattress cover for nearly 3 years now and it has dramatically improved my sleep if you'd like to try eights sleep you can go to 8sleep.com huberman to save $150 off their pod 3 cover eight sleep currently ships to the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by Roa Roa makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system and I can tell you that your visual system has to contain with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly under different conditions Roa understands this and designed all of their eyeglasses and sunglasses with the biology of the visual system in mind now Roa eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially developed for use in sport and as a consequence you can wear them without them slipping off your face while running or cycling and they're extremely lightweight Roa eyeglasses and sunglasses are also designed with a new technology called float fit which I really like because it makes their eyeglasses and sunglasses fit perfectly and they don't move around even when I'm active so if I'm running and I'm wearing my glasses they stay on my face most of the time I don't even remember they're on my face because they're so lightweight you can also use them while cycling or for other activities so if you'd like to try Roa glasses go to Roka that's r.com and enter the code huberman to save 20% off your first order again that's r.com and enter the code huberman at checkout today's episode is also brought To Us by betterhelp betterhelp offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out online now I've been going to therapy for well over 30 years initially I didn't have a choice it was a condition of being allowed to stay in school but pretty soon I realized that therapy is extremely valuable in fact I consider doing regular therapy just as important as getting regular exercise including cardiovascular exercise and resistance training which of course I also do every week the reason I know therapy is so valuable is that if you can find a therapist with whom you can develop a really good rapport you not only get terrific support for some of the challenges in your life but you also can derive tremendous insights from that therapy insights that can allow you to better not just your emotional life and your relationship life but of of course also the relationship to yourself and to your professional life to all sorts of career goals in fact I therapy is one of the key components for meshing together all aspects of one's life and being able to really direct one's focus and attention toward what really matters if you'd like to try betterhelp go to betterhelp.com huberman to get 10% off your first month again that's betterhelp.com huberman and now for my discussion with Dr EJ chelski Dr EJ chelski welcome good to see you for the audience we are friends we go way back EJ has been a few years or more ahead of me in the science game and the best way to describe you and your work EJ is you're an astronaut you go places no one else has been willing to go before he developed new technologies in order to do that all with the Bold mission of trying to understand how the nervous system which of course includes the brain works and how to make it better with engineering so today we are going to get into all of that but just to start off and get everybody on the same page maybe we could just take a moment and talk about the brain and nervous system and you know what it consists of that allows to do all the sorts of things that we're going to get into like see things in our environment and respond to those things in our environment so at risk of throwing too much at you right out the gate what's your one to five minute version of how the brain works oh I don't have a one to five minute version of how the brain works but I can tell you how I think uh vision is initiated in the brain and um you and I go back a long way so we have a lot of common understanding about this but I'll narrate it from scratch if if that makes sense um so vision is initiated in the retina uh of the eye which is a sheet neural tissue at the rear of the eye that captures the light that is incident on the eye that comes in through the through the eye transforms that light into electrical signals processes those electrical signals in interesting ways and changes them up and then sends that visual information to the brain where it is used to bring about our sense of vision and uh you you asked me about the 1 to five minute version how the brain works I don't know but I do know that the brain receives all these patterns of electrical activity coming out of these nerve cells and the retina and somehow assembles that into our visual experience whether that be responding to things coming at us or our circadian rhythm that that govern our sleep and behavior or identifying objects for prey or avoiding Predators or appreciating Beauty and what we know is that the brain receives a fantastically complex set of signals from the retina and puts that all together into our visual experience and we are very visual creatures obviously so I think that's a big part of how the brain works because so much of what we do revolves around vision revolves around how the brain puts together these signals coming out of the retina and I would love to understand how that works at the moment I don't uh and what we're trying to do is get a really complete understanding of how that begins in the retina and then how we can restore it in those who have lost sight why focus on this issue in the retina this thin set of layers of neurons that line the back of the eye what why why explore there I mean obviously there are centers within the brain that of course contain neurons nerve cells that are involved in Vision if one wants to understand visual perception and I agree by the way that visual perception is one of the most dominant forces in the quality and experience of our life why focus on the retina why not focus on the visual cortex or the visual Thalamus I me what's so special about the retina well we have to focus on all of it because understanding the retina won't give us a full understanding of how all this works obviously and if you don't have your visual cortex and visual Thalamus you won't see but if you don't have your retina you also won't see you won't even have a chance to see so I focus on the retina because um I enjoy the possibility that we can really understand a piece of the nervous system in my lifetime in our lifetimes we can understand it so well that we can build it replace it restore its function that's farther off in this in the central regions of the brain it's going to be quite a bit harder um I find satisfaction in really understanding something so well that I can write down in a mathematical formula what it's doing that I can test my hypotheses up and down and yes we really get how this little machine works and that I can engineer devices to replace the function of that circuit when it's lost that to me is just deeply satisfying but there also has is a really fundamental role for people who want to go and do more exploratory work in the visual brain as you mentioned in the visual cortex and the phalus and other places because ultimately those retinal signals won't lead to anything if those areas aren't putting it all together to govern our perception and our ultimately our Behavior so let's talk about the retina in its full Beauty and detail three layers of cells line the back of the eye like a pie crust somehow take light that comes into the eye lens focuses that light if it doesn't do that well we put lenses in front of our eyes such as contact lenses or spectacles and somehow takes that light and transforms it as you said into neural signals and processes that within the retina so let's take a deep dive into the retina and do so with the understanding at least my understanding is that in part thanks to your work and the work of others this is perhaps the best understood piece of the brain yes I think it's a solid argument that it's the best understood piece of the brain and uh we'll turn back to that in a minute so um the retina begins with a sheet of cells called the photo receptor cells that are highly specialized these are cells that essentially don't exist anywhere else in the brain and what they do is transform light energy into electrical signals in neurons very specialized very uh demanding cells they require a lot of Maintenance and they die relatively easily which is what gives rise to some some of the forms of blindness those are the you might call them pixel detectors they're tiny cells called photo receptors that each one captures light from a particular location in the world that sheet of cells has done that initial transduction process where light is converted into neural signals that the brain can then begin to work with the second layer is responsible for processing adjusting changing mixing and matching uh comparing signals and different neurons many complex operations that we're still trying to understand and consists of dozens of distinct cell types that extract features if you will of the visual World from the elementary pixels represented in the photo receptor cells so that second layer is receiving the input from that sheet of photo receptors and picking stuff out of it the third layer of cells is the so-called retinol gangan cells that's the only uh term that I'd like to probably will come up repeatedly in this conversation uh so for your for your viewers and listeners um these retinol ganglin cells are the ones who are responsible for taking the signals that are there in the retina and sending them to the brain so that the process of vision can begin they are the The Messengers if you will from the retina to the brain the retinal ganglin cells and there are about 20 different types in humans um are again feature extractors they pick out different bits and pieces of the visual scene and send interesting stuff to the brain trying to leave out the uninteresting stuff and the 20 or so cell types all pick out different types of information from the visual scene you can sort of think of them as Photoshop filters each cell type in the retina um again about 20 different Gangland cell types each type represents the full scene the entire visual world but picks out different features such as some cells pick out spatial detail tiny little Points of Light almost some cells pick out and Signal information about things that are moving in the visual World some cells pick out information that's been captured about different wavelengths from the photo receptor cells and there thereby giving us our sensations of color and probably more things in those 20 different gangin cell types that we don't fully understand the result then is that the retina has this sort of a representation of the visual world but it has 20 different representations not one it's not one picture that comes out of the retina and gets sent to the brain no no no it's 20 different pictures and you can think of maybe as 20 different photoshopped pictures but one of them has the edges highlighted one of them has the colors highlighted one of them has movement uh encoded in it and these somehow these filters send the information to many different targets in the brain and our brain puts it Al together and then we have a cohesive sense of the visual World which is the remarkable feature that we really don't understand amazing is it fair for those that don't work with Photoshop to think about these um different Photoshop filters perhaps as like different movies of the visual world one movie contains the outlines of objects and people and things another movie is showing the motion of blobs in the environment meaning whatever is moving environment is kind of just represented as blobs another movie is just the color in the environment another and then all of those what I'm calling movies are sent into the brain and then the brain somehow combines those in ways that allow us to see each other and see cars and objects and recognize faces is that is that one way to think about that that's exactly how I think about it maybe it's a better way to say it no I I I like the Photoshop filter uh analogy I just for those that don't work with Photoshop um you know I I just think that the movie analogy might might be a decent alternative how the retina works is an example we think of how all sensory systems work there's an initial representation in a specialized cell type that is it is that is responsible for and capable of extracting physical features from the world and then neural circuits in the brain use that information in different ways to grab stuff out of the visual world in the auditory system there's the the sound world is represented also in specialized cells that capture sound energy and transduce that into neural signals and then subsequent p uh stages of processing in the auditory system pick out different features of our auditory world like the frequency how high or how low a tone is right the direction it's coming from right the movement of it uh how loud it is different features are extracted so the we think the visual system is just an example of how the external world is represented in our brain and of course in some sense a a philosophical approach to the brain is really saying well there's the sensory world and then there's the actions we take and there's almost nothing else that we really know other than those two things how the sensory world comes in and then finally it results in our action that's what our brain is about because vision is so important for people I find it absolutely compelling and fascinating I mean as an example as you know well many people study rodents uh to understand how different aspects of the brain work and um you know rodents are interesting animals and do all sorts of really cool things but they interact with the world differently than we do they in in a lot of ways they sense by smelling they they identify objects by smelling and they navigate with their whiskers in to a large extent we don't do any of that you don't navigate with your whiskers at least I don't think you do you don't recognize me when I walk in the room by my smell no you use for all that and we humans use Vision so it's a really fundamental aspect of who we are as biological creatures I wonder if just for sake of entertainment uh we could think about how the human retina and therefore Vision in our species differs a little bit from some extreme examples of vision in other species not to make this a comparative um or Zoological um exploration but just to really illustrate the fact that the specific cell types within our retinas create a visual representation of the outside world that can be and often is very different from that of other species um for instance or at least my understanding is that the mantis shrimp sees I don't know 60 to 100 different variations of each color that we are essentially blind to because their photoreceptors can detect very subtle differences in red for instance long wavelengths of light what most people refer to as red um pit vipers cons sense heat emissions essentially with their eyes but also other organs um and on and on you know it I raise this because I think the the human neuro retina is such an incredible example of extracting features from the visual world that then we recreate but I think it's also worth reminding everyone and ourselves that it's not a complete representation of what's out there like there's a lot in light that we don't see because our neuro retina just can't turn it into electrical signals right you want to give some examples of what we can't see and if any um particular examples from the Animal Kingdom Delight you feel free to throw those out well one thing you mentioned color um we experience a rich sensation of color when we look at the world and say wow I see all these colors that's immediate and that's just how we talk about it but in fact we have very little information about color color is a very high-dimensional complex thing or wavelength I should say wavelength information really is about how much energy there is in the light around us at different wavelengths we only have three sort of snapshots of that in our retinas with the three different types of photo receptor cells that are sensitive to different wavelength different bands of the wavelength Spectrum three is not a lot as you just said other creatures have many more ways of capturing wavelength information and one way you can verify for yourself that we just have three is to realize that if you look at your TV there are only three primaries on your TV there's a red there's a green and there's a blue that's it and from those three primaries the entire richness of the experience on your TV set is uh composed so with just those three things you basically are able to create any human visual sensation well the mantis shrimp would be like that's nothing there's so much more stuff out there that's not represented on this TV if you could speak to the mantis shrimp another thing we we maybe don't see another example of a difference in the animal kingdom is so um again taking rodents as an example one of the one of the things rodents have to do is to not be hunted by birds that are coming down toward them and so it it appears that there are cells in the retina that are seem to be quite sensitive to what to uh looming to something dark that's getting bigger uh like a shadow coming from a bird coming down at you we don't know for sure that this is exactly what causes animals to avoid being eaten by birds but there's there's interesting evidence in that direction that's not really a big thing for us for humans as far as I know we're not typically hunted by huge birds so that's not a thing we need and I think that's that's where comes back to where you were headed if I understand right um which is we occupy different biological niches we and the Manta shrimp and the rodents and our visual systems reflect that we have different stuff that we're looking for in our visual environment than other creatures are and so our eyes are different and that's one of the reasons that we emphasize work on the human retina um as opposed to other certain other animal species that would be less clearly relevant to the visual experience you and I have so let's talk about these incredible experiments that your laboratory has been doing for several decades now I've had the uh privilege of sitting in on some of these experiments and they are very involved um to say the least if you could just walk us through one of these experiments I think the audience would appreciate understanding what goes into quote unquote trying to understand what's going on in the electrical activity of these specific retinal cell types the retinal gangling cells in particular um you know what does this look like you know you're in your laboratory at Stanford and you get a phone call someone says I got a retina what happens next we scramble like crazy we drop everything we're doing cancel all our appointments and get ourselves ready for 48 hours of non-stop work down in the lab getting as much data as we possibly can from the retina the most exciting example of what you just said is when we get a human retina when for example there's a a donor who has died and the retina is available for research we jump at that opportunity how soon after uh the person is deceased do you need to get the eye Globe the eyeball in order to get the retina in a condition that would allow you to record electrical signals from it a few minutes just you're waiting in the hospital um typic the way we typically get these eyes is from brain dead individuals so people who are legally and medically dead but they're hearts are still pumping and therefore their retinas are still alive and functioning when when those individuals uh are used their the bodies of those individuals are used for organ donations we can benefit from that organ donation setup that organ distribution centers do to save many people's lives and also to promote research so we sometimes get those retinas and that begins the experiment for us um I'm gonna ask for a few more details here just to put the picture in people's minds and not to be gruesome I just really want people to understand what's involved here so you'll get a call we've got a a patient who is soon to be deceased um they've consented to giving their eye Globes their eyeballs for research so that you can study the human retina y um is it you who goes over and takes the eyes out does somebody do that or hand them to you in a bucket of ice I'm sorry if I'm making people queasy at all but this is folks how uh one goes about trying to understand how the human brain works absolutely and this is also how you go about donating your heart so that you can save somebody else's life who needs a heart transplant the same incredible organizations that do the harvesting of the tissue for us their primary goal is to do that for organ donations to save lives they save lives every day these people are incredible donor Network West is one of those organizations the one that we work with um they're really amazing um so their technicians or a retinal surgeon will take the eye out give it to myself or some somebody from my lab who will bring it back to the lab and we have a way to keep the eye alive and functioning just the eye by itself is this always at Stanford or do you sometimes travel elsewhere local hospitals up to an hour away so then you drive them back we drive them back it's the retina Express and when when we're bringing back the retin Express it's uh again it's all hands on deck in our lab we are scrambling setting up all of our equipment getting everything ready you've been at these experiments they're intense and they really are really are 48 hour marathons of incredible activity by really dedicated individuals so um we we might get those eyes sometimes get them at 2 in the morning that's common and from that to in the morning time um Begins the experiment so we bring the eyes back we open them up and we we have access to the rear of the eye which is what the where the retina is it's a thin sheet of neural tissue at the back part of the eye we hemis the eye cut it in half so that we can see the back it's like half of a glow if you will and then we put in relaxing cuts and lay it out flat so we can see what we're working with and we take little segments of retina out in the subsequent 48 Hours cut them out maybe a 3X3 millimeter piece of the retina a little chunk of retinal tissue and bring it into an electrophysiology recording and stimulation apparatus that allow allows us to interact with it and we do two types of experiments with that so this electrophysiological recording and stimulation apparatus is very custom built by our physics collaborator who have developed high-end equipment it allows us to record and stimulate through 512 channels simultaneously at very high density this is pretty high-end stuff in terms of uh technology for interrogating and manipulating the electrical signals in the retina that's what we specialize in in my lab could I just ask a question about this device um I've seen it before uh it's very small as you mentioned your recording from a few millimet square of the of the retina um from this recently deceased patient um it looks a little bit like a bed of nails right like tiny little microwires all arranged very Clos to one another you got the retina laying down on top of it and that bed of nails can extract meaning record the electrical signals that are coming out of the retinal gangion cells that's right and the retina is still alive so you are in a position to shine light on it and essentially um make it behave um um in the same way it would if it were still lining the back of a healthy alive person that is the beauty of these experiments so because we can keep the retina alive and happy and because the retinal ganglin cells the cells that are the ones that message the visual information to the brain are on the surface we can put them right next to the electrodes and we can record their electrical activity in other words we record the signal that those cells would have sent to the brain if they were still in the living person and at the same time as you said we can focus an image that we create on a computer display onto the retina so we're treating the retina if you will as a little electronic circuit which it almost is honestly delivering light to the photo receptor cells so that they are electrically excited and then recording the electrical activity that the retina is sending out if you will that allows us to study how the retina Works normally what we also do with that same electrical apparatus is turn around and pass current through those electrodes in order to see if we can activate those ganglin cells directly with no light just electrodes why do we do that we do that because it allows us to design future methods of restoring Vision by electrical stimulation of the retina which we'll probably talk about in a few minutes I'd like to take a brief moment and thank one of our sponsors and that's ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens I started taking ag1 way back in 2012 the reason I started taking it and the reason I still take it every day is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas for vitamins and minerals and it ensures that I get enough Prebiotic and probiotic to support gut health now gut health is something that over the last 10 years we realized is not just important for the health of our gut but also for our immune system and for the production of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators things like dopamine and serotonin in other words gut health is critical for proper brain functioning now of course I strive to consume healthy Whole Foods for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day but there are a number of things in ag1 including specific micronutrients that are hard to get from Whole Foods or at least in sufficient quantities so ag1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals that I need probiotics prebiotics the adaptogens and critical micronutrients so anytime somebody asks me if they were to take Just One supplement what that supplement should be I tell them ag1 because ag1 support so many different systems within the body that are involved in mental health physical health and performance to try ag1 go to drink a1.com huberman and you'll get a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 and five free travel packs of ag1 again that's drink a1.com huberman let's take this moment to talk a little bit about cell types so um you mentioned there are about 20 different types of these retinal gangling cells what we may refer to in brief as r gc's so retinal gangling cells rgc's same thing and as you mentioned these cover the entire retina so that if each cell type is extracting a different set of features from the visual World motion color specific colors Etc that essentially no location in the world around us fails to be represented by these cells put differently these cells are looking everywhere um each cell cell type is looking everywhere um so that if movement occurs in any region of our visual world we are in a position to detect it um but maybe we could talk a little bit about cell types cell types is such an important theme in the field of Neuroscience and indeed in all of biology but it's actually not something we have talked about very much on this podcast before either in Solo episodes or in guest episodes um I don't have any specific reason for that we've talked about brain areas prefrontal cortex basil ganglia anterior mingal cortex and on and on we' talked about neural circuits but we've never really talked about cell types so the gangan cells as other you let me down no talking about cell types well but that's why you're here that's why I'm here that's why you're here um tell us about cell types how do you figure out if you have a cell type how do you know if it's a cell type or you know is it the shape is it how it responds um how do you know if you have a cell typee what what's this about and I want to just um put in the back of this question um or rather in the back of people's minds that um this issue of cell types is not just an issue pertinent to the retina this is an issue that is critical to understanding how the brain works absolutely it's critical to understand Consciousness I know a lot of people like what is consciousness right we're not going there just yet but uh what are cell types how do you determine if you have a cell type and why is this so important to understanding how the brain works yeah I mean as as you said as as far as we understand every single brain circuit is full of very distinct cell types those cell types are distinguished by their genetic expression their shapes and sizes which other cells they do contact and which cells they don't contact where they send their information to in other parts of the brain and what they represent and as far as we know this is true throughout the brain and it's true in the retina the different gangling cell types retinal ganglin cell types about 20 of them Each of which is looking at the whole visual scene extracts different stuff this cell type one extracts one thing cell type two extracts something else but they all represent the entire visual scene but those cell types we know from lots of beautiful work work that you're closely connected to and some of which you've done um those cell types have different morphology different shapes and sizes different patterns of gene expression different targets in the brain they send their outputs to different places in the brain so really to study the retina without understanding cell types you're kind of lost right away you have to know what's going on with the cell types otherwise you can't make sense of this retinol signal the way we we identify them in two ways and they're different for different purposes the the basic way we identify the different cell types is their function because we study their function we study how they respond to light images and we can clearly separate them out and in fact it's it's a simple thing to say but it's really true our 512 electrod technology which you've seen in our lab and stuff that developed with collaborators um about 20 years ago um was crucial for this because with that 512 electrode technology we could see many cells of each type and we could clearly parse them apart from one another whereas previous studies working on one cell at a time had great difficulty doing that so with our technology with 512 electrodes we record hundreds of cells simultaneously we say oh there's 20 of these there are 50 of those there's 26 of those and here they are and we can just set them in different bins and say okay this is what's present in this retina just what the information is they're extracting there's another purpose again referring forward to the neuroengineering aspect we need to identify the cell types not just based on what visual information they carry but based on their electrical features properties electrical properties of the cells cells as you know neurons are electrical cells they fundamentally receive and transmit electrical information and the way that they do that has a distinctive electrical signature that turns out to be super important for developing devices to to restore Vision could you explain how you determine what a given cell type does its electrical properties um let's just draw a mental image for people uh the retina's taken out of this deceased individual put down on this bed of nails of electrodes those electrodes can detect electrical signals within the gangling cells you are able to shine light onto the retina and see how the retinal gangling cells respond meaning what electrical signals they would transmit to the brain if they were still connected to a brain they're not connected to a brain in the experiment they're sitting there they're trying but they're trying I could imagine playing those cells a movie of I don't know a checkerboard going where every um Square on the checkerboard goes from white to black to gray could do that I could um play a cartoon I could um show it uh this year's Academy Award winner for best picture like how do you decide what to show the retina this is a human being's retina after all uh presumably it looked at things that are relevant to human beings until that person died but how do you determine cell type electrical signals if you don't know what specific things to show it I mean you're going to show it I don't know Disney movies like what what do you show it so what we shown now reflects the fact that we've built up a lot of information and our work stands on the shoulders of many scientists who have studied the retina for decades to figure out what different cell types respond to and um we know that certain cell types respond primarily to increments of light when light gets brighter than it was so it change from a certain brightness to a higher brightness this particular cell type fires another cell type fires or send spikes to the brain when it gets darker some cell types uh respond primarily to large Targets in the visual World other cell types respond better to small Targets in the visual World some cell types respond to different wavelengths of light that we can identify there exists certain cell types that are still poorly understood that respond to movement so we can tailor visual stimuli to types that we kind of already know about because of much preceding research that's not actually how we do it in our experiments for the most part instead we use a very unbiased flickering checkerboard pattern as it turns out which is a really efficient unbiased way to sample many cells simultaneously so that in a half hour of electrical recording from a retina we can figure out what all the 512 or so cells are that we're recording and know all of their types and the way we do that is to play essentially random garbage TV snow Type image to the retina for a period of time and determine which bits of of brightening or darkening or movement or whatever in that random garbage activated this particular cell by looking AC at average across the half hour recording and saying oh it looks like this cell was always firing when it became bright in this region of the screen that must be an on Cell sensitive to light in this region of the screen and so on so we have sophisticated efficient ways of doing it but it all comes back to these basic things about what features in the visual World tend to cause a given cell to send a signal to the bra yeah that makes a lot of sense so you take essentially what you called random garbage um snow white black and gray pixels on a screen yep the retina views that and then the cells in the retina will respond every once in a while with an electrical potential they'll fire as we say spike it's sometimes called and then you take sort of a forensic approach a bit later you look back in time and you say you know what was the arrangement of pixels in this random garbage right before this cell fired an electrical potential that's right a spike and then from that you can reconstruct the preferred stimulus yeah right the you can say oh this cell and cells around it seem to like motion of things going in a particular direction for instance and um how do you know know that the cell doesn't also like a bunch of other stuff that you didn't pick up on using this random garbage yeah two things for let let me just say for the record we don't record from these cells that signal Motion in particular directions they are an elusive cell type that is best understood in rodents and other creatures and not well understood in the primate as you know although some people are discovering potential cells of that type now and have have recently discovered them okay so let's say cells that respond to like spots that are red um you know that go from dim red to bright red right yeah so we can go through that colored TV snow and pick out the cells that responded to a transition of the kind you described from darker to lighter or from Greener to redder or something like that cells tend to respond to Transitions in the visual scene rather than static imagery um and so we can pick that stuff out but you asked the question well G is the TV snow gon to capture everything about what these cells are doing that's a really important question that I want to just mention more um quite likely not that's a scientific instrument it's an unbiased way to sample a whole bunch of cells you know first cut look at you know generally speaking what are they up to but that doesn't mean we've really captured their role in natural visual perception because actually you don't go through the World perceiving visual snow you go through the world perceiving objects and meals and mates and targets and all these things right so the study of how the retina responds to more naturalistic visual stimuli uh in my lab and in many other labs around the world is really get getting off the ground now and I would say we have limited understanding um I would say we know that our simple laboratory experiments with the TV snow don't capture the whole story there's more there're about 20 different cell types in the retina we have basic characterizations of seven of them if you count a certain way um we know that there are another 15 or so lurking right behind the curtain that we've started to sample we don't know what naturalistic targets they respond to in the visual life of the animal that's work that's underway exciting interesting work because this we know that the r they got to be there for something one one way to think of it I'm I'm pretty sure you think think of it this way too is that the retina is a highly evolved organ with a lot of evolutionary pressure for it to be efficient to have a small optic nerve sending to the brain it's probably the case that there's no accidental stuff sitting around in the retina that's Vis digal and sending information to the brain it's probably the case that this those signals are are all doing something important for our visual behavior for our well-being for our sleep all sorts of stuff and I think and the field is still trying to figure that out these these are the big Mysteries I think that in terms of the retina what are those signals exactly in all those different cell types what different behaviors and aspects of our life do they control what is the wildest cell type you've ever encountered like what did it do like what did it respond to that's that's what I mean when I say wildest um you know it cells reog gangling cells that respond to you know increasingly red portions of the visual scene or decreasingly green portions of the visual scene like okay cool that seems cool like get some you know around the time of Christmas that that's useful and it's uh useful on other days of the year as well but you know given that the retina is indeed the best understood piece of the brain and given that you have 20 cell types 20 isn't 20 million it's um you know it seems tractable probably gets understanding it in its entirety or understanding them in their entirety excuse me um one would like to know like what what stuff is are we paying attention to at the level of the retina I mean are there like Spiral sells it like Spiral stuff in the environment are there sells it like emojis like what what's going on in there you spent a lot of time doing this we do we SP a l after all you give up two nights sleep which is kind of incredible by the way I'll just do a little uh take a moment here and just say you know for a guy that's been doing this for this long with these sleepless nights um you look pretty good you look pretty resty you I tend to go home I go home before The Graduate students do oh they stay up they stay up I was us to stay up I used to stay up until my mid 40s I was I was in there doing the all nighter type things got it and um maybe you can help me figure out my sleep patterns better yeah yeah we can talk about that this episode we talk about how to pull all nighters and still survive done plenty of those um but yeah like what what's yeah lots at stake here there's a human retina you know meaning a human gave up their eyeballs to for this experiment after they died of you got many people on this these are these sort of experiments um are very expensive um a lot of fancy equipment a lot of salaries to try and figure this stuff out this is the chief mission of the national eye institute there's a lot of tax dollars like this is um in my opinion as important as the Space Program probably more important in my opinion you know restoring Vision to the blind obviously so what are you finding in there yeah and and we have the privilege of being on the front lines of that funded by the National Institute and other in tions to be out there figuring out what's going on in this human retina I'm with you on that so I I'll tell you how we go B it these days there are about seven cell types that we understand pretty well what they're doing they're it's not they're not complicated they just have different properties color size this kind of thing temporal properties their timing of their signals and those seven cell types we understand pretty well but we're trying to really nail down the details why because of neuroengineering for vision restoration then there's another I'm going to say 15 or so and we and the anatomists the people who study the shapes and sizes of the cells have long known that there were more cell types lurking in the retinal circuitry but their function has not been known and because we didn't have many recordings from them we didn't have electrical recordings in response to light that would tell us what they naturally do we've actually had a breakthrough in the last few years led by a senior research in my in my lab named Alexander cing who has figured out that there's another 15 or so cell types lurking in those recordings that if we look more carefully they're there and they have crazy properties and so the crazy properties I can tell you about have to do with the spatial region of the visual world that they respond to the well-known cell types that you know and I know from the textbooks kind of respond to a circular spot in the visual world if there's light in this little circular area they'll fire a spike if there's no light there they don't care well okay some cells is not quite circular some cells respond to the light that's there and and the difference from the light that's around it so if it's brighter than the light that's nearby then you then you get a big response the new cell types are more puzzling than that some of them respond to three or four blobs in the visual world that's kind of strange unexpected definitely unexpected based on the textbooks and the newest ones are weirder yet some of them they're their visual response profiles that is the region of the visual world that they are sensitive to light in almost has a spidery shape almost like the dendrites of a cell like the processes of a cell and some of them have Blobby Light sensitivity they're sensitive to to light increments here and decrements there and increments here and decrements there and some blue light over here and blue light over here we don't understand these cells to be clear the seven that we understand reasonably well well and not trying to just pin down and really nail for vision restoration the sort of first cut at at at cell type specific Vision restoration those ones don't have these weird properties they're a little simpler to understand so we're we're just but we're just working out all the details of the timing of the of the responses and all that these new ones we don't know what's going on with them so we're doing experiments those seven cell types constitute maybe 70% of all the neurons that send visual information from the eye to the brain so we think it's a really solid Target for Vision restoration to work with the simple ones and so so when I when I say that I think that the retina is the best understood circuit in the nervous system I'm talking about those seven cell types which we know a lot about what they do we really do know a lot it's not done but we know a lot I'm not talking about the other 15 cell types which are a minority of the population but seem to be doing very strange and surprising things that are yet to be determined so there it's a mix we know some really good stuff and then there's really some deep Mysteries out there about these other cell types so we've been talking a lot about how to understand the signals that the retina is sending the brain and I know your lab has done incredible work in this Arena and figured out a number of the different signals as you described some of the features that the different cell types are extracting just a moment ago these Blobs of different colors Etc what good is this to you know the everyday person right um What What In addition to wanting to understand how we see you know what sort of sorts of medical applications can this provide in terms of potentially restoring Vision to the blind um but perhaps even larger theme is this notion of neuroengineering right taking this information and creating devices that can help us help our nervous system function better maybe even function at superphysiological levels I know there's a lot of interest in this these days um in part due to neural link right because elon's out there front-facing very vocal about his vision of the no pun intended of you know chips being implanted in people's brains that would allow them to be in conversation with you know 100 people at the same time just by hearing those voices in the head maybe filtering things out so it doesn't sound like a clamor of a hundred different voices um perhaps giving people super memory I mean you know sky the limit no no one really knows where this is all headed you're working in what we call a very strain system where it has specific properties that you're trying to understand and once you understand those you can start to think about real applications of like what's possible like could you create a visual system that um Can extract more color features from the world that no other human can see um can you restore um pattern Vision to somebody who is essentially blind independent on a cane or a dog or you know God forbid can't even leave their house because they can't see anything at all you know where is this headed what is the information useful for and perhaps we should frame that first within the medical rehabilitative context of repairing uh or restoring Vision rather and then get into the more kind of um uh sci-fi type neuroengineering stuff absolutely yeah this this really is my passion these days turning that corner continuing to figure out the mysteries in the retina but also saying wait a second we actually know quite a lot about this shouldn't this be the first place that we can solve problems like restoring Vision restoring function or augmenting our function I think it should be the concept of how to do this is straightforward and not invented by us in any way and that is the following one of the major sources of blindness in uh the Western world is uh loss of the photo receptor cells that capture light macular degeneration and retinitis Pigmentosa are two well-known ailments that give rise to to vision loss and the vision loss is because the cells that capture light in the first place that we talked about earlier die off so you're no longer sensitive to light and then you're blind the concept is that you may be able to bypass those early sections of the retina that capture the light and process the signals and instead build an electronic implant that connects up directly to the retinal ganglin cells and this electronic implant would would do the following it would capture the light using a camera which is relatively easy it would process the visual information in a manner similar to the way that the retina normally does as similar as possible and then it would electrically activate the retinal gangin cells by passing current and causing the gangin cells to fire spikes and send those spikes to the brain and if we do this really well we can essentially replace those first two layers of the retina and piggy back onto the third layer and say okay we're just jumping right into that third layer we're going to force those ganglin cells to send reasonable visual signals to the brain and then the brain is going to think it got a natural visual signal and proceed accordingly that's the concept this is not our idea people have had this concept for decades and some people have even started to make it work in in human patients and what I mean by that is implanting electrodes on the retina stimulating and causing people who've been profoundly blind for decades to see visual sensation blobs and streaks of light in their visual world that that are reproducible so so that's happening now that's happened people who were at once blind yep are able to see objects are able to see crude blobs and flashes of light in ways that allow them to navigate their world better a little bit a little bit avoid a coffee table maybe or at least see a bright window in a dark wall and be able to point to that bright window or the bright doorway in a dark wall something like that so it's a glass half full half empty story that I want to turn that I'd like to turn attention to in this conversation cuz I think it's very exciting um yes you can see stuff by artificially electrically stimulating the ganglin cells and you can see stuff that actually helps you interact with your world a tiny little bit so great that's the glass half full the glass half empty is it's nothing remotely resembling what we understand as naturalistic Vision where we see spine spatial detail and color and objects and can navigate complex environments and all that stuff no chance you can't do anything remot remotely like that you can see that there's a bright doorway over that way and turn toward it which is a helpful step in your Human Experience but there's a long way to go so the question is why does this existing technology fail to give us high quality Vision what what's needed to give us high quality vision and this is the piece I'm really passionate about it turns out that the the devices that have been implanted in humans so far by pioneering bioengineers who did really hard stuff were were fairly simple devices that treated the retina as if it's a camera that is just a grid of pixels and they put a grid of electrodes down there and they stimulated it according to the pixels in the visual world and thought well hopefully that will cause the retina to do the right thing and send a nice visual piece of visual information to the brain and initiate Vision Unfortunately they left the science on the table and this is actually what I'm dedicating the next phase of my career to bringing the science that we know that we talked about to the table for vision engineering and in particular the fact that there are there really are 20 or so distinct cell types and they send different types of visual information to the different targets in the brain I like to think of them a little bit as uh an orchestra playing a symphony each different cell type has its particular score the violins do one thing the obos do something else it's a very organized signal coming out of the retina presenting to the brain this complex pattern of electrical activity that the brain assembles into our visual experience well current retinal implants unfortunately are too crude to do anything like that the the conductor has just scattered the sheet music everywhere and people are playing whatever it's cacophony okay you can maybe recognize a tune in there a little bit sometimes navigate toward a doorway but you're not going to get the full richness of the experience by ignoring the different cell types and I'm so passionate about this in part for reasons that a little bit are similar to your reasons for doing this kind of work that you do which I think is great which is I I feel we have a mission to give back as scientists to take all this stuff we've been talking about because we find it so interesting and cool and to deliver something to the society that has allowed us to explore these fascinating areas and in our case it's in my the case of my lab and what we've done it's to turn around and say wait a second we understand that there's these different cell types we understand a lot about what they do none of this information appears in current epir retinal implants can't we do better by using the science to restore Vision in a way that respects the circuitry of the retina that's what we're trying to do and the mismatch is intense um I I told you when we were adding before that nothing that we have learned about the retina since the founding of the national Eye Institute in 1968 is incorporated into the existing retinal implants nothing we've learned a ton about the retina your research was funded by the national Eye Institute my research is funded by national ey Institute a fantastic organization that allows us to learn all these things how is this showing up in the neuroeng engineering to restore Vision to people well currently it's not and so we're trying to do that now doing that turns out to be hard and maybe we'll talk about that it's a it's a technological feat that's really challenging you have to build a device that you can implant in a human that can recognize the distinct cell types see where they are stimulate them separately from one another and conduct this Orchestra to create a musical score that reasonably closely resembles the natural one that's what we're all about doing and as it turns out and maybe we'll talk about that separately that mission of being able to restore the patterns of activity that the retina normally creates also has extremely exciting spin-offs in three directions one of them is understanding better how the brain puts the signals together that's research for the brain the second one is augmenting Vision creating novel types of visual Sensations that weren't possible before and maybe doing something along the Elon Musk lines of delivering more visual information than was ever possible and third figuring out how to interface to the brain more broadly because as you and I know the structure of the retina is very much representative of the structure of many brain areas and if we're going to figure out how to interface to the visual cortex we darn well bitter figure out how to interface to the retina first that's what we're all about doing in my lab these days is figuring out how to do that well that's a mixed science and Eng engineering effort we've done about 15 years of basic science on that how do we stimulate cells how do we recognize cells how are we going to build a device that does all this and talks to the cells in this way and I can go into lots of gory detail about it um but that's what we've been doing the basic research on and the last few years we've worked at Stanford with um fantastic Engineers from various disciplines electrical engineers material scientists others to figure out how to put together the pieces and build an implant that can do this in a living human so is the idea to build a robotic retina to build a a essentially an artificial retina that could be put into the eye of a blind person or even put into the eye of a sighted person that would fundamentally change their ability to see or in the latter case uh enhance their ability to extract things from the visual world that they would otherwise not be able to see like like seeing twice as far um getting you know hawk-like resolution of the visual World um yep or which that would be cool yep could be distracting yep like I'm not sure I want to see the the fine movements of a piece of paper in somebody's notebook from across a cafe as they flutter the pages um but you might want to for a moment there might be a moment when you want to and if you have an electronic device that you can control that you can dial in to sense different aspects of the visual World Under You Know by by your choice you might be like yeah that's pretty cool I want to be able to do that right now there's an example I like to give which I think maybe is is helpful for interpreting what we're talking about when we say being able to do more things with the optic nerve you gave the example of many voices and stuff here's an example that I like we know that we can drive down the road and have a phone call handsfree and do that quite safely pretty safely right and you're why because you're tapping in you've got two types of signals coming into your brain your visual signal of the cars on the freeway any one of which could kill you in an instant so it's important and the sound coming into your ears which carries the voice of your girlfriend that's telling who's telling you something that you're interested in hearing and these are different parts of the brain processing this information and so you can do both of these things at the same time because there's no interference one part of the brain is working doing one thing another part's doing something else you're good what you can't do is to read your texts and drive down the freeway at the same time that's not good because now that visual system of yours that needs to be detecting these fast moving dangerous objects is being distracted by looking at the text and you might die and some other people might die with you so I see a lot of people texting and driving yeah that's why I like to point out this example to remind people you can't do it well it's like it's like can't do it well you probably talk yeah it used to be you know we'll just take a brief uh tangent here into this topic um a few years back there were there were a lot of news articles a lot of discussion about texting and driving a lot of attention to getting people to stop texting and driving I've seen a few people pulled over for texting and driving before but I would say texting and driving is rampant reading what's on one's phone y while driving is rampant yep all you have to do is be on the freeway here in Los Angeles look in the car next to you yep look where they're looking and people like reading and texting while driving presumably when they're doing that they're just using their peripheral vision to detect any kind of motion and um no doubt this has caused the deaths of many people yeah change lanes get away from them and you know just just like that other driver so so here's the thing um and this is this is uh I say this a bit tongue and cheek but it's it's sort of a real example it may be that if we harness the different cell types in the retina to deliver different visual information to different cell types like the image of the text on your screen to a certain cell type that you know the so-called cells or the motion of the objects in the visual scene the cars to a different cell type cells by the way folks because they're very very small yes and by named by anatomist decades ago so we carry that nomenclature forward sure um and the parasol cells which are different cells that you can potentially encode the movement of the cars in the parasol cells and if those two systems are operating independently which we sort of think they may be from research that you know very well from your extensive studies and vision um maybe we can do those two things safely at the same time now by the way that's not my research goal to text and drive at the same time just to be clear but it's a very tangible real world example of if we do really have parallel Pathways that can be modulated and controlled independently of one another this opens the door to streaming all kinds of visual information in parallel into our very high band with visual systems that wasn't possible during Evolution because we didn't have control over the cell types so I think of that as the world of visual augmentation and it starts to get interesting if the different cell types are behaving in an independent way and when they transmit visual information to the brain now how are we going to figure that out well we need a device that can stimulate the different cells independently and then study that to see whether people can and can do this kind of thing right what's that device the artificial retina the same implant I'm telling you about that can restore Vision to people because it's an electronic device that can up in the activity in the different cell types that same device is what we can use as a research instrument to understand if the different pathways are parallel if the signals interact with one another and explore how the brain receives that information and then we can use that to explore can we augment vision and allow allow ourselves to have new visual Sensations that we don't even know what that would look like we we we don't even understand what it would look like to us to see those Sensations but it might be able to deliver lots of information to our brain and if we can do all those those things then we can take that same set of tools and Engineering Technologies into the brain to access different cell types as well I'd like to just take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors insid tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals now I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact our immediate and long-term health can only be addressed that is can only be measured with a quality blood test now one issue with many blood tests out there is that you get information back about lipid levels hormone levels metabolic factors Etc but you don't know what to do with that information with inside tracker they make it very easy to understand your levels and what they mean and specific actionable items that you can undertake in order to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimal for you insid tracker also offers insid Tracker Pro which enables coaches and health professionals to provide premium and personalized

tracker's plans again that's insidetracker docomo here of of what you've done um you started off with the understanding that the neural retina is perhaps the best place to try and understand how the brain works because of its Arrangement the cell types Etc you spend a number of decades doing these wild experiments um on human retinas and other retinas um recording the different cell types with these highdensity What I Call Bed of nails two and a half decades I'm not that two and a half decades um it's your uh robustness that matters EJ um and you have plenty of it um you figured out what the cell types are so then you gained an understanding of how light is transformed into different types of electrical signals that encode different features in the visual scene then comes the challenge of developing neuroengineering tools to try and stimulate the specific cell types in a way that more or less mimics their normal patterns of activation like not um activating a huge piece of retina so that you know the cells that like increases in redness are also being stimulated with the cells that like you know edges in a way that would create some shoy like crazy representation of the outside world no you want the same Precision that light stimulation of these cells in the intact human eye provides in this explanted retina this retina on this bed of nails but then a device that essentially can mimic what the retina does and you needed to do all that earlier work understanding like what does the normal retina do what does the healthy retina do in order to try and develop this prosthetic device to either restore Vision or because it puts puts you in the position of being able to stimulate cells however you want in theory you could create a situation in a human where the cells that respond to um I don't know outlines of objects are are hyperactive so that you know the person could um effectively see objects in one's environment better than anyone else yeah could perceive I know motion is a tricky one but motion better than anyone else could see detail in the visual world that no one else could detect we're not talking about turning people into mantis shrimp um but the analogy works because mantis shrimp can see things that we can't and vice versa and so what you're talking about here is neural augmentation through the use of engineering yep and we often do talk about it as sci-fi because the Sci-Fi writers have been talking have been you know writing about this for decades it's not sci-fi anymore it's sigh it's straight up sigh right now it's really we just need to build the instrumentation and start working with those experiments to figure out how to make make it work I think we have a responsibility to do this because this is the way we take this kind of information all that's been learned about the visual system by the national Eye Institute since 1968 and all the people that it's funded to do this research and turn the corner and make a difference for Humanity with it and I I assume and think that Humanity will be leveraging nervous system knowledge to build all sorts of devices that we can interface to the world with I think you know I don't know Elon Musk but I think he's right about that that that's where we're headed it should be done well it's important to do it well um we will hopefully be more connected to truth in the world if we're able to build devices that give us better Sensations more acute understanding of what's going on out there better abilities to make decisions and all that let alone just see stuff so that Frontier of developing Technologies to allow our brains and our visual systems initially and then other parts of our brains to do things better is unbelievably exciting it is SciFi but I just want to emphasize I think it's the responsible way to go to think about how to do that well all technologies that we develop can be used for good or for ill and I'm sure some of your listeners who are a lot a lot of very passionate thinking people out there thinking about neuroscience and the implications worry what does this mean we're going to be introducing electronic circuits in our brains to do stuff yeah well we will it's pretty much clear that Humanity will do that and so in any technology development you have to think about well how do you do it well how do you do it for good there there are popular movies right now about technology development such as understanding the structure of the atom and that technology development can be used for good or for ill to blow up cities or to save civilizations how's it going to go well I think I think as scientists we're responsible for advancing that in a thoughtful and meaningful way I think we can do this in the retina it is the place to start it's the and you know you I'm curious what you think actually as a scientist your background is in this field or very close field to mine I know you speak with all sorts of scientists on this podcast um but this is pretty much your field or very close not the neuroengineering part but understanding the retina I'm curious if you agree that this is the place to start doing this stuff the first guest ever asked me a question on this podcast during a guest interview um I think this would be a fun place to both answer and Riff on this a little bit because um first of all I think the retina is absolutely the place to start because we understand so much of what it does what the cell types are but maybe by comparison a different brain region the hippocampus which is involved in the formation of memories and other stuff but formation of memories about what one did the previous day what one did many years ago Etc is an area that I think anytime the conversation about neural Prosthetics or neuroengineering or neural augmentation comes up people think oh wouldn't to be cool to have like a little stimulating device in the hippocampus and then if I want to remember a bunch of information from a page or from a a lecture I just stimulate and then voila all the information is batched in there um while that's an attractive idea I think it's worth pointing out right now that sure there is a pretty decent understanding of the different cell types in terms of their shapes some of their electrical properties of the hippocampus but there is in no way shape or form the depth of understanding about the hippocampus and what the individual cell types do and what the different layers of it do that one has for the neural retina so what we're really saying is if you stimulate the hippocampus you'll likely get an effect but it's unclear what the effect is and it's not clear how to stimulate that's to me the best reason to focus on the retina because you know what the cell types are thanks to the work of your laboratory and many other Laboratories you know what sorts of stimulation matter and it provides the perfect test bed for this whole business of neural augmentation neuro neuroeng engineering I think there's also a bigger discussion to just frame this in which is so much of what we discuss on this podcast with guests and in Solo episodes relates to things like dopamine neur neuromodulator serotonin and everyone is interested in these things because they can profoundly change the way that we perceive and interact with the world but one only has to look to the various Pharmaceuticals that increase or decrease these neuromodulators and know that indeed those Pharmaceuticals can be immensely beneficial to certain individuals I want to be clear about that but that whatever quote unquote side effects one sees or lack of effect over time is because those receptors are like everywhere over the around the brain so you can't just increase dopamine in the brain and expect to only get one specific desired effect so the reason you're here today um is not because we both worked on the retina and it's not because we happen to also be friends it's because uh to my mind your laboratory represents the um Apex of precision in terms of trying to figure out what a given piece of the brain in your case the neural retina does parse all its different components and then use that knowledge to create a real world technology that can actually tickle and probe and um stimulate that piece of the brain in a way that's meaningful right not just like sending electrical activity in and that to me is so important I think if we were going to think about levels of specificity for manipulating the human brain to get it an effect you would say okay crudest would be drugs take a drug increases serotonin which might bind to particular receptors let's take the drugs psilocybin a lot of excitement about psilocybin we know that can lead to increased connectivity between different brain re at rest there's probably there is some demonstrated clinical benefit there's also some potential hazards but it's very broad scale we don't know what's happening when the person is thinking about a uh you know a piece of moss expanding into an image and a memory of their childhood or it's like a million different things are happening there and then at the other far extreme is the kind of experiment that you're talking about stimulating one known type of retinal cell seeing what that means for visual processing or modeling what that means means for visual processing and then building a device that can do exactly that and then maybe ramp it up 20% 50% and because I think that represents the first step into okay how would you stimulate the hippocampus to create a super memory would you stimulate a particular cell type in a particular way and to my knowledge There's You know despite the immense excitement about the hippocampus and understandably so there just isn't that precision and of understanding yet so uh forgive the long answer but you know you ask me a question on on this podcast give you a long answer yeah and it specificity is what you're talking about and we need technology to do that to to modulate neural circuits in a highly specific way we got to start with the piece of the neural circuit we understand best and we have best access to that's the retina it's sitting right there on the surface we can get right into it and in install devices we know so much about it that's the place to start the place that we understand build Electronics that is that is adaptive that senses what circuit it's embedded in and responds appropriately it's not just Electronics you stick in there and it does something and that's it no it it first figures out who it's talking to and then learns to speak the language of the nearb neural circuitry so a smart device smart device let's push on that a little bit so um put a little chip onto the retina that can stimulate specific cell types is there a way that it can use AI machine learning that it can learn something about the tissue it happens to be in contact absolutely in the simplest possible way the device Works in three simple Steps step number one record electrical activity which is what we do in our lab in a room full of equipment but this is a 2mm size chip implanted in your eye record the electrical activity just recognize what cells are there when they're firing what electrical properties they have to identify the cells and cell types in this specific circuit in this human that's step one step two stimulate and record so you figure out oh this electrode activates cell number 14 with 50% probability this electrode activates cell number 12 if you pass a micro amp of current with this probability and so on you make a big table that tells you how these electrodes talk to these cells in your circuit that's step two calibrate the stimulation by stimulation and recording then finally when you have a visual image and you want to represent it in the pattern of activity of these cells you say okay I know from Decades of basic science what these cells ought to be doing with this image that's coming in I know exactly what they ought to be doing that's what the science has been telling us we've been studying the neural code for decades to understand this I know what they should do use my device with my calibration where I know where the cells are I know how the electrodes talk to them and bing bing bing bing bing activate them in the correct sequence that's what I think of as a smart device a device that records stimulates and records and then finally stimulates yes AI is part of that of course it is because this is a very complex uh transformation if you will from the external visual world to the patterns of activity of these cells it's not easy to write down in just a few lines of code or in a few equations it's complicated and AI is really helpful for that and learning by stimulating and recording and aggregating information quickly so that you can then use the device that's absolutely a part of the engineering it let me be clear the AI doesn't help us to understand it's just an engineering tool that helps us to capture what this thing normally does and then go ahead and execute and make it do the thing it should normally do I hope people um will appreciate this example uh perhaps not you know not but goodness I don't know 40 50 years ago but still today uh one treatment for depression is electric shock therapy uh a very you know on the face of it barbaric um treatment but effective in certain conditions it's still used for a reason um but it can appear barbaric right you know people are have like a bite you know a bite device you know so they don't um bite through their tongue or their lips they're you know they're strapped down and they stimulate the whole just like stimulate all neurons in the brain essentially there's a huge dump of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators it's like drugs it's completely non-specific stimulation effectively probably even less specific than drugs maybe and yet the clinical outcomes from electric shock therapy in some cases are pretty impressive like people um the brain is quote unquote reset they still remember who they are um but presumably through the the the release of neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin acetylcholine in a very non-specific way there has been some symptom relief in some cases what you're talking about is really the opposite extreme um you know before I said Pharmaceuticals that tickle a particular neurom modulator pathway would be the opposite extreme I think electric shock therapy is probably the the the most um extreme where is this whole business of neural prosthesis going outside of the visual system like right now um I can imagine that there are little stimulators in the spinal cord for sake of restoring movement to paralyzed people um I realize this is not your field but is are you seeing impressive stuff there um or is it still really really early days there's absolutely impressive stuff uh particularly uh for example people reading out signal from the motor cortex or the language cortex in order to help people to communicate or to move cursors on screens in order to interact with devices these are paralyzed people par yeah excuse me paralyzed people who can't interact with technology the way that we do um and but with their thoughts can send signals through an electronic device that can be used to control a mouse on a screen and have them connect to the internet that's a huge deal to be able to have people do that imagine how life changing would be to be able to communicate if you couldn't before so there are wonderful examples of that you know of them so do I the work of Krishna shinoy and Jamie Henderson at Stanford is one beautiful example over the recent years Eddie Chang doing stuff now uh you know neuralink doing doing this kind of stuff the built on the work of Shino and Henderson and stuff so that's great um you know stimulating in spinal circuits as you said for creating rhythmic movements that's that's happening so this is an enormous space and in each case what you said I think is really highly relevant that electroshock therapy you can think of that as look let's say your computer is not behaving right you can reboot it might work then it'll start not working again then you have to reboot it again well how often do you want to reboot your computer it gets a little inconvenient to be rebooting your computer every five minutes maybe you want to go in and actually diagnose this thing and put in a piece of software that fixes the thing that was going wrong instead of rebooting your computer every 5 minutes right and I think of electric shock therapy a little bit as a reboot um it's that level so we want to intervene more specifically how do you do that well you have to understand the software in order to do that you have to have specificity controlling this thing in your computer not this this this this or this this particular thing that's going wrong you got to interfere with that and change it and modulate it well that's what understanding the neural circuit is about that's what building specific Hardware that can activate specific cells is about that's in in the case of the retina again it's just so obvious that it's right in front of us to do this stuff and it's right in front of us to take us into augmentation to giving us better senses a fun example I like this is it's an interesting topic because the National Institutes of Health that um funds a lot of research that goes in this direction tends to not be interested in augmenting our senses they kind of want to they they draw a line more or less saying look we're trying to restore what we were as humans not create a new kind of human and that's an interesting question because I don't think there is a fine there's an actual line a bright line between those things I don't think there's a bright line between those two things the the finest example I know is that even in the very crudest visual restoration devices you have to actively suppress the infrared sensitivity of your camera to not have infrared vision why because many cameras are sensitive to infrared light so in other words if you don't put an infrared filter in front of your camera you're going to have some infrared vision maybe it won't help you very much whatever I'm just trying to say as soon as you start building devices to restore Sensations building electronic devices augmentation is right around the corner it'll creep up on you real fast so I I think you can't even really draw a line throughout today's discussion we've been thinking of the brain as kind of a the rest of the brain I should say because the neural retina is two pieces of the brain extruded out into the eye Globes during development I like to remind people of that over and over when you're looking at somebody's eyes you are looking at two pieces of their brain um there no debate about that but most people don't realize that you'll never look at anyone the same way again but this is the reason why you can tell so much about people's inner state from their from their eyes somebody who's sleep deprived it's not just about the droopiness of their eyelids or the circles under their eyes there's a there's an aliveness to the eyes the the yogis um talk about um people that sort of show up at the level of their eyes as opposed to sunk back into their brain you know these are very um kind of abstract Concepts but they and there's some very non-abstract stuff these days looking at looking through the eye at the retina the way the op opthalmologists do and there's a lot of diagnostic capability just in those images of the rtina oh right there I'm glad you brought this up there's um some uh interesting and increasing evidence that looking at the neural retina because it is a piece of the brain with neurons that have the potential to both Thrive or degenerate that looking at the neural retina which one can do with these new technologies um can provide a window into um whether or not there are forms of degeneration just such as Alzheimer's and other forms of neurod degeneration deeper within the brain that one can't image directly because of the the thick opacity of the skull right so in other words Imaging the eye in order to determine if someone is developing V in Alzheimer's because you have a direct view into a little piece of the brain it's a it's a good signal it can help you figure stuff out about what's going on in your brain even beyond the sunken eyes absolutely amazing so I think the rest of the brain piece is is also really interesting and maybe here we can go like semi neuro philosophical um you know that there are clearly parts of the brain that are involved in um essential what I call housekeeping functions regulating respiration you know keeping us breathing keeping our heartbeating um digestion um responding to threats in in some sort of basic way like through the secretion of adrenaline and and giving us the potential to move but a lot of the brain is is um capable of plasticity and um one wonders if you were to for instance develop a retinal prosthesis that would allow me to um see with twice the level of detail that I currently can would my adult brain be capable of dealing with that information we're talking about twice as much information coming in same brain tissue on the receiving end can it make sense of it do we have any idea if it can make sense of it are there um are there experiments that speak to that yeah that's a fantastic and interesting question it makes you think about neural development all over again right and I I take some inspiration on that from the work of someone you know Eric nson um who discovered that there is plasticity beyond the period periods of time he discovered many wonderful things but there's plasticity well beyond the period of time that we thought that there was plasticity in certain animals and in particular that if you make gradual adjustments to the sensory world you can exhibit plasticity that you can't see if you make an Abrupt adjustment so plasticity is there it just has to be brought on by more subtle manipulations that take you from A to B in little incremental steps and if you take those incremental steps you can see the adult plasticity so coming to your question is the brain capable of receiving the kind of extra information we provided could be that if we just show up on day one bam try to deliver twice the visual resolution or whatever in your visual your visual system it could be that if we try to deliver twice the visual resolution on day one it won't work you'll see It'll you know it won't look sensible to you but if we gradually introduce it by the way that we're dialing up the resolution we may be able to get there and there are fascinating studies to be done you think about Spike timing dependent plasticity a term that that your viewers may not all know but is a is related to how neurons adjust their strength of connectivity to one another according to the timing of the signals in those cells mechanisms like that tell us wow the brain really cares about the very precise timing of stuff and to the degree that that influences the way that neurons do or don't strengthen their connections to one another it's so fundamental in everything from memory to visual function what have you this relates to fire together wire together although um it highlights the Together part how closely in time do two neurons need to be active in order for them to subsequently increase their connectivity and indeed one of them needs to be active a little bit before the other one in order for it to work optimally right so if it what I what I Envision is that when we have full control of the neural code with an electronic implant that can talk to the cells and do all the things that I said and we can really control the neural code coming out of the retina we can then start to play games and dial up that neural code very slowly and teach the remaining brain how to understand these signals not introduce some crazy thing from day one no just gradually teach isn't that how we do everything well isn't that how plasticity works I love the uh subtlety and the uh rationality of your example because you know so much of what we see in the internet and on the news is like you know chips inserted into the brain to create super memory or uh you know conversations between you know 50 people at the same time without anyone speaking you know just hearing other people's Thoughts by way of um you know neural signals being passed from one to the next but yet another reason why you're here today is because you represent the the the realistic grounded um incremental approach to really parsing this whole thing of how the brain works and how one then goes about um engineering devices to augment the human brain and as you just pointed out it's not going to be done by just sticking electrodes in and stimulating and seeing what happens in fact those experiments were done in the 1960s people like Robert Heath would put electrodes into the brain during neur surgery stimulate and just see what the patient would do or what they reported thinking you know nowadays that's done still but with a lot more precision and intention and we've moved we've moved far beyond that by the way I just want to say those were important first experiments the first thing got to do Keith was was was a rather um let's be honest not not the most Savory character he he embarked on some experiments that um had a social agenda to them and was a pretty pretty uh at least by my read was was not the kind of person I'd want to spend time with to say the least but but you're right those experiments were critical because like electric shock therapy like the formulation of drugs that can massively increase certain neurom modulators or decrease them they LED to some level crude but some level of understanding about how the brain works which is what we're really talking about today yep um but you represent the uh as I said the the astronauts of this astronauts don't go into space and just kind of blast off and see where they end up there's a there's there's math there's physics uh there's computer science sensors cameras right looking where are we about to land here on the moon is there a crater here or not what what's around us we we should sense what's there and then make our decisions accordingly and our electronic implants in the brain really we should make them smart why make them dumb we're smarter than that we can build implants that can sense what's around them and change their patterns of activity accordingly I I use a metaphor sometimes if you go to if you go as an American who doesn't speak Chinese to China and you start yelling in English maybe somebody will to to learn which way to go on the street somebody might understand you at some point and help you out but it's going to be a it's going to be a you know not very effective way to get around it's way better if you speak the language you talk to people and ask ask them where to go so that's what we need to know we need to say look we have the science we have incredible devices we can engineer we have ai now that even helps us to do this query of the outside world and turn it into a smarter instrument make our instruments smart make them so they know how to talk to the brain don't expect that the brain is just going to wrap itself around your your simple electronic device no make a smart device that's what we want to make a smart rental implant maybe we could just take a couple of minutes and talk a little bit about you and the some of the things that have led to your choice to go in this direction so did you always know you want to be a neuroscientist from the time you started college what was your trajectory I should know this but I you were an undergraduate at at Princeton at Princeton that right studying math math so you could have just done all your work with a piece of paper and a pen but you had to try and engineer all these electrodes okay that's a pen and paper pen I took a very random route I studied math as an undergrad I spent a few years running around playing music and traveling living a Bohemian life well tell me more about that oh it was I basically just told you all I'm going to tell following the Grateful Dead no not quite following them but uh it was that was an important part of the story um and important part of your personal development um yes very much so uh free Expression Dance music creative exploratory music all that kind of stuff such a contrast to the the EJ that comes forward when we're talking about the Precision of neural stimulation in in the in specific retinal cell types but I think it's useful for people to hear both young and old like um that uh one's nervous system can be partitioned into these different abilities like go and dance and travel and you you weren't doing anything academic at that at that time no for a few years I wasn't doing that programming computers to make a to make a living and uh then I started I started three different PHD programs at Stanford before I simultaneously no no no in sequence I started in the math PhD program I learned that was not really for me and I started in a in an economics PhD program in the business school there and I realized after after less than a year that was not for me um I worked in a startup company for a while I did a lot of stuff for a few years and took some settling um but then I decided to go into nurse science and there were a couple formative things one is that I had I had gotten a really formative experience as an undergraduate from a wonderful guy called Don ready who taught a introductory Neuroscience course who was really inspiring Mentor um and then when I when I was at Stanford I met Brian wandell my PhD adviser and I was inspired by him I thought I didn't know why he was studying what he was studying but I just knew I wanted to learn from this man and I wanted to study with him I just knew this was this was the person who should be my mentor based on something about him yes C can I ask you about these three PHD programs because I think people here um you know or or see what you're doing and and probably imagine a very linear trajectory but now I'm hearing you you like tour it around playing music then you start a PhD program nope then another one nope then another one without getting into all the details I mean were there nights spent lying awake thinking like what am I going to do with my life or did you have the sense that you knew you wanted to do something important you just hadn't found the right fit for you like how how much anxiety on a scale of 1 to 10 10 being total panic um did you experience at at the Apex of your anxiety in that kind of wandering am I allowed to go above 10 like turning up the amp to 11 sure I just think it's really important for people to hear whether or not they want to be scientists or not this idea that people that are doing important things in the world uh in my view um um rarely if ever understood that that's the thing that they were going to be doing there was some wandering about that sure seems like it doesn't it yeah I I I experien the same when I talk to other people and it seems like that and for sure for me uh it just took a while of trying different things to see number one what I was really good at and where I felt I could make a difference and it and I realized um I studied math and I was okay at math but I know I I have known mathematicians who are really talented gifted mathematicians the one who really make a difference I wasn't going to be one of those people likewise playing music I don't have that intrinsic Talent it's fun I can play songs in front of people and do stuff I like it and stuff like that but I don't have that kind of talent in fact I'll say something that that I say to friends sometimes and you're a good friend of mine if I had the talent to get a few thousand people on their feet dancing by playing music I'd probably just do that really as long as we've been friends I knew none of this I like knew none of this mostly because I think we always end up talking about Neuroscience or other aspects of our life yes um but I I didn't know I know I know a great many things about you but I had no idea it's so interesting um do you still do dance we had Eric Jarvis on the podcast by the way Professor Rockefeller who studies um at one point was studying um uh Speech in so in Birds um and song in Birds and then he's done a great many other things now in genetics of of vocalization and you know he actually uh danced with or was um about to dance with the Alvin ay Dance Company it's like a really really talented dancer um and so you know dance seems to be like a theme that comes up among the Neuroscience guests on this podcast do you still dance yeah I love to dance I'm a free form dancer I don't I'm not a skilled dancer but I love I love music I love dancing I think it's part of the human spirit I someday will understand the Neuroscience behind dancing Dan in right dancing is a universal human thing in all cultures what is this dancing thing why do we do this and other creatures don't well Jarvis thinks that um perhaps it's one of the more uh early forms of language and that song came before spoken language it's sort of interesting that birds that um can actually recreate human speech oftentimes have the ability to dance as well oh wow um and and so there's some commonality of circuitry there we'll provide a link to that episode jar really I would love to hear that I mean I but if I may I just I'd like to Riff on that in a different in a different way um I did spend some time wandering around as many people do um and I think particularly for your young listeners and viewers who don't know wow you know could I ever be a scientist and develop new things stuff like that yes you can and if you're messing around your life trying this trying that trying the other thing definitely stick with it keep looking for the thing that works for you I I really deep believe that you got to play around you got to find what it is that works for you interestingly enough at least it's interesting for me I I spent a lot of years studying the retina in a pure basic science just curiosity driven research way as you and I have both done in the past um and as it turned out I learned all the stuff I needed to know about the retina to do to develop a high fidelity adaptive retinal implant of the type that I'm talking about in that process the technology the stimulation recording figure out the cell types how do you stimulate all stuff I learned all that stuff and I have come to a point in my life where I realize wow if somebody's going to do what I think needs to be done which is to take everything we've learned about the retina and instantiate that in in smart technology that can restore vision and do all the things we've been talking about who who are the people in the world who have the right training and background and knowhow to do that stuff I I'm one of them I I know that and it's totally by chance that I picked up and learned or it seems by chance that I picked up and learned the things that I need to know for this so but but I'm I definitely have the right knoow to do this based on all my training and the research that I've done and it feels accidental sometimes I look back on my own history I'm like how did I get here where this is obviously the thing I need to do was this this on purpose it didn't seem like it was on purpose but now I got to do this because I know what needs to be done and it's something that needs to be done so that's that's my mission for the you know coming decade or so wild I I mean I knew you had this engineer matthy uh geeky Neuroscience I don't want to say geeky cuz I'm well because it makes it sound like I'm not right there in the same same uh raft with you but but I didn't know about this more free-spirited um move in all directions depending on what one feels the moment dancing uh EJ it's very cool um are you still a a absolute level 11 coffee snob yes okay yeah I used to go to meetings and um EJ would bring his own coffee maker and coffee to to meetings we're not talking about an espresso machine we're talking about like extreme levels of coffee snobbery press pot the correct ground coffee correct kind of press byot good good good I I expect nothing less uh proof that um not all circuits in the brain are neurop plastic nor should they be that's right but to bridge off of that in a more serious way um despite the the free you know free exploration aspect to yourself and and that hopefully other people don't suppress um it seems like you you really are um good at develop like knowing your taste like it seems like the the I think it was the great Marcus Meister a colleague of ours who you know has also worked on the neural retina extensively of course once said you know that there's a coding system in the brain that leads to either the perception the the feeling of um yum yuck or me and that so much of life is being able to register that in terms of who you interact with and how and um the the choices of problems to work on it seems like you have a very keen sense of of like yes that and you move toward that you've always been very goal directed um since the time I've known you so and and you've picked such a a a huge problem but going about it in in such a precise way hence the the analogy to the space space mission so um like when you experience that um may ask is it does it come about as like a thought like oh yeah that has to be the thing or is it like a whole body sensation what a great question I love that question I have two things to say to that the first is that for me it's all it's all feeling I I don't make hardly any decisions out of thoughts I think I process I put it all into the hopper and the hopper comes out and spits out a feeling and feeling's like yeah that's the thing to do 100% And I know not everybody's like me lots of people aren't like me and particularly lots of scientists aren't like me that you know so but but I definitely roll that way that is absolutely how I work there's there's something that's related to that that I think is you know philosophically in terms of personal development and Spiritual Development stuff I think is quite relevant that I think you'll you'll relate to my favorite aphorism is know thyself the Oracle and I I think because if you don't know yourself you can't do anything you don't even know where to go you can't even you know Orient yourself at the next thing in your life and I think it deserves to have um two Aries that go with it or aenda uh know thyself be thyself which is not easy it's not easy to really be yourself in this world there are all sorts of things telling us to be something other than what we are and the third one is love thyself and it's you know having gone through much exploration of yourself and your life and your values and my and me too and all the things we've talked about over time that's not easy some of us are not necessarily programmed to love ourselves and uh it's a skill I and I really I try my best to be with those three things all the time know thyself be thyself love thyself could you elaborate a little bit more on your process for the third I this is a concept that um has been very challenging for for me and I think for many other people um and it gets um kind of opaque when it starts getting complete with like self-respect and and Etc like like loving thyself do you have practices um do you meditate um do you Journal do you spend time um trying to cultivate a love for self yeah yeah I'm I meditate in an informal way in the morning with my coffee every morning I make a fantastic cup of coffee and I sit with it I believe you for five or 10 minutes and take in my world as it's coming toward me and start to be as I as I come into the day and come into Consciousness I I I meditate like that and I have a aanga related yoga practice many of you many of your viewers and listeners will know about Ashtanga Yoga it's a very physical spiritual traditional yoga practice that has a deep meditative and breath Focus component I know you've had lots of episodes and discussion about the breath and the importance of that for awareness um you know at the end of a of many Western Yoga practices you end with Namaste which is expressing your respect and for the connectedness of what is in front of you to the whole universe and what's common to all of us and everything and I usually practice yoga by myself and when I say namaste at the end of my yoga practice a part of that is to myself earlier when I asked you about how you guide your decisions you said it's all feel and you provided a beautiful description as to how and why that occurs for you and your trust in that I don't recall you saying whether or not the feeling is in your head or it's a whole body feeling does it have a particular signature to it that you'd be willing to share is it excitement that makes you want to get up and move or is it a a Stillness I think I I ask because we've been talking throughout today's episode about you know the Precision of neural coding and these signals that are at the level of individual cells and And yet when it comes to feeling we actually have a a pretty crude map and certainly a deficit in language to explain what this feeling thing is and I I know that people experience life and feelings differently but I think it's often insightful when somebody uh with your understanding of the nervous system and yourself can share a bit like what does it feel like I love that question and it relates to something you said to me years ago uh what it feels like uh is ease and I remember years ago when we were talking about challenging things that each of us was facing in our lives you said to me something like I I wish for you some ease with all of this it was very um moving touching as that's what a good friend does is to give that to somebody to who they love and um um and it sticks with me probably 10 years later so um the feeling I feel when I'm on the path that makes sense for me is ease it's there's just nothing it's just okay this is it I love that I don't actually recall that specific conversation because we had many many conversations sitting in your yard in San Diego on those plastic chairs with your um with my Bulldog Costello hanging out by the way folks EJ knew Costello my Bulldog Master very well and he was not a huge fan of dogs prior to meeting Costello but um Costello flipped him he he became a at least a Costello lover I love Costello I'll never forget him yeah he embodied ease he did nothing but sleep and eat uh he he embodied um energetic efficiency and everybody loves him everybody who gets to be in the same room with him loves him the people I just spoke to in your setup here your colleagues you know yeah I could see why and you have a beautiful photo of him hanging there yeah yeah he's a what a creature a great great memory definitely embedded in my nervousness I often choke up when I think about but I I want to be clear because I've already cried once about him on a different podcast I don't want to do that today they're not tears of sadness it's this crazy thing like I love him so much I just kind of want to explode so damn it costell got me again and publicly again so he's someplace laughing so I I love that um and I think if um if I made you know do you think it's worth kids and adults learning to recognize those those kind of States those signals that tell them they're on the right path by paying attention to I don't know this like like we said there's sort of a deficit of language like eases in the body eases in the mind it's the release of I mean you know it's not even worth exploring verbally because it's a is such a whole body whole nervous system thing yeah I I I feel like I I actually was thinking about I was giving advice to a young fellow who uh is applying to graduate school recently and had a zoom call with him about stuff and he had received some good advice from some other people and then I gave him some advice and I saw him and speak and emote and with body l language drop into like oh yeah that makes sense yeah that that feeling of course kind of the of course and I think if you can teach people to do that I don't know if the verbal communication of that is going to like you said is that going to do anything but can you at least observe it in them as a teacher as a mentor and do things and when you know when you've done it because you see them drop into ease do you think you can detect ease in people by looking at them and seeing their body body language and everything it's it's got to be an amalgum of different things that the Cadence of their breathing their pupil size it's not worth dissecting this is an experiment I would not want to run yes right I wouldn't want to bring people into a laboratory and figure out you know what pupil of the eye Dynamics combined with certain rhythms of breathing relaxation of the shoulders because it's too beautiful for that is it's too beautiful and it's it's too nuanced and um it's different when we're in Motion versus when we're lying down it's like I mean science is capable of a great many things but I don't think needs to be pointed at every aspect of Human Experience I think they um some of these things are are simply worth allowing to just be do you feel the same way about when you when you have a feeling about a person you meet somebody and their energy just captures you it's like wow what a cool person what what amazing energy do you want to know the science behind that I don't no I don't I think the the word that comes to mind when I experience somebody like that or something like a animal or you see something the movement of something or a beautiful piece of music or something is uh the word just behold yeah I just want to stop and and take in as much of it as possible and here's something I know you've done but I'm checking to make sure I really got this right because I've done it too because we sometimes get human retinas for doing our experiments the first thing that happens when we get the human retina we bring it back to our lab it's a big production everybody's getting ready to go a whole bunch of moving Parts going on we have to open up the eye and look into it to see what condition it's in and it's typically on with a dissecting scope on a chair and it's open sitting on a chair dissecting scope looking down look into the eye it is so beautiful it it's breathtaking each time I've looked at the retina I don't know how many times each time wow this is what's initiating all the visual experiences I've ever had in my life or that person ever had in their life right and the beauty just keeps coming I love it and I love it because you're talking about a behold moment that isn't just to entertain your curiosity sure it's that you want to understand how the brain works um but also a behold moment that leads from that desire to understand to a deep level of understanding now after you know more than two decades of exploration to a mission in service to humanity restore Vision to the blind develop neuroprosthesis and other types of neuroengineering technologies that will allow the human brain to function better than it would otherwise so there's real purpose there too so it uh represents kind of a perfect ecosystem of it's not just about delighting in something and and um and spending one's time there there's a real there's a real Mission there so um I love it well EJ Dr cheski uh Dr huberman I rarely get called that these days um when I invited you here today I was absolutely sure that uh our listeners and viewers were going to get a absolutely worldclass explanation of how the nervous system works and the the retina and the visual system in particular and um that it would be delivered with the utmost Clarity which it was so thank you I know there's been so much learning in and around that and you beautifully framed for us what that means in terms of the larger understanding of how the nervous system works and what you and other Laboratories are now in a position to really do with that information and the technologies that are being built and that will be built and you know the purpose in bringing you here today was was just that but not that alone um you know I think we hear so much about the brain and how it works and everyone wants to have tools and protocols to function better but um it's clear that the work that you're doing is headed in a Direction that's going to vastly expand the possibilities for sake of treating human disease and and for expanding Human Experience I'm I'm certain of that what I did not expect however was that when I wrote down one bullet point well actually two I wrote still a coffee snob question mark the answer is yes um and yoga you know that we would end up in territory where you would share some of your experience that I myself was not aware of about this um a bit of a Wandering um of three different PHD programs and of this um cultivation of an intuitive sense of of beauty and taste and preference that the way you described it takes you out of your rational mind and into the aspects of your nervous system that just really act as a compass toward what is absolutely right for you and we're all so lucky that what's absolutely right for you turns out to also be what's absolutely right and beneficial for the world so thank you for coming here today thank you for sharing your knowledge and your heart and for doing it with um such an incredible degree of of openness and respect so

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Cal Newport Dr Cal Newport is a professor of computer science at Georgetown University he did his training at MIT and he is currently both a professor and the author of many best-selling books focused on producct ity focus and how to access the specific states of mind to bring out your best in terms of cognitive performance and indeed in terms of performance in all Endeavors one of his more notable books is entitled deep work rules for focused success in a distracted World deep work is a book that has had tremendous positive influence on my work life and indeed my life in general because it spells out how exactly to go about doing one's best possible work for me that's in the context of Science and podcasting But it includes tools that I and many others have extended to other aspects of their life as well and it's a book that I highly highly recommend everybody read Cal also has a new book out now it's one that I'm currently reading entitled slow productivity the Lost Art of accomplishment without burnout and as the title suggests it gets into specific protocols to avoid burnout and to bring about one's highest quality work over the greatest amount of time today's discussion starts off with extremely practical steps that any and all of us can use in order to enhance our level of focus productivity and creativity Cal shares much of his specific practices and also offers some alternative practices for those of you that perhaps do not want to disengage with social media or with smartphones or with email to the extent that he does I found the conversation to be extremely useful in the sense that I indeed am on social media I use email I use my phone and text in quite often so I'm not somebody who's willing to completely disengage from those tools but I share in the sentiment that those tools can often be an impediment to doing one's best work so today's discussion gets into not hard and fast rules for enhancing focus and productivity but a variety of different tools that you can select from in sort of a buffet to suit your particular needs we also of course discuss the specific research studies around focus and distraction task switching and context switching all of which support the specific protocols that Cal offers so whether you're somebody who has issues with attention and focus or whether you're somebody that's just feeling overly distracted by the number of things in your email inbox or the number of text or what's happening out in the world by the end of today's episode I'm confident that you will be armed with the best science supported tools that is protocols in order to access the states of mind that will enable you to do your best possible work before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Helix sleep Helix sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are of the absolute highest quality I've spoken many times before on this podcast about the fact that quality sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance and to get the best possible night's sleep it's absolutely key that your sleeping surface that is your mattress suit your specific needs Helix understands this and they developed a brief two-minute quiz in which you can match your body type and sleep preferences that is whether or not you sleep on your back your side or your stomach whether or not you tend to run hot or cold in the middle of the night perhaps you don't know the answers to those questions that's okay you answer the questions in that brief two-minute quiz and they match you to the specific mattress ideal for your sleep needs in my case that was the dusk DS mattress I started sleeping on a dusk mattress well over 3 years ago and it has significantly improved my sleep and as a consequence I feel more focused and alert I'm better able to do all the things that I need to cognitively physically throughout the day so if you're interested in upgrading your mattress simply go to helixsleep.com huberman take that brief two-minute quiz and they'll match you to a customized mattress ideal for you you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order and two free pillows again go to helixsleep.com huberman for up to $350 off and two free pillows today's episode is also brought To Us by Maui Nei venison Maui Nei venison is the most nutrient-dense and delicious red meat available I've spoken before on this podcast and there's General consensus that most people should strive to consume approximately one gram of protein per pound of body weight now when one strives to do that it's important to maximize the quality of that protein intake to the calorie ratio because you don't want to consume an excess of calories when trying to get that one gram of protein per pound of body weight Maui venison has an extremely high quality protein to calorie ratio so it makes getting that one gram of protein per pound of body weight extremely easy it's also delicious personally I like the ground venison I also like the venison steaks and then for convenience when I'm on the road I like the jerky the jerky is a very high protein to calorie ratio so it has as much as 10 grams of protein per jerky stick and it has something like only like 55 calories so again making it very easy to get enough protein without consuming excess calories if you would like to try mauii venison you can go to mauii venison huberman to get 20% off your first order again that's Mau venison docomond to get 20% off today's episode is also brought To Us by ju ju makes medical grade red light therapy devices now there's one theme that I've consistently put forward on this podcast it's the powerful role that light has on our mental health physical health and performance ju makes medical grade devices that emit both red and near infrared light red and near infrared light is so-call long wavelength light and it's it's able to penetrate deeper into tissues than shorter wavelength light like blue and green lights those red and near infrared long wavelength lights have been shown to be beneficial for everything from skin Health to wound healing to Eye Health and even for mitochondrial Health what sets ju apart from other red light and near infrared light devices is that they are clinically proven to emit the specific wavelengths at the specific intensities required to achieve specific biological effects personally I use the ju handheld light both at home and when I travel it's only about the size of a sandwich it's very convenient to use I also have a ju whole body panel and I use that about three or four times a week if you would like to try ju you can go to jv.com huberman ju is offering an exclusive discount to all huberman lab listeners with up to $400 off select ju products again that's ju jv.com huberman to get $400 off select ju products and now for my discussion with Dr Cal Newport Dr Cal Newport welcome Dr huberman good to see you I'm a huge fan I've been a huge fan ever since I read deep work I can't say that I've adopted all the principles but that's on me not you you provide incredible incentive for y1 ought to pursue deep work and slow productivity in service to high quality true productivity Etc um some of the protocols as we'll call them are incredibly easy to implement me others take some discipline so I'd like to talk about both sets today but the first question I have is um do you own a smartphone I do have a smartphone yeah well here's the thing I don't use social media so it turns out smartphones aren't that interesting if you don't have any social media apps on it yeah what's that like so there's there's nothing if you have nothing that is engineered to try to grab your attention the smartphone actually goes back to 2007 Steve Jobs keynote address smartphone which is this is a really nice phone and your music you can listen to things on it and uh the phone interface is really good and look there's a Maps app and you can like look at maps on it like it's actually a useful piece of technology that you're happy to have but uh you don't use it that much what about text messaging do you text message and if so do you get into conversations by text or is it more of a a plan and meet type tool uh I try right so so I try I do use text messaging I mean this is how like my wife gets in touch with me uh but I'm notorious somewhat among my friends of my the ability to capture my attention with text messages really hit or miss because I'll go hours without looking at my phone so it's not this default appendage I think for a lot of people if you know someone you can basically assume like look if I text them they're going to get right back to me H my problem is I'll go two three four hours you know without looking at my phone and then there'll be text messages on there from conversations that people were trying to start and I typically just have to declare text bankruptcy a few times a day like like if they really needed me I guess they would have called so I do text but uh I'm not considered to be very good at it a few other questions about your phone practices this makes me nervous um is your phone in a drawer on on the desktop um while you're working is it face down face up is the ringer on is it off Oh you mean if I'm writing or it's nowhere near me yeah I it could be anywhere it's just not GNA be anywhere near me so I have in my house uh two different offices basically right so there's a home office the printers there the filing cabinets are there like the nice big monitors there you pay taxes that type of thing then I have a library uh and there's no permanent technology in the library no computer in there no monitor no printers nothing like this I had this sort of custombuilt desk I had made by a company from Maine that makes desks for college libraries like that's what they do so I had this like custom fit desk to fit into uh it's not that big of a space that's where I go to write I'm surrounded by books that I've really carefully cured ated what's where each shelf like what type of book it has on it so I can look different ways for different Inspirations I got a fireplace so I can just turn on a fire if I need it I'll bring my laptop in there to write if I'm going to write on a computer and my phone doesn't come in there yeah you don't you don't look at you don't look at a phone in that room and it just helps me it's a ritual right if I'm in there I'm thinking I'm creating with the sort of same patterns of cogitation that we would have been using for hundreds of years when people have been thinking professionally if I want to be near a printer and I want to go on to a web browser and pay my taxes or whatever I have a different place for that I'm curious about the fireplace I have this Theory based on my understanding of visual neuroscience and the fact that when we're looking at visual scenes that have some degree of predictability to them yeah um we get into a mode of anticipation our thinking is at least somewhat linear um and so forth when we are looking at say ocean waves or um up in a skyscraper we're staring down at the street of say New York City and the cars are moving in obviously not random fashion but at least to our visual perception pseudo random you're not tracking any one thing that the the Mind goes into this sort of um state where our thoughts become nonlinear they're not anchored to any kind of if then kind of what I call DPO duration path outcome kind of trajectory there's not a lot Neuroscience on this but there's a little bit same thing happens when you're looking at an aquarium by the way um so I wonder whether or not staring at the fire which is something that humans have been doing for many many many thousands of years um because it has that uh random aspect to it does it tend to spark creativity linear thinking at what point in your writing do you turn to the fire and stare at it that's interesting actually that there's a a neurological explanation when I use to fire is actually when I read right so a chairs by the fire but I think for exactly this reason right because when I'm reading I'm looking to spark ideas right like okay what am I what's my take away from this what's the connection you're making between this thing you're reading here and this idea over there that type of connection making is a lot of my brainstorming and I read by the fire when the weather allows it uh I also walk a lot so I wonder if there's something similar going on like when I'm trying to work through an idea for an article or a math proof or something like this almost always I'm going to do that on foot and there might be something similar going on there where you're encountering it's not entirely exotic stimuli right so it's not oh my God you know my attention is being drawn but it's you you don't you don't quite know what you're going to see and you also have that that circuit quieting effect of the walking your motor neurons are going you can tell me if I'm getting this right or not are abolutely the motor neurons are going and you get some inhibition going on in some of these these key networks which allows you to actually um maintain the the the internal focus on a concept a little bit better so I do a lot of my original focused ideating on foot but a lot of my serendipitous ideating will be with the fire going right it's a win I read by the fire and so when I read that I get a lot of my original ideas I have this theory that the two opposite states of mind that both facilitate creativity and productivity look something like this and you can tell me whether or not this Maps anything that that you know one is just as you described our body is in motion um could be running walking might even be in in the shower or something of that sort uh but we aren't trying to direct our mind toward a specific linear trajectory or outcome it's not it's not like working out an equation or a theorem um the same way we would if we were at a piece of paper or writing out a sentence a structured paragraph So it's body and motion mind not channeled toward one specific Target um the opposite extreme to me is body still mind very active um which resembles rapid movement sleep when we learn a lot and neural rewiring occurs and dreaming but uh for which there's also a lot of examples of very accomplished um creatives using that sort of thing of meditative like um approaches you know forcing oneself to be still and thinking so it sounds like you incorporate both um and I'm curious as a computer scientist who writes code does theorems does a lot of math where you can't just kind of wing it yeah um there's a right and wrong answer uh involved what is your mode for sitting down and working through something that's linear and hard yeah that it's interesting the way you talk about it right because when I'm walking uh and this is actually something you can train you know and I talked about this one of my books once that you can actually train yourself to uh maintain your internal eye of focus more stably while you're walking right so I called this productive meditation in deep work actually uh and I I practiced this in grad school right okay so so I'm going to work on a particular problem while I walk and then you actually practice bringing your attention back to the central problem and it I don't know exactly what's happening but you get a little bit more uh facility working with your working memory a little bit more efficiency with bringing stuff in and out of the working memory and so I trained myself that I could actually write a couple paragraphs in my head maybe not word for but basically word for word like figure out how I'm going to do it or uh figure out enough steps of a math proof to capture like a key Insight like okay I know I'm going to get around this then you have to sit down and actually formally capture that and yeah for me that's still working with notebooks though when I was coming up in grad school and I was just Excavating these thoughts recently we were talking before the we recorded that you know I just wrote this essay about what I learned as a grad student that impacted all my writing uh as a grad student in the theory group at MIT which was just purified concentration this is where all the Deep work ideas come from right I mean it was just worldclass concentrators there the method was very still more than one person whiteboard so if you have two or three people staring at the same whiteboard you're actually going to up the level of concentration you achieve because if you let your attention wander you disengage that attention there's a social capital cost because now I've fallen out of the the Whiteboard effect discussion that's going to be a problem so you actually maintain your focus at a higher level and then when someone else is making their move okay you know what about this and they're working math it's all math on the board you're giving that the highest attention you're capable of because you want to keep up right you don't want to fall behind so it was like this Hack That was figured out in the theory group that if you put two or three people at the same whiteboard that try to alchemize these insights into actual mathematically precise proofs you get a 20 30% boost in your concentration level and and that could make all the difference right if you're working on a very hard proof 20 30% boost could be the difference between solving it or not in one of these situations where you're at the Whiteboard chalkboard and there two other individuals facing it are they interrupting you or is the um etiquette uh in that scenario to just let the person go until their natural yeah uh inclination to raise a hand and and scream help whoever has the marker on the board they're the ones talking so you go okay what about this you say and now you're working you're writing down equations or drawing your diagram and everyone is just watching and then when they're done everyone steps back and looks at it then you can step forward okay but what if we did this and then and you still work on it so so when I got uh built some offices or worked out some offices near my house like one of the first things we put in there was a whiteboard so they could have computer science collaborators come because we can't work on Theory otherwise like it is the thing we need is a whiteboard right when I started grad school they had just built this new $300 million Frank Gary design building for the computer science artificial intelligence laboratory and the Linguistics but half of it was computer science I know those buildings cuz the peow and the McGovern NeuroScience Center and those buildings are very interesting people should check them out if they're ever in Cambridge Kendall Square stop the status Center yeah right down the street from the K sop yeah so the sixth floor was where the theoreticians were this is where I was uh so I you know they opened that building the year I started my the doctoral program and what did they want to show me when they when they brought me to this $300 million Building look at our whiteboards that's what they were proud of they had filled the common space on the sixth floor the theory floor with these uh freestanding double-sided whiteboards it was like a maze of whiteboards and this is what everyone was so excited about was yeah look at our whiteboard coverage surrounded by a 3 million meal I Tred I was trying to explain this to someone recently uh having good whiteboards to us as like an astronomer saying look we got this great radio telescope like this is going to allow us to get data to work on that we wouldn't otherwise have access to I think to a theoretician uh that's why you see a whiteboard because you know if you want to think at the very highest level you need two or three people staring at the same thing taking turns with the marker pushing each other past where they're comfortable I love this because I often think about visual maps that represent our internal memory stores and plans etc for productivity I've always relied heavily on the on the Whiteboard I getting one for home I have one here in the podcast studio all of my podcast notes for my solo episodes are distilled down to four 8 and 1 half by 11 notes which are photographs of the the Whiteboard yeah and um I don't use a teleprompter um that's I've been accused of using one before I don't even know how that would work um but um it's extremely useful to use the Whiteboard and I think because um ideas are so easily put up there and removed um there's something about uh writing on things that are vertical as opposed to on a flat surface I really because that's actually the way our visual perception casts things we don't cast visual perception onto the ground we're used we experience the visual world mostly in front of us I think the cognitive map and the visual map are inextricably linked for at least for cited folks um so I I think there's really something there so um in the absence of colleagues to sit there and boost our attention by 25 to 30% um what could one do do you have a you said you have a whiteboard at home I certainly use the Whiteboard do you um work on it the same way you would in those early days just with in the absence of of colleagues looking on yeah yeah so you work on it just like someone's there uh the other half is using really good notebooks that's always made a big difference for me paper notebooks paper notebooks yeah yeah though though recently I've been messing around with a remarkable which is one of these digital notebooks where it's eink technology so it's like a Kindle but you can write on it uh but you have endless pages on it so I've been messing around with that recently but I remembered when I was a postto for example I found it recently I went and bought a lab notebook because those are expensive at least for a postto right they're like $70 because a lab notebook has have archival quality paper it's bound it's bound yeah people might not realize this lab notebooks need to be kept for many years yes you uh you're not supposed to tear Pages out of them and so they tend to be bound so if you have terrible handwriting like I do you just have to deal with it yes you can't rip it out and it's thick thick paper assd free archival paper big sturdy covers um but I bought this because I thought okay look I'm going to take it more seriously because I think that's also part of what goes on with the Whiteboard is your mind thinks about writing on uh the big vertical space as a a public crystallization of thoughts I'm putting this up for people to see even if there's no one actually there to see it and so you take it more seriously right if I'm writing on a a whiteboard in class I'm not just going to put up nonsense like I'm gonna be very careful about what I'm writing because you imagine there's an audience this is something for other people to see and so you get a little bit of a similar effect if you have a very nice notebook you think look I don't want to waste pages and somehow that helps with the thinking so then I found this notebook because I store my old notebooks in my closet so I found it when I was working on a recent book I found it I went through it right and then I started ticking off uh this turned into a paper this turned into a grant this notebook I used it for maybe two years only used maybe about half the pages it's all very careful neat script and diagrams I think I found seven different peer-reviewed papers or funded grants where the core ideas were in this notebook so it's like that $70 was a an incredible investment because when I when I got to work in that notebook it must have been pushing my thinking to a new level because it was an incredible concentration of actual publishable results were coming out of his Pages yeah it seems like we would all do well regardless of our field um to have some very low Bar Method of capture where if we just have an idea that spontaneously comes to mind that we can capture that in a voice memo or um dare I say in a a phone uh notes segment but then something as you're suggesting like a a whiteboard um like a bound notebook where the moment we look at it it brings about a level of seriousness yeah to our to our thinking and to our actions so like this is different than just um texting um I what we're really talking about our our kind of layers of sophistication um but not in a snobby way in terms of um highest productivity and quality to kind of um I don't know bubble gum wrapper on on the floor type levels of quote unquote productivity well I mean I become a fan of this idea of having specialized capture for specific type of work so for example I'm a big believer in pretty quickly you want to capture ideas in the tool you use to do that work so when I have ideas for an article or a book I'm going to go write the scrier which is uh specialty this is specialty software writers used to write right I want to go right to a scrier project and start putting these in the research section of that scrier project when I'm working on a math or computer science thing I might work out proof ideas on paper but I pretty quickly want to get that into a latch document so so the markup language that you use for doing sort of like applied math papers right the the the tool we use to actually write papers I'm going to move an idea into there as soon as I can I'm going to move proofs out of a notebook and into formally marked up like you would for a paper you know as soon as I would so this idea this is something I've been leaning to more is capture the notes in the tool you're going to use take out the middleman in some sense right so it's it's a reducing friction but also puts you in the right mind space like okay this idea I'm going to put it where I'm going to need it later as opposed to a more elaborate third party system that you construct that you then later pull everything out of as needed uh this is what I've been doing more recently let's just get straight to the tool I'm eventually going to use with maybe a high quality notebook intermediary if I'm actually literally working out thoughts so math you have to work out thoughts but I'll get that into an actual paper format pretty quickly tell me what you think of um this what I always call protocol if I want to learn something from a manuscript I read or a book chapter yeah I used to highlight things and I had a very elaborate um extracted from my University days system of stars and exclamation marks and underline that mean a lot to me that can yes bring me back to a given segment within the chapter but a few years ago I was teaching a course in the biology department at Stanford and for some reason we had them read a study about information retention and um and I learned from that study that one of the best things we can do is read information yeah um in whatever form a magazine research article Etc book um and then to take some time away from that material maybe walk maybe close one's eyes maybe leave them open doesn't matter and just try and remember specific elements how much does one remember then go back to the material and look at it and I've just been um positively astonished at how much more information I can learn when I'm not simply going through motor commands of just underlining things and highlighting them but stepping away and thinking okay yeah they I don't oh I don't remember how many subjects there were I'll go back and check that maybe make a note and okay they did this then they did that and then like and then it's crystallized and and when as I say this I realize of course this should work this is the way that the brain learns um but somehow that's not the way we are taught to learn yeah well I'm smiling because I when I was 22 uh I wrote this book called How to Become a Straight A Student right and the whole premise of the book was I'm going to talk to actual college students who have straight A's uh and who don't seem completely ground out right like not burnt out and I'm just going to interview them right and the protocol was uh how did you study for the last test did you study for how did you take notes for the life so I was just asking them to walk through their methodology the core idea of that book was active recall that was the core idea that replicating idea way used to say is replicating the information from scratch as if teaching a class without looking at your notes that is the only way to learn and and the thing about it was it's a tradeoff uh it doesn't take it's efficient doesn't take much time but it's incredibly mentally taxing right this is why students often avoid it it is difficult to sit there and try to replicate and pull forth okay what did I read here how did that work it's it's mentally very taxing but it's very time efficient right if you're willing to essentially put up with that with that pain um you learn very quickly and not only do you learn very quickly you don't forget it's almost you have a pseudo photographic memory when you study this way you sit down to do a test and you're you're replicating like whole lines from like what you what you studied I the ideas sort of come out fully formed because it's such a fantastic way to to actually learn um it was my key like the whole premise that got me writing that book is I went through this this period as a college student where where I came in freshman year was like a fine student not a great student but a fine student and uh I was rowing crew and I was sort of like excited to do that um and then I got developed a heart condition and had to stop congenital wiring in the heart atrial flutter thing mean I couldn't R crew anymore is a prolapse of some sort it was a a a circuit a circuitry issue that would lead to a extremely rapid heart beat it's like U really rapid like tardia right you get two 250 beats a minute just and it could be exercise induced right which is not optimal um you could take beta blockers which would moderate the electrical timing but beta blockers reduce your max heart rate and if you're a athlete where the entire thing that matters is your max heart rate so you're doing something like a 2,000 meter rows your performance on beta blockers just goes down it makes no sense it's like being a basketball player that wears weighted shoes it's too frustrating right it also makes you super mow I was pretty mellow guy but I was a worst rower so um so I stopped that I was like okay I want to get serious about my my studies I I can get serious about my studies and writing right that's when I actually made the decisions they didn't stuck with for the next 25 years after that but one of the things I did to get serious about my studies is I said I'm going to systematically experiment with how to study for test and how to write papers and I had I would try this how did it go deconstruct experiment try this how did it go deconstruct experiment and active recall was the thing to turn me all around and so I went from a pretty good student to 40 every single quarter sophomore year junior year senior year I got one a minus between my sophomore year through my senior year it was like this miraculous transformation it was active recall I rebuilt all of my studying so if it was for a humanities class I had a whole way of taking notes it was all built around doing active recall for math classes my main study tool was a stack of white paper all right do this proof white piece of paper and just can I do it from scratch if I could I know that technique if I don't all right I'm gonna come back and try it again later completely transformed you know I did so well academically that's why I ended up writing that book that basically spread that message to other people so I'm a huge advocate for active recall it's really hard but it it is the way to learn new things I'd like to take a brief moment and thank one of our sponsors and that's ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens I started taking ag1 way back in 2012 the reason I started taking it and the reason I still take it every day is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas for vitamins and minerals and it ensures that I get enough Prebiotic and probiotic to support gut health now gut health is something that over the last 10 years we realized is not just important for the health of our gut but also for our immune system and for the production of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators things like dopamine and serotonin in other words gut health is critical for proper brain functioning now of course I strive to consume healthy Whole Foods for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day but there are a number of things in ag1 including specific micronutrients that are hard to get from Whole Foods or at least in sufficient quantities so ag1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals that I need probiotics prebiotics the adaptogens and critical micronutrients so anytime somebody asks me if they were to take Just One supplement what that supplement should be I tell them ag1 because ag1 supports so many different systems within the body that are involved in mental health physical health and performance to try ag1 go to drink a1.com huberman and you'll get a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 and five free travel packs of ag1 again that's a drink ag1 uberman and as you pointed out it is very time efficient oh yeah yeah I mean it was a problem it was a social problem for me that I would have to pretend during finals period that I was going to the library to study because I would be done studying this active recall it's brutal but it's incredibly efficient you sit down there I would have my cards I would mark it okay I struggled with this I'd put it in this pile I got it done I'd put it in this pile and so then you would just go back to the I struggled with it pile uh and work on that and then make a new I struggle with a pile and these would exponentially Decay and so in like a few hours you could really Master you know with a few other tricks that worked you could really Master the material pretty quickly and then what am I supposed to do I didn't do all nighters like it wouldn't make any sense like active recall is how you prepare it's going to take four hours and it's going to be tough so do it in the morning when you have energy and then you're done I love it I learned essentially all of neuron Anatomy looking down the microscope at tissue samples and then I would try and take photographs with my eyes I do not have a photographic memory but then I would get home in the evening look through the neuroanatomy textbook lie down and try and fly through the different circuits in my mind and then if I arrived at a structure in the brain that I couldn't identify I would then go check my notes and go back so I just so basically I learned neur Anatomy which I you know um I'm poor at a great many things in life but neur Anatomy I'm I'm I'm solid at um with and then some if I may say so and it's because there's a mental map move through it you know fly through it dynamically um and that it's the same process um not all things lend themselves to that approach um I'm guessing maybe we could think of a few that don't um I guess if people were learning music yeah um that might be tricky maybe they need the sheet music in front of them I don't know I'm not a musician yeah I mean I studied a a professional guitar player at one point you were a professional guitar player I studied one oh so for for a book everything's from some book I've written a lot of books so I wrote a book 10 years ago um where I was trying to figure out as part of it how do people get better at things and so I spent time with a professional guitar player that said I just wanted to see how he practiced like what is this actually look like and what I learned from them is like what they do is yeah they have the music in front of them but for them it's all speed so they take a piece uh he was working on licks for he was a new acoustic style player and they had these kind of blueg grassy type licks um and he probably had it memorized and he knew how fast he could comfortably play it for them it's all about adding 20% to what they're comfortably doing and then that that that push pass where they're comfortable and the thing I remember writing about him was he was concentrating so hard to try to hit this lick 20% faster than he was used to it is he'd forget to breathe so he'd be like going going going and then just gasp you know like because his body would you know force him force him to breathe so yeah there it seemed to be all about uh deliberate practice so like how do you they don't waste any time professional musicians waste no time doing things they comfortable doing every time they spend practicing and this is also incredibly difficult uh but every time they been practicing it's almost entirely in a a state of I'm not comfortable with this but if I focus as hard as I can maybe I'm G to pull this off like I'll pull off the Sonata at this new speed I'm trying to do maybe I'll pull it off it's like the maximal growth stimulating State uh and so I wrote in the in this chapter why was he so much better at Guitar than I was at the same age because I played a lot of guitar when I was younger and was in rock bands right and this kid was young right but really really good and I said okay now I realize it I can recognize me when I look back at my time playing guitar at his age I played stuff I knew how to play like that's what was fun like yeah I want to like jam along with the songs I knew or you know rip some pentatonic scales you know to like a jimmi Hendrick album uh it was fun and he spent almost no time the pro spent no time having fun practicing was your brain had to be you know uncomfortable so I learned a lot from that you know um this actually led to a bit of a battle because of my my readers there was this a a this battle that emerged where people were trying to combine Andre Erikson and deliberate practice with uh Maley chmi and Flo and really they were trying to make Flo apply everywhere like it's all about flow uh deliberate practice is flow everything is flow the whole thing is to get into a state of flow and I remember Anders talking about this at some point and saying like no no no like the state of practice that makes you better it's the opposite of flow right in flow you lose track of time when you're practicing like that professional guitar player you know every second it passes by because it's like incredibly difficult like what you're doing your mind is rebelling it's not natural you know it's not fun it's not the skier going down the the hill and it's all Instinct it's you it's all you thinking about exactly what you're trying to do and so you know I began to push this point out here is like it's not all about flow like actually getting better at things is really painful sometimes deliberate practice is not the same as flow and there's a lot of fights about this for a while I think there was a lot of flow Advocates that just wanted life to be flow all the time but I think Anders was right because I watched these professionals practice like that's what it is it's not fun well everything we know about neuroplasticity which of course is the nervous system's ability to change in response to experience says that there needs to be some neurochemical or electrical condition that changes in the nervous system in order to queue up plasticity and um to my knowledge one of the most um robust of those is the release of the so-call catac colines dopamine epinephrine norepinephrine um dopamine because it's involved in so many things uh can be a little bit of a distractor so let's just say epinephrine norepinephrine adrenaline noradrenaline it create in the body and mind to some extent a state of alertness and often a state of agitation but if you think about it in the absence of some neuromodulators like those yeah um that change the conditions for wiring of neurons you know everyone loves fire together wire together yeah beautiful statement by Carla shatz not Donald Hebb Dr Carla shat said that not Donald Hebb um but why would neurons need to change their patterns of connectivity if you can complete the operation the nervous system needs to um it doesn't feel discomfort it creates discomfort but the nervous system needs a cue to like okay this is different I'm failing and it's the failures that actually trigger the plasticity it's the discomfort that cues that conditions are different now otherwise there's simply no reason to devote energetic resources to rewiring neurons and I feel like we don't learn this when we're kids we um and I think as kids we can learn so much without that feeling of agitation we get into these modes of looking for flow and um I have respect for the the research on Flow and the people involved in but I'd like to talk about flow a little bit the only thing I really know about flow for sure is that backwards it spells wolf so um what of flow it's such an attractive idea right this like Star Wars it's like you have the force and you're kind you're doing things without thinking and um awesome but I can't flow myself through a paper Y and extract the critical data I can't create a podcast in flow but when it's done it feels great especially if you nail the the key metric so what do you think about flow let's I'm not trying to beat up on it I just want to understand how how you place it in the framework of learning and and deep work if it belongs there at all it doesn't have a big place in it in the Deep work framework and and this was what the controversy was for a while and and I I knew mahale a little bit like we we corresponded some and I knew Anders a little bit like we corresponded some so I sort of felt like I was um you know and and both of them actually tragically died in the last three or four years I think oh that's very sad yeah I think both recently um Flo doesn't play a big role in the Deep the Deep work framework right so so when I was trying to justify deep work so I why focusing without distraction was important I was drawing a lot more for Anders work work right because uh why is focusing without distraction important well you have to quiet the neural circuitry you can isolate the circuit that's actually relevant to the thing that you're doing right you're not going to get better at something if you have noisy circuitry this is and that requires a really intense concentration so is one of the big advantages of deep work was if you're used to that cognitive State you're going to learn things faster and I think it was all Anders to understand why so if you're not distracted I'm really focusing hard on what I'm doing trying to learn this new thing you're giving the right mental conditions uh but it's not a flow State I always used to say okay when your when your deep work is not flow because of this like a lot of deep work is you're trying do something that is beyond your comfort zone and that's going to be difficult that's a state of deliberate practice and there's a famous paper about this where Anders uh actually explicitly says deliberate practice and flow are very different and and I wrote an essay years ago called the father of deliberate practice disowns flow and again people are really flow partisans out there it's interesting I think people just like the idea because it feels good but I mean flow is the feeling of performance is the way I think about it like it's really hard to train for certain sports but then when you're actually performing you're in the game you can fall in the flow right because then everything is undo it's really hard to train guitar but like when you're performing in front of a big crowd you probably maybe you fall in the flow maybe you don't but you could right but it's the performance State not the practicing getting better state so you know to Me Flo has like very little role in how I think about what I do as a cognitive professional it's just not something that comes up that often I agree um that we learn through focused work and that uh flow does um manifest itself during performance and sometimes um so much so that people exhibit virtuosity there they're surprising themselves even what what's in there and that that's kind of I always think of it's a what is unskilled skilled Mastery virtuosity virtuosity seems to incorporate some sort of random elements of maybe even the performer has not done that before and they surprise themselves or something like that who knows these are these are words for um for something that uh isn't easily Quantified in the first place but in terms of deep work and getting um a little bit back to kind of practical steps towards deep work I also have to ask you because I didn't uh earlier when you are on your laptop in your library with your fireplace and these books it's a beautiful image actually that you've drawn for us in our minds um is the Wi-Fi connection to your computer activated or are you offline uh it's connected um because it doesn't really matter to me you know because what what is it what's drawing my attention um I mean the most important decision I think I made technically speaking to be a cognitive worker is I the lack of social media like I I I think we underestimate the degree to which our problem with digital distraction is not the Internet it's not our phones it is specific products and services that are engineered at Great expense they pull you back to them when you take that away the internet's not that interesting like I don't have a cycle of sites to go to you know I can check my email but I don't really know where else to go I mean I could go to the New York Times I guess but then you've seen the Articles right they they change it once a day there's just not much I've set things up so there's not much that's that interesting to me we've all heard of fomo fear of missing out I feel like there's the other thing which is um fear of missing something bad right sort of like an anxiety a more primitive anxiety within us that if we are not engaged on social media or looking at our phone often or texting often that it's not that we'll miss the party um we'll miss the emergency um you don't seem to suffer from those kind of everyday ills yeah I mean it doesn't happen that much I mean I have a phone you know a standard no I mean I have my phone I guess if I'm working away from it yeah I guess it's true if there was an emergency uh but this was the case for a very long time right we didn't have smartphones till really relatively recently this is you know 15 years ago so we were just used to this until yesterday essentially that there's just periods of time where you're you're out of touch like you're at a restaurant with someone you're out of touch until you get back to your office like we were okay you know we weren't plagued by emergencies that that uh led to disastrous results because we couldn't hear about it right then you go to the movies like you're out of touch right and be a couple hours so you're in touch again and so I don't you know it's not something that's affected me as much so maybe working without my phone nearby a lot of people have this response they begin sort of catastrophizing like what if this happens or this or that and I'm thinking you know I survived before that my parents survived without that my my grandparents survived without that um I don't worry about it as much you know and and some of this maybe is just this doesn't upset people as as much as it used to the fact I don't use a lot of these apps or have my phone um but it really does upset people right there's what about this what about that what about this and I don't know how much of this is just maybe I'm oblivious and how much of this is people back sliding explanation for why they do need their phone why they do need to look at all the time but I I get a lot of it you maybe they're upset and you don't know because you're not looking at your phone that's right hey I'll tell you what that's a blessing not knowing how upset people are at you yeah it's a blessing as a semi-public figure I'll tell you that uh yeah I can comment on that but I won't um I am on social media and um I do enjoy it as I've got started posting on Instagram and then expand it to other platforms including the the podcast but there's a threshold Beyond which it becomes counterproductive for sure um I think there's information there um that like questions that people ask are often informative it's sort of like ending a class and asking are there any questions sometimes the comments that people bring back are truly informative towards both where they might have some misunderstanding but also sometimes some really terrific ideas yeah um so there's that but I I completely agree that this is a a very uh precarious space um and I'll just relay a quick anecdote years ago I gave a quick lecture um down at Santa clar University south of Stanford and I was talking about this issue I recommended your book and a student came up afterwards and he said you don't get it at that time I was in my early 40s he said you don't get it you know you grew up without social media and the phone and so you've adopted it into your life but we grew up with it and when my phone he's speaking for himself and the first person when my phone loses power I feel a physical drain within my body and when it comes back on I feel a lift within my body so I I'd love your thoughts on whether or not you think the phone and perhaps social media as well are in some ways an extension of our brain it's almost like another cortical area that contains all this information it's sort it's a version of us this gets into Notions of AI that we can talk about as well I know you're involved in in Ai and writing about AI but you know to me the when the phone is used in that way um it really is a almost like a uh a piece of neural Machinery of sorts yeah I mean there's two ways of looking at it yeah so so there is the the sort of cyborg image I suppose right like you are you're extending you're you're plugging into this neosphere like you have this sort of digital Network extension of information and what's going on there's also the much more pessimistic view which is no no that feeling is the feeling of a moderate behavioral addiction right so you you you'll hear the same thing from a a gambler I really when I'm away from being able to to play to make my bets or do whatever like I feel really I feel not myself and then when I'm when I'm around it and I can play make some bets play some poker whatever it is feeling of the chips I feel I feel myself that chips right like they would say so there it could be both of these things could be true I think the moderate behavioral addiction side is is more true than than a lot of us want to admit actually like it it does feel bad because moderate behavioral addictions build these these feedback response loops and then you get the dopamine system going when the anticipation because what's on there is that have been engineered that you're going to get this sort of Highly engaging stimuli and then you see the Deliverance of that stimuli right this really nice piece of glass on a piece of metal I'm going to press this sort of carefully uh this icon whose colors have been chosen because we know it's going to hit various parts of our neural alert systems to be as engaging as possible um and I'm going to see something in there that's going to generate some sort of emotional response so of course when you see that thing sitting there you want to use it and when you can't it's a a stimy dopamine response you're like this this is not good I'm uncomfortable and I I think that's a big part of it as well um because I've had this you know I've had this argument with with some people and I by the way I see both sides of this like there are great advantages to what people are doing with these tools it's just that it's all mixed up with all these disadvantages and it becomes very difficult it's like the alcohol in the neighborhood bar is too potent you know and and people are going there to socialize and they're coming home at 3: in the morning you know uh passing out you know it's like the balance is off not that there's not something good there but the balance is off so it becomes pretty difficult to navigate so I think some of that's what's going on especially with the younger generation that was raised on it which is why by the way I think the cultural norms are going to change around this I think we're going to think about unrestricted internet usage not as something that we just sort of Beque on youth as they become 10 years old but something that we're actually much more careful about and probably something that's going to be post pubescent is going to make a lot more sense once you've had more brain development once you've had more uh social entrenchment you sort of understand your identity Etc because we recognize you know the the flip side of plugging this thing into your brain is yeah you have access to more information but it also pumps that into your brain so I don't know I I lean a little bit heavier towards the pessimistic read because I know too many people because of my books um who've really reduced the impact of these things in their lives and they don't on the far side of that transformation they don't typically report a great impoverishment in exper experience they don't report um I'm less mentally agile the information at my fingertips is less I I'm I'm missing out on life there's typically this coming out of the fog on the other side of it where they're like oh this is fine so you know I'm a little bit suspicious about exactly what this mechanism is I think you're right about the um moderate behavioral addiction piece years ago when I was starting my lab I had grants to write and I found the phone to be pretty intrusive for that process so I used to give the phone to somebody in my lab and announc to everyone in my lab that if I asked for it back prior to 5:00 p.m. that day I would give everyone in the lab I think it was a $100 bill my lab was pretty big at the time I was a junior Professor they did not do not sorry uh academic institutions not to be named um pay us very much despite what people might think and um and it was difficult several times throughout the day or more I was like I really want to look at that thing but the end of the day um I'll tell you that no one got paid I got my phone back but it's wonderful the amount of work that you can get done when that thing is out of the room I mean it's my it's my superpower right I don't work that hard in the sense that I don't do long hours like I'm not constitutionally suited for long hours this was never my thing uh my brain tires right I mean I'm good for four four and a half good hours a day of actually producing good stuff with my brain probably Max but you know I don't use my phone that much I don't use the internet that much and I prioritize it and a lot just gets done it just sort of piles up over time you know and there's this sense of like you must be burning the midnight oil and you have all these things going on uh but again people I think underestimate and it's not the uh they underestimate the impact of this it's not just the the accumulation of time you spend looking on your phone it's also this network switching cost right because like the phone is very good at inducing a network switch and that's a expensive time consuming energy consuming neuronal operation task switching I'm going to switch my focus of attention from this to that like we can't do that in two seconds right that's a hard process it takes a while it's why when you sit down to work on something really hard you have that feeling of for the first 15 minutes this is terrible you know and then after like 15 or 20 minutes you sort of get into the groove I always assumed part of what's going on is it takes a while for your brain to really start marshalling okay so what semantic networks do we need to start activating here oh we don't need this let's inhibit this we're not doing that anymore it takes a while um so what happens then when you have a lot of these quick checks to social media you're jumping in on email back and forth is you have this disaster catastrophic pile up of aborted task switches happening right and so it's not just the total time you're looking at let's say email or social media it's the 15minute window you have to add around each of those checks in which you have this cognitive disorder that really adds up and then you realize oh there was no time during my day in which I was more than 15 minutes away from looking at something that induced a network switch the the data I like to site which was looking at email and slack checks and knowledge workers this came from Rescue time the software company the median average interval between checks was 5 minutes so the median and the mode was one minute in this data set so it was like we are we are checking all the time that means you were never in a state then in your day where you don't have a confused cognitive space where you don't have partially you were switching to this task but then you switch back to this task before that finish but before you could fully lock it on this task you look back over here and so you're spending your entire day in the state of cognitive disorder which is is going to be reduced cognitive output right so you get rid of that I mean I always say like one of my advantages is not that I'm doing anything smarter I'm just avoiding sometimes the dumb thing just holding slowing other people down you get rid of that and you feel like you're on the world's best uh neurotropic or something like this like oh I'm just doing this thing and I'm doing it pretty well now I'm done you why this didn't even take that long so I mean I I think people underestimate what's going on here I'd like to take a quick break to acknowledge our sponsor element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means zero sugar and the appropriate ratios of the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium and that correct ratio of electrolytes is extremely important because every cell in your body but especially your nerve cells your neurons relies on electrolytes in order to function properly so when you're well hydrated and you have the appropriate amount of electrolytes in your system your mental functioning and your physical functioning is improved I drink one packet of element dissolved in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning as well as while I exercise and if I've sweat a lot during that exercise I often will drink a third element packet dissolved in about 32 oun of water after I exercise element comes in a variety of different flavors all of which I find really tasty I like the Citrus I like the watermelon I like the raspberry frankly I can't pick just one it also comes in chocolate and chocolate mint which I find tastes best if they are put into water dissolved and then heated up I tend to do that in the winter months because of course you don't just need hydration on hot days and in the summer and spring months but also in the winter when the temperatures are cold and the environment tends to be dry if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element spelled lm.com huberman to try a free sample pack again that's drink element.com huberman yeah would like to drill into the concept of context and task switching a bit more uh I do think that the brain has something akin to a transmission system where you know for people that drive and have driven you know the the amount of energy that needs to be used in order to accelerate a vehicle to get up to a you know higher gear it's very different than the um equal amount of increase in speed at a given gear right so it's sort of the this is you hear this if you're not familiar with Transmissions say it sounds like it sounds as if there's it's more fasile at at higher speeds well how could it be that you're burning less fuel at a higher speed it's not exactly that way but but I think the brain has these sort of transmission systems and what you're describing with um people switching back and forth and checking email and phone Etc and back to the work um that should be at hand is sort of akin to going up and down the the gear system constantly yeah trying to arrive at a given destination and sure you might arrive but you're going to burn far more fuel it's the least efficient way to go about it you want to get into that deep Groove and I think when we hear about flow I feel like at least for me that's the sort of notion of flow that I'm looking for dropping into that deep Groove even if there's some friction within that groove of the the challenge of the work that I'm doing it's about not thinking about anything else it's really about Focus yep right and the word flow is just a wonderfully attractive word um that I think gives us the the false impression that we can just drop into things like a square wave function sit down pen and paper go and there's no possible way that neural circuits could work that way no we let's let's invent a term and I'm you tell me if the term makes sense I'm invent it's on the fly but uh neuros semantic coherence this is going to be my alternative term for flow when you're working on something hard um it's not that you're in an actual Flow State where you lose track of what you're doing you're concentrating really hard but I'm why I'm saying neuros semantic coherence is you get to this place where the sort of relevant semantic neural networks are all um those that are activated are all relevant to what you're doing and you've uh over time inhibited most of the unrelated networks that were fired up before and so you get in this sense of it's hard maybe I'm not losing track of time but like I'm all focused on this you know I'm grappling with the the the bear here the the math equation the the book chapter whatever it is um and so it's something different than flow but it's also different than Linda Stone had the term partial continuous attention which is what you're that cognitive disaster of I'm constantly Network switching back and forth so we'll call it neuros semantic coherence I'm got to coin that term um because it's uh you have this coherence of the semantic neural networks on what you're doing and that's the feeling of I'm getting after this hard problem and it might be really hard to do I mean I know the feeling of trying to solve a math proof for me for example could be so difficult because I mean what does it actually feel like in your head when you're solving a math proof it's a lot of you hold this here and then you try to get to the next step by doing this and it doesn't work but you have to keep holding this here which takes a lot of concentration okay let me try this that didn't work either but this looked promising okay so now I need to go back and in my mind's eye update this setup and now let me try this so it's a lot of holding things in your working memory um and keeping them loaded while you try an extension and then evaluating how that worked without and so it it requires um just internal concentration which isn't pleasant but in neuros semantic coherence it's all that's happening in your world you know is that in that proof so maybe that's what we should be pitching what people should be looking for is yeah forget flow but also remember like this default where you're like the rescue time data set participants checking email once every five minutes that's cognitive nonsense that's crazy that's like you're trying to you know play football and you're covering over one of your eyes and wearing like a 50 pound ruck sack on you're just like handicapping your abilities here for no reason right so what's in between is this idea and that requires Focus you know that requires deep work yeah we're playing football and then um every three Downs or so running into the stands and having a conversation trying to work out something challenging with your spouse or whatever then going back and try a totally different play set right um at risk of throwing too different too many analogies and and stories I'll just briefly say I went and saw the the play in New York with my sister this year I think it was Harry Potter and the cursed child or something like that um I didn't really enjoy the play that much but the set stuff was amazing and they have this magic Library I think is very very relevant here where essentially um the book that you open um has a certain topic I don't know maybe it's spells or something as Harry Potter again uh fun show but great set stuff didn't didn't really resonate with me too much in any event and then the books around it change their that but are related to that Central bookes and then if you look at one particular thing like maybe it's potions or something I'm making this up and then all of a sudden the books the books around it change they become either more specific there might be a distant but related idea that could lend itself to creativity so sort of that's the way the brain works in cognition is that we get into a frame of of a certain discussion or a certain theme and and the and the the books on the Shelf change according to their relatedness based on memory of past what's going on now and plans for the future I think anytime we look at uh we change context and we look at you know a raccoon video on Instagram or our calendar and oh there's that thing the books become very scattered so when we return to it there's a lot more friction uh a lot more work or neural neural energy required to get back into that um this uh narrow states of cognition just that exactly explains sort of my experience and the way I think about it yeah yeah because you're it takes time uh to to load up the these sort of relevant these secondary and tertiary semantic ideas and now they're there so like you can pull from them and then as you shift you have to sort of shift this whole thing around that takes a lot of concentration I mean I I wrote this this article once that got me a little bit of trouble not not trouble but mild trouble uh but it was it was called was for the Chronicle of Higher Education um and the title they gave it was is email making Professor stupid which wasn't my title you basically called every every one of your colleagues stupid we all check email the dean at the time did call me in for lunch but actually he was here's the thing he was like hey this is real I agree with this um but what I was arguing actually in that article essentially was what do we do at a university is is partially what we're supposed to be doing is trying to teach what the life of the mind is and how that works and we've kind of forgotten that so what we should maybe think about like at universities we need to be explicitly not just teaching how to think but also modeling the life of the mind at the at the highest level and so this idea that we just allow the the professor serot to to be drowned in um emails and and uh tasks and being as distracted you know it's the main war that every research Professor has is how do I how do I fight the admin overload until I become famous enough to get an assistant right like this is the big problem and I was making this proposal of University should be the citadels of concentration I said if you want to get the the best academics in the world to your University just tell them uh here's at the top of our contract you will not be assigned an email address like you're going to get Nobel laurates coming from you know all over the country to come to this place and so I was making this argument um we should think a more about thinking we should talk more about it we should model it exactly the type of things you're talking about but we don't it's much more contents focused but really this should be something more that we we get into specifically like this is how you actually use the mind to produce Innovative uh interesting high value new cognitive artifacts this is a very hard thing we're asking you to do um but you can Apprentice here because this is what we do and we've mastered we're going to teach you how to do it uh but we never have that sort of meta conversation sort of meta cognition conversation always thought that'd be important I think you'd have much better outcomes if that's part of what you learned at the University was how to take the thing in your head and really put it to work you know really extract out of it his capabilities or even high school or even Elementary School level I agree yeah U you have kids yeah and um do they have smartphones no yeah how do they feel about that well I mean they're not they're not old enough yet that it's a it's a real problem um but they're they're not going to be happy with me probably soon hate me now love me later as my mother used to say basically because I you know I'm I'm convinced having spent some time thinking about this writing about this doing some journalism on this talking to a lot of the experts that like I think where we're going to end up where all the the arrows from the the relevant social psych research which um I've been following This research since you know 2017 this is 2017 is roughly when you see the first warning signs going up that we need to worry about the potential mental health impacts of these tools especially social media and smartphones on young people and I you can track this right I have a talk I I actually gave it my kid school not happy about this where I tracked how this research evolved and you know like any literatures it's contentious at first and then you see um you you begin to see uh consilience between different lines of evidence and I think where where everything now in the last couple years is starting to come together this idea of we don't really know if this is bad or not I think that's just an old take the researchers moveed past that and I think where we're we're we're landing on is unrestrict internet use pre-puberty is risky and like the new standard is going to be uh post puberty is probably the right time to be given a device that gives you unrestricted access we're talking like 16 is probably the appropriate age so this does not make me popular at the middle school where my son's my oldest son's about to go um I think in two or three years that's just going to be common sense that's this is the direction I see the research literature and the advocacy going and I think there's a solid ground for this because you're a computer scientist I can ask this question what about video games I'm not a big consumer of video games it's been years since I've played one in fact um but video games are so very different than smartphones and um and other Technologies because they uh seem to put at least the kids I've observed playing them and adults um into a very narrow trench of attention yeah uh I mean there are definitely issues with it I mean look I'm not a social psychologist I just sort of play one in my articles but but I've I've looked into this a lot um there's a bit of a a gendered breakdown that has a lot of overlaps where when they're looking at uh potential harms of these Technologies uh young adolescence right pre-adolescent young adolescence you tend to see social media to be more signal for cognitive distress for young women and girls and the video games to actually be the bigger culprit for uh young men and boys right there is a bit of a difference here because with the the social media impact the the content of what's Happening matters in this picture right so so um what I'm seeing the engagement I'm having how this impacts my social life this is part of the mental distress with video games it seems to be more uh an impact of just disharmonious passion and Obsession just the time it takes right because the games can be incredibly addictive so the problem that young men are having are just they're playing it all the time that I'm staying up late because I have a an iPad in my room and I'm 14 and I going to play fortnite until 3 in the morning because my brain cannot handle like what you're what you're giving me here right um so it's less of a a Content concern than it is just a Time concern right that seems more solvable to me you know like my solution with my own kids I don't mind video games I'm a computer scientist but I said nothing that's online right nothing that was free because if it was free that means uh their business model involves getting you to play it all the time so you can upcharge or whatever uh they have Nintendo switches like I like Nintendo okay Nintendo switch here's a $60 Zelda game that someone spent 5 years making or whatever you can only play those games so long at a time before you know you're tired you come back to it um they don't have an addictive response to it if they get an iPad with a a game on it they'll just like play that till their eyes bleed because those are meant to be to be addictive so I'm wary about video games but there it's all just a usage game so you stick away from the more addictive games it's it's a much easier problem to solve I think than the social media the social media issue earlier you talked about books um I still read um hard cover and paperback books um what are your thoughts on audiobooks and learning by way of um Audi book uh versus paper in front of you flipping a physical device or Kindles I don't know if there's any real research on this I've seen a little bit but I'm curious what what you've encountered and what your thoughts are as well you could speculate yeah I mean I I'll tell you personally I can only do fiction and audiobooks right because when I'm in a non-fiction experience I'm just very used to constantly looking for connections and ideas you know and so I have to be able to slow down and then speed up and then go back to something I just read um so I really have a distressing experience trying to listen to non-fiction audio books Fiction's fine that's great let put a thriller on you know audible great I you know I'll listen through it and I think some of this might be particular to my my engagement with books which is I'm you know I'm a writer and a thinker so I'm constantly looking for ideas and so I might have a different engagement with a non-fiction book than someone you know just listening to one of my books but I can only do fiction on audio that makes sense thinking about what works for me what doesn't I agree I I love stories and fiction by by audiobook um you ideally consumed on a long drive or a hike um but non-fiction requires that I take notes and see things in their kind of um respective spatial layout and yeah um in your most recent book um you describe this concept of pseudo productivity is pseudo productivity a general term to refer to some of the things we've already talked about this test switching context switching or pseudo productivity something that uh includes other categories of of limiting ourselves as well I mean I think it's more specific than that right so it to me Pudo productivity was the answer that we came up with a knowledge work to a real dilemma which is that's a sector you know using your brain primarily to create value that's a sector that emerged as a major part of the economy in roughly the mid 20th century um when that emerged all the definitions of productivity that we had were inspired from Agriculture and Industry right so so in agriculture we can have ratios U bushels of corn per whatever acres of land under cultivation in industrial manufacturing we have ratios modalities per input labor hour um so you could just measure these things H we also had clearly defined systems of production so you could then say if I change this about the system of production what happens to this number and you could do gradient descent right okay I do this that number goes down let's not do that by make this change it goes up that's a better way of building it like this was the dominant way of thinking about productivity since basically Adam Smith the knowledge work arises that doesn't work right because I'm working on whatever five different things it's different than what you are working on um how I'm managing my work is entirely off youc right in knowledge work uh organizational ideas is entirely left up to the individual how you manage your work and your workload and collaboration that's like up to you that's all off you skated there's no number to measure there's no system to improve so I think it was a real quandry my argument is what essentially the management class came up with is PUD productivity which is okay in the absence of being able to be quantitative about this we will use visible activity as a proxy for useful effort so that's it like we see you doing things that's better than not the more we see you doing the better I call that pseudo productivity and I think that's implicitly how we've been organizing the management of knowledge work labor since the 1950s and when you say visibility people doing things it this is the um conflating of busyness with actual productivity yes and so the problem came when we had this General way of measuring approximating productive effort which wasn't very good but whatever right I mean I want to see you're at the office and you're doing things the problem was the front office it Revolution right because I'm I'm essentially a techn Critic I see everything through the lens of technology in my writing we got computers we got networks we got email pseudo productivity can't be sustainable in that context because now with something like email and then later tools like slack I can demonstrate effort at a very fine grain right because I can send an email respond to this jump onto a slack conversation I can now do that at a very fine grain level um and essentially everywhere and anywhere all throughout my day I can be demonstrating labor at home I can be demonstrating labor because we have mobile Computing we get the smartphone Revolution um so there there's a now an ability to constantly be demonstrating effort at all points of our day and that's where I think the wheels came off the bus right and and led to this this this point that got worse and worse starting the early 2000s and hit ahead in the pandemic of a knowledge worker burnout knowledge worker exhaustion and nihilism of like what's going on with my job like all I do is zoom all day what's happening I think that pseud productivity plus front office it Revolution they did not play nice together and you can see this by the way if you look even at productivity books you see this huge shift that happens early '90s versus early 2000s it's like a completely shift in tone right early 90s it's stepen cvy is very optimistic it's like how are we going to self-actualize and like carefully choose the most meaningful activities to fulfill all of our dreams for all of our roles early 2000s now we have email you have David Allen this like oh my God we're so overwhelmed with task all we can hope for is like these little moments of Zen in the day if we can just automate how we're just churning through these widgets at least we can find some cognitive piece uh what happened in those 10 years was the front office it Revolution and now we just felt like we had to constantly be demonstrating that visible effort so you know I think that's where we got to the problem pseud productivity plus technology recently my podcast team was in Australia and um my producer and uh close friend here uh Rob Moore uh instructed all of us to get rid of social media on our phones except one guy who would post our weekly episodes announcements um and it was pretty brutal at first and then coming back to social media has actually turned out to be more challenging you really experience the friction coming back the other way and then one experiences the the lack of friction and that's where it gets scary it's it's so interesting the way that the brain can adapt um the friction leaving something behind um the friction coming back to it um and I think for people listening to this I I raise this because I think of course many people listening are you know have work that they really need to focus on they may be having issues with uh productivity and burnout Etc I think a lot of people use the phone and social media because it fills their life you know it provide some enrichment and they aren't necessarily committed to specific projects but I guess through the lens of the the let's just call it the Cal Newan lens one might argue that those people uh almost certainly have untapped creativity untapped resources within them that um they don't yet know about because they're essentially using that energy elsewhere yeah I mean I think for a lot of people it's papering over the void right you have this void in your life because there's a unmet potential uh unmet interest um living in misalignment with the things you care about right I mean a lot of people this is the classic sort of catastrophe of life right social media and there's before this it was other things right there was other intoxicants or other sorts of distractions it's a way for some people of essentially putting a screen over that like gaping void and it like just makes it bearable enough that you can kind of go on with life and so it is true if you just rip it out you see the void and that's really difficult right I mean because I I did this experiment for one of my books I ran an experiment with 1600 people and they all turned off all their social media for 30 days 30 days 30 days right these are young people old people a whole mix a whole mix right not just University students I recruited them from my my newsletter readership so they weren't University students and it wasn't formal research it was you know I put out the call right so this is not randomly sampled right but I put out the call and I said here I'm going to walk you walk you through this and then I got a lot of information back so people reported back how it went and this was like the number one thing I heard was it's really hard at first right and so who are the people that succeeded for 30 days versus those who didn't the the ones who didn't succeed it tended to just try to White Knuckle it just be like I don't like how much I'm using social media I'm just going to stop because it's bad and I don't want to do a bad thing I'm just going to like you know hold on the table with White Knuckles they wouldn't make it through days the people who did succeed followed my advice to incredibly aggressively pursue Alternatives in those 30 days so it's like go learn new hobbies join things right away get like really structured about your day um get into exercise again learn how to knit again a lot of people said oh I learned about I forgot how fun libraries were like you can go into this building and like all the books are free and there's there you could just grab whatever and it's okay if you don't like the book because you didn't have to pay for it I'm going out with friends again I'm I'm okay every week I'm going to have you know we're going to have drinks with this person and every Thursday morning I'm going to go running with this person the people who aggressively try to put in place a more positive alternative through self-reflect experimentation they lasted the 30 days and Beyond right and so then I came to realize like oh I see what's happening here is you have these unmet needs these tools can give you sort of a a simulacrum of meeting them I need I'm a social being I need to be connected to people well I'm texting and like doing comments on social media it's sort of touches that a little bit just enough that you don't feel hopelessly lonely but it's not really fulfilling that um I have a need to like see my intentions made manifest concretely in the world humans want to do this well I'm you know posting these things and people are responding it's sort of this simulacrum of real creation so it's like kind of satisfying that just enough that it's not just intolerable right um and so what happens is if you remove that you have to actually fill those things the right way so now I'm not socializing on social media but I'm going out of my way to sacrifice time and attention on behalf of other people I'm feeling the social void in the right way now I don't really feel like I need to go back uh I'm actually build making my intentions manifest I'm learning skills and Building Things now this sort of pseudo construction and Collective attention economy of social media I'll post this and you'll like it I'll like this um I don't need that anymore to fill that void so it's like you have to fill the void first so so you know five years ago I wrote a book that was about reforming this part of your life and a lot of the book was nothing to do with technology but about how to actually just rebuild parts of your life and on my podcast honestly like one of the big topics we talk about which is crazy that I'm a technologist and I write about trying to find focus in a distracted world is this thing we call the Deep life which is just straight up building a meaningful life 101 and it's like crazy that my podcast is talking about it but on the other hand it's not because my the podcast people go to when they're fed up with the digital world and it turns out if you don't get the analog world working right for you you need something to avoid staring to that void and and the digital world will do that well enough it's like just good enough to keep life tolerable there's a lot of discussion nowadays about ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder sometimes U minus the H minus the hyperactivity uh a lot of kids have true clinically diagnosed ad ADHD so we want to be um sensitive to that it's a real issue for a lot of people a lot of adults have true ADHD um but nowadays people talk about ADHD the same way terms like um depression trauma gaslighting and um Etc are discussed in in non-clinical territory OCD people use clinically as well right right and um and I'm not disparaging that it's just that we we have sort of a dilution of deeper understanding of what these things really are and aren't um what are your thoughts I realize you're not a psychiatrist but what are your thoughts on the idea that um many uh people that think they perhaps have true attention issues have either um built those attention issues through neuroplasticity um uh into their system meaning their system probably worked nervous system probably worked pretty well to focus but they engaged in enough task switching that the circuits of the brain involved in cognition became optimized for um this very distributed cognition um as opposed to um narrow focused attention and what are your thoughts about um just the amount of of stimulant use on college campuses and in in adult populations to to try and overcome this I feel like there's a lot of um attempts to use pharmacology to match the level of distraction to try and make that distraction not seem like distraction but you know this is uh this is an area I hear a lot about given the nature of the things I cover on the podcast I think a lot of these issues are phone induced right um and and I think the problem is yeah not solvable as much you don't need pills you need a different phone relationship my optimistic hypothesis is again this uh non-clinical uh difficulty with maintaining attention like in your work or if you're a college student or whatever um it's not necessarily representing sort of knock on wood like a wholesale neural rewiring like that I basically rewired my circuits on my brain to be a sort of distributed switching processor I think most of this is is persisting um in that much more malleable area that gets affected by moderate behavioral addictions right so the the we we have parts of the brain that are part of these like feedback reward Loops that's meant to be malleable right I mean this is supposed to be so we can have really rapid learning about what's happening in our environment how we're supposed to respond to it and and this is what gets hijacked when you you build up these behavioral addictions and so it's it's very quick to change um but that malleability means you can change it back right so so I I I think this this drive to I have to keep checking my email or my phone is again you build up a moderate behavioral addiction because of like standard reward cues and and that's a part of the brain that you can't it's difficult but it's not your whole brain is now a social media brain and that's just the brain you have because you're exposed to this um it's a matter of you know getting the stimuli out of your life doing the same type of training you would do uh ex boredom exposure like get used to the idea of feeling that drive and not actually doing it you can work with blocking apps like there's stuff you can do this is sort of like standard it's painful it takes two months and then like you're doing better on it so I do think we have a a a large stratum of subclinical attention issues that are not representing wholesale neural rewirings but are like absolutely sort of expected outcomes of working with malleable reward CU circuits in the brain we can fix those just like we can if you know you're you're uh you're gambling too much or compulsively eating the junk food or something we don't say your whole brain got we red for junk food it's like no you have this ex this particular Q cycle that we have to work on so maybe I'm being optimistic there and you know the brain better but like it would be extraordinary if in like a 10-year period right your entire brain somehow got rewired in a way that it couldn't sustain Focus anymore I totally agree with that statement unless uh you're a young person and you grew up in a distracted world and your brain optimized as the young brain does for the conditions it's in and then I think you have a real issue yeah um which is not to say it can't be rescued through the use of discipline tools protocols pharmacology nutrition great sleep and if necessary prescription drugs right because there is a case for prescription drugs in certain um instances for ADHD and and as I understand it um you know anytime people say wait aren't those drugs just meth isn't it just speed yep they are amphetamines in most cases and the idea is to increase the deployment of C certain neuromodulators ones I mentioned before um as a means to induce neuroplasticity so that the focus state becomes more of a default state um so I think that young people are in trouble I think that we I do worry about young people I think we it's um it's akin to putting them in a kind of a well we know this in the visual system if you take an animal or human and you put them into an altered visual environment um the visual system changes and your perception of the visual world is becomes inaccurate um and the way I think of this cognitively with respect to attention the analogy would be I think we've been for the last 10 years or so 10 15 years we've been raised in kids in a sort of um House of uh fun house mirror things which is anything but fun where you look at yourself and your legs are shorter than and your torso is long and so everywhere you turn you're getting a distorted perception and trying to navigate the world through that distorted perception is very very difficult you can do it but it's a lot of extra work that's what I feel we've done to young people I'm I'm very concerned about that as well yeah yeah and and I think I don't know what your take on this but like do you think at the undergraduate level that we have just been not explicitly but just sort of implicitly uh professors in general we have been just sort of slowly adapting the difficulty of what we're teaching Etc because we maybe there's a reduced cognitive Focus capacity which is like the key skill for this sort of very artificial thing of learning you know complicated college level work I think this would be an interesting experiment to find out is have we been implicitly having to sort of simplify things to keep roughly speaking distributions where normatively we feel comfortable I mean do we see the signal yet that's my interest do we see the signal yet if we look back a generation 20 years ago versus now I don't know for courses of the sort that I teach or taught until very recently I still teach but I was directing the neuron Anatomy course and there's a laboratory module so the students dissect brains they're holding actual human brains um that's a real physical contact that cannot be recapitulated um digitally you just can't do it you can try you use VR but it's it ain't the same I mean how would you like it if you're a neurosurgeon learned um on a virtual brain and then it does surgery on a brain no not no such thing should uh happen I think that um my experience with this is perhaps most relevant with respect to social media where I teach Neuroscience yeah and I use a variety of duration of Clips you know the 902 real the you know 7 minute thing the 2 and 1 half hour podcast that you know we have podcast solo podcast 4 and a half hours um I don't know how many people listen start to finish but I think having a variety of different durations really helps um and I'm told by my team I have a Tik Tok account although I've never logged on there um you know I think Tik Tok represents the extreme of kind of bubble gum level um information SL entertainment and they really nailed some some circuit that can handle information of about 30 to 60 seconds in a format that um tickles the brain just right to keep swiping liking commenting and sharing yeah um and I don't think that's anything like a real understanding or education yeah I mean it's nothing like a real understanding or education yeah I mean Tik Tok in particular like I think something PE what people get wrong about Tik Tok is they think that there was a uh real algorithmic Innovation which is actually not the case like as far as I understand the machine learning algorithm underneath Tik Tok is probably like a relatively standard sort of multi-arm bandant you know intermittent feedback reinforcements algorithm all they did is they cleared out all the other noise so you know if you're Facebook or something like this uh you're trying to use algorithms to curate things but you have all these other Legacy structures you also have to try to satisfy there's friends and you know you want to show stuff that your friends like more than other people and there's groups you're joining Tik Tok just got rid of all the noise and so we're just going to all we're doing is optimizing uh watch time we we think we don't know but we think watch time is the main thing that they're they're uh optimizing so want to optimize it watch time and everything all these videos all Just exist as multi-dimensional points in this sort of semantic cloud and all we're doing is just showing you things and then you swipe another thing swipe another thing so when you get rid of all the noise from a machine learning algorithm it doesn't also have to satisfy that I follow this person on Instagram or this is my friend all I have to do is optimize this one number how long did they watch before they swiped it just turns out oh it's really easy like you do that for a couple hours you're going to hone in on these sub regions in this massive multi-dimensional space of stuff that just tickles this particular person's brain you know and it's very cybernetic because now I'm the user of Tik Tok I'm the content creator I'm getting immediate feedback what's working what's not I really quickly find these particularly Rich regions in this sort of cybernetic space and so it's like Tik Tok just purified something that was simple basic machine learning but just like purify what we're doing here and that turned out to be enough to create what's like probably the most addictive Force we've seen in the digital world in a long time so Tik Tok is optimized for dwell time yeah that's the thought right because it's not public so like we don't exactly know how the algorithm works but people have been studying it like a Skinner box you know 100 phones and we we looking all these accounts looking at the variables it seems like that's largely what it's optimizing for is uh how long did you watch before you swiped right and that's it so there I mean it's not this was both uh what was smart about about Tik Tok and also why I've been arguing it's it's destabilized the whole traditional social media narrative is because the traditional massive social media players of the last decade had this uh first mover advantage on these giant actual social networks right so like Twitter and Facebook and Instagram had these uh massive networks of people's uh preferences of I'm following this person and this person I'm following uh and they could leverage these actual social graphs as a huge source of producing interesting content right and this was a huge first mover Advantage because you can't it's hard to get a 100 million people to use something now right Tik Tok got rid of all that we don't want a social graph you as a user don't have to declare anything you don't have to follow people or say who your friends are we'll just start showing you things and that was more compelling than what you could generate with a social graph but now there's no first mover Advantage so as the big social media players follow the Tik Tok model which is much more algorithmic let's just try to curate based on gorithms not who you follow or who your friends are they're now much more vulnerable because Tik Tok could come along and do this without having to spend 5 years getting people to clear their friends and now if someone else could come along and do this so I think the major players are giving away their competitive Advantage which is this uh the social graph IP that no one will ever replicate again they're giving away that advantage and now it's a free-for-all playing field of all sources of attention engagement so I don't know I think Tik Tok accidentally destabilized the social media decade that had been defining until I think just recently L what I find so interesting about social media platforms like Tik Tok is that um sure it makes sense that um kids and teens would use it they were raised with it Snapchat Etc but when I see my peers who you know we call ourselves adults um people in their mid to late 40s 50s essentially like playing kids games or engaging through these platforms that are they're not childlike necessarily but they they just prove that the um or rather that their adherence SL addiction to them just proves that this is tapping into some core neural circuit that exists in everyone um so while it might be shaping the uh young brain a lot this is adults basically eating junk food all day um which raises a question you know I think um while there are many different ways to eat and it's not a topic we want to get into now um Lord knows that's a great way to to create um a lot of social media content debating which diet omnivore carnivore vegan Etc the notion of intermittent fasting um limiting On's a portion of the day where they eat to whatever 6 hours 4 hours 12 hours um is an interesting one that maybe has some applicability here um what are your thoughts about simply not turning on the phone maybe even not turning Wi-Fi on if people are are not as disciplined as you are with the laptop or tablet um for the first two hours of the day or four hours of the day or for a portion of the day sort of like you're taking a a social media fast that isn't 30 days it's you know which I think for a lot of people is going to evoke um High cortisol release uh just the idea of it yeah uh know this is an idea I've written about before you know in deep work I had this chapter called Embrace boredom that was the entire idea right so the idea was um boredom by itself is not I think laudable right there there's a reason why it feels distressing when things feel distressing that's usually an evolutionary signal that there's something going on here um but was arguing in that chapter was exactly what you're talking about you should have some moments every day where you're free from distraction even though you could be accessing distraction and you want to and like a little bit each day 20 minutes each day and then maybe a longer session once a week like a couple hours um my argument for that was it's about breaking a pavlovian connection in this sense right so if it's every time I feel boredom lack of Novel stimuli I get this release of the phone your mind is really going to make that Association of like this is what we always do if sometimes you don't it's a different cognitive landscape right your mind is uh sometimes we get the distraction sometimes we don't that's a much better place to be because now when it comes time to actually focus on something you know your mind's like I've been here before like we don't always get the distraction so you know this is going back you know early 20th century psychology there's probably a more neuroscientific way to think about this but it's like breaking pavlovian Loops if like sometimes at the end of the day I'm exhausted it's Instagram time and it like scr scratches an itch but other times I'm bored I'm in line at the pharmacy and I don't look at the phone my brain learns like yeah we don't always do it and and so the idea is that you know if you make boredom more tolerable then you're much more likely to succeed with doing things that are boring but hard and I think deep work for example is boring just in the clinical sense of there's lack of Novel stimuli you're just doing the same thing for a long time so I've always advocated for that is like you shouldn't be un super uncomfortable with boredom like don't go seeking it I'm not a big believer of and boredom is where all creative Insight comes from I think it's a strong evolutionary cue like leave this state but you do have to have some tolerance for it I wonder if we need a different word than boredom um are you familiar with this notion of Gap effects in learning these Gap effects are similar to the effects of um neural processing during sleep um focused attention with some agitation triggers neuroplasticity and learning but it's during sleep in particular deep sleep rapid eye movement sleep states of deep bre maybe in some forms of meditation that the actual rewiring takes place and then there's this literature about Gap effects which have been demonstrated for music for math for many things in which if people say are practicing new scales on the piano for instance but could be any scale and then they um intermittently are are queued by a buzzer to just stop and do nothing the the hippocampus which is involved in learning memory replays the action sometimes in Reverse just as occurs during sleep um at a rate of maybe 20 or 30 times faster at the neural level we're not talking about boredom what we're talking about is pauses during which perhaps um we are obtaining accelerated neuroplasticity the Gap effects certainly accelerate learning I've talked about these in other podcasts but I wonder whether or not this thing that you're calling boredom so being in line um to get some groceries yeah and not taking one's phone out while the Checker is you know scanning the groceries through and just not really doing much of anything it's entirely possible that the thing that we were working on earlier that day or the previous day is being processed in the hippoc campus at un conscious level at a much more rapid rate where we to look at our phone we would inhibit those Gap effects which are truly beneficial yeah well I mean professors feel this all the time right at least a lot of ones I've talked to with peer reviews so I don't know if you've had this experience but you're like reviewing a paper I often have this experience where when I'm first engaging with the paper I feel incredibly frustrated like I I don't quite understand what they're doing here like this mathematics isn't quite making sense to me and it'll often be the fact I come back later like well let me just like write up what I have so far and your understanding is like much much better right so there's this this sense of maybe something's been processing I took that so seriously when I was uh especially at post stock like when I was at the height of just all I do in my life is produce value with my brain every day I would do what I call thorough walks because I I discovered thorough while a grad student I read it down by the Charles like the full sort of you know just minus the Beret like pretentious grad student thing but I was really in the the the Walden um real influential book for me so every day when I would walk back I was was living on Beacon Hill walking from MIT so people who know Boston it's it's going across the Longfellow bridge I would say nothing but nature observation like that's what I'm doing I'm just uh oh the ice is thinner on the Charles today like look at this tree or the leaves coming back partially I think what was going on is like this was right after I'd been whiteboarding it right uh I think it was letting stuff process right so I had this explicitly in my routine uh a lot of time where I was okay I can't think about work at all I can't do anything else but you know I'm thinking about the tree I'm thinking about the water like really sort of minimal cognitive lifts and I wonder if that's what was going on there like to me that I that was a very productive period of my life yeah I feel like in the in the last five 10 years thanks large Le in part to Matt Walker's book why we sleep and the advocacy around sleep from others um we've come to understand that sleep is essential for mental health physical health and learning cognitive Performance Physical performance so much so that now people devote immense amounts of attention and and uh resources to trying to get the best possible night sleep whereas it was the I'll sleep when I'm dead mentality prior to that yeah and I I would love to see a world where um people Embrace not the notion of boredom per se but the notion of gaps um lack of external stimula coming into our our eyes and our cognitive system as a means to get smarter to get more creative to get better we just need a language for this yeah and I think it's the you know so of often language is a separator when it comes to health and performance tools and something I really strive for is to try and um create language that's not linked any one person that illustrates what something is for so maybe um no small task Cal but maybe we'll just uh have you rename boredom as um neural rewiring um epox or something like that I'll go up with the term my whole writing crew by the way is based on taking things people already intuitively know in their gut and giving it a two-word name and just having the language around that really matters like deep work oh okay that's like this activity I kind of knew that was important I didn't have a name or digital minimalism like oh yeah that okay I kind of know what that means like it's a different different philosophy towards it but there's all so I do have a name related to the the gaps we're talking about but but for one of the other negative effects right so we have the positive effects you talked about which is consolidation of learning and acceleration of learning we had the one negative effect which was the pavlovian connection to distraction the other one I've written about before is solitude deprivation right so so I'm using a different definition of solitude than the colloquial one most people think of it as a physical thing I'm I'm just isolated but there's a there's a cognitive psychological definition of solitude which means absence of stimuli created by other human Minds right so I'm not taking in information that's coming directly from another human mind U having no period with this Solitude so having no period in your day where you're free from stimuli creative from other Minds is Solitude deprivation and it's a real issue and partially it's a real issue because when we're processing input from another human brain it's all hands- on Deck right I mean we're very social beings a huge portion of our brain is dedicated to this right um so it's a very cognitively expensive activity when I'm trying to understand another human's what they're saying I'm simulating their mental state I'm trying to understand like where do they fall in this sort of social hierarchy and one of my arguments was um when you spend your entire day in that state it's exhausting and anxiety producing and like until we had smartphones and ubiquitous wireless internet the idea that you could banish all Solitude from your day is laughable it's just impossible right so of course we had a lot of portions of our day where our brain was not like ramped up in gear four like the sort of social processing mode but smartphones makes it possible that you can be in that mode all day long and so like one of the things I hypothesize is some of the anxiety Rises that goes with the age of smartphones is brain exhaustion right so that's another negative effect of the constant we have two negative effects now for the constant stimuli and one positive effect for the absence of the constant stimula so I think we're making a case here for not always being on your device yeah I agree one of my favorite literatures from neurosciences I think most people have heard of the so-call critical period stages of development when the brain is essentially hyperplastic to any input um for better or worse this is a stage of Life called childhood um and then of course people throughout the number 25 after age 25 plasticity possible requires more effort tension Etc and then sleep um so forth but we know based on really beautiful studies that if you deprive someone of sensory input um for even a few hours um and we're not talking about sitting in a completely blackened room um with no input but you essentially limit the amount of sensory input in the period that follows you get a uh an opportunity for a hyperplastic response to any stimuli and this just makes sense if you understand Basics about signal the noise in the visual system and uh and the and the Brain it just means when there's a lot of background shatter of stuff it's harder to see the stuff that matters and the stuff that the brains should rewire to um very computer sciency neuroengineering type perspective but um yes I would love for you to come up with a a two-word description of of this um it's not boredom induced plasticity it's this quiet induced hyper plasticity or something I don't know maybe we can Riff on this together sometime not trying to move into your space but um I have a very practical question um and I'd love to get a little more insight into the structure of your days um but are you a list maker like do you wake up in the morning and make lists and cross things off and then decide what are the key items on that list no I'm a Time blocker time blocker yeah yeah so I'm not a big believer in to-do list I I like to Grapple with the actual available time like okay I have a meeting here I have to like pick my kids up from school here here's the actual hours of the day that are free and where they fall all right what do I want to do with that time well okay now that I see that there's a lot of gaps in the middle of the day here they're short maybe there I'm going to do a lot of small non-c conly demanding thing oh this first 90 minutes in the morning is like the main time I have uninterrupted okay so this I'm going to work on writing so i' I've been a big believer of this since I was an undergrad like you give your time a job as opposed to having a list which is somewhat orthogonal to what's actually happening in your day and then just as you go through your day saying what do I want to try to do next which I think is a lot less efficient I'm going to try your method um I try and structure my as much as I can but it just never quite Works um do you work late into the night or you no no I'm I'm a 5:30 man okay yeah so 5:30 p.m that's it yeah more or less that's my cut off now the the one exception is um if I'm writing on Deadline I'll sometimes like if I need to get more writing done I can do uh an evening writing session which which I got used to through long experience of I used to write my blog post at night after like my kids went to bed now they're older and they don't go to bed as early so it's like the one thing have left that I'll do after 5:30 it's like every once in a while I'll do like a 90minut evening writing block um but I call this by the way this whole philosophy I call fix schedule productivity and I've been doing it since I was a grad student fix the work hour schedule that's my commitment I work in these hours um and then work Downstream from that for everything else so like this controls like even what you decide to bring into your life because you know I can't go past a schedule um and it drives you to be more Innovative in how you deal with your time and schedule you have to be efficient because you only have these these hours here uh that's been you know a signal for my my life since I was in my early 20s fix the schedule and don't work outside of that schedule now it's your move to figure out anything you want to do you have to make that work you want to become a professor figure out how to make that work you want to write books while you're being a professor figure out how to make that work you don't have the option of just throwing hours at it and you innovate a lot I think when you have the constraints where do sleep and exercise fit into your schedule uh what's your typical to bed time wakeup time what's your um typical exercise r and the reason I ask about this is because I think nowadays we hopefully people understand that exercise and cognitive function are are inextricably linked yeah and we're all going to live longer lives and be sharper mentally by doing exercise yeah so I mean my main like actual working with weights I do this pre- dinner right and this was an innovation the last couple of years it's it's a fantastic psychologically for me this is a transition from work to like family time after work so so I'll do like 45 50 minutes uh garage gym you know that we built during Co after I'm done working before dinner and once you get used to that like it also forces you like I got to finish work because I got to get this in before dinner but then I'll do also quite a bit of walking if it's not a teaching day so I'm not on campus uh I do a lot of thinking on foot um you know walking my kids to the bus stop which isn't particularly close in back so I'll do a lot of walking but that's when I my serious exercise now is always always pre- dinner then uh I want to be up you know in our room by 10 and then at that point I don't track so I have uh insomnia issues which which actually has been a key driver of a lot of the things I think about especially with slow productivity is I'm very wary because I can without any control on my own just find myself unable to sleep sometimes fall asleep or stay asleep fall asleep yeah I mean I used to get it really bad um not so bad now but you know it comes and goes that really affected the way I thought about productivity because it's seemed like to me the the definition of just I get after it with a bunch of stuff wasn't really on the table because if my notion of productivity depended on me like every day being able to just like hammer on a bunch of stuff I'm very busy I have lots of commitments what would happen if I couldn't sleep I wouldn't be able to do that so it I drifted naturally towards a definition of productivity which was it doesn't really matter if you work tomorrow but it is important that like this month you work like writing a book it doesn't matter if you work on your book chapter tomorrow in particular but like this month you have to spend a lot of time working on it so it was uh like an insomnia compatible definition of productivity was sort of morphed into this idea of slow productivity taking your your time with it so it's interesting so like sleep issues really shaped the way I thought about work and put me on these much longer time scales of productivity try not to be dependent on any particular day being critical to what you do I don't want the high stress situation I don't want the like I'm just going to 10 hours a day for the next 10 days we're going to make this deal happen like I can't operate in that space because I worry about it any time my brain could betray me and I could like lose sleep for a couple days I think it's really important that you're sharing this because while people's challenges differ I think oftentimes people hear the content of my podcast or other podcasts and think oh gosh I have to have everything dialed in just right when in fact most all of the tools and protocols that have been discussed on the huberman Lab podcast are in response to a particular challenge that I've had um or that others close to me have had had um and I I love this well I I'm sorry that you suffer from insomnia U we have a series uh on sleep with Matt Walker in which he lays out some some great tools that we haven't yet discussed on the podcast I'll just um send you I'll text you I'll call you with with a short list of those and hopefully they'll help but as we do cover insomnia in some depth but but I think it's important that people realize that they can be very productive with the hours that they have and the the moments or hours of of high focus clarity that they have um even if they're not sleeping great even if they're raising small children um because that's the real world and certainly that's the real world of deadlines and Academia but um family and um colds and flu and travel and jet lag and arguments and all the happy stuff too Vacations so um sounds like you're very good at adapting your day to what's going on around it but that you have certain sort of committed time um it am I correct in assuming that you have at least one period of say 60 to 90 minutes of real what you would call Deep work uh let's say at least 5 days a week I know that might be an underestimate but seems like that's what what I'm that's what I'm extracting from this that's the goal right so so to me uh depending on the season is how extreme I can get so the the busiest season would be like a teaching semester right but even then I'm going to make sure that five days a week I'm starting with deep work and the non-teaching days I'll more than the teaching days compare that to the summer for example where like all I do for the most part is deep work no meetings on Mondays and Fridays all admin stuff is uh midday to early afternoon Tuesday Wednesday Thursday um everything else is deep work you know just locked in you know hours at a time but I want if I'm not getting five days five days of starting the day with deep work I'm I'm unhappy right because I mean I keep coming back to this is okay because I'm not going to be able to I mean fortunately the insomnia doesn't bother hasn't bothered me in years but the the the threat of it like completely shaped the way I I think about things and because I know I'm never going to be uh have sort of like an Elon mus style energy of like I can just take on seven companies and make it happen right I just don't have that ability um I've always focused on the long game and to me the long game plays out with get your deep work time in you know just keep working on the stuff you do best and get better at it you know tomorrow doesn't matter but if you if you're doing this most days for the next four months like that's going to matter you know and so I often think about productivity in my own life at the scale of decades what do I want to do in my 20s you know okay what do I want to do in my 30s you know what do I want to do in my 40s you know U and that helps like in my 30s I had a lot of young kids like it's yeah I mean the amount of time I could spend total working is like much less right but I could still think about what do I want to do in my 30s how do I make that happen let me make sure I'm pushing like on those things then everything else I can adapt to I can give here and there you know it allows you to be very adaptable when you're thinking about what do I want to do you for the next 10 years it also means you're not on a random Tuesday chiding yourself because like why didn't I get three more hours of working that becomes sort of a nonsensical question when what you care about is like what happens in the next decade which is that's a long game it's not about you know hustling today it's about I came back to deep workk day after day after day when other people got distracted by Tik Tok you know like I'm GNA you whatever it's that coming back to what matters again and again years ago I was in a scientific competition SL battle and one of my tools it wasn't really the kindest tool was I would just suggest to the competitor um great television series so the wire you which at that time was great and um we won a few they won a few but um you know there's something very addictive about those um yeah Netflix shows I you know I mean they're unbelievably addictive just even seeing the the the um slider next episode slider come up you can skip the intro it's it's just like they've just dialed in um so I suggest those to competitors all the time no longer but um and who knows what role they played but I just noticed in myself um how distracting they could be they could take me to when I started watching Ozark yeah I found myself waking up in the middle of the night perhaps to use the restro or something and then starting another episode of O is wild and um I I wonder whether or not a way to reverse engineer one's way to uh productivity or reverse hack our way to productivity would be to think about all the ways that you would um benevolently deploy distraction for a competitor and then um ask yourself which which of those you're still engaging in and think of yourself as sort of in a competition with the highly distracted version of oneself yeah um because I think that one task um I think for us today is to try and think about for the person listening to this who's not an academic um who's hearing about all this distraction that enjoys some social media you know how how can they bring about the version of themselves in terms of productivity but also presence for family um presence with self um Etc and um and if one isn't in a competitive environment um then maybe it's about setting up different um mental maps of the self and then trying to pit them against one another and be the best version literally I think that's interesting right like think about what would be yeah what what I like this idea of thinking about my competitor you know what what would really give me a leg up you know am I doing this I mean but I would also add in here this is like a a slower productivity type idea um you figure out the thing you really care about you figure out what you would need to do to really show up for that thing and then if you're doing that like give yourself a break on everything else too you know what I mean it's like I'm this way with WR if I'm getting in my writing time I have to write I'm very uncomfortable when I'm not writing I just write all the time articles books you know I'm always writing if I'm getting in my writing time then it's like okay the rest of the day maybe like this week was kind of a loss like the kids were homesick or there was a crisis at the University or whatever and like I'm just trying to keep that under control and like have good productivity habits and like don't contact switch too much and don't be too distracted but still have your fixed of productivity like end at 5:30 every day uh and time block and try to be reasonable with that time limit the damage but if I'm doing the thing that ultimately really matters I'm going to be pretty happy with it so it's like moving the the definition of am I happy with what I'm producing away from a quantity metric and to this more am I aggregating the quality reps you know and like I think in weightlifting this would make a lot more sense right it's like yeah there's a there's a certain number of like a certain amount of time under load each muscle group needs to be on and like if I'm doing that I'm happy if I'm you know weightlifting right there's no notion of like why can't I why didn't I exercise five hours more this or that and so I sometimes try to think about my core intellectual work that way like if I'm getting in the core deep reps on the thing I care most about which for me is almost always writing then like the rest I just want to it's it's like damage control like I want to like do the other stuff well and like not get too stressed out about it and you know there's the productivity habits then that are about doing the stuff that matters and protecting it and then there's the habits that are all just about let's not let the other stuff get out of control um you know I find a little bit easier you go easier on myself when I think about it that way do you listen to music while you work no well the data certainly support not listening to music or if you do listen to music listening to music without lyrics yeah you have to train even to get used to it right I mean even to get used to music without lyrics you got to get used to it I guess your brain's building the filters um some people I have met have trained themselves to work with lyrical music which I think it took them a long time but I I met a self-published novelist who does like a million words a year which is crazy U and he blasts because he has four kids he blasts Metallica in NASCAR earphones and I like how do you possibly write like this I think he just trained his mind has just like a pure auditory filter that it's uh that it's he adapted I guess or maybe his books aren't that good I don't know I but I like silence or like background noise but even background noise is hard I have a hard time riding at cafes for example like I really do like lack of stimuli do you use visual blinders you know like some people actually do this they you it's like a hoodie and they'll like really try and tunnel their Vision which makes perfect sense from the perspective of Neuroscience I mean your visual World strongly constrains to the the narrowness or the or the um broadness of your cognitive Maps yeah I mean I just have my spaces engineered right so like where I write in my uh my library at home all the interesting windows are like behind me and over here I'm staring across to Windows that just is right next to the neighbors and like just typically blinds down well as you say this it just makes me want to you know shout that you know so many people who think they have attention deficit issues um have probably just put themselves in compromised environments which include smartphone um apps and things that I mean like like there's absolutely no way that they ought to be able to focus in fact perhaps the fact that they can focus at all is is miraculous given the the constraints like trying to run with shackles on yeah I I mean look we're used to this with physical stuff right if if we analogize to physical fitness we're so used to all these details right like it matters like what you're eating like how you're sleeping the details of how you train and when you train and how much like we're very used to this idea that that really matters we have no intuitions for cognitive development or application we we like treat our brain I guess because we associate it so much with a sense of self it's just this sort of um an effable connection to us as a person we don't think of it as much of an organ as like a muscle or something like this but we don't have a sophisticated vocabulary at all for thinking about how do you do stuff with your brain which is the if you're in knowledge work that's the whole game like the whole game is this brain takes an information adds value to it it alchemize value out of out of mind stuff and people who who alchemize value out of you know muscles I'm a relief pitcher in baseball I know like my whole job is like to take a certain muscles on my kinetic chain and use them to move a ball very fast and if I if I really am very careful about this I can have a multi-million dollar deal those of us who do this with our brain don't have any of these intuitions it's just like you know you have to uh work hard you know and we're on our phone all day I mean this has to be the physical equivalent if you had like an endurance athlete who was smoking all the time like this is crazy like this is directly contraint it's like you have to treat what you're doing like a a professional athlete with their their game like prioritize sleep prioritize food prioritize time prioritize you know it's and we as you point out we don't do that with the mind we we tend for cognitive stuff we tend to assume that we just flip a switch and like Focus time and I think that's in part because there are certain things such as social media such as a great movie such as certain social interactions that can immediately and completely harness our attention unlike a marathon or where sure I could probably finish the 26 miles or wherever it is 26.2 3 I forget what it is um if I had to do it right now to save my life but it's not like I can just hit a switch and and and I think that's the that's the kind of um caveat here is that the kid that loves video games can definitely Focus yeah give him or her a video game they love and boom they're focused so it seems as if there's a problem when they can't um but they know they can right stuff's obvious when States it but I think um it's worth pointing out that this stuff needs attention it needs it needs work yeah which means and it starts with vocabulary it starts with intention starts with examples you know I mean there should be a book like how to think that we just give to everyone learn and learn right yeah like how to use your brain like the user manual you know like that would be a very useful user manual and I think in like Elite cognitive professions this gets handed down as lore and people figure it out right I mean like this was like my experience training at MIT in the group is that you know everything was focused on getting the most out of your mind and so it's been passed down from you know person to person it was also in the culture it was in the way that people acted but most places that do cognitive work don't have these don't have these cultures yeah but here's the advantage though here like here's the Silver Lining right if you're one of the few who cares about it it's a huge Advantage right now like it's a it's a big part of like my success I don't think I have the highest horsepower brain but like it I care a lot about trying to you know get the most out of it like to push it to like the edges of like the Reps I can I can actually RPMs I can actually get out of it you know so it's an advantage as you know someone who's listening to this you start caring about your brain how it works how you want to take care of it what you want to get out of it you start caring about this um you're going to get advantages compared to the person right next to you like suddenly in your office or you know in in your grad program it's gonna be like what's going on here yeah you know little superpower and sometimes there's a bit of a social cost upfront yeah when I made the shift from being a let's just call it a not serious student to a serious student in college um and I was coming from behind I had to put so many more hours in and so partying was a something happened fairly seldom I still did it but and it was isolating actually lived alone in a studio apartment I mean it's isolating there you're you're going to miss out on certain things there there's some deprivation there but um you eventually end up in a position to do far more with your life yeah of course what um you said a moment ago also reminds me David goggin the David goggin no no introduction needed um has been um quoted as saying you know it's easy nowadays to be exceptional because so many people are just distracted and and wasting their time so you put in 20% more effort to being more focused or to uh toward your fitness program and you're going to you're going to surpass many many people so it's not that hard to accelerate it's just it it takes some practices that are um socially challenging to implement it's it's funny I had that same experience as an undergrad that you had yeah because I care preped I was impatient to be done with college and like to do things with my brain I want to be a writer I want to be an academic but you know that takes a lot of work and I I really cared a lot about it so I was a I was a uh fraternity brother for one day and I went to the first meeting where they're doing you know just held up pledging or whatever and I remember I this not for me and and I walked away I like I'm not gonna because this is going to be distracting like the the hangovers and this and that and and you know I want to focus on writing I want to learn how to do this it is pretty isolating yeah um and I know some people that were in the Greek system that also benefited tremendously from that I I wasn't one of them um but uh I I definitely resonate with it with so not everyone yeah I mean way saying is like they don't all have to be as intense as you and I were right um but but caring about your brain it gives you a lot of options and if you're playing catchup it there's almost always a social cost associated with it but you eventually are joined by many other people you find the other nerds that's been there's a lot of the other the other nerds Misfits and people who um who are who are you know seeking something uh they they come around you find you you find them uh I'm interested in this concept of burnout yeah um we hear about burnout um we associate with it too much adrenaline lack of sleep tired and wired um feeling disengaged the poet David White has a beautiful um poem I forget the title about burnout where he says that that I think the cure to burnout is wholeheartedness um and I I always like that's a bit more abstract than the kinds of things we're talking about today um but I like that because there's something about wholeheartedness um really leaning into something with with the the true desire to be there and to explore it no matter how hard that is um the opposite extreme of burnout yeah well I mean I think burnout in if we're thinking knowledge work like people with office jobs my diagnosis there it's not exactly quantity of work that that does play uh role it's the kind of work because I I think what's happening what what's been deranging actually for people in these jobs is uh workloads are getting larger right in part because communication is low friction and we always want to be demonstrating activity because of pseudo productivity and people are always asking us to do things we say yes everything we say yes to brings with it administrative overhead right which is talking about the thing but not actually doing it so it's like emails about the commitment it's a meetings about the commitment um because our workloads are larger what happens then is more and more of our time has to service this administrative overhead because everything we say yes to brings with it its own overhead it adds up it Aggregates right so now more and more of our day is spent talking about work and not actually doing the work and then make it even worse it's not like this overhead is all batched together it's sort of spread out throughout your day so it's also putting you in that state of uh constant distraction which makes it hard to do work what I think is burning people out is they're now in this state where they're saying I'm spending most of my day talking about work sending emails attending meetings very little time is left to actually make progress on the work and then the the workload gets larger and larger this by itself is deranging right this it feels like you're in some sort of um nihilistic experiment like what what is this why do I have six hours of meetings I'm not actually this can't be the right way to work um and then what happens of course is you have to recover time in the morning in the afternoon maybe after kids go to bed they try to actually make progress so now you also have just a straight where quantity is so you're working more hours there's an energy drain but I think that psychological piece of this can't possibly make sense that like I am checking email once every two minutes and spent six hours in Zoom like doing very little actual high value work like this can't be the right way to work that's what I think the burnout epidemic right now is coming from is it's that psychological component of we all know this is stupid but no one is saying the emperor has no clothes on we all know that the amount of email and meetings I'm doing is such a waste of my salary like this is a highly trained brain like I could be writing these reports or this code or creating these business strategies um but we're all just accepting this so I think the absurdity of the current situation is creating as much of the burnout as it is just we also have to add these extra hours there just like a straight aggregation of work quantity it's almost analogous to taking professional athletes or would be professional athletes and having them do a bunch of other physical labor so that they're showing up not fresh for the the game and little micro injuries and distracted and um and no one's admitting that this doesn't make sense and everyone's just getting injured and no one's talking about it so it's the absurdity of it would drive people crazy and it is driving people crazy it it's so difficult though because certain things like smartphones are very useful on the hospital Ward I mean doctors can communicate nurses communicate so much faster now um parents and kids can communicate who's going to pick up the kids nope got stuck in traffic you go this way alternate route Google Maps and and on and on so it's all woven in with stuff that's that's also highly adaptive it makes it tough yeah you know it's almost like the work of being a selective filter yeah is half the work of trying to deload the cognitive systems that would allow you to do deep work yeah well and in the workplace is even harder than that right because because part of the issue is email and slack let's just say digital communication um I spent a lot of time studying that closely right from like a techn Critic standpoint the introduction of digital communic to the workplace and the problem there is the reason why we're checking this all the time it's not some like individual habit deoptimization it's not oh I should just check this less often what happened is when we introduce low friction digital communication to the office this emerging consensus came about that said great let's just use ad hoc messaging as our major way of collaborating like we can just figure things out on the fly I can just be like Andrew what's going on with the whatever and you can answer me and I can send it back um this was very convenient the activation cost was low and so this is how we began actually collaborating on work now what happens is as workloads get higher we now have many things at the same time they're all generating these asynchronous back and forth conversations most of these have some sort of time sensitivity right so if I email you and say like what's going on with like the guests coming later today we have to kind of resolve this before later today um so now it's not just that these messages are going back and forth with all these different threads but I have to keep checking my inbox to make sure the gap's not too big this is not a failure of habits it's not a moral failure it's uh necessitated by the fact that all these back and forth conversations have to keep moving forward so it is difficult then if you're in this system to step out by yourself because this is the way we're collaborating is these asynchronous back and forth messages and I can't disengage myself from that without slowing things down like from a like a mathematical Game Theory point of view it's a suboptimal Nash equilibrium it's not the right place not the right way to run this the the the utility value of this configuration is low but no one individual can deploy a different strategy that's going to be higher value we're stuck in it right and so now it becomes really hard for an individual just to say I want to check my email less often it it's built in systemically into this hyperactive hive mind workflow and the only way to break free from the suboptimal configuration is to basically have the organization itself do like a really high cost change to the rules of the game these are how we're collaborating now we're not using email freely anymore we're going to use this system instead here you it's a very expensive top down procedure to free ourselves from the suboptimality it's like in the world of work that's partially why this is such an intractable problem I I tried to write a book about this recently um and it was really hard to gain traction because it's not easy to solve this like no individual can move out of this and you have to put in a lot of energy as an organization to try to to change this um so it's in some sense email is a a more insu problem than social media on the phone because at least over here this is my engagement with this and I might have these moderate behavioral addictions but I could make differences here in my company oh this is much worse this is like a systemic problem it's a an emergent deterministic work impact on a economic social cultural system that was completely dynamical and went in a way we didn't really expect so it's it's a it's a really tough situation sometimes especially in the world of work how do we get out of this constant distraction it's why you know I wrote deep work and I was like well why don't people just do this that's why they don't just do this because it's not so easy to to reclaim this time well it's like um when I was a graduate student in postto I was focused on eating pretty well meaning just clean-ish food and um people talked less about that at that time I was also really committed to exercise since I was 16 um people were less committed to that in the academic sector at that time now I think it's common place for people like I'm going to my yoga class I'm doing my zone 2 cardio I go to the gym you know men and women do this you know I remember having like like sneak off to the gym like oh yeah um and um you know you felt like a bit of a of an oddball if you were the one bringing your lunch to the the you know the pizza lunch in not there's anything wrong with pizza love pizza but I was trying to eat well I have for a long time I feel better when I do and I'm grateful that I did but you get some weird looks like oh do you have an eating disorder or something like that that's what people would say then yep um now people would probably look and go that looks better than the pizza people start to understand so I think there needs to be a cultural shift yep um and I think there has been a cultural shift around food and exercise certainly food meditation sleep y um I think people are far more accepting and actually encouraging of their workers and co-workers um taking really good care in order to function better for longer yeah I think it's going to be the next Revolution and it's going to be a revolution that's going to unlock we're talking on the scale of like a trillion dollar GBP when we go through knowledge work and have this revolution I call it like the cognitive Revolution let's take really seriously how the brains of our workers work like these are our number one assets like not to be too mechanistic about it but what is our main capital asset if we're a knowledge work organization we have some buildings but it's really these brains that we have like employment contracts with these brains create value let's take seriously how the brains actually operate and as soon as we do we'll say oh my God these brains are checking email once every two minutes what a disaster it's like if we had a car factory and we spent $20 million on one of these German robots that can you know put cars on the doors or whatever and we just weren't taking care of it and it was like rusy and it was dropping the doors and the production pipeline was going down like this is crazy we got to take care of this equipment right um when we have the cognitive Revolution the sort of cognitive Capital Revolution and knowledge work I think it's going to unlock a trillion dollar GDP I think that's how unproductive we've been if we just think in the pure raw terms of brains producing stuff that's worth money like if it's like super deterministic and kind of inhumane about it uh so much is being lost because we're in these suboptimal Nash equilibriums everyone just email everyone all the time everyone's just on slack all the time that when we finally have the revolution to get over that it's going to be a massive economic hit and you know AI might play a role in this right because maybe AI once it gets planning capabilities is going to be able to take the burden of some of this back and forth planning I think it's easier to get there with cultural shifts I don't think we have to wait to build an email capable chat GPT to do this like you could solve this tomorrow this is cultural as much as it's tool-based but I think it's going to be a huge Revolution when we get there akin to uh like the assembly line in manufacturing which was like a 10x Improvement in productivity metrics when we figured out the continuous motion assembly line with interchangeable parts was a massive it created this uh productivity engine I'm using the economics in productivity now um you know dollars per worker uh the economic miracle that came from this process-based industrial Innovations in the the late 19 early 20th century that the money generated by that the wealth generated by that was the foundation of the modern West like the whole world as we know it was built there's these huge latent potentials um and right now I don't think we're there with the brain and I think it's going to be a huge Revolution it's just it's just difficult right it's not an easy Revolution to start but I think it's going to change whole Industries in ways that we're it's going to be hard to even imagine yeah and I think as long as there are individuals who either by virtue of lack of family or other constraint or by virtue of just having more energy and requiring less sleep because these individuals do exist out there um there will always be these individuals that can kind of apply themselves more than others in the sense that they can get in earlier and stay in later um and and that trying to be them is not a good idea that we all need to optimize for our you know best balance of productivity deep work and um work life balance for lack of a of a better term uh when I was a graduate student um I was really committed to My My Craft and I remember that hearing about a student he's now a professor a very accomplished OC chronol just um I'll just give him a name because he he did this thing he doesn't know me but I heard about this guy that had been in the department Randy Nelson and everyone was like he used to work a 100 hours a week yeah so I was like all right great I'm going to start logging my work hours silently I'm going to do 102 hours and I ended up with a flu and an autoimmune condition I literally had an autoimmune condition I've never had one since and then I stopped working that much started working quote unquote smarter on the lines of many of the things you're saying here although I didn't implement or know about all these tools that time and of course the autoimmune thing went away it was a fairly minor thing never had it again but you can destroy yourself simply by working more yeah um even if it's deep work so that the solution is not necessarily more it's um just like with exercise I guess that stand it's obvious but I I thought I'd share that anecdote because uh Randy Nelson taught me what I'm capable of and what I'm not capable of yeah well the other thing that happens by the way too it's not just who's capable of working more get these advantages there's these other unpredictable inequities um I talked at a law firm once years ago about deep work and I was uh invited by a group it was actually a a group of women lawyers who had a reading group and they said part of what was happening at this Law Firm is that people who were uh disagreeable like just sort of gruff and jerks would get asked to do less of what they would call non- promotable activities or can you organize this or whatever which meant they had more time to do deep work uh which meant they would do better and they would rise faster and then what was happening then was you had accidentally built a system that said let's make sure we have a fast track for like our most disagreeable employees to the partnership level where actually you need to be pretty agreeable because you're uh client acquisition is really on the partners and so they accidentally had you know push towards this this uh inequity and these type of inequities happen all the time when we leave it like halfhazard and okay so who's doing less work like like well I just sort of like I'm Gruff and people don't like me or I have something going on at my house that means I don't have the the same time to do this um and you end up pushing people up these paths that might not be who you really want to select because you're selecting for uh things that are sort of unrelated to their actual underlying Talent or like how much they can actually produce and so I'm I'm with you on that yeah it's a complex problem but a tractable one nonetheless I'm interested in your thoughts on remote work versus in-person work and the hybrid model yeah um I've heard uh about a hybrid model recently a friend who owns a big um record company here in Los Angeles said that um they require one in-person day per week unless on sick leave um they require one at home day per week and then the other day is it's at your discretion yeah it's kind of an interesting model for in a five day a week model yeah I mean I my my proposals I've thought about this a lot is okay if you're going to do hybrid work and I I propose this Atlantic article recently which created some positive some negative waves I like here's the way you should do it uh synchronize the schedule here's at home days here's an office days but for everybody for everybody okay or have a few of these schedules but like groups of people who work together have the same schedule but then make the rule at home days no meetings no email like that's the way to really get the full benefit out of hybrid work when we're in the office we have meetings and we can talk about work and we're at home we're just doing work and we can do it without distraction and we can just stay deep and really turn through things I think it would really make a big difference on the overload issue I think it would be much more sustainable remote work so I did a lot of coverage of remote work as this was first emerging the early pandemic there I became convinced uh I was doing this twice a month column for the New Yorker back then that was just looking at the pandemic transforming work and I came away with the idea that remote work can be um fantastic but it's difficult and it can't just be do the job you were doing in person but just do it at home and we have zoom and we'll figure it out like if you're going to be full F remote we have to rethink what work means for that uh and there's a lot of differences it needs to have it needs to be way more structured it probably needs to be um you're working on less things it's very clear what you're working on the collaboration is much more defined and much less frequent you probably need to be freed from the sort of hyperactive hive my dance of we're just emailing each other all day and in Zoom meetings all day you have to sort of reconstitute what a remote work job is I think before it works and we know this in part because software Developers pre- pandemic we're one of the only knowledge sectors to have a a really successful track record with remote work that is the only sector within knowledge work where we had large companies fully remote they did that because their jobs they they had really structured them around these these agile workload Management Systems where okay here's when we talk about work here's how long it takes here's how we assign you new work you work on one thing at a time you sprint till it's done they had all this structure around work which then it didn't really matter if you in the office or not so the less structured work is the more free-for-all the more you need we have to be in the office so like I'm a huge fan of full-time remote work but I think those jobs have to look very different than like a standard 2019 job yeah I've always done a hybrid of remote work um I used to take Wednesday mornings at home from the lab yeah um but nowadays it's wild because especially during the pandemic but still now I mean you can do the whole day in pajamas and getting work done and I love this idea of no um no email and limiting text and social media while at home doing work to really extract the most out of it yeah are there any data um maybe from the pandemic era or um prior or Beyond about zoom and things like it in terms of how they enhance or diminish or perhaps have no effect on productivity like Zoom specifically and and meetings I we just found ourselves in Zoom all the time for a while that was the bigger problem I mean so so there is data that says for example a hybrid meeting some people are online some people aren't these are less effective meetings they don't they don't work as well um but the bigger problem with zoom I think was the quantity and and part of it was just the the technology involved right so so if we're in the office together and I have a relatively quick thing to talk to you about I can just grab you and we can talk about this and then the footprint is going to be five minutes that's not just that it's five minutes it's five well allocated minutes because I'm probably going to use the social cues of your doors open or you're going to get coffee anyways right um in the zoom era instead we would say well we should set up a meeting right because you know we have to talk about this but if you think about a standard online calendar it's difficult to have a meeting that's less than 30 minutes long I mean you just you have to drag it you know I mean 30 minutes is like the default smallest length meeting so we're taking a lot of informal back and forth and inflating the time I think that was part of it so we just had too much Zoom going on right if it was just I do one meeting a week now it's on Zoom it used to be in person we were all on Zoom we used to all be in person it's that's not that big of a deal it's maybe like a slightly less effective meeting but it's fine it's good enough but if it's I have 4X more meetings than I used to because of the the inherent inefficiencies of having to go to prescheduled Virtual for basically all collaboration that could be a huge problem the data I saw from Microsoft the last data I saw was a 22% increase in these meetings from 2020 to now and it's not a number it's not like it peaked and then it started coming back down again once we went to hybrid it we just it's just high and it's still creeping up right that's a lot of time that just vanished and we sort of pretend like it didn't but that's a lot of time that is not actively working on things and just talking about work or talking about other stuff while we get around to talking about work I think it's a real issue is there a top three list of things that if you had a magic wand you would see everyone do um each day you know if you had if you had three wishes um yes what would they be enhancing work creativity focused work I mean I think you and I both um clearly agree that there's not just great value in terms of productivity yeah but a great degree of of Life Enrichment yeah like a deep level of enrichment in terms of Happiness feelings of well-being con time for connectivity with others lessons about deep work that can be exported to time with others where we are really present Etc just so much be gained from these from engaging in deep work and things like it that you've written about in your various books um and talk about on your podcast are you know is there a top three yeah yeah yeah so if I do three I would say Okay um first of all with your workload simulate something like a pull system instead of a push system and what I mean by that is when you keep track of what you're working on have the the top part of that list which is I'm actively working on these things and keep that top part of your list to like two or three things everything else is in the bottom part of the list it's to work on next and it's in an ordered queue and so when you finish something that you're working on you pull something new to take a slot from the list below right so what I'm trying to do with that advice is reduce all this administrative overhead because now even if like you can't get away you have to say yes to these things because it's the way like your your organization works the stuff that's in the waiting to work on Q you said I don't have meetings about that I don't do emails about that I wait till I'm actively working on it and I only actively work on three things at a time now I'm going to finish those things really quickly because I don't have 15 items worth of meetings I'm going to every day so things are going to pull up there pretty quickly and so the rate at which I'm accomplishing things will probably be higher than it was before but I only work on three things actively you could even make this visible it's in a shared document if you want to when someone asks you to do something new tell them to put it on the end of your Cube they like oh okay so like Andrew is not working on this right now he's working on these three things and there's seven things here and I'm adding something number eight so I know not to expect something for a while um in fact I can keep checking this list until I see Andrew is working on it so I can see it's making progress and then once I know he's working on it I can start email him about it and we can do just a normal type of overhead you would have with with projects right uh that alone is going to have a huge difference like now the amount of distraction your day is going to uh plumm it because that's generated from overhead of things you've agreed to do and that's going to that's going to plummet that down all right so that'd be number one could I just thank you could I just ask a few questions about that just to clarify so for I use myself as an example selfishly but then of course I don't know what everyone else out there is pursuing but so substitute the specifics I'm about to insert here for whatever it is that you care about in your life so um researching podcasts yeah SOLO podcasts in particular for me is my major task in life these days yeah uh with respect to work so that would be top of the list yeah um and then um there could be two other items on this you know top of queue um would daily activities like like exercise Social time with loved ones Etc would that be included there or we're talking specifically about work yeah let's just keep just work okay so it would be you know podcast prep you might podcast prepcast you might have the particular topic though right right okay so right I'm working on an episode right now about about skin Health yeah um you could you could have two different episode topics you're prepping those could both be up there yep so skin Health allergies episode These are that I'm spending a lot of time on um months in fact yeah right and then your third might be something that that involves the uh the media company something around the business side like okay we're trying to figure out um a plan for whatever right content for forand Association or something okay got it great so that those three would be top of the list and every day until those are done they could sit top of the list and then there are a number of items underneath those that fall under whatever yeah and and critically when these other items come up right like oh this is like a topic for example I want to do a show on you have a place to put it where it's not being forgotten or here's a here's a business idea like we need to figure out like whatever we want to add do something with our camera configure okay put on the list so it's not being forgotten like it it's on there and you can see where it is not only is it on there but like this could be shared among your team so as people had extra information or things to add to one of these projects they can add it to it on the list right so the information is aggregating so if you use a tool like Trello for this Trello spelled t r l l o okay is it an app it's a webbased service that the metaphor is just index cards in piles it right but they're virtual um but you can flip over the index card digitally attach files write notes and and so I use Trello for my own organization what I'm working on so now you have a place where you can gather like oh we just I just heard about something that's relevant to this thing I need to work on you have a place to put it like it goes onto the Trello card or you could do this with shared documents doesn't matter you're just like literally typing things into a Google doc you know or a whiteboard or a whiteboard yeah yeah you could be we're keeping track of these things right I'm going to do this by the way yeah well I mean I'm a big believer in this and then everyone can see what you're working on um and then uh but the key thing is if it's not in your active list you don't have meetings about it and you don't have emails about it right like if people have ideas or things they just add it to the card so when that gets up to the active list we can work on all the information there we haven't forgotten anything and what two-word uh language do you use to describe this first point this method I love this I called it a pull based pull based right what pulled up you pull into the so you're fixing in advance here's how much concentration I have to give on work and you pull stuff into that the alternative is push based which is how most organizations run which is when I want you to do something I just push it onto you and now you have to deal with it got it um I once heard email described as a public post to-do list yeah that made me scared of email in a way that nothing else had um it's newport's pull-based system I called it that by the way um this is what in the a lot of the advice in the first uh one of the chapters of the new book is basically how do you get away with implementing this and when you have a boss and there's like all sorts of different so you're Your Own Boss you can just say this is what we're doing here's the board but there's a lot of like subtle ways you can do yeah um right so that's number one that's number one the um Cal newport's pull-based system I'm going to do this and I'm actually going to report back on this at some point um you won't see the post on social media because you're not there but others will all right so that's one all right number two would be multiscale planning okay so now this is planning uh you're planning on three different scales daily weekly seasonally or quarterly however you want to think about it right so you have a a plan for like the semester the season or the quarter like this is what I'm working on these are the big objectives I want to hit here's the reminders to myself about like what matters like remember like I'm I'm overhauling my my workout routine we're trying to like do this with the podcast you look at that scale of planning every week when you build your weekly plan and the weekly plan it just free form text you don't need anything you know any special tools your weekly plan you're looking at the actual calendar all right uh what from my bigger scale plan my seasonal quarterly plan what am I trying to make sure I can make progress on this week and you you confront the reality of your week you see where's the empty space or there's the busy space you also change what's on your plate right here you know if I cancel this thing that frees up that whole morning which means like I could really make progress on this which I really want to make progress on so great I'm going to cancel that thing on Friday so you're looking at the whole week as one unit then every day you look at your weekly plan like okay so so I'm going to use this when I make my plan for the day and when you do your daily plan you do time blocking now I'm every I'm giving a job every minute on my workday not my day after work but every minute on my workday I'm time blocking so I call it time blocking because you're literally drawing blocks around the free time okay this I'm working on this this I'm working on this so you're making a plan for your day that is informed by the weekly plan so in multiscale planning you have like the the big picture things you care about trickle their way all the way down to okay I'm what am I going to do during this hour during the day um but you don't have to Grapple every this what most people do every time I'm figuring out what to do next I'm not grappling with all these scales at the same time what are my objectives what's my big plan what's going on this week uh you're you're dealing with each of these scales when the time is right and so when it finally gets down to it's now 3:00 you're just doing what that block is and you figured out that block earlier today when you looked at your weekly plan that weekly plan reflected what was in your semester plan which you figured out you spent a whole afternoon working on at the beginning of the semester so multiscale planning uh it keeps you focused on what matters it prevents you from wandering through your day and how you disperse your energy um and it gives you control over your time on different scales from like canceling major ongoing obligations to just being more efficient about what you do during a given day uh so I swear by multiscale planning to try to keep this whole lumbering ship that is sort of like Kell Newport um aiming in the towards the right Shores you know like keep correcting and keeping it aimed back I love this I this is more or less what I do with my physical workouts every week I know I'm going to get three resistance training sessions two or three cardiovascular training sessions I know I'm going to train my legs once it's either going to be on depending on travel Sunday Monday or Tuesday I'll train torso muscles in the middle of the week I'll train sort of um limb accessory muscles on a Saturday yeah long run on Sunday or hike on Sunday or some other day there'll be some sort of hit workout in the middle of the week and ideally there's a jog in there too and you can adjust it a little bit based on the reality of the week yeah I might double up for two days then take a day off I have my ideal schedule but sometimes it gets compromised and um and then I do that for 16 we Cycles where I vary the kind of intensity load Etc um and I've done this for years and it's just kind of works for me um now with cognitive work I tend to do this it tends to be more deadline based yeah but I think that the um the pull-based system is really going to help um if I dovetail it with this multiscale planning um I love this and you can see the deadlines now you see them coming right so that's part of what's nice about multiscale planning is you know the deadlines coming up and so when you're doing your semester planning you start thinking like okay the big deadlines like when I get to December I need to be really starting getting after this thing that's going to be due I've got a book due yeah so then you know and so this really helps me bookwriting because now when I'm planning it's like you know a year in advance I know this month I need to get like roughly the rough draft of chapter 2 done you know and then that trickles down to my week where I'm going to make sure I have enough time cleared to like be on track for finishing it and then that trickles into my day now I know to like block those mornings to work on it so it all it all works together an added bonus of the daily scale is I would say communication should get its own block email social media whatever that's like you communicating with the outside world goes into your time block plan so if your block doesn't include that you don't do it so it's like this block is writing it's not email it's not social media so the rule is really simple I'm not going to use email or social media um but I still need to do email at some point so I have to put a block in for it and when I'm in my email blocks I'm doing the email if I need to go on social media to see what's going on with like the latest episode or something I got to give that time and then you can mono Focus because then uh it's a psychological hack but basically um when you particularly would you schedule communication and distraction now the only thing you have to muster willpower to do is obey the single rule of I'm follow me in my blocks if you don't do that if you're like I just sometimes do email and social media sometimes I don't now what you have to do is just constantly be having this debate is now the right time to do this I know I'm going to do it at some point today why not now well what about now what about now like you're just constantly asking yourself right that's impossible right that's going to drain you but if all you have to do instead is say my commitment today is to follow my blocks and I get I really feel good when I do it and like I check off a box if I do give yourself some feedback here it's a much easier cognitive battle to win than just trying to be reasonable about well let me wait a little longer to check my email like you're going to lose that battle you know eight times out of 10 which is like enough to to Really overcome it so that's like a a hidden bonus of time blocking is now you can really get your arms around separating different cognitively distinct activities this is where the analogy of time restricted eating comes to mind yep um again not that that's the best way to lose weight or maintain weight or it's its role in longevity is still debated Etc but I think for many people not all but for many people the decision that they do not eat during certain time blocks and they do eat in other time blocks is just far more tractable in the real world for them than trying to limit portion size decide whether or not they're going to eat they going to pass the cookie and have a little bit nope they're they're in their fasting window it's just it simplifies the issue yep and as a consequence I think it improves um Behavior overall although the clinical trials point to some mixed results with that last statement again I don't want the uh nutritionist does after me the point is the time blocking and the and the the the thick black lined of the yes no the binary yes no as um eat don't eat or single commit email communicate don't communicate in a given time BL I think that's that really um is what it's about it it honors the the the power of of those sorts of neural computations and there's another hidden bonus of time blocking too is visually distinct blocks so what I do for example is I put uh double thick line around deep work blocks focusing on some not just deep work but deep work on things I really care about this just gives you a visual record how much deep work am I doing right like it's this diagnosis I use a a paper based time block planner so uh you flip through those pages and you're just looking for dark blocks right so you see if I see I don't have a lot of dark blocks I say this is my whole job like my whole life I've been trained in a lab to think really hard about things and write things why do I not have very many dark blocks you get this feedback mechanism so there's all these bonuses when you start doing this type of doing this type of planning before you tell us about number three I often have fantasized about a web-based program that seems to run countercurrent to much of what you're talking about but goes back to this the Whiteboard MIT Observer stuff that you talked about at the beginning which is I often longed for okay I need to write today I need to write a book or I'm going to do some podcast prep I'm going to pop up a few Windows of other people that are also doing deep work and we're not going to communicate in fact if we do or if music comes through on the microphone or somebody coughs that's going to be considered a distraction but if does anyone want to join me for some deep work yes where we don't communicate and I've often thought I would just pay someone to be there yeah to just sit there and um but I haven't done that there are multiple companies that do this okay yeah it's interesting where you you're you're online with with uh or in person with just other people doing deep work so a deep work Club the challenge is synchronizing schedules because I might want to do this with somebody on the east coast and they might not be doing deep work at the same time and a recording isn't the same because then you know they're not really watching but but there's something really to this right I especially for at home workers or people like me that work often in isolation students do this right dissertation boot camps I don't know if if you had this experience but Georgetown does a lot of colleges do this uh okay everyone working on their dissertation we're all going to get together and we're going to work on it together because they would often have me come speak at these things earlier in my career it would just be a bunch of grad students they were just coming to the same space and they would work for like okay 90 minutes and then they would have like a speaker come in or launch and 90 so the the group cohesion of everyone working deeply at the same time writers Retreats are the same way we all go to the same house in the middle of nowhere um so that we're all just going to encourage each other to write because that's all what everyone's doing here yeah so social pressure I'm with you I was thinking if I ever needed to you know put a big extension on my house that's that's what I should do just like okay pay me money and I will sit there on zoom and do deep work with you this is my secret plan i' pay money I'd pay money to do deep work in parallel with you by with a virtual window there there's C in his office doing that I think there's something nice about having some knowledge of who people are you know like hey logging in today yeah yeah all right let's get down to it set the timer and go and then you know AA I'm out you know working at the library academic libraries why do people do that right just everyone there is working right yeah no I'm a big believer in that there's really something sticky to that okay number three all right uh have a shutdown ritual which clearly demarcates uh the end of work in the start of the night after work and the shutdown ritual so it has to uh you have to close open Loops right so you got to make sure this is like a a review type period let me look back at my inbox and look at my plan let me look at my you know my time block in my calendar um really make sure I there's nothing urgent that needs to be dealt with that I didn't and there's nothing that's just in my head that I don't want to forget it's not written down somewhere like take care of all of that right so you review all these things you get what am I going to do tomorrow you don't have to build your whole plan for tomorrow but you have a sense for it um and then you need some sort of demonstrative thing you do to indicate that you finished the routine right so my my longtime newsletter readers know I used to actually have a I would say schedule shutdown complete like a crazy phrase right it's not how normal people talk right um now I have a planner that has like a checkbox that says shut down complete next to it the reason why that it's a demonstrative anchor is that you use this then for cognitive behavioral therapy because at first people have a hard time shutting down work I mean I invented this because I had a very hard time shutting down working on my dissertation I just what if this proof doesn't work and blah blah blah so what you do is when you're you get a rumination post shut down down hey what about what's going on with our work are we doing the right thing do we forget this or that instead of engaging in the rumination well it's like no I think we're okay let me think about my schedule tomorrow what's my plan you instead can just say um I said that crazy phrase or I checked that box I wouldn't have said that phrase unless I had gone through everything and made sure that I had a good plan and nothing's being missed and it was okay to shut down work because of that I'm not going to engage with you rumination I said the weird thing let's get back to what we're doing this is like cognitive behavior therapy that after a month or so you were really able to actually uh effortlessly disengage from work and do everything you know all the other stuff that matters right without having the constant ruminations about work which gives your mind an actual break to you know do other things so I mean this is more mental health than productivity but for me it was critical I mean I can really remember when I came up with this you know exactly where I was in my grad student career and there's just too much too many ideas and concerns that were just roiling and like once I did this you know it took a few weeks and then I could actually like shut down and go on and do other things yeah the par associative nature of the brain can make it um really problematic if you're thinking about work at the dinner table you start to associate the dinner table with work I mean when Matt Walker came here to do this six-part series that's soon to be released um and we were discussing insomnia he said you know one of the major issues with insomnia is people who have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep will often stay in bed when they can't sleep and then the bed becomes associated with challenges with sleep that you know hence the recommendation that virtually every sleep coach and sleep scientists um recommends that people actually if they can't sleep for 20 minutes or so of effort then you get up and leave the bed and go someplace else until until you feel sleepy enough to go back and try or fall asleep on the couch elsewhere um I put put that in as a as a as a note to you um but um this seems incredibly important also for enrichment of of relationships with spouses and children and people in your life I mean the the problem is the first thing that we ask people when they walk in the door typically was how was work today yeah how was work what' you do today yeah tell me about your school day tell me about your work maybe we need to come up with better questions yeah like here's something interesting we could do or here's like something I read about unrelated the work yeah no I think that I think it makes a huge difference uh and again there's all these meta benefits for these things so so one of the meta benefits for all of these is also these are all very structured you'll begin to build a reput as someone who is very careful about how they manage themselves in their time like if you're doing multiscale planning and certainly if you're doing you know pole Bas workload management people are going to start thinking this is someone who thinks a lot about like how they manage their workday and how things happen this gives you massive leeway right yeah because we we think what like our colleagues want from us is accessibility but really why they want accessibility is because uh they have no clarity about you know are we going to do this thing are we going to remember to do this thing um am I going to have to keep bothering you you know what if I don't really think you have your act together I just wish you would just do this right away or respond to me right away because I'm going to have to worry about this until I hear back from you that you did it like accessibility is born from lack of trust or lack of clarity right so if you have the reputation of someone who really has to act together you can for example lean into a shutdown I don't do email at all and people they don't think that you're being lazy or that you're not keeping up with the work they're like no like Andrew has his act together with this stuff I trust him when you show them something like this workload management system like this is where the queue is like I can't get to this yet like okay that's reasonable like you have your act together so there's this meta benefit of starting to get a little bit more structured about your your time and cognitive work is that people will give you more flexibility to work with the better you get at actually working with you know the resources you have as your reputation grows um your autonomy grows yeah and of course as your reputation grows um more gets thrown at you it probably takes a bit more discipline to to enforce these things but I always remind myself and other people that you know the reason people want to access you is because of presumably the consequences of the deep work you did yeah not um but people love meetings gosh do they um I won't do brainstorm meetings anymore unless it's with my close team it's like you can pitch me a contract and we can reverse engineer the idea you know um but it just doesn't work to to meet with people and kind of brainstorm stuff but I don't know what this is like I think maybe people are taking their own lack of structure and um projecting it onto other people as a way to fill the time yeah it's Pudo productivity as well like this is what I have like visible activity and so let's can we have meetings let's talk let's hop on calls like that all feels useful when ultimately it's not like I'm with you on it like remember the reason why everyone wants to talk to me is because not I'm so great at brainstorming meetings you know people like this is great like Andrew's great at brainstorming meetings so that's why you want to bother no it's because you were really good at podcasting you were doing like the Deep thing and then that brings in the better you get at what you do best the more the world conspires to take away your time to actually work on it uh like professors know this well like pre- 10 year they most big universities are pretty good at preaching the professors all that's going to matter is going to be your research but they throw a ton of other stuff at you at that time it depends on the school like I would say like Georgetown was very good about this they're like we don't uh from our perspective it's a waste of resources to hire you and and have you not get tenure so like we want to try to protect you from the service requirements low for example and like just focus on you know just focus on your research because that's what's going to matter and at least professors know this right like uh there's a clear process like the tenure process most people don't understand tenure they think it's like getting promoted at a job and there's like all these different ways you can sort of impress your boss it's none of that right I mean it's these confidential letters from leading scholars in your field that are doing nothing but brutally assessing your research how good is Cal who are two people who are better than him on the market right now who are like two people he's slight better than would you tenure him at your University what university could he get tenured at I mean it's all that matters is yeah research quality um so you have to somehow ReDiscover what that is if you're not a professor like ultimately like this is the thing I do best for my company so let me do that let me do that really well there's also an aspect by the way of uh if you do a deep thing really well that does not attract as much work as if what you do is you're just really good at like responding to people's things and putting out fires it's like you don't want to get too much trapped in that game unless that's the game you want to play you know if you get trapped in the game of how I distinguish myself as I reply right away doesn't matter when it is I make your life easier you're playing the game of making other people's lives easier and that's what they're going to ask you to do but if instead you play the game of I'm competent with this like I'll respond to the emails and not be uh I won't be pathological about it but the real thing you care about is like this code I'm producing or these reports on producing are just really Second To None then you're not going to get a much of the small stuff they're like okay well do that then you know like that's what we want that's what we want you to work on so like what is your equivalent of research is probably a really key question for a lot of people how do you treat um social engagements through work like you know like the company barbecue I don't know anyone does company barbecues anymore but um you know like happy hour or I don't know if anyone does that either um and social engagements with family like you know because obviously those things are important too yeah um are those on your schedule well you know I treat uh work schedule different from notw work schedule right so my work schedule is this time block plan part of a multi-scale plan um really dialed in like when I'm working I'm working right um but then when I'm not working I'm way more LAX you know so I don't do time block planning of my weekends or my evenings uh the work shutdown being clear gives you more flexibility there so it's like okay what do we want to do like let's go like see these people let's do these things with the family um I like to be flexible and not overly planned outside of the work day but then during the work day itself you know it's much more machine like so you're you're fairly um not laxed but you're a bit more relaxed around social engagements and engaging with the kids but at at work or when you're working at home or or in the office you're you're obese yeah I'm like a black box in the work days like when I'm when I'm working like I disappear nice yeah and then when I'm done like I'm I'm around but like my family and friends and they've learned like if you text me during the workday I'm I'm not part of that game of like I'll just respond back to it people know like it may have been four hours since I saw my phone that's like Lex fredman yeah and people often ask to get in touch with Lex and I've you know made that connect for a few people but I always point out you know Lex will go long periods of time where we don't connect and then we're close close friends we spent a lot of time in person on the phone text but I understand that if I text Lex I might not hear from him for four or five days and it's all good yeah you know it's just in fact that it tells me he's good it's like that that scene at the end of Goodwill Hunting where he's like I just want to show up at your house know you're not there he gets there and he smiles his friend's gone he knows he went the direction of of his of his heart you're saying if you start to get a lot of like memes texted to you from Lex that's not going to happen you're going to be like what's going on that's never going to happen What struggle what struggle are you having in your life right now I'm a big believer in the phone I'm old school pick up the phone make a call we'll get on a call sometimes FaceTime um we do text one or two things back for it's AES and really quick yeah really quick and I have other friends in the podcast space for which it's the same it's just um phone is a great tool yep and you know drop in and then get back to it not a lot of chitter chatter on I like that I I always like text is like a great logistical tool you know like wait what what restaurant are you at oh you know okay I'll meet you there or are you free to talk like I love text as a logistical tool but you're right as a conversational tool yeah it's not for me either and do you take vacations where you are on pure vacation so just with family or or maybe even Solo or with your spouse where it's like no digital anything uh yeah digital's not a problem for me on vacation but my wife won't let me not bring something to work on on vacation because because I become a monster got it your brain needs that it needs it yeah when we had little kids I tried this right I was like okay like this is it I'm not going to think about anything like this is and I would just become a like an anxiety case so what I've learned is bring one thing that's like very deep and non-urgent um like a book concept I'm trying to make work or an academic paper that I was like trying to crack or like something new and I need like that 90 minutes a day to like walk on the beach and think and I have to have a notebook I have it with me in here I have to have a notebook with me so that like I can capture notes and get them out of my head on vacation and that now we have a happy medium like I work a little bit every day no email I don't get not email not no deep work thinking uh I'm much happier it's like an itch that you have to scratch yeah if I'm not writing or thinking it's it's I I get cognitively antsy I get anxious you know like I'm on I've been now I'm talking to you now but I've been you know traveling doing some podcasts and stuff like this and I'm way out of my cognitive comfort zone here because I'm not vlogging like early in this trip I I was uh on a New Yorker and Atlantic deadline like riding all the time you know California time up at 5:00 am like you know and I'm done with that now and I'm really cognitively ay like I just feel out of sorts right now you know like I'm not working I'm not thinking love it Cal I for me this has been such an honor I mean I should have said this at the beginning of the episode but I've been such a fan for such a long time um long before we met or communicated at all uh I started reading your books and um I would say you and Tim Ferris are the people who early in my academic career had such a profound influence on how I approach work and and it required that I do things um kind of against the grain people around me and very quickly I saw um that I was making progress much faster than I would have otherwise yeah and I never looked as a competitive Endeavor with others but and um you've just continued to churn out valuable information actionable tools you know book and after book after book and um and obviously they require some structure and some some restriction but also some moving toward um action items and I love these these top three that you provided us um the the pull forward the uh multiscale planning and and the shutdown ritual and all all the others um that you put forth and I guess the the um major takeaway for me today is is that yes you've developed all these tools but you also use them and um it's not lost on me that you also have a flourishing career as a computer scientist so you're not just somebody who talks about and here I'm not dissing anyone else in the in the information sphere like just talks about habits or just talks about protocols you do these things and you implement them in the context of your work life your creative life your family life and your relationship to self and you exercise and um and I think that that all combines to to be an amazing example of what's possible if we introduce um a bit of understanding about how we function as a as a being um and that we Implement some of these tools in in the user manual that that you've come up with and so I just want to say on behalf of myself and everyone who's listening and watching you know thank you so much this is incredibly valuable information regardless of what one is doing in life and um I'm certainly going to implement this um three-step uh system and I do have the book I always like to read books after guests are on I'm going to read the book um and I'm going to do some posts about uh what I uh experience as a consequence so thank you so much I would pay a substantial amount of money to do deep work sessions with you in the on the screen there but I won't put that on you I'm just going to I'm going to just bite down and and uh and do this stuff so thank you so much for being a Pioneer in this space and for such a clear Communicator we all owe you a debt of gratitude oh thanks Andrew well and for the rest of us professors who are also podcasting we owe you a debt of gratitude because you're showing us what's actually uh what's actually possible so this has been great meeting you as well has been fantastic right well thank you we won't um we won't see each other on social media but we'll we'll share a meal at some point U before long thank you for joining me for

Title: How Placebo Effects Work to Change Our Biology & Psychology
Published: 2024-03-04 13:00:37 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I discuss placebo and belief and mindset effects — all of which exert a powerful and real influence on our biology and psychology. I discuss how your beliefs and expectation that a certain outcome will occur after taking a substance (or any intervention cause genuine changes in brain and bodily function. I discuss how placebos can change neurotransmitter and hormone release, pain levels, whether the stress response is beneficial or detrimental and more. I also explain how placebo effects can work with traditional drug or behavioral treatments to help improve health outcomes and why some people are more susceptible to placebo effects. By the end of the episode, listeners will understand the placebo effect, how it works, and how beliefs and mindsets can be leveraged toward mental health, physical health, and performance goals.

Title: AMA #16: Sleep, Vertigo, TBI, OCD, Tips for Travelers, Gut-Brain Axis & More
Published: 2024-02-29 23:00:31 UTC
Description:
Welcome to a special edition of the 16th Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of Huberman Lab Premium, recorded in Sydney, Australia. This episode is a recording of a live stream AMA, originally exclusive to our Premium members. We've decided to make the full-length version available to everyone, including non-members of Huberman Lab Premium.

Huberman Lab Premium was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the main Huberman Lab podcast — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.

If you're not yet a member but enjoyed this full-length livestream AMA, we invite you to join Huberman Lab Premium at https://www.hubermanlab.com/premium. By subscribing, you'll gain access to exclusive benefits including our regular monthly full-length AMA episodes, AMA transcripts, podcast episode transcripts, early access to live events and more. Additionally, a significant portion of your membership proceeds contributes to advancing human scientific research. You can learn more about the research we were able to support in our Annual Letter 2023: https://www.hubermanlab.com/annual-letter/2023.

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello, everybody, and welcome. I want to thank all of you premium Huberman Lab podcast subscribers for joining. This is an exciting one. Even though the backdrop here looks very much like the studio back in the United States, I am doing this AMA live from Sydney, Australia, where I and the Huberman Lab podcast team have been for well over a week. We were in Melbourne. And we just did two live shows here in Sydney. And we're headed off to Brisbane tomorrow. And it's been absolutely delightful. We've had so much fun talking science, learning from people. It's a wonderful place. I want to get right into your questions and do my best to answer as many of them as possible, as thoroughly, clearly, and succinctly as possible over the next hour. So I'm going to dive into those in just a moment. Just one last important thing before I do that, which is that I want to thank everyone for being a premium subscriber and let you know that we, based on your contributions to the premium channel, have already, as you know, supported four laboratories at Stanford Columbia University Salk Institute and elsewhere for important projects on humans that are already leading to important therapeutic breakthroughs that we will soon share with you on the Huberman Lab podcast. But that this year, 2024, we were fortunate enough to secure no fewer than three dollar for dollar match donors who have generously agreed to match our contributions from the premium channel to additional projects. Those are going to head out to a number of different universities and researchers working again on human studies, so no animal studies. Human studies on important projects. Everything from novel treatments for mental health issues, headache and migraine, some interesting stuff on immunology and cancer, mindsets and immune system function, and much, much more. Also nutrition, physiology, exercise physiology, et cetera. So your contributions to the premium channel really do make a difference. I can say this because I'm familiar with the challenges of raising funding for doing truly breakthrough work and getting things quickly out to the general public. So thank you, thank you, thank you. And now, without further ado, let's get to your questions. The first question was, is how are you managing to achieve your key health pillars while in Australia and any other place you've enjoyed doing so, all while working so hard? Well, thanks for the question. I'll answer this question in the context of what I think we all can, and should, and really will do because if you're a premium channel subscriber, I'm certain that you're taking your health seriously. So first off, I think there's a bit of a misconception about the protocols on the Huberman Lab podcast being that we are all, including myself, super, super regimented about them to the point where we don't enjoy other things in life, and that's simply not true. So I view the protocols of the Huberman Lab podcast as science-based, actionable, low cost, zero cost, minimal cost in almost all situations. There are a few exceptions to that. But it really designed to mesh with the rest of life and enhance mental health and physical health, which of course, means remaining social staying, on typical sleep schedules, et cetera. So the big ones for me when arriving here were, of course, to get morning sunlight as often as possible. We saw a beautiful sunrise this morning over Sydney. But even on the overcast days, we've had a few rainy overcast days to really make it a point to get outside and to get that morning sunlight. Also, our crew did travel in with a red light. Not a red light panel, although I do have a couple red light panels. Those little portable ones that I use from time to time. The red lights I'm referring to in reference to answering this question are the red lights which are just red light bulbs that I actually travel with a little red light bulb unit. It's just like a small screwing unit. You plug it in here with an adapter of course. And then in the evening, we've switched off the lights in the place where we're staying, and it just brings the overall levels of cortisol down low very quickly, and it makes it very easy to get to sleep each night. It makes a big, big difference. And this is a very low cost tool. You could essentially purchase any red light, even red party lights, and put those up, and then switch off the regular overhead lights. It makes a big difference, and it's probably even cost-saving. We've also stayed fairly regimented about exercise. So this morning, we took a great jog down to the ocean, jumped in the ocean. If you don't have access to an ocean on vacation, just getting outside and getting some movement early in the day can help shift your rhythm. Really the quadfecta of shifting your circadian rhythm in a new place or becoming an early riser if you want to do that is morning, sunlight movement, social engagement, and in my case, caffeine. Although some people would opt for eating breakfast, I just happen to prefer to eat a little bit later in the day. So when you combine those things, you are really amplifying that morning cortisol increase that I've talked about on the podcast. Morning catecholamine release. So dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. And those act in synergy to create more early day and daytime mood focus and alertness and enhance the transition to nighttime sleep. But of course, that dimming of the lights and maybe even red light in the evening really, really can help. And so those are the biggies. And then of course, if you want to shift your circadian rhythm really quickly to be on a local schedule, it helps to hop on the local meal schedule. But for me, that always means skipping breakfast. I'm not a big breakfast eater. I like lunch and afternoon snack sometimes and dinner. So when you do all of those things, it makes it very easy to stay with the health pillars. And of course, stress control is important. We're doing lives. There's a lot of work to do. So there's a daily for me non-sleep deep rest or yoga nidra protocol. By the way, you may be familiar with non-sleep deep rest and yoga nidra. Terrific zero cost practice for reducing stress, replacing or replenishing dopamine and mental and physical vigor. I've talked about this and the studies that support this on the podcast. There's a Huberman NSDR script on YouTube. That's, again, zero cost. But while down here, we recorded a 10-minute, 20-minute, and 30-minute NSDR script with a view of a beautiful Sydney sunrise. Those should be posted to our Huberman Lab clips channel in the not too distant future, probably in the next couple of weeks. And then you can have different duration NSDR scripts that you can use, again completely zero cost, any time you like. We've recorded also some additional meditations, and we're considering putting out a Spotify album, if you will, of NSDR and meditations that are science-based, of different durations. So if you like that idea, maybe just give a shout into the internet, and hopefully we'll hear it, or put a comment on the latest episode of The Huberman Lab podcast on YouTube. And if that sounds like a good idea to you, we will do more of that. These are, again, zero costs, zero to access tools for enhancing mental health and physical health. So combining all of those is really what we've done. Next question is I have followed your sleep advice, and I have seen a huge improvement. Great. Happy to hear that. Wonderful. But I still wake up at night and only get five or six hours. Is that enough? Can you please give more advice if possible? Well, first of all, thanks for tuning in to the sleep advice. So the question of whether or not five or six hours is enough really depends on person context. And by context, I mean it can even change across the course of the year by life circumstances. The criteria for insomnia are very clear. Insomnia is excessive daytime sleepiness due to lack of sleep at night. Excessive daytime sleepiness due to lack of sleep at night. So if you're not falling asleep during the day and you feel reasonably good throughout the day, maybe you only need a brief 10-minute to 30-minute nap in the afternoon. Some people nap. Some people don't like to nap. Doesn't matter. But if you feel pretty good throughout the day and you have enough mental and physical energy and focus to complete the activities that you need to complete, then I wouldn't worry so much about five to six hours, and I wouldn't obsess over these kind of scary things that we hear. Oh, if we're not getting seven to eight hours, that we get dementia, et cetera, because that's not necessarily the case. Everyone has different sleep needs. The other thing, and this is perhaps the most important thing for everybody listening to this really to think about is QQRT, which is quality, quantity, timing, excuse me. Quality, quantity, regularity, and timing. QQRT. QQRT. Which is an acronym coined by the great Matt Walker, author of the book Why We Sleep. He has his own terrific podcast in his own right, has a series on the Huberman Lab podcast coming out soon. QQRT is what you really need to think about when you think about your sleep. So you want to think about the quantity. How much are you getting? Well, you, Rema, who asked this question, are getting five to six hours a night. OK, what about the quality of that sleep? Is it consistently five to six hours with no breaks, or is there a break in the middle? One trip to the restroom in the middle of the night is considered normal and healthy for most people. If you're making multiple trips to the restroom in the middle of the night or you're waking up multiple times throughout the night on a regular basis, that's something to try and overcome. So the quality piece is important. Also, whether or not you remember your dreams or you don't, you want to make sure that you're getting ample amounts of slow wave sleep, which dominates the first half of your sleep night, and rapid eye movement sleep, which dominates the second half of your sleep night because they have different roles in recovery of brain and body. Namely slow wave a.k.a. deep sleep is responsible for growth hormone release. Rapid eye movement sleep responsible for the unpacking or the uncoupling of emotions to prior day and previous day experiences. And in that way, acts as a kind of scrubbing out or a therapy for your emotional state. So are you feeling emotionally rested when you wake up is a good indication of whether or not you're getting enough rapid eye movement sleep. Some people like to sleep trackers, using their Eight Sleep or their WHOOP or their Oura Ring or something like that. I'm a fan of sleep trackers, but I think that relying too heavily on sleep scores can be risky. There are data from Alia Crum's Lab at Stanford showing that if people receive a poor sleep score, even though they slept well, their performance will drop. If people get a good sleep score, even though their sleep was lousy, their performance is maintained or even enhanced. So you don't want to take any one sleep score and overinterpret it. You want to look at the average and compare that to your subjective experience of sleep. Maybe I would say go about halfway through your day if you can bear to do it before looking at your sleep score and see how you feel. Then look at your sleep score as opposed to the other way around. That might be a good way to adjust for that belief effect I just mentioned. But if you're getting enough quantity, let's say you get five to six hours and quality, you're sleeping through that bout maybe with one epoch of waking up. And then the regularity of your sleep is that you're going to sleep more or less at the same time each night plus or minus an hour on let's say five to six days per week because sometimes, we like to stay up on a weekend night and have some fun or something like that. And then the timing, you know, where that sleep is falling in your 24-hour schedule is really key. And here's what we're learning as a field, that for many people who are early to bed, early to rise types, if they go to bed around 9:00 PM, 9:30, and they only get six hours of sleep, they feel great. Whereas if they get the equivalent amount of sleep but go to bed at 11:00 PM or midnight, they feel lousy. Similarly, if you're a night owl, you're somebody that really prefers to go to bed around 1:00 or 2:00 AM and wake up around, let's say, 10:00 AM, if you take that equivalent amount sleep and you go to bed earlier, you're going to feel not so good. So getting the timing of your sleep in the 24-hour cycle correct and fairly consistent, that's the R part of QQRT. Correct is going to be beneficial. So I wouldn't worry so much about five to six hours only. Here's what I would do, Rima. I would take that five to six hours. And before getting out of bed each morning, I would do a 10 to 30-minute NSDR non-sleep deep rest protocol, which will allow you to feel deeply rested and frankly, to recover whatever bits of sleep that you perhaps missed during the night. I found that to be a tremendously beneficial practice. Waking up, if I don't feel thoroughly rested, doing a 10 to 30-minute NSDR. Then getting out of bed and continuing the day. And if you don't have time to do that, do that 10-minute, maybe 20-minute later in the day at any point. And I think you'll see terrific results not just because you're recovering some sleep that you lost perhaps during the night or maybe you just need five to six hours, but also because you'll get better at falling and staying deeply asleep through the practice of NSDR in the morning or at some point throughout the day. I wouldn't recommend anything else elaborate unless you're feeling really exhausted during the day. In which case, then I would move to some of the more advanced sleep tools. I've had vertigo. I should announce, this is a question. I'm not just telling you about my vertigo. I've had vertigo on and off and wonder what causes it. Is it hormones, adrenals, otoliths moving around? Oh, this person knows about the cochlea. Hydration, virus exposure. Zenana I think is how you pronounce your name. Forgive me if that's not the correct pronunciation, Zenana. So vertigo is very interesting. Unfortunately, it's uncomfortable, but we can learn a thing or two right now that should be able to help you, Zenana and others, even if they haven't had vertigo. So vertigo, this perception of falling or dizziness, needs to be distinguished from lightheadedness. So if you're ever feeling dizzy, it's worth stopping and sitting, or if you can't sit, standing and closing your eyes and asking yourself a question. Do I feel like I'm ready to fall straight down, or do I feel like I'm going to spin and fall down? Because in answering that question, you can determine whether or not you are lightheaded, that would be the straight falling down, or you have vertigo, which is you're dizzy, which is that you're going to spin and fall down. Now do this in a safe place, please. You can do this while bracing yourself against a wall, or that's why I said, ideally seated, so you don't actually fall. But in most cases, if you're feeling that spin, if you're feeling truly dizzy, you're feeling vertigo, and I move my head around like on purpose, then chances are you've got some issue in either your visual system or your inner ear. OK. So since this is being recorded on video, I can display what I'm about to say. So your visual system and your inner ear system for balance have some really important features. I'm going to make this a very quick tutorial. Your head, as you move through space, is experiencing visual images going by all the time. Your retinas, your eyes are essentially exposed to a lot of what's called visual slip. Imagine you're walking and you're trying to take a picture on your iPhone, or if you have an Android phone, on your Android phone. And you're moving, it's going to be blurry, right? Well, there's a stabilization process in your body and brain. It's a magnificent one that frankly is built into all jawed animals. Whereby your head, because it can move forward, so think nodding, right? So this is pitch for you pilots, right. Yaw, moving from side to side. This would be the no. This would be the no. No. So pitch, yaw, and roll, which would be like the puppy look, right? Pitch, yaw, and roll. Pitch, yaw, roll. Those are the three major angles of visual slip. And in an absolutely magnificent set of things, your inner ear has three hula hoop like shaped structures. One that's arranged vertically, so up on its end. One that's at an angle of about 45 degrees to that. And another that sits like a hula hoop flat on the ground. And inside of each of those little hula hoop like tubes, there are little stones called otoliths, OK? You heard that word earlier. That roll around on the bottom, just like marbles at the bottom of a hula hoop. Such that when you pitch, nod, the marbles in the vertical hula hoop slide back and forth. When you say no, the marbles in that hula hoop lying essentially parallel to the floor move around. And then the one at 45 degrees, when you roll your head from side to side, those move. And each of those sends neural signals that converge on the neural signals coming from the eye. And get this, when you move through space, there is a precise offset of whatever visual slip you happen to be experiencing by walking. The images are moving, you're looking up. You're looking at buildings. You're looking around. You're talking to somebody. They're moving their head. And your eye is making little tiny movements, little microsaccades on the millisecond time scale that act as a perfect image stabilizer. So what this means-- this is, by the way, called the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Vestibular system, ocular reflex. And it's mediated through a structure called the cerebellum in the back of the brain. This is why when you're on a boat, when the horizon is tipping back and forth, I have to be careful with this because I have such a prominent seasickness based on a prior experience that if I think about this too much, I might get nauseous. When that horizon is moving around, your system becomes uncalibrated because you can't really keep the system jolting about in a regular way. To be really careful here, I'm getting dizzy. Notice I said dizzy, not lightheaded. And you will end up disrupting that slip process, and you'll essentially overcompensate, which is why whenever you feel sick on a boat, they say, look at the horizon. Fixate to something at a distance. OK. So if you have vertigo, almost certainly, there's something going on in your inner ear. Yes, it can be caused by viruses. Yes, it can be caused by hormones. These things tend to be transient. But the most important thing is going to be to anchor the visual part of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. So what you're going to want to do is you're going to want to fixate on a point maybe three or four feet away. And then you're going to actually want to move closer to that point, or if you don't have access to it, you would want to look at your hand, your finger out in front of you, and then slowly move it in toward your nose. At some point, you'll feel like you're going to go cross-eyed, and you can stop at that point. Then move out again. Then in again. What are you doing when you're doing this? What you're doing is you're overriding the error signals, the incorrect error signals that exist in your kind of default setting when you have vertigo, and you're forcing the visual component to dominate. And then your inner ear mechanisms will adjust to that. So this is a very powerful tool. If you ever feel nauseous or seasick, it's a very powerful tool. If you've ever been like me, you sit in the back of an Uber, and the Uber is too small. You get out and you're like walk into a building where there are no windows. And you're, like I don't really feel good. Get outside and look at a fixation point some distance away. This actually happened the other day. We went to the gym. We went inside this gym. We'd been in a van and then went inside and weren't feeling well. So we decided to get out, and just take a walk, and fixate to the longest distance possible. The fresh air probably helped as well. But when doing that, you are anchoring the visual part of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Now that's far and away better than trying to avoid moving your head to not get those little stones moving around in the semicircular canals. Lots to say about this. I could go on and on. But hopefully, you learn some biology, and you learn to howl to not be nauseous if ever you feel dizzy or nauseous based on movement. Motion sick. And we can talk about why you get motion sick, but it's through the vagus nerve, et cetera, et cetera. But this is a very useful tool. And if you're ever just not feeling well, unless you have a fever or something like that, I recommend getting outside and looking at the furthest fixation point with your vision that you possibly can and then walking toward it as far as you can safely. If not, by actually just doing a few of these exercises of looking at your finger up close, that's going to be very good for anchoring the vestibular ocular reflex and not every time but many times people report feeling better, especially if you've moved from one closed environment, to another closed environment, to another closed environment, and so on. OK. Next question is what can be done to improve brain function for people that have been negatively impacted by things, such as poor sleep, poor diet, and TBI early in life? James. Yeah. This is a great question, and I get this a lot. I think that it reminds me that a lot of the conversation that we have on the podcast is about the good things that happen when you do things right and the bad things that happen when you do things wrong. And while I think that's an important conversation, what I've frankly failed to do enough, and that's why I'm grateful for this question, because it gives me the opportunity to talk more about the fact that your system is very robust. There is neuroplasticity. And also, as my graduate advisor used to say, time is broken, which is not to say you're out of luck. But I wouldn't spend any extra energy thinking about how many seats-- not seats, excuse me. How many, I have to be careful, the seed oil debate is still a debate. It's unclear how many trans fats you were exposed to in childhood. We know trans fats are bad. Everyone agrees they're bad. Governments agree they're bad. This is perhaps one of the few things that everybody agrees on in the nutrition space trans fats are bad. When I was growing up, trans fats were abundant in foods. There were probably fewer of certain things that we have more of now that are bad. But we ate a lot of trans fats. We had margarine in our fridge. There were other things that were probably weren't good for us that we consumed. And every once in a while, I'll think, gosh, if I'd only been eating grass-fed meats, and fruits, and vegetables, and healthy grains as I do now back then, imagine how much healthier I'd be. But I really don't spend too much time on it, and I don't think you should either. I think the most important thing to remember is that biological systems, unless they're really damaged, you know, you're talking about a major injury, and even then, they're very robust. You can overcome years, decades of poor use or misuse of those systems. That said, if you have the opportunity to take care of them now, I highly suggest you do. So for instance, if you haven't slept well for years, now's the time to get it right. I wouldn't worry about the past, truly. You can always rescue some of your health and healthspan and lifespan. Poor diet, same thing. It's a just do it kind of thing. Just hop on the train of getting things right 80% to 90% of the time. TBI, traumatic brain injury. Well, the episode of the Huberman Lab podcast that's out right now with Dr. Mark Esposito. He's an MD, a neurologist, originally trained at University of Pennsylvania, now at University of California Berkeley. We talk about TBI. There are a lot of different forms of TBI, different origins. Everything from bomb blasts, to car accident, to construction work, to just slipped on the stairs at a party. I know someone that slipped on some wet floor at a party and has a brain injury. What do we know? Well, you get back to the basics. Sleep is going to be important. But there are some things like transcranial magnetic stimulation, certainly things that reduce brain inflammation like glymphatic outflow. So glymphatic outflow is this washing of the brain at night that removes debris. Very, very important in the weeks and months after traumatic brain injury to get adequate sleep for that reason. But then there are things that also seem to perhaps improve outcomes from traumatic brain injury, such as hyperbaric chambers. So hyperoxygenation treatments, if you have access to those. Even things like elevating the feet slightly when you sleep by about 5 to 15 degrees is known to increase glymphatic flow during sleep, which can, we believe by way of increased clearance of a bunch of basically debris, reactive oxygen species within the cells but also debris outside the cells in the extracellular space, so between neurons. So it isn't just empty space. There's all this like heavily glycosylated stuff, which basically just means this kind of like spongy carbohydrate stuff that fills in the spaces. The clearance of some of the metabolites and some of the debris that's accumulated there by just sleeping with feet slightly elevated. Definitely not falling asleep in a chair upright. That's the worst thing for glymphatic flow. Things like that. Some people will go kind of bonkers on all things anti-inflammation. They start taking tons of curcumin, and they kind of get obsessed with inflammation as the enemy. I wouldn't do that. In fact, there are some negative effects of things like curcumin, turmeric, if you take it in high doses, like limiting the amount of dihydrotestosterone production, which is not good. You don't want that. Male or female, you don't want to take too much turmeric or curcumin. There are real issues with that. To say nothing of the studies that have shown lead contamination in a lot of turmeric. So you want to check the sourcing very carefully if you do consume any turmeric. A little bit is probably fine. Cooking with it is fine. But here, we're talking about supplementation. And just really not trying to turn inflammation into this terrible thing to the point where you're starting to do other things that are potentially damaging. There's some really interesting evidence that 5 grams, maybe 10 grams, depending on your body weight, of creatine monohydrate per day can enhance creatine phosphate metabolism in the forebrain and enhance brain function under conditions of high altitude or TBI. I take 5 to 10 grams of creatine, just creatine monohydrate powder. Frankly, any creatine monohydrate powder should be sufficient. There are other forms of creatine. They are not any better creatine. Monohydrate is the least expensive fortunately. That mixed in water. You take it with or without food. Some people ask, does creatine make your hair fall out? No, it does not. Make your hair fall out, but some people do experience an increase in DHT with creatine monohydrate, and there can be a DHT hair loss link. So if you think you're losing your hair from taking creatine, then stop and see, do the control experiment. It should grow back. But 5 to 10 grams of creatine monohydrate, something to explore. Hyperbaric chamber, something to explore. Excellent sleep, definitely do that. And I just wouldn't obsess over past ills or wrongs to the extent that it impacts your ability to try and correct those in the present. I would say that about most everything. But then again, I understand that as humans, because we can remember the past, the present, and the future, that sometimes it's difficult to let go of the mistakes of past that we made. But that's just simply being human, and I don't have a solution to that. Are we any closer to finding the cause of OCD? Well, I think we know what causes OCD. I think it's pretty clear that OCD is some form of miswiring in the basal ganglia. The structures of the brain that are involved in go action and no go, withholding, action type behaviors. And some malwiring of those structures to the dopamine reward system because here's what's interesting about OCD. OCD involves obsessions obviously. That's the O in OCD. Compulsions, the actions. That's the C in OCD. But in a kind of weird twist of the neurology, OCD is a situation where the compulsion does not remove the obsession. Rather, it exacerbates it, OK? The compulsion does not remove the obsession. It exacerbates it. So unlike an itch that you scratch, with OCD, the scratching of the itch makes it worse, which is actually what we experience when we have a mosquito bite, which by the way, I absolutely loathe mosquito bites. It's one of my least favorite things in life. I have about 3,600 and counting pet peeves. That's definitely high on the list of those. The obsessive compulsive disorder is one that really needs to be treated, frankly, neurologically. It's one for which there are behavioral interventions, but it's clear that adjusting the pharmacology of the neural circuits involved in OCD really can help. Again, there are behavioral treatments. But for severe cases of OCD, it's just very, very clear that interventions, which include SSRIs, which have been demonized. A lot of people say, oh, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are terrible. Blah, blah, blah, blah. You know, the serotonin hypothesis of depression isn't true. Well, listen, the reality is this that all treatments for depression that are effective, which include SSRIs, in some cases, cognitive behavioral treatments, all of these sorts of things, which are shown efficacy, are all about what? They're not about serotonin. They're about neuroplasticity. That's why some antidepressants center on dopamine and norepinephrine. Others center on serotonin. They're about neuroplasticity. They're about changing neural networks. They're not about neurochemical per se. But the neuromodulators such as serotonin allow an access point. They are a wedge into the neuroplasticity process. Now with OCD, in order to overcome these malwirings, it's very important to get plasticity. How do you get plasticity? Well, in my belief, you work with an excellent psychiatrist who can prescribe the appropriate dose of drug to release the appropriate amount of neuromodulator. Then, and this is really key, you have opened up the window for plasticity, but then it's really important that the proper behaviors are engaged in. And when I did an episode on OCD, I talked about what some of these are. For instance, the person is exposed to the stimulus that causes the obsession, or maybe the obsession arises spontaneously. They feel the impulse to complete the compulsion, the behavior, and they resist with the support of a therapist, but they're doing this in the context of having elevated levels of serotonin or some other neuromodulator that then allows fewer trials of resistance. Fewer times of needing to withhold the behavior that this person so badly wants to perform because it's coming from within. It's this compulsion literally. Then they are able to achieve plasticity more quickly. Perhaps also transcranial magnetic stimulation. So a conjunction of correct behavior, the withholding behavior, maybe a replacement behavior that's often used. Use a replacement behavior with the appropriate neurochemical milieu is the solution to OCD. OK. Next question is if I'm just going to New York City from San Francisco, how do I control shifting my circadian rhythm by only three hours? So if you're going to New York City from San Francisco, the best way, frankly, would be to get up an hour earlier two days before you head off to New York. And then another day, you might try and shift by two hours before you go and then head to New York and do the last shift on the last day. Most people won't do that. It takes a little bit of work, but they just don't have the time ability or your discipline to do that. But it is perhaps the best way. I would say the best thing to do is to know your temperature minimum, and I'll try and keep this pretty simple. If you typically wake up at 8:00 AM, let's say, just by way of example. That means that your minimum body temperature is at 6:00 AM. Which means that if you want to get up earlier in the days where you travel to New York, well, in the couple of days before you leave, any time between 6:00 AM and 10:00 AM, get some bright light in your eyes, even if you go back to sleep. So for instance, get up at 6:00 AM. Set an alarm clock. I know you normally like to get up at 8:00 AM. Get up at 6:00 AM. Get some bright light in your eyes from artificial sources or from sunlight, maybe 5 to 10 minutes, then go back to sleep until 8:00 AM. You do that again the next night. And then you head off to New York. You'll find the shift to be much easier. Now here's what you don't want to do. You want to make sure that you do not view bright light before 6:00 AM. So in the middle of the night, if you get up, you need to use the restroom, try and use dim lights as dim is as safely possible, et cetera. And what are you doing when you're doing this? I could get into a long description of the science behind this, and I'll probably do a podcast all about this at some point. But really what you're doing if you get up at 6:00 AM and getting some bright light exposure is you think about it, you're kind of looking at a New York sunrise of sorts, OK? If it's not a sunrise, you're getting some bright light that mimics sunrise at least to some extent. Nothing's quite like sunrise, but to some extent. So in that sense, even if you go back to sleep, what you're doing is you're sending the light signal, the zeitgeber, the time signal, to your circadian clock of your hypothalamus that it should shift, that you need to get up earlier. And indeed, that will happen over the course of about two to three days. The other thing you can do, and I know this is kind of rare these days to get an answer like this. The other thing you can do is just fly to New York and force yourself to get up. And just drink caffeine, and get out, and exercise and use the social rhythm of the activity of the city in order to get up earlier. But you will feel lousy late morning. And so you would only want to do that if you could access a brief nap of anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes late morning, and then you'll feel fine. But my suggestion would be to, something back there like some animal or something likes that answer so much. It would be to just try and get a little bit of light exposure a couple hours before your normal wake up time. Then go back to sleep in the two days before you head off to New York City. And of course, everything here was set in the context of the New York City, flight from San Francisco and New York City. But the principle, the logic holds. And if you have any questions about this temperature minimum and wake up time, and you want to get your circadian clock right for travel, check out the episode that we did on jet lag and shift work. And I'm realizing now as I say this, and my team is here, and they're listening, that I will do a video on the Huberman Lab clips channel where I explain temperature minimum and how to plug in your normal wake up time in order to essentially arrive at whatever time shift you want. We should probably put that out as a newsletter too, where it's a little chart, where it says I currently wake up at 8:00 AM, and then which means my, and then it'll say subtract two hours. My temperature minimum is 6:00 AM. And I want to travel to whatever it is. I don't know. Sydney, Australia on this date from this city. And then we know the time change. And then I can tell you exactly what to do for a couple of days. I've done this for various military groups. I've done this for people and close friends who travel a lot, and it works fabulously well. I can't eliminate jet lag for you. I wish I could just eliminate jet lag. I can't do that. But I definitely can have the time that it takes for you to shift maybe more. Hi. Hi. I love the Sydney Show. Thank you. Thanks for coming out. Thanks for coming to Australia. Thanks for having us. I take fish oil, but I'm not sure I'm getting the dose right. What are your thoughts on fish oil and dose? I have lots of thoughts on fish oil. I think it's a terrific tool. I think every time I see a study or a news article saying fish oil not shown to-- I just go, oh, gosh. All right. Well, listen, whoever's reading, wrote that article, I take no pleasure in your declining health span or lifespan, but whatsoever. But the rest of us are going to be taking fish oil. And here's why. There's just, oh, so much evidence that getting enough omega 3 fatty acids is great for brain health, body health. And I think that the issue around fish oil is typically around contaminants. So you want to make sure that it doesn't have loads of mercury. So things like sardines, cod liver oil, et cetera. You can get those from natural sources, except there's one problem. I hate sardines, and I don't want to slurp down a bunch of cod fat. I'm just not interested in that. So if you eat a lot of fatty ocean fish and it's really clean fish, great. I don't. Most people don't. So I believe in taking a high quality fish oil. There are a lot of different sources of these. In fact, in the episode that we did with Dr. Rhonda Patrick, there's a link in the show note captions I believe that takes you to a chart of the different fish oil sources and their relative levels of contaminants, et cetera. But most of the reputable brands out there are not going to have any contaminants because they've been cleaned out. It's been checked for. So I take the fish oil from G1 or from Momentous. That's just me. There are a lot of other great sources out there. But I will say this. That's when I'm traveling, and I take capsules. Typically, I like to take it in liquid form, and I will take it in liquid form. I have no financial relationship to the liquid non-capsule forms of fish oil, and I get the one that has a lemon flavor to overcome the absolutely disgusting flavor of Cod liver oil. I guess, I don't know, presumably cod, like the taste of cod liver oil. But I don't. So that's what I do. I'll take a tablespoon of that once a day and a protein shake. It tastes like lemon. It doesn't taste like cod, thank goodness. And when I travel, I take the capsules from AG1, or Momentous, or there are excellent ones from other sources. Lots of great sources out there. Now what are we trying to do when we take fish oil? Yes, it can reduce inflammation. Yes, it can do a number of different things. But that's all by way of omega 3 fatty acid intake, right? Most people get far too much omega 6, right? This is why there's a seed oil debate. We're not going to have that debate now. We'd put us all to sleep frankly. The key thing is to get enough omega 3s, and they're hard to get unless you're eating krill. So unless you're a large baleen whale, you're probably not eating that much krill. If you're getting fatty fish, great. But when you take an omega 3 fatty acid in the form of fish oil or you eat sardines for that matter, what you're getting essentially is the substrate for a lot of other important building blocks, not the least of which is the lipid bilayer that surrounds the neurons of your brain. And so basically, the omega 3 fatty acids provide the substrate for some key building blocks of nerve cells and other cells in the brain and body. And, this is perhaps the most important reason I can think of, when you get out past 1 gram of the EPA form of omega 3, OK, 1 gram of EPA form of omega 3 per day, it's clear there's either mild to moderate antidepressant effect, so much so that one can, in some cases, talk to your psychiatrist or psychologist, partially offset the dosage of any antidepressant. I am not telling you to go off antidepressant medication and go on to fish oil. That is not what I'm saying. I'm just saying that there's some impressive clinical trials showing that fish oil, if taken at dosages of 1 to 3 grams of EPA per day, can have a mild to moderate antidepressant effect. And I don't know anyone that wouldn't want to have better mood. So I take 1.5 grams of EPA, which is not to say 1.5 grams of fish oil. You need to look at the package and see how much fish oil but then look at how much EPA. And typically, it's less than 1 gram per serving. So you may have to take two servings. Some people say, well, is it safe to take two servings? I don't see any reason why not. And then of course, there are the high potency fish oils for which there is certainly 1 gram or more of EPA. Keep in mind that all this discussion about fish oil might sound kind of health food hippie store. Forgive me, hippies. Health food store kind of stuff. But the reality is that EPA, high concentration EPA is actually a prescription drug in the United States and elsewhere, prescribed often for enhancing mental health, enhancing cardiovascular health, and on and on. So we're not out on a limb or out on a fin as it were when we're having this discussion. We're actually just talking about something for which there's a lot of clinical evidence. There's a lot of biochemical evidence. There's a lot of mechanisms. So I take anywhere from one to 2 grams of EPA per day, even if that requires taking six rather than the suggested three capsules per day or taking a full tablespoon or even two tablespoons of fish oil. And frankly, most people are getting too much omega 6 fatty acids and not enough omega 3. So shout-out to the fish oils. What is the recommended protocol for measuring hormone levels? Interesting. How frequently do you advise monitoring these levels to accurately determine their typical range? And I just have to try and pronounce your name. Vallad Resnichenko. What a cool name. Vallad Resnichenko. I'm a big fan of like two-syllable first name. All right. So Vallad Resnichenko, thank you for this question and the opportunity to try and pronounce your name. So hormone levels. I think a good thing to do is, in the absence of any apparent or suspected endocrine dysfunction, right? So we're talking about you feel pretty good. You're wondering if you're good under-- if I say good under the hood, that just sounds like weird. It rhymes. So if you're feeling pretty good, I recommend getting your hormone levels checked once if you can, if you're still in your teens, in your late teens, after you've gone through puberty to establish a sort of baseline. Most people won't do that because it's too late. I didn't do that. Once in your mid-20s. Again, we're talking about no suspected or apparent endocrine dysfunction in your mid-20s. You have a baseline. Something to compare to when you were in your say 18 to 20 and again, when you're 25. That would be ideal. And then again, I would say when you're 30. And then start once a year starting when you are 40 or older. I think that just logically, I would love to know what my hormone levels were when I was 25, when I was 30. Maybe when I was, yeah, when I was 18, 25, 30, 35. And actually, 35 is when I got my first blood draw for just getting a look under the hood. Like what's there? What are my estrogen levels? What are my testosterone levels? What are my growth hormone levels? This kind of thing. And then once you're 40 and older, I think once a year minimum. And I realize that some people out there are going to say, well, that's ridiculous. What are you going to do with that information? Well, you're going to do a lot with that information. You're going to figure out whether or not your LDL cholesterol is in healthy range. You're going to figure out whether or not your ALT is in the healthy range. You're going to figure out whether or not your ApoB is in healthy range. You're going to figure out a lot more than just whether or not your testosterone is 400, 600, 800, or 1,200. And I think we also need to be careful about overinterpreting results of hormones because a lot of it has to do with the ratio of testosterone to estrogen or the ratio of free testosterone to testosterone, both in men and women. So for instance, if your testosterone level is 900 but your free testosterone level is 2, well, then you have a problem. Whereas if your total testosterone level is 500 or 600 but your free testosterone level is 15, well, then you're probably doing pretty well. So I would say getting your hormone levels checked once a year after age 40, and prior to that, once every three to five years starting at about age 18 would be ideal. But most people don't do that. They either don't have the disposable income. I certainly didn't when I was 18, 20, 25. And at that time, it was really hard to get that measured unless you had a clinical problem. Now if anyone has a clinical problem that they suspect or is real, then obviously more testing. I think great sources for endocrine profiling are things like InsideTracker. Full disclosure, they are a sponsor of the podcast, but they do an excellent job. They'll even come to your house. The phlebotomist will come to your house if you want, or you can go to a clinic, so they make it all very easy. But there are other sources as well, right? I'll never make these AMAs or anything else about specific companies for its own sake. I just think InsideTracker does a great job. There are a number of clinics like Marek Health and others, online clinics that will do that, but it's part of a more comprehensive package of agreeing to work with them. At least that's how I understand it. I hope I didn't get that wrong. But check and see. Nowadays, it's pretty easy to find ways to get your hormones checked. But I would suggest that the following things at least be on there. Growth hormone or IGF-1 rather. IGF-1, testosterone, estrogen. This is true for women and men by the way. So IGF-1, testosterone, estrogen. It'll show up as estradiol on there. Free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, cortisol. Keep in mind, morning cortisol is always elevated relative to afternoon cortisol. It will be impacted by food. So you want to go in fasted in the morning, ideally get this done early. Your creatinine levels, which by the way, will be elevated if you're taking creatine or you're exercising hard. Your doctor will say your creatinine levels are elevated. And you say, well, great. Well, my creatine intake is elevated too. So take that. It's not going to be a problem necessarily. Do check with your doctor. LDL cholesterol, ApoB. And there are probably a few others that would be good to have in there. For men and women, sex hormone binding globulin, SHBG. And for women especially, progesterone and prolactin, and any of the progestins are going to be important. And of course, for women, the trick is going to be when you get your blood taken with respect to your hormone cycle, your ovulatory cycle, and to try to make that at least consistent from test to test, not necessarily having to go in both during the follicular and the luteal phase of your cycle, but always going in during mid-follicular or mid-luteal, and that can be challenging to do perhaps. But that's going to be important because of course, those are widely fluctuating levels across the cycle. But unless you're really obsessed with your hormone levels, and analyzing them, taking them at multiple times throughout your menstrual cycle, probably not necessarily unless you're starting to think about conceiving, or there's some issue, PCOS or other issue. OK. I find that I need to do NSDR after working out. Any thoughts on this? Yes. Well, first of all, I'm glad you're using NSDR, zero cost tool, known to replenish mental and physical vigor, works oh so well. I think it's great. I think it probably is accelerating your recovery. I think this tells me that you're probably working out really hard and hopefully not too long. If you find that you work out in the morning and then you're really, really sleepy in the afternoon and the next day, you might be working out too long or too hard. So maybe ratchet back the intensity a little bit or the duration. It's amazing how great we can feel when we work out to 80% to 90% of our maximum output and duration. And we did this the other day. We went out for a little jog, run, bounding, skipping, jumping jack thing, and stopped at like 80% to 90% of maximum and went about the rest of the day and evening feeling great. If you do this consistently, you'll find you have more energy. And there's actually a lot of solid physiology and physics to support why that is. As opposed to if you go to the gym and you do every set to failure, or even every exercise, you include one set to failure, and you're grinding out four straps, or you're-- I don't know what kind of exercise you're doing. Or you're running more and more distance each day or with more intensity. It's understandable how one gets kind of drawn to or addicted to that burn or the effort. But keep in mind, that is stress. You're stressing the body to produce a certain kind of adaptation, either endurance, or strength, or hypertrophy, or et cetera adaptation. So there's real beauty in learning to love working out hard but to leaving the gym or ending the run with 10% to 20% of the gas in the tank. And knowing that you can come back and do more, and you actually want to do more. It increases vigor, as opposed to taking yourself over that cliff even a slight 10% to 20% and then finding that you're kind of depleted. And this is something that we don't hear enough about because most people that are into fitness are into pushing themselves. It's also true for work. I think some of the best advice I ever got in the professional landscape was when I was a graduate student at UC Berkeley. And an excellent neurologist by the name of Bob Knight said the key is to figure out how much can you work each day consistently? If that's four hours a day, fine. If that's eight hours a day, fine. We're talking with weekend breaks because that was in the era of weekend breaks. Maybe a weekend every once in a while where you have a deadline. But by thinking about what you personally can really do consistently while maintaining sleep, and mental health, and physical health, you're going to go a lot further than doing like, for instance, what I did, which was maniac and working 100 hour weeks as a graduate student and then ending up sick four times a year and missing out on a bunch of days when I could have been in lab. So these days, I try and get as much focused work done as possible but try and make that as consistent as possible, if not from every day to the next, over time. Figure out what those averages are, and don't be ashamed of those averages. I would say declare those averages to people, so they know what to expect. And the fact that you can do more does not necessarily mean that you should do more because I think one of the best pieces of advice I ever got in the world of fitness is more important than training hard, more important than doing any particular exercise, more important than anything is to not get hurt. Because if you get hurt, you can't train. So I love that you're doing NSDR after training. I love that you're making that part of your practice. But maybe also throttle back a little bit because you said I have to do it after training. Maybe throttle back a little bit on the duration or intensity of exercise and see how you feel. What can we do to optimize the functioning of our gut-brain axis? That's very simple. Get enough sleep. In addition to that, avoid excessive intake of antibiotics. But if your doctor prescribes them, take them. I am a believer in antibiotics, OK? Before the internet jumps on me, I'm not anti-antibiotic. I always want to say. That I'm not anti-antibiotic. I am not pro-antibiotic, but I am pro-probiotics. I'm probiotic. So I think you should ingest one to four servings of low sugar fermented foods per day. So sauerkraut, kimchi, natto, or kefir, or otherwise, whatever you like and fits with your nutrition preferences and plan. I think it's also very important that you don't overuse antiseptics, like antiseptic mouthwashes, and hand rinses, and all that stuff. This was all discussed on a podcast episode I did with Dr. Justin Sonnenburg on the Huberman Lab podcast, which is just to say that Justin, who's a professor at Stanford and is amazing, even said that he lets his kids eat lunch when they've been playing outside without washing their hands before eating lunch because he wants the probiotic makeup of their gut to be diverse, including from outside. Now I'm presuming that's not a public park. I'm assuming it's their yard. So we're not talking about gross stuff being on their hands. We're talking about a little dirt here and there. It turns out owning a pet increases the diversity of your microbiome. Lots of things like that. You don't want to go around licking people's pets. It's OK to let them lick you. And depending on what your preferences are, but don't lick them. But when you interact with people, you shake their hands or pets, you're increasing the diversity of your microbiome. When you eat low sugar fermented foods, you want to make sure also you get enough fiber, both prebiotic and probiotic fiber. So fruits and vegetables. The fiber debate for me just makes me roll my eyes. I mean, it's so clear that fiber is good for us, for gut motility and for offsetting cancers of the gut. I mean, I realize there are the people out there who are really into elimination diets where they just only eat meat. But I mean, there's just so much good data on fiber, especially from fibrous vegetables. It just seems like what, yes. I mean, it's almost silly that we have the debate frankly. But I'm sure someone out there who's pure carnivore will be shouting. But guess what? You're shouting and you're constipated. Last question. Regarding the subject on tongue cleaning from the oral health episode, can you please share a bit on brushing tongue, scraping tongue, and generally how best to clean the tongue? So tongue cleaning came up on the oral health episode. I talked to four different dentists and a periodontist in preparation for that episode. Almost all of them, remarkably, extraordinarily converged on the same advice except for some slight deviations around frequency of flossing. It's kind of cool, right? A field where almost everybody seems to agree. I realize that it isn't the hugest sample size, but I picked them from diverse locations, backgrounds, trainings, et cetera. Every one of them said brush and floss your teeth. Every one of them said antiseptic, alcohol-based mouthwashes are bad. And every single one of them said that brushing your teeth before sleep is especially important because at night, you produce less saliva, and you want to be able to remineralize your teeth, that is fill in cavities that are starting to form brush. So brush your teeth, floss ideally as well before sleep, but at least brush. And of course, in the morning too, for everyone's sake. But if we're talking about tongue brushing and scraping, it was clear that tongue scraping was advised if done correctly, OK? Because there are certain bacteria that grow on the tongue that you don't want there. And that scraping can help with the turnover of healthy bacteria there in addition to removing some of the bad bacteria. But that most people scrape their tongue too hard. And rather, it would be wise to brush your tongue gently with a soft toothbrush. And by the way, you should also use a soft brush for your teeth but not the same one that you use for tongue brushing. So the takeaway that I was told, and it makes a lot of sense to me based on what I know now about the biology, physiology, and care of the mouth is that you want to use a different soft toothbrush to brush your tongue than the soft brush that you use to brush your teeth and that you do not need to use anything on it. But if you wanted to put a little bit of salt and baking soda, that is perfectly fine. A lot of people wonder whether or not baking soda scrapes the enamel off the teeth. It actually is low on the abrasion scale. Dentists have, believe it or not, an abrasion scale with a list of things of how much enamel it scrapes off at a given pressure. These dentists have done their work. It's really, really cool. I can't say I always liked dentists. I didn't like going to the dentist. They always seem like nice people. But now I have newfound respect for dentists. They really care about their craft, and oral health has been kind of pushed to the back seat of the different aspects of health. I consider it one of the major pillars of mental health and physical health because taking care of your teeth, your gums, your mouth, including your oral microbiome is critical for cardiovascular health. It's critical for brain health. One of the bad bacteria, Streptococcus mutans, that can proliferate in the mouth, especially after eating sugary foods, can make it through the blood-brain barrier. And maybe, it's thought one of the causes of dementia, can disrupt your neurons. Your brain and body is a system. Everything is talking to everything else. And so yeah, brush your tongue but use a separate soft brush to do that and replace it every few weeks to months. I suppose get expensive but probably not as expensive as some of the other health issues that were just described. So I appreciate that question. We didn't talk about oil pulling on the podcast. A lot of people asked about that. Some people like to swish oil and then spit it out as a way. That's oil pulling for oral health. All the dentists I spoke to said nah, not big fans of oil pulling. But none of them said it would be particularly bad. So if you enjoy it or you think it works for you, great. But none of them really pointed to any clear evidence that it was going to be beneficial. So I was told that was the last question, and we are coming up on the hour. Again, I want to thank everybody for joining this AMA. I'm doing this from Australia. Sydney, Australia. What's interesting down here is because we are below the equator, everything is reversed, right? So this was actually-- it's being presented to you. I'm actually upside down, but they turned the camera, so I would appear right side up to you. Also, when I'm down here, I drink my AG1. Normally, I swish it counterclockwise, but I notice here, reflexively, I'm swishing it clockwise. So anyway, lots of interesting stuff going on. We'll talk about how that all works. It's not through the vestibulo-ocular reflex it turns out but maybe on a future episode of the podcast about the relationship between location relative to the equator and neural functioning. And I'm just kidding. But what I'm not kidding about is I appreciate that you tuned in. And last but certainly not least, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]

Title: Dr. Becky Kennedy: Protocols for Excellent Parenting & Improving Relationships of All Kinds
Published: 2024-02-26 13:00:24 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. Becky Kennedy, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist, bestselling author, and founder of Good Inside, an education platform for parents and parents-to-be. We discuss actionable protocols for raising resilient, emotionally healthy kids and effective alternatives to typical forms of reward and punishment that instead teach children valuable skills and strengthen the parent-child bond. These protocols also apply to other types of relationships: professional, romantic, friendships, siblings, etc. 

We explain how to respond to emotional outbursts, rudeness, and entitlement, repair fractured relationships, build self-confidence, and improve interpersonal connections with empathy while maintaining healthy boundaries. 

We also discuss how to effectively communicate with children and adults with ADHD, anxiety, learning challenges, or with “deeply feeling” individuals. 

The conversation is broadly applicable to all types of social interactions and bonds. By the end of the episode, you will have learned simple yet powerful tools to build healthy relationships with kids, teens, adults, and oneself.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Becky Kennedy Dr Becky Kennedy is a clinical psychologist specializing in parent child relationships she received her degrees and did her training at Duke University and Columbia University in New York she is the author of the bestselling book good inside a Guide to Becoming the parent you want to be she is also the founder and creator of an online learning platform also called good inside at which parents and parents to be can learn the best possible parenting skills that are grounded in the fields of Clinical Psychology that have been proven to work in the real world and that can allow people to navigate common sticking points in parent child relationships during today's discussion you will learn a tremendous amount of actionable knowledge of about what it is to be a good parent this is a conversation that pertains not just to parents and parents to be but also uncles aunts grandparents and also those of you not planning to or who do not want children I say that because while everything we discussed today is grounded in the discussion around parent child relationships it indeed pertains to all of us and relationships of all kinds including romantic relationships friendships workplace relationships and our relationship to self Dr k Kennedy defines for us and makes clear and actionable what the exact job of good parenting is and how that relates to other relationships that we might have she explains how to set healthy boundaries and in fact defines exactly what healthy boundaries are there's a lot of misconception about that we also talk a lot about empathy and the need to make children and ourselves feel safe in all kinds of relating we discuss how to navigate disagreements and arguments apologies and punishments reward and on and on all framed within a real world realtime context what I mean by that and what I think really sets apart Dr Becky Kennedy's work from so much else that you'll see out there on parent child and other types of relationships is that she makes what to do and say and what not to do and say in a variety of real world contexts very clear such that you can access that knowledge and do those specific things and avoid those specific things even when things get tense in fact especially when things get difficult or tense by the end of today's episode you will have learned a dozen or more very potent clinically backed tools to navigate parent child relating including your relationship to your own parents alive or dead and your relationship to self before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is matina matina makes loose leaf and ready to drink yerbamate I often discuss ybba mate's benefits such as regulating blood sugar its high antioxidant content the ways that it can improve digestion and possible neuroprotective effects I also drink yamate because I love the taste while there are a lot of different choices of yamate drinks out there I love matina because again they have the no sugar variety as well as the fact that both their loose leaf and their can varieties are of the absolute best quality so much so that I decided to become a partial owner in the company although I must say even if they hadn't allowed me to do that I would be drinking matina is the cleanest tasting and best yerba mate you can find I love the taste of brewed loose leaf matina yerbamate and I particularly love the taste of maa's new canned cold brew zero sugar yerbamate which I personally help them develop if you'd like to try matina go to drink matina ./ huberman Right Now matina is offering a free one pound bag of loose leaf yerbamate tea and free shipping with the purchase of two cases of their cold brew yamate again that's drink maa.com huberman to get the free bag of yate Loos leaf tea and free shipping today's episode is also brought To Us by ju ju makes medical grade red light therapy devices now if there's one thing I've consistently emphasized on this podcast is the incredible role that light can have on our biology and of course I'm always telling people that they should get sunlight in their eyes as soon as possible after waking on as many days of their life as possible for sake of setting circadian rhythm daytime mood focus and alertness and improv sleep now in addition to sunlight red light and near infrared light has been shown to have positive effects on improving numerous aspects of Cellar and organ Health including faster Muscle Recovery improved skin health and wound healing even improvements in acne or that is removal of acne reducing pain and inflammation improving mitochondrial function and even improving Vision itself what sets juv apart and why it's my preferred red light therapy device is that it has clinically proven wavelengths meaning it uses specific wavelengths of red light and near infrared light in combination that trigger the optimal seller adaptations personally I use the handheld Juve every day the handheld ju is about the size of a thick piece of toast and I also own a ju panel that allows for full body exposure and I use that one approximately five times per week for about 10 to 15 minutes per session if you would like to try ju you can go to jv.com huberman to receive $50 off your first purchase again that's ju SP jv.com huberman to get $50 off your first purchase today's episode is also brought To Us by Aeropress Aeropress is similar to a French press for making coffee but is in fact a much better way to make coffee I first learned about Aeropress well over 10 years ago go and I've been using one ever since Aeropress was developed by Alan Adler who was an engineer at Stanford and I knew of alen because he had also built the so-called aobi frisbee so he was sort of famous in our community for developing these different Feats of engineering that turned into commercial products now I love coffee I'm somebody that drinks coffee nearly every day usually about 90 to 120 minutes after I wake up in the morning although not always sometimes if I'm going to exercise I'll drink coffee first thing in the morning but I love love love coffee and what I've personally found is that by using the arero Press I can make the best possible tasting cup of coffee I don't know what exactly it is in the Aero press that allows the same beans to be prepared into a cup of coffee that tastes that much better as compared to any other form of Brewing that coffee even the traditional French press the Aero press is extremely easy to use and it's extremely compact in fact I take it with me whenever I travel and I use it on the road hotels even on planes I'll just ask for some hot water and I'll Brew my coffee or tea right there on the plane with over 55,000 fstar reviews arero press is the best reviewed coffee press in the world if you would like to try Aeropress you can go to Aero press.com huberman that's a r o p s.com huberman to get 20% off any Aeropress coffee maker Aeropress ships in the USA Canada and over 60 other countries in the world again that's Aero press.com / huberman to get 20% off and now for my discussion with Dr Becky Kennedy Dr Becky Kennedy welcome thank you so excited to be here I have a lot of questions for you and as I mentioned in my introduction much of what we are going to discuss today relates to parent child relating but pertains to relationships generally so people with children without children who don't want children hopefully there aren't people that hate children but for all people uh out there with children or not planning them or not relationships are really just fundamental to who we are and I actually place relationships including relationship to self in what we now think of as the six pillars of mental health physical health and performance um sleep nutrition exercise relationships clearly vital to all aspects of life so I'd like to start off by just asking for all of us are there some simple or perhaps not so simple questions that uh we can reflect on that give us a sense of you know how good a parent we are or would be based on I don't know our our previous parent child relationships our relationship to self you know like what kind of things come to Bear when we think about really healthy relationships um I can you know start rattling off a list of what I imagine they could be but what are are your thoughts like what are the what's the parameter space as as we say how should we think about relationships besides just oh you know I either like this person or don't or I feel good around them or I don't or separating how I feel about them versus how they make me feel you knowbe we can drill a little deeper below the the kind of U more superficial stuff that we often see out there the first thing that comes to mind when you say that is this word sturdiness and to me when someone says like what is good inside as an approach and that's always the first word that comes to mind and I know it's like an odd word it's not a word we like use a lot although I do think most people when you say that person's like a really sturdy person I think we all have some connotation or feeling at least of what that means and I use it a lot being a sturdy parent being a sturdy leader I talk a lot about the similarities to Parenting and kind of being a pilot of a plane and and that word sturdi always comes up and so I remember a little while ago someone pushed me they're like what's your definition of what that means and at that point I thought wow I should probably have a definition given I I use it a lot but what I think it really means is inability to be connected to yourself and to someone else at the same time and I think that is really the definition of sturdy leadership and that is the key thing that's present in a healthy relationship that at once I kind of know my values what I want what I need I feel like I can be true to that and at the same time I can kind of connect to someone else who probably has different wants and needs and maybe even slightly different values at the same time and the thing that that lead leads me to next is what I think about is like family jobs and a parent job so in almost any other place you could assume if I'm getting a new job at this company like there's just no way I could do my job well if I don't know what my job is right if you go to your desk and your boss like have a good day do a good job and there's no job description you'd be like I like that's impossible but over and over with parents if I say to them well what is your job with your kid or when your kid is having a tantrum or they hit or they're rude or they lie to your face or anything like what is your job in that moment most people very well-intentioned educated people who would never ever take a job if they didn't have a job description they look at me they're like I have I have no idea so how can we do it well how can we then perform it to a place to get to the outcomes we want if you don't have the foundation of what your job is and to me I I I thought a lot about it I think parents actually have two jobs and it relates to sturdiness so you'll you'll connect it where one of our jobs is boundaries and to me boundaries are things we tell people we will do and they require the other person to do nothing and that's like really important because a lot of times we think we're setting a boundary when actually we're making a request and boundaries keep us connected to ourselves they represent our values and our wants and our needs and in a parent child relationship they also keep our kids safe if I just know in a simple way like my kids watched enough TV today and they really have to get to bed and I know that like I don't want them to stay up late I kind of know what my family needs I have to set a boundary but the other part of my job is like empathy and validation which is a way of connecting to someone else where you see someone else's feelings and experience as real you don't agree with it probably you don't necessarily condone the behavior that's the repres presentation of the feelings but the feelings themselves you need to connect to and I feel like those are our two jobs as parents and that's really the way to be a sturdy leader and to be in a sturdy healthy relationship with your kids wow so much there uh and I love it uh and here's one of the reasons I love it this notion of sturdiness something that I don't think we hear enough about um you know we hear about resilience grit um also important terms um but sturdiness as as you've described it and the job of parenting um really seems to include a lot of um verbs not just nouns and adjectives and I and I'm a huge fan of verbs because biology and to some extent psychology um yes also psychology is all about verbs um and so the labels often are um mysterious but sturdiness it you know just sends a clear message of of something that um doesn't budge easily um but then as you describe the job of being a parent having boundaries and I'd like to drill into that a little bit more what how you view boundaries um but also empathy uh it's not a walled off um picture it's one that that is semi-permeable um also uh and I confess I'm a bit obsessed with um old school psychoanalytic theory not as the the the be all end all of psychology but but it also suggests um like this other other relationship like I'm a person I have a self you're a person you have a self this is the opposite of codependency where obviously dependency and two people being quote unquote codependent can be healthy in the context of relying on one another but uh as I understand it when one person has a self and another person doesn't have a self or this notion of merging not just in romantic relationships but child parent relationships you know I'm best friends with my mom or dad is that a good thing I don't know but this notion of other other relationships it's like I myself you're a self and we each see each other as another um anyway I I think there's so much to explore here so valuable um you mentioned that boundaries are something that we do and that the requires that the other do nothing um can we go a little bit further into that because um it's a beautiful concept and um this notion of boundaries but like uh gaslighting narcissism and all the other things that we hear about nowadays I think is are often badly misunderstood so tell us more about boundaries and uh how that looks in the in the action sense of it and this is all so connected to what you're saying that other other relationship I'm a person you're a person and so many times that's actually is what gets merged and so my kid gets upset that I say they can't watch another show and and apparent really in that moment it's like they're whose feelings are whose like they were upset was I was upset a second ago I thought I should set the boundary and now all of a sudden I'm changing my mind there is this complete role kind of fusion and merger which is one of the main reasons that kids get actually really scared and escalate their behavior because they don't have a sturdy leader when they really need one right so boundaries are what we tell someone we will do and they require the other person to do nothing I like this definition for a lot of reasons I'm just very practical so it allows me after I set a boundary to like assess was that a boundary or not right because let's take um let's take the TV example it's whatever time at night my kid has just watched a show and they know they were supposed to watch one show and then you know turn off the TV I hear from parents a lot my kid doesn't listen or my kid doesn't respect my boundaries and I'll say okay like that sounds hard let's get into that so then they'll say so I told my kid to shut off the TV they just kept watching they just kept on I told my kid to stop jumping on the couch and they kept jumping they don't respect my boundaries they don't listen to me this is like a beautiful example of like this is a problem I agree but this is not a boundary problem you made a request of of your child and frankly if you have your I'm making this up 7-year-old watching TV I'm not so good at putting away TV in a phone at night like it's just hard for me to do so your seven-year-old probably is just you know addicted to what's ever happening and we're kind of asking our kid to do our job for us because we don't want our kid to be mad at us or whatever it is a boundary in that situation would be saying O you didn't put off the TV look by the time I get over there if you haven't turned off the TV and I don't want to do this but I will I will take the remote out of your hand and shut it off a boundary is saying O after my request doesn't work can you get off the couch you can jump on the floor look if by the time I get over there you haven't gotten off the couch I will pick you up that is like I was say I'm not going to put the success of my intervention in my like seven-year-olds hand I care too much about my own needs and my own role as a as a leader in my home to do that right same thing with let's say in-laws my mother-in-law doesn't respect my boundary show always shows up without calling now I don't want to get to this point there's a lot of things in a relationship we can do before we get to this point but if that's really a boundary and I have a very kind of intrusive mother-in-law a boundary would be saying look this is going to be awkward and I know you mean well but the next time you come unannounced I will come to your car and say oh this time doesn't work for us you cannot come in and I will go back into my house and close the door like now there's going to be lots of feelings around that but you are now setting a true boundary and when we say our kids don't listen those are often situations not all of them but there's a big percentage where I'm actually not setting a boundary early enough and in a sturdy enough way which is what my kid needs because at that point they simply don't have the skills to inhibit and urge and they need me to be the boundary for them we hear sometimes that U kids are craving rules they're craving boundaries um I don't know I was kind of a wild Adolescent and teenager um maybe a little more than wild I I don't recall ever craving rules I but I do recall paying attention to their lack of presence so what of that um you know is this notion that kids really want and crave rules and boundaries is that is that sort of a uh I don't know projection that we put on to them um and and I'm not exploring this just just for fun I'm exploring it because I think that one thing that's very helpful in setting boundaries especially with kids is the idea that gosh even if it's a bit painful to see them in discomfort there's that empathy piece that you talked about before that empathic Attunement can um get in the way of boundaries right these are and they're not mutually exclusive but these are somewhat competing forces set at times so if we if we know or if we can acknowledge or at least explore this idea that rules are deep down what they really want not just what they need yes um maybe it would help yes and I think by the way in my taking you know the remote away or taking my kid off the couch just to be clear if I do that to my kid like they are not going to say oh mom you are the best mom in the world thank you they are going to cry and scream and that's where boundaries and empathy those two parts of our job actually do always go together I think they're actually Partners they're not actually at odds because as soon as my kid is upset what I would say to them is oh you wanted to jump on the couch it's not as much fun on the floor oh you really wanted to watch another show you didn't even want it this big you wanted to watch it this big it sounds crazy because you're like wait why am I empathizing with that feeling they just kind of disobey no they're two different things I'm doing my job and setting a boundary they're actually doing their job and feeling their feelings that's actually their job the only way you can ever learn to regulate a feeling is through feeling the feeling so they're doing their job now I'm going to validate and this is how kids learn emotion Reg ation boundaries they feel I validate I hold the boundary over and over and over so do kids crave rules and I I think one of the issues is that most parenting approaches have one or the other and I think they're both very incomplete strategies if you just lead with rules right I don't know who said it definitely wasn't me like what is it rules without relationship lead to Rebellion yeah that's what happens right so that's not good but I see this stage we've swung the other direction it is also not a complete parenting strategy when your kid's jumping on the couch to do nothing if you think that's dangerous and to say oh you really want to jump jump jump and such big feelings like that is not what kids need I think kids crave boundaries and they crave feeling seen and understood because as kids are growing up like I think the questions they're always asking parents even though of course they never say this it's just am I real and am I safe every interaction that's what they're asking us the reason we have to validate their feelings when they're upset even though they're so upset just that their string cheese broke whatever it is is feelings don't have markers like blood or like they don't know and so when we say oh you wanted your string cheese to be together what we're really saying is the things you experience inside of you are real but kids are also desperate to know like how far do things go no one likes to feel boundaryless as a kid that's terrifying right and so when we set a boundary we actually say to a kid like I will always protect you like I won't let things get so far out of control so I do think I don't know if it's rules but kids crave connection and I think boundaries and kind of validation and empathy they are the two forms of connection that kids yeah are really desperate for what about rewarding kids and here rather than um start off by asking you know what are the best ways to reward kids and healthy ways I will ask that in a moment um how can we uh evaluate the notion of of Rewards or incentives um through this lens of sturdiness boundaries and empathy yeah um because you know I could imagine you know a reward that's outsized in comparison to what a kid did you know okay great you know you you took your plate to the kitchen sink after dinner um you know you get $1,000 obviously out of scale extreme example but just by way of example um you know screw up their reward mechanisms for for for life if you ask me that everything I know about reward and neuroplasticity says that that that would occur but but this idea that you know you can incentivize kids if if you turn off the TV now then you definitely can watch tomorrow night whereas if you don't you can't like so you're sort of merging reward and potential punishment um you know it how do we bound rewards um and uh how do we take into account that when we start adding rewards to scenarios that that we're we're mixing and matching life experience for them you know okay so now doing what I'm told do I always expect a reward um if the reward doesn't come next time we know based on reward prediction error we tend to be worse off emotionally than had we never received a reward dur in the first place again pretty pretty vast parameter space but what are your thoughts on best ways to reward kids for standard good behavior yeah versus achievement versus elimination of bad behavior y maybe so three categories I think you're asking a much bigger question or I'm GNA I think you are which is like what do what why do parents think we need to reward kids I think that's why do we think we need to punish kids and this is actually where everything I work on started from because the way I was trained to work with parents I went to you know the best gold standard evidence-based program and it was all about timeouts and punishments and rewards and stickers and ignoring and praise and and honestly when during the training for the years after I kind of practiced this way my I feel like that you know this better than I am so I shouldn't even say this but like that left part of my brain like logic and linearity I was just like this is amazing oh my goodness we're going to get more of the good behavior and we're going to not get the bad behavior and and I'd start teaching this to parents my private practice and there was this little thing in me I don't even know I was like I don't know about this I don't know and it get louder and louder to the point that in a session I literally said to a parent in front of me I was just like telling them how to do a timeout and I said I'm sorry I I don't believe anything I've been telling you that's literally what I said cuz I just it was so loud and there were it was obviously super awkward but it led me to I feel like from this first principal's way be like there are a million assumptions that we have about raising kids and I think about relationships and if I just strip them back what do I be left with and what would be a new building from there and rewards and like punishments to me are these assumptions that we have somehow converted from like the fiction shelf of the library in my mind to like the non-fiction shelf as like truths and I I kind of rail against all of them so I think I think the question if that's okay to go that direction to me is like why do we think we need to reward kids and is there actually a better system system both shortterm and long-term I'm incredibly long-term greedy in my parenting approach CU at the end of the day 18 and up is where things really matter not really matter I mean they all matter but I'd rather you know I want to help my kids become sturdy resilient adults but I'm short-term greedy too cuz I'm a realist like I just can't deal with like all these difficult moments you get both for sure without rewards and punishments so I don't know what might someone tell me they give a reward for do you want to use the like clearing the table or example let's start that there it kind of goes back to like believing kids are inherently good inside I really think it goes back to that if you really believe kids are inherently good inside which by the way when I strip back every assumption the only thing I was left was that literally the only thing and then I started to think okay so if they're good inside why do they do so many annoying things like all the time but that gave me a gap and I feel like that is very exciting to have a gap like why do people who are goodness I do such bad things right adults or kids and to me right kids are born with all the feelings and none of the skills to manage those feelings like period and we've often thought therefore when feelings feelings without skills come out in behaviors I think that's what bad behaviors are feelings or urges or something without a skill to manage them or without access to the skill maybe in that moment either way and then we end up punishing Behavior but the behavior was just a sign of the lack of skill so I can't imagine anyone thinking I could teach my kid to swim by punishing them for not swimming like I think someone would say that was crazy um and but that's kind of how we raise kids and then we think rewarding them is going to be effective but it actually leads over and over to what you said I've seen these parents over and over my private practice my 14-year-old literally won't pick up their clothes from the floor unless I give them $5 like how did I get here and I'm like yeah that's that's a problem but I saw how they got there so let's take clearing you know their plate like I know this is going to sound cheesy but kids do have something in them where they want to feel like a purposeful meaningful part of society they do impact drives adults and it drives kids it's not the same type of rewarding as playing fortnite it's a totally different system but I think the question is like why do we think we have to bribe kids or you know kind of trick them into doing things that are kind of like basic part parts of human life and so if we take that and my kid chronically isn't clearing their plate I could say to them look every time you clear a plate I'm going to give you a sticker after five stickers you're going to get I don't know whatever it is to me like a much more just effective way is I'd say to my kid hey I know you know like clearing a plate is just one way of being part of this family and taking care of stuff I know you know that we're on the same team I say that phrase we're on the same team right we are um something's getting in your way of remembering I'm going to assume I like like the most generous interpretation that to me allows you to separate someone's bad behavior from their good identity then I going say what would help you remember we literally did this with my son who always had his towel on the floor and I was just like I bet he just doesn't remember he literally doesn't see it we talked about it and he's like we talked about him putting a Post-It literally something simple like a Post-It on my door that just says pick up my towel he wrote it in his own handwriting right trying to facilitate him like solving his own problems and now he has a much higher rate of picking up his towel like I guess I could have said every time you pick up your towel you'll I don't know get a dollar or whatever it is but again it makes me think I'm not building the generalizable skill that way I'm just kind of offering something at the end which sets me on this kind of awful cycle that I think kind of misses the point I'd like to take a brief moment and thank one of our sponsors and that's ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens I I started taking ag1 way back in 2012 the reason I started taking it and the reason I still take it every day is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas for vitamins and minerals and it ensures that I get enough Prebiotic and probiotic to support gut health now gut health is something that over the last 10 years we realized is not just important for the health of our gut but also for our immune system and for the production of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators things like dopamine and serotonin in other words gut health is critical for proper brain functioning now of course I strive to consume healthy Whole Foods for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day but there are a number of things in ag1 including specific micronutrients that are hard to get from Whole Foods or at least in sufficient quantities so ag1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals that I need probiotics prebiotics the adaptogens and critical micronutrients so anytime somebody asks me if they were to take Just One supplement what that supplement should be I tell them ag1 because ag1 supports so many different systems within the body that are involved in mental health physical health and performance to try ag1 go to drink a1.com huberman and you'll get a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 and five free travel packs of ag1 again that's drink a1.com huberman I love the idea that kids want purpose um and am I correct in wondering if that goes back to this am I real component of the am I real am I safe yes like one way that we know we are real is our ability to impart change on the world around us I don't want to get too abstract here but you know as a neuroscientists have often sat back and reflected like all the emotions we feel like no one sees that or knows that unless we say something we write something we sing something we shout something you know all the forms of expression just like none of our um our dreams our creative uh insights or or wishes um exist except inside US unless we transmute them into something in the real world so there does seem to be something about having this nervous system from a time we're really young like it it's seeing our effect on the world that that really makes us real and on others and um I love the idea that well and I must say I absolutely believe in my heart and I just feel it as a feeling that kids are inherently good inside like I just I can't imagine any other version of that but does that mean that there are people out there who believe that kids are inherently bad or or at least not good I mean like how could be but then again maybe I'm just naive uh I don't know if anyone consciously believes that but when I go back to that system I was first trained in rewards and punishments like it feels like a system of Behavioral control and to me like I've always thought about control and trust is opposites so I only control what I don't trust so nobody said to me that program by the way Becky everything you're learning Here We Believe kids are bad inside and so we do this thing but well if I don't trust my kid and if I don't trust they inherently have the things in them to do good by the way that's not going to happen naturally that's why we have a big job as a parent to coach our kids to bring that out to set boundaries when they can't do it and so many other things but I don't believe anyone would say yeah it's cuz they're bad inside but there is a nature where you're constantly interacting with your kid from that other system looking at them like I don't trust you I don't trust you and when you do bad things I cannot hold on to the fact that you have a good identity that's why I'm giving you a punishment that's why I'm sending you away to your room and so if I'm reflecting back to you constantly that you are just your latest behavior that I don't trust you that I kind of have to bribe you to do very basic human things well our kids form their identity from our reflection of them and so then we're this is what really compelled all of this I'm like we're raising generation after generation of kid kind of saying to them like you're kind of a bad untrustworthy kid and then we wonder why we have such high rates of like massive mental health problems well like I there's some linearity there I'm curious about this notion of impingement I I've heard about this um you know this idea that you know when we're young we're forging life deciding you know do I like the way this tastes or not tastes you know by the way I still hate anchovies I don't need to be asked again to know the answer but when you're young you know we're encour enage to do things like eat your broccoli taste the anchovy and some parents it seems are very comfortable with the idea of allowing their children to have their feelings and their wishes they their as I always say the nervous system seems to be divided into yum yucks and me Mees I guess the plur will be me um yum yucks and Mees I mean it's more complicated than that but like with people where either like yeah I really like them or no something's off there like you know um so it's not that much more nuanced than that the brain's got to make decisions afterwards after all excuse me so um you know kids have their yums yucks and Mez and then we've got our our ideas about what they need to do in order to progress through life often inherited from our parents and hopefully Modified by the wonderful work that you're doing and writing about and in your your program um that we're talking about here but you know how much space should we allow for kids to be un impinged like like you don't want to eat you don't want to eat what we're eating for dinner like okay I'm not going to cook you an entire new dinner but then I guess like you might go to bed hungry sounds harsh right um but the other version is okay what would you like for dinner well I prefer let's say they pick a healthy option they prefer pasta not chicken okay we won't do the ice cream chicken you know uh thing um do we do it right like how much impingement I don't want to watch a movie with the family I want to play in my room you know at some level you know I've heard it both ways that impingement is needed for safety and life progression but there's times when it it's uh it's more subtle than that it's not about safety and life progression it's not about going to school or not going to school homework or no homework it's about like do you want to come with us to the park you want to play at home in your room how often should we impinge um how do we know um this this kind of the the tricky the tricky areas of parenting that I think um because it doesn't fall into the extremes yeah I love this question that's a word I don't often hear actually what impingement like can you act like what like like impinging on yeah like impinging on the child's in um inherent natural desires or aversion to things got it right like you say hey we're going over so and so's house and they say you know I don't like their kids you go listen you got to learn to play with other kids and go no I don't like their kids you say did something happen and so we're not talking about a dangerous sit no I don't like I just really want to stay home this is a great so are we going to impinge on their I mean because we're teaching them either way we're teaching them something you got to do stuff you don't want to do even if you don't like it and here again we're ruling out the possibility that there's something unsafe about the environment psychologically or physically unsafe or but at the same time we're teaching them um hey you're I see you I hear you but you know your desires might not be right there there's actually a kind of an like a tacit message of the way you feel might not be the best gauge of what's best for you which sends a complicated message to a kid totally so this is again where I think at good inside like family jobs are so useful family jobs to me when I used to meet with parents and like they describe a situation I feel like 90% of the time that's where I'd start because then that flows from there it's like a framework so what is my job I'm the one who sets boundaries like I am the one who makes key family decisions obviously as our kids get older they they should be making some decisions to no one likes to feel controlled but key decisions and my job is to validate my kids experience this is actually complicated because again over and over we think that validating my kids's experience means they're going to dictate a decision my boundaries don't dictate my kids feelings and my kids feelings should not dictate my boundaries they're just two equal things so this is a great example my kids are like you know I don't like playing with those kids and I can I just stay home with let's just say Grandma was home can I just stay home I'm like I just think it's important to go as a family but my kid doesn't want to go there's nothing dangerous okay to me this is that exact way of putting family jobs into action sweetie like and to me this phrase I wish every parent could say this to their kid I believe you if you want to make a kid feel real and confident for Life confidence comes from the experience of being believed because that's how you I for me confidence is self trust it's not feeling good about yourself it's self trust I really do know the way I feel so let's say I say to my son in that situation it's I believe you I'd start that way I believe you look I I know you want to play football all day and the kid around your age hates football like that would probably be lowest on your list of types of kids you'd want to hang out with for the afternoon I totally believe you and in this family we know that sometimes we have to do things we don't love to do we do that for a family experience I say this to my kid all the time you know also just to end up being a adult you just have to end up practicing as a kid doing things you don't want to do things that are boring things that aren't your preference so you know you notch in your belt for that so you don't have to thank me and and also I know you have it in you to do your best to be polite and engaged like I just I know you're a good kid and this isn't what you want and I know we're going to get through it now if it's really hard maybe young hey let's create a sign like can you look at me and go when you feel like you're kind of at this and then me and you we're going to go to the bathroom I'm going to give you a hug and right I'm going to say I know this isn't what you want and when we get home we could watch that football game whatever it was right because what we often do is we leave ourselves with two choices with kids we either say fine stay home their feelings actually just dictated the decision that's not helpful for them I don't want my kid to learn in life when I don't want to do something people twist and turn to make that thing not happen like that's disturbing for adulthood expectations but then we do the other thing which is like you are so selfish just because you don't have a friend your age doesn't mean that you can't come with us so we either let their feelings dictate or we think our boundaries kind of give us the right to be mad at our kid right like to do both is so important and so that's where I think to me when I hear impingement like I actually think that's that is the exact space where you have the most bang for your buck as a parent like it's not enjoyable and again if I have my beautiful intervention with my son do not think my kid will look at me and say I love how you explain that that was so beautiful no he's going to roll his eyes my job is not to take the bait cuz I'm an adult and to also hold hope I think that's really important this Con concept of I'm validating my kids feelings where they are today but I need to be the one to hold hope that they can cope with it if I can't name to my kid I know you're going to get through it they're not going to be able to see that kind of next more mature version of themselves and I actually think it's the same as your best boss you know was like I know you don't want to go on this trip I I don't whatever it is I know this presentation topic isn't the one you would have chosen and there were 10 things and this was literally number 10 I totally get that and it stinks and I'm not taking anything away from that and this is the thing I need you to do and I know something about you like when you put your mind to something you always do a great job and like it's probably not going to be enjoyable but I do know you're going to do a great job on this like that's like the boss you want amazing are you adopting children by the way I'm I actually I finished college and actually I actually consider Andrew you adult children uh what I'm hearing is don't dictate their behavior with and I'm going to underline and bold dictate don't dictate their behavior you're going to do this because I said so that's dictatorship but at the same time don't quash the emotion behind the resistance kind of acknowledge it make them feel real um I believe you I I love this phrase amazing and I love your definition of confidence if people didn't hear that we're definitely going to repeat it again and we're going to we're going to etch it into your neural circuitry because I love that it's it's a it's a self trust yes and this notion of giving hope you're giving them a an incentive that's based on a reward that's actually good for them that they can translate to other situations as well uh wow um can I double click on reward because you know what made me think I didn't think until you said that like I think in a situation we'd be tempted to say like and if you go and you're polite I'll give you 20 extra minutes of Roblox right that's like and first of all let me to say something like whatever I say to you like for listeners like it's not like I do this stuff all the time with my actual kids I'm the first one sometimes to be like here's your thing I have to dangle you a little section in the comment section on YouTube where your kids can no I'm just kidding exactly your kids are forbidden no oh wait that's wait that's dictating we understand why you I believe that you would want to comment um but but we're going to trust uh we're going to let you know why it's a it's good for you if you don't anyway I'll practice this on someone else's kids but the reward like the when your kid ends up seeing themsel capable of doing something they didn't previously think they could do you know better than me like I feel like that is like one of the best rewards even if it's getting through a social situation or I think about this a lot with you know my little kid is I don't know like struggling with a puzzle or something and I could just do it for them or if I help them kind of regulate oh this is a hard puzzle and you can take a break I I just know you're going to figure it out today I just know it and then because of that they get there that feels in your body like that is the best kind of reward and it's the type of reward that works for kids in adulthood when they're in a job we want them to be motivated by the feeling going to have of Pride not be saying hey I finished my thing early do I get a bonus to their boss like that's that's not going to play out as well I love it I um I'm just pausing and shaking my head only because I love it so much um and I just want to make sure that I don't quickly move to the next question without drilling down even deeper into some of these Concepts um I believe you as the feedback uh or response that can instill real confidence over time um not to get too nuanced here but how is it different because I I sense it is different than I hear you I hear you but you're going to do this anyway yes or I hear you but listen in this family yeah um I believe you that the word believe is powerful and I believe there's real power in specific words as is you know like for instance sturdiness again such a such a powerful and underused word I believe you um what do you you're olist what what do you think we're hearing when somebody says I believe you that's different than I hear you I haven't listed these out but I think we all have these like core needs as humans and I think being believed is one of them because it's it's someone else kind of saying you're real that's what I I might not feel what you're feeling but that thing that feels strong to you that nobody can see or measure is real and when I think about the most confident people like I think about this girl who I went to Duke with and she was just brilliant like so smart we were in this seminar it was one of these small classes where this professor was like talking about stuff and like I for once I was like I have no idea what this person's talking about but like I was like no one else was stopping and this girl raised her hand and she said I'm sorry if everyone else is annoying like I have no idea what you're talking about like is there any cuz I usually do and like is there any way you could say that in different way that is like to me the utmost version of confidence that she believed her own experience of confusion was real confusion she didn't think it was a sign she was stupid she she believed it she believed herself that is so confident and I think when someone says I hear you they're they're they it's like a version of listening there's many worse phrases no damage is done when we follow anything but but we tend to in validates that's not good anyway I believe you but is also not going to but there's a million examples of this to me that build confidence and I actually think there's so many situations with kids where they say situations and we worry oh they have low confidence and then we intervene to quote make them feel better which actually is the thing that lowers their confidence because it's like we say to them I don't believe you you're not really feeling the way you feel where I believe you is the exact opposite so like I like to give an example just because it makes it concrete like my will come home and say um I don't know um I was pick last for you know for Dodgeball today I was pick last and something and and they're they're clearly very very sad right and we want to say to them like it's no big deal or everyone's pick last sometimes or but remember yesterday you told me you were pick first for basketball and we think like I need to build up my kids confidence those are confidence I want to say destroying that's reducing interventions cuz a kid is kind of coming to a parent basically saying I'm very very upset that I was picked last and we're saying to a kid no you weren't and they're like but I am and what they learn is this is really terrifying to me is other people are better feelers of my feelings than I am and it has like a million really scary interpersonal I think relationship you know kind of consequences later down later down in life but when a kid says you know I was pick last and nobody even wants me and they all think I'm the worst athlete whatever kids say to sit and say some version of like I'm so glad we're talking about this and I could tell that was a really hard gym class and sweetie like I I believe you you will watch your kid it is crazy to me what parents tell me happen when they say those words to their kids they're like it also just like literally diffused everything and they were like ready to move on like they are just trying to tell you probably like I was feeling something it was a lot it was confusing right our feelings are always hardest when we're alone in them so I was alone in it and I bring it to you when someone says I believe you not only are they giving you that core need they're also just like they're like sitting down with you and it and that's that makes everything better and then meanwhile what a kid feels like when we say I believe you to a hard experience or hard feeling is they're like the feelings that overwhelm me don't overwhelm my parents they can tolerate it they're not scared of me kind of being a loser in gym class one day and if my parent likes me when I have that feeling like I can start to like myself when I have that feeling it's so great because it sounds like it accomplishes both things it makes kids feel real and safe yes real and safe and you know I can't help but ask say because you know how we started off today was that this isn't just about parent child relationships but in friendships in romantic relationships in cooworker relationships that the words I believe you I have to presume based on everything I'm hearing now and feeling inside about it that it's equally effective huge well you know years ago I was on like a podcast early on and to me there are these three lines that kind of all go together when kids are anyone's upset and it's kind of like you start and to me it's like beautiful invitation to have that conversation just to say to someone I'm so glad you're talking to me about this right and then kind of I believe you tell me more and my husband that when he heard it was like you know you could like say those words to me sometimes like I would like that because and I think about the workplace too like you have someone come in they upset about I don't know I got staffed on this or I'm not getting a promotion and I I thought I was like just diffuse it with just I'm so glad you're talking to me about this yeah I've been working nonstop for and just if you say to them like I I believe you cuz we usually don't say to someone I don't believe you but what we'll say is we we defend ourselves in that moment and the way the other person receives it is as if we're saying I don't believe the intensity of the experience you're having and when you do lead with I believe you same thing in a partnership you know like every time I ask you to do something you get really hot and bothered like it doesn't even mean you agree you're kind of just believing I like I like I believe you like tell me more right I believe you that that really upset you and like I'm obviously I have a whole another story in my head but like I hear what you're saying and and I know there's something there and I believe it enough to like be open to hearing more about it I don't know that's like what's best that's what that's what we all want in our in our Partnerships I mean I'm widey I mean what a beautiful acknowledgement that as you pointed out is not agreeing to accept someone else's reality to the extent that you're going to dismantle the the you know the order of the world whatever it is but it's such an opening as opposed to a closing and as you said it's non- defended but it's also boundaried I mean there's just so many things about it that feel good um seem good and and clearly are good you know I don't want to go down the the um tragic Rabbit Hole of trauma but um previous guest on his podcast um you know is defined we should probably Define trauma just because because it gets thrown around a lot trauma an event or set of circumstances um that fundamentally change the way that the brain and nervous system works so that there's a maladaptive response going forward it's not every bad thing that happens but but there are microt traumas sometimes called small T more macr traumas big te again could be multi-event or single event but years ago a different psychologist psychiatrist who's an adolescent um psychiatrist at Stanford said something uh in a seminar that just really struck me which was that at at its core trauma is really about confusion over who's responsible um and and here we're not just talking about the the more Salient examples of like sexual assault that those two of course but you know like if if we get screamed at um or we observe something like third person trauma like the The Logical stance is well okay that was them not me but when this happens especially when we're young the ner system the brain some somehow interprets this as like I was there I had a role in it just by being there so like what was my role and somehow the emotional response becomes one of responsibility even if we know like they're clearly the one that initiated this and so um the reason I'm bringing this up in this context is that it's almost like that lack of belief in self somehow gets rooted in and then that it all feels confusing and then we don't feel safe that's right because it's a confusion about responsibility again going back to this um we go down that rabbit hole for a second please please that's why I raised it I think that I want your think trauma is actually not events it's the way an event gets processed and I I love Gabor M's definition of praa it's not what happens to you it's what happens inside of you right so to me there's an inherent relationality there where events that get proc not any event events with high emotionality let's say that get processed in aloneness become traumatic and I think that's where it gets linked to responsibility so this is actually what my TED Talk was about and why repair is so important um who said this Ronald Fairburn years ago that for kids it is better to be a sinner in a world ruled by God than to live in a world ruled by the devil I think it explains almost everything about Child Development right there going back to goodness also your parent just screamed at you and by the way your parent I scream at my kids everyone's going to scream at their kids it's going to happen Okay that's just the event the event's not going to have the impact what is happening for a kid well we know kids are oriented by attachment they literally need us to survive like they could not survive on their own and so what do you do when the person you're dependent on for safety becomes the source of danger and threat that's very confusing for a child in that moment so they're super hyperaroused they're in this state of you know Terror and then usually after in my house too I just yell at my kid they're kind of alone in their room I'm alone in the kitchen or wherever meanwhile spinning like I'm such a bad parent like I'm Pro you know but meanwhile because I'm so lost in my own guilt I might not be going to my kid and so what happens for my kid if I don't repair after I scream at them or one of these events right well a kid cannot say to themselves my parent just had a bad day then the Badness is in my parent my leader I'm I'm young now right like I don't understand Nuance my leader can't be bad so I must take on the Badness at least then I have control so kids after they're kind of yelled at in the absence of repair they will they really only have two options for how to regulate and feel safe again they can self-blame it's all my fault which is why I feel like most adults when they have a hard time they tell themselves like it's my fault I'm not good enough it's like the legacy of that story from childhood or they use self-doubt maybe that didn't happen maybe I overreacted maybe I can't trust myself again it leads to adults who basically say like did I overreact or let me call five friends let me see if they think what my boyfriend did was a big deal because they can't trust themselves and so trauma trauma what I want every parent to know is they say I left my kid alone and I didn't pick them up at the soccer field is that going to traumatize them and I'll say well that's just the event like did you say to them hey that probably felt scary what was that like H you're right like you were alone now all of a sudden next to the event that that was scary is my story and my connection it got processed in a safe connection it didn't get processed in Al loneness and that's that's a massive massive difference in the scenario you are describing the parent who yelled goes to the child uh having been that child um and perhaps also having been that parent um how do we deal with the fact that sometimes you know we don't want to be around the person that yelled at us it hurt it hurts to receive the care or there's there's a there's a like a textured landscape as opposed to a smooth landscape there like like okay now you're ready for everything to be peaceful I'm still with my feelings I guess that's where the I believe you comes in and that's where the Sorting it through process begins I think it's like what version of a parent comes back to me the the first thing we have to do in a repair process is actually repair with ourselves as a parent really because if you haven't repaired with yourself which to me is kind of separating your identity again from your behavior like okay Becky I'll use myself an example I'm a good parent who just screamed at her son like I did not mess up forever and you see when you try to repair with yourself those two things get collapsed I'm like I messed him up forever I'm a monster wait like I'm a good parent who did something I'm not proud of you can't repair with someone until you've repaired with yourself they feel it from you they actually it usually is like then you're asking for them I'll be like it's okay right like you forgive me right that's not a repair that's like using your child to try to do something we just have to do on our own or with other adults but if I've repaired with myself I'm going to show up in a different way might I have a feisty kid I might like I don't care it's not better that's okay I'm not repairing to get something from my child I'm repairing to give an experience to them so we can also get creative you know your kid is older you text them you slip a door under the note you say okay I just have to say this one thing to me this line really matters to like snatch that self-blame out of a kid's body it's just like I'm sorry I yelled it is it's never your fault when I yell and it's not and people who argue like our ability to regulate our emotions predated our child's existence like that you know like they had they had something they did something and we felt frustrated but that's very different than yelling right and saying that to your kid is so important meanwhile the day you might say by the way let's really figure out how to get out the door in a smoother way you know you could work on whatever they need to work on but the reason I think most kids end up rejecting parents apologies is it's not really repair we're asking our kid for permission to be okay again or our repair sounds like hey I'm sorry I yelled but you know like if you just got ready in time that wouldn't have happened or we say I'm sorry you felt that way I'm sorry you felt that way those are not like none of those are actually repairs and if that's what a kid's been used to they're going to keep a parent more at Bay so is it safe to say that we can always come back to making the kid feel real and safe I believe you is a great place to start and the reason I keep coming back to these these simple things is that simple but very very potent by the way um is that in the real world landscape of parenting family and life things are happening really fast and it's very Dynamic and it's multifaceted I mean we haven't even talked yet about how when there's two parents like the one that didn't yell um when there's multiple siblings when I mean there's you know human dynamics on a one in in other other landscape is is hard enough and then when you start introducing the real world landscape um things happen fast so having something that people can reach to really quickly what I call in the landscape of stress modulation which is something that I'm more familiar with from my labs work is you know real time tools yep real time tools like we're all at our best after meditation vacation M and a good night's sleep but what about real time tools when everything's everything's hectic um so what does a really good apology look like in the real world yeah um because a really good apology in the ideal world of uh Instagram um is yeah I believe you I'm so sorry with no butts no this that but a real apology sometimes is as you're boarding a plane or when there's a bunch of other things that are going on and you haven't even dealt with those yet or when you're on your way to an event or yeah okay so you get it uh what does a really good internal landscape for apology look like like how can we touch into where we need to be and then what are the words that even if we have to try again later and again and again later with that person in this case kid but person more generally um what's the like go-to solid apology so yeah I think you are never going to go wrong saying I believe you to your kid like obviously not have you say it randomly but if they're really upset you yelled at me I believe you like if that's all you can remember you're crushing it I think a realistic repair you have to do something for yourself and like to me it can be a very simple Mantra like to me I'm a good parent who is having a hard time is the one I use honestly over and over just and after I yell at my kid before I'll like go to the bathroom sometimes and I'll say that to myself Becky like I'm a good parent having a hard time and I'll kind of say it as many times as I need until I really do feel something like shift a little in my body it just because again I think that phrase separates what I did from who I am right and then to me a realistic apology it could be super simple if you remember nothing else could just be like I'm sorry I yelled that's that's great if you wanna if you're like I'm feeling it Becky give me that next step I'm you know I'm sorry I yelled just like you I'm working on managing my emotions and you know next time even when I'm frustrated I'm going to try to stay calm something about the next time you know if you want to throw in that it's not your fault kids it seems an odd thing because parents are like why do kids assume it's their fault it is their default position and so it's never a bad thing to throw in but honestly just simply hey I'm sorry I yelled that actually gives them that realness because without saying anything more you're saying that thing you think happened did happen so that's powerful I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor insid tracker insid tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your

and rudeness and again let's um extend this to all relationships so you get in your best mindset and by the way I love this I am thing um two of the most important words in any language um when translated to other languages I am blank I am a good this or I am whatever role identity is key to the brain um we know this um you go in and you say I'm really sorry I struggle to regulate my emotions yeah I believe that you're really upset yeah and the kid says I hate you m now earlier you said that good boundaries are about not expecting a change in behavior from someone else they about our own boundaries so um or maybe the I hate you comes from you know listen we're not going to go to so and so's house for a play date today great example I hate you yeah I hate you um so is there ever a case for no response I mean to me the most underutilized parenting strategy is doing nothing literally it's one of my most used strategies because and there's there's there's like really good reason for it especially in this situation so I always to me like I always say we have to understand before we intervene so I know every parent like what do you do in that situation but it's like trying like it's like trying to fix someone's tennis swing before you like look at their tennis swing right like what there could be a lot of problems so again why is a kid saying I hate you and I would ask every parent to just keep this in mind it's a tool and you can't use it in real time eventually you can but we have to say it at like the end of a night when my kid said I hate you what what is my most generous interpretation of why he would say that to me and if you're like any human me included by the way like your least generous interpretation is immediate you're like because he's a sociopath like that's what we say all the time we're like wow or because he's like a horrible kid because he's spoiled because he's nasty it comes easily so that's fine but what is my most generous interpretation and when I don't know I'll push myself to say okay well like I was in a situation with my husband what would lead me to say that I what would lead you to say that to someone that I hate them yeah like they like say something to you like hey Andrew we're not going to be able to you know do this dinner it would have to be some sort of deep betrayal of trust and and when I'm and I have to acknowledge that if I said that to somebody that I really care about or love if as I'm saying I hate you what I'm really saying is I love you so much and that hurt unbelievably at such an unbelievable intensity that what's coming out of my mou say I hate you because if you because if you didn't love them that's right it would have null effect it would be a me it would be it would be a it would be a met but instead it's a oh it hurts so we somehow there's a neural circuit in there that goes you know I whatever insert explicative hate you that's right but what you're really saying is I love you so much yeah and as a consequence that thing you did or said hurts so much that's right and so I think that's like exactly what's going on for a kid or like to me my most generous interpretation in a simple way is my kid when I said we couldn't go to this friend's house that he thought we were going to his friend he was going to sleep over he had like so built it up in his mind he'd like probably like kids do like they have this whole image oh and then we're going to do this and this and like the let down was so intense and again I go back to kids have all the feelings we have and they're born with none of the skills so it takes a lot of it takes like a pretty welldeveloped skill to be really disappointed by the way and surprised right in the moment and like manage it in like a mature way I I'm sure we both know adults who aren't really capable of doing that right so the fact that my seven-year-old is doing that so if I think about it that way we latch on to our kids words as if they're the truth they're not the truth it's not to say they don't matter but they're not the truth the truth is whatever world is under the words like I'm disappointed and I don't know how to manage that so if I think about the outcome like what would where do I want to be what I would love in that situation because the truth is when I say to my kid sorry we can't go to Bobby's house I wouldn't even want it's not normal for my kid to be like oh no problem because like I would I'm just picturing my 25-year-old like trying to get a job and being like Mom oh I didn't get it and then he's like no problem I'm like that's kind of weird like really like that's weird like I'd want you to be disappointed and so what I want my kid to be able to do is to be like I don't know what's the best to gets like oh man I was really looking forward to that that's like ultimate maturity so how do I get from I hate you to oh man I was really like you know looking forward to that the all the things we want to do just like don't even make sense like sending my kid to their room saying like you're such a nasty kid I've never seen any of your friends say that to their parents and I'm good at acting these things out because of course I say these things too but all I'm doing is basically telling my kid the version of themselves I don't want them to be so now I'm further away from that outcome just not effective my kid obviously literally needs to learn some of those skills and practice them we don't think about simulations with kids nearly enough we know that in sports people practice all the time we don't do that with emotion regulation so what do I do in the moment I think the best question here is what do I do outside the moment to help my kid build the skills so they actually have more of a skill the next time that moment comes still I'm a pragmatist what do I do in the moment I hate you I probably would do nothing first when someone is rude to you and they say something nasty I don't know I just like this is one this is my son this is me my son just hurled I hate you it's like sitting between us when we say back to them like you know I hate you or like go to your room we take all the energy from what they said and we just like throw it and then like we have this pingpong match when you do nothing I always picture if this is like that I hate you it just sits between us my kid has a much higher chance of kind of reing what they just said because I'm just kind of sturdy in that moment because I didn't just take it from them and say something to them which just gives them the opportunity to like take what I said and have no responsibility for the first thing they said it's always true in adults when someone says to you like something nasty if you actually just stay there they're kind of like oh shoot like I shouldn't have said that because like it's it's right there so I'd probably say nothing no a couple I don't know if I'd really do that but I'd want to do that let me be clear something else you can say and moment which takes a lot of presence so it's not going to happen right away is just something like Whoa like clearly you're disappointed I get that I believe you and I know there's another way you can say that to me that's actually right back to family jobs I'm validating and I'm setting kind of a boundary in some ways like I know maybe there's a hope there too like I know there's another way if my kid keeps saying I hate you I hate you you're the worst you're the worst I'm going to say listen I love you you're a good kid you're you're having a hard time I I really won't stay in your room while you keep saying this to me and part of that is cuz it's not good for you either like this isn't a good Dynamic I'm going to step outside I'm going to come back and we can talk about it when we're both in a place where we can be a little more respectful or something like that right you don't have to be a punching bag but at least now I'm helping my kid see that he is having a feeling under these words if I can't differentiate the feeling from the behavior how can I expect my kid to ever learn to differentiate those two which is how my kid can actually get to a more regulated place I've sometimes wondered whether or not parents are either afraid of or Not Afraid enough of their kids um I've known some parents that are afraid of their kids because and perhaps as a consequence who knows what the chicken egg uh is there all we know is the parent was alive first the kids learn to control their parents through not necessarily emotional outbursts but the threat of emotional outbursts I've seen this again and again and it's it's a pretty wild thing to observe um and of course as an observer it's far easier than when you're in it but this idea like who like they're like a pot ready to Bo boil over uh um you know like they're going to pop um and I've seen this in teachers in the classroom I I've seen this in so many venues where whether or not the child understands that they're somehow controlling the situation or not that there's just an inherent fear of what could happen and then I think kids feel a certain power but they don't feel safe right I mean how could they right they children yes um so for the parents out there that are afraid of their kids potential responses and or how bad their kid quote unquote might turn out if they were to really lay down the law here I'm using kind of old school language but I listen I grew up you know I'm 48 years old so you know I yeah I mean my parents you know didn't physically abuse us but there might have been a spanking every once in a while or I I don't know what the rule is nowadays or the or the the uh standard out there you know I think I won't say which why I might have taken a smack here or there but not many um and it there was also a lot of love um but clearly um and here I'm not I'm not supporting the use of corporal punishment I want to be very clear um but you know yeah kids can be tough and then also you know it wasn't long into my high school years when I was physically larger than both my parents I never used that to intimidate them but I have to imagine when your kid is larger than you if you were already psychologically afraid of them now you it's clear to both of you that the uh the tables have turned that's right right I'm talking about the the unconscious semiconscious aspects of it I'm not talking about who can you know obviously physical fights there's not something I ever want to see or participate in in a household so this this is an amazing topic like walking on eggshells this is right and this is terrifying to a kid because again if a kid is trying to figure out like am I real and am I Safe Kids do experience feelings in such an intense way because they don't have any of those skills and they're so surprising and they're so visceral that it is scary to them and there're are kind of especially these groups of kids I call them deeply feeling kids that do feel things more intensely and they do have more of these big massive Tantrums they even look animalistic often during they try to scratch you they'll hiss during them they'll growl his really yes there was a I grew up with some biters yeah kids that bite yes that's because again those are just feelings literally uncontained that are exploding out and where do they explode out through your extremities so they that's really what it is and so what will happen and this is this really unfortunate dance and one of the my favorite things to help people turn around is then kids kind of sense from a parent like I really am as toxic as I worried I was right and again if we go back to that pilot thing like I think about a pilot who's like um we have to make an emergency landing we're not going to be able to go to La and we're all going to land in Cleveland whatever it is I picture of the passenger who's like you are going to take us to LA and the Pilot's like okay okay like can you imagine you're like it doesn't matter that this person is pissed like you're the pilot you don't have to keep us happy please keep us safe and if you're in that plane and you're terrified because you're like we have to make an emergency landing I promise you you're way more terrified when you hear this person change the decision because of the threat that a passenger is going to be very very upset and that is actually what we do when we're walking around on eggshells now the alternative to this again we live in this world in parenting where there's a binary where we say and you said it yourself so I'm going to lay down the law like I don't recommend that either like especially with a kid like that that's not going to be the best solution these kids have to be seen as good kids they are good kids and when I we meet with parents of these kids I hear about them and like I always say I hear about them and I have a kid like this so I get it and I'm just like I really like your kid and they're like what I was like I do and they're like and then they usually start crying and they go you're literally the first person in 11 years who's ever said that including like the parents like you like our kid why I'm like they're tenacious they're they know what they want they seem like they have 0% people pleasing in them these kids will change the world but not if they're boundaryless then they'll become tyrants and that's that's really terrifying and I'm going to teach you how to be the sturdy leader which is equally firm as it is warm and that's going to start today and so like here's an example of these deeply feeling kids I think you said something about like watching like a TV show where these kids it feels like they hold the family emotionally hostage right and because if you don't pick the the movie that they want to watch on family movie night they will scream they will cry and they will do that for 3 hours they well other kids after you're like they're they don't Peter out these kids these kids interestingly enough get in an awful cycle with their parents because they have such intense emotions more often which more escalations which tend to get met with invalidation you're so dramatic you ruin everything they are that much more desperate to be believed they escalate further you can understand how that would lead to more distance and invalidation and We're Off to the Races in a bad Direction and I would say to the parents you're going to during family movie night tomorrow night this is what you're going to do and you're going to by the way I would say this is how concrete I get you're going to write this down and you're going to say it to a voice recorder with your own voice and I want you to play it back and see how sturdy you sound and they'll often do it and they'll be like wow I didn't even believe myself when I said that I'm so scared of my child right you're going to do it again and then you're going to do it again and this is this is just like any other skill we practice and you're going to say to your kid look I know in this family you know Bobby usually we let him pick the movie he gets really upset if not we all tonight's going to be different Bobby it is your sister turn to pick the movie and I know you're going to be upset and I just want to tell you exactly what's going to happen and I'm going to in this example I'm saying there's a two Family household which is an assumption but even if there's one say if you're super upset and screaming I'm going to bring you to your room this is important I'm going to sit with you and I'm going to stay there and this is a line that I know from our deeply feeling kid Workshop has really and you have to believe it to say it I am not scared of your feelings and I know parents will say to me but Dr Becky I I am scared of their feelings I'm like yeah you're going to fake it till you make it they they need to hear that because if you think about the image of these kids their feelings feel so overpowering to them they feel more but they're actually more poorest to the world so they both have more coming in and they are actually always terrified of how much of them can flow out and so they feel their feelings in that way it's almost like my tantrum in the house takes up the entire living room that's why you actually have to bring them to a smaller room and you actually have to contain them in that way as a way of kind of saying like it only goes this far like literally I will not let you dictate family movie and always sitting in the front sea and your favorite chair at dinner like it only goes this far and that is truly an act of love and protection and safety for those kids how how often do You observe that these deep deeply feeling kids is that how they refer to um I mean I made up the term so but yeah deeply feeling kids you're you are qualified to to to qualify to so deeply feeling kids um also Express these uh deep feelings in the positive sense um I mean because I can think of some kids I grew up with and I can look at my own experience of um like it's hard to know we don't have a calibration point it's not like body temperature of like how much I feel versus how much you feel we look at the external expression of these things like the the acal gland secrete some tears or not like you know as you were talking about this this thing before I noticed I like wed up a little bit and I'm thinking yeah look I can remember seeing things and feeling things and like whoa it's a really big inside I don't remember screaming at my parents telling them I hate them I probably did at some point but um but I have observed other other kids peers that grew up that clearly fell into this category and have gone on to do REM REM arable things yes remarkable like extraordinary things because it's it's a capacity it that doesn't always skew towards negative expression it can also like immense expressions of love and and you know I think these days that there's a tendency to for unqualified or like truly unqualified people um because they're not trained to do so to slap labels like borderline right splitting like good object bad object splitting and indeed that's that exists in the as a diagnosis and and symptoms of borderline but that um we punish rather than U believe and observe that these things exist there's range in nervous system tuning and affect and um so put simply um do deeply feeling kids also tend to express love and joy and um and positive emotions with the with the same intensity or near same intensity I would say it depends on some like it depends on kind of kind of their stage of development and the nature of the interactions they've kind of received back I think deeply feeling kids I always say are super sensors like if youve won these kids and I've won these kids we live in New York City she will not go into a New York City Garage okay like where we park our car and she's like the smell and I'm the rest of us are like what are you talking about meanwhile I have another friend who lives in a totally different area of Manhattan and she's a deeply feeling kid she's when she's like my daughter the same thing like I actually believe that my daughter smells something that I don't smell like they are super sensors in that way right and she notices the little detail of something now in terms of the intense love I think for these kids their vulnerability sits so close to their shame this is why they get so explosive they almost experience their feelings as attackers which is again why parents can get scared of them and they do because again they feel that feeling so intensely that they have this deep fear of Abandonment of being too much and so they that shame tries to shut it down although it obviously doesn't work and it explodes what I've noticed with deeply feeling kids and this to me is actually like truly my proudest body of work and you mentioned borderline so we'll go there people have said like these sound almost like kids who are like have some predilection to to borderline and obviously having gone to a PhD program where told a lot about invalidating environments and things like that I'm not really one for labels either but I just got so much Insight from my honestly my own kid where I was like wow like she is so different and how she processes things and what she needs and how she responds to my very same interactions as my other kids like they're very different and that fear of Abandonment and being too much it was like it was like there from the start it really feels like it was like there what's so interesting is I feel like through working with her by the way in a very different way because these kids reject almost every typical parenting strategy you go to validate these kids' feelings it's like you're trying to intrude on them and steal their heart because if you think about their porousness they're so terrified of being taken over that when you're like seeing a feeling they feel like you're like seeing into them and so they reject you I always say you can't go in the front door with these kids you've got to like find these side door approaches but now of all my kids she is by far the cuddliest the most loving the most emphatic about our relationship up this trip now I'm going to miss you so much like the idea when she was for that any of that I would say to someone like you are crazy you are talking about a different kid so I think that yes that deep love is there and it we just have to kind of make it a little safer for those kids to access it is there any kind of General statements that one can still make accurately about differences in the expression or perhaps even the experience of deeply feeling kids in boys versus girls great question um I actually haven't noticed a ton there might be I'd love to look more into that but in terms of I want to be accurate I haven't noticed that yet I think one of the things you know you have one of these kids is if you know the moments when you're a parent where your kid like needs you like there and in those moments your kids push you away they push you away when they need you the most that's like I think a really common quality for the for those kids and how how um common is this um I sound like such a like a a biologist this deeply feeling kid phenotype I I don't I don't I don't want to you know I don't want to um lessen the the importance of of of what you're saying by saying it that way because actually what I think you're saying is incredibly important resonates with me on a lot of different levels in fact so um but as far as I know it's not a DSM diagnosis and thank goodness it's not because that would pathologize it right um so but you know of the you know in in a classroom full let's make it a big classroom a 100 Kids yeah um how many of those kids Pro and I'm guessing it's a Continuum but would fall into this category of of deeply feeling I think you're right it's a Continuum and connecting topics I know you've spoken about I've been doing a lot of looking into this overlap with deeply feeling kids and neurode Divergence and ADHD and what I think interesting about that is we we have these workshops these deeply feeling kid workshops and a lot of them we do live and there's this whole chat right and I'll say these things people like that you know and they're definitely ideas they haven't heard but what I think is more healing is thousands of people in the chat and and saying I I thought when I say the hissing thing the chat is like a waterfall I thought I was the only one I thought so like there are so many of these kids why I think there's more and more something I need to look more into but I I think it does really if you think about these kids as more porous and you think about how insanely stimulating the world is that we bring up kids what comes into them it would make sense that I think this is like a growing type I'm guessing it's similar with ADHD too I are so many more kids diagnosed than in the past the world we bring up kids in the sensory overload if you're kind of that much more porous that's going to overload your system and you know it see and I think that I think that's also why more and more kids are so what's the percentage I don't I don't know like uh maybe 20 but that don't that's fairly high percentage I do I think it's a fairly high percentage but that feels right it just sort of feels right based on my observation of adults also yeah um feels right might also explain a lot of the um apparent conflicts and and um misunderstandings in adult relationships that's ex and we I mean so many people like they'll say to me I was oh my goodness like that was like that was like years of therapy for me watching that I thought I would took that from my kid like this was me and I finally talking about I believe you that's what I mean deeply feeling kids are desperate to be believed and they're desperate for our attempts to connect with them because their deep fear is their unlovability and so they do reject typical you know it's a Dan get out of my room fine you're so difficult and then see I really am as unlovable and bad as I worried I was right unless we kind of reverse that cycle I'd be willing to bet my life that most of the ultra successful performing artists that we observe um you I'm not going to name names but just think of ultra successful that the people whose words music poetry writing acting uh presence evokes immense uh emotion in other people so much that people will pay money to see these people Express their emotions and what's inside them fall into this deeply feeling category 100% I mean it just can't be any other way right yeah the the muted uh perform former unless that's the the shtick so to speak is um is just not compelling yeah yeah and um a lot of what we're talking today is about um the kind of um tuning fork nature of emotions uh it's a wow what what a tricky balance speaking of that I'd like to just return to something I raised earlier and then I made the mistake it was my fault of shutting the hatch on it I'd like to reopen that hatch which is um when there's two parents maybe they're under the same roof maybe they're not uh or let's just say two caretakers um so kids are pretty darn good at figuring out who to go to For What and how to balance out negative experiences by seeking out the positive reinforcement of the other sometimes even pitting parents and caretakers against one another I mean makes children sound diabolical but adults do it too it's called gossip what can co-parents co- caretakers um do to try and align strategies or if necessary to offset um some like bad stuff that the other parent might be doing and in today's landscape where it's about 50% of of marriages and in divorce at least in the US you also have the the situation where then their um new significant others come in and now you've extended the landscape to you know sometimes five or six different parents you know yeah my familyes my biological family starting to look like the UN we've got so many countries and religions and like this thing it's kind of nice on the one hand but um lots of Divergence of opinion and emotional stance and background so how in the world do we do we wrap our efforts around this yeah so I one of the most common questions I get from a parent at good inside is like can you convince my partner why the way they do things is wrong and you know do things more like good inside and so essentially I always say like yeah I'm not for a million Reasons I'm not like too interested in taking that phone call um you know but yeah I don't get involved in couple disputes either um you know but but again assuming and you've said this a couple times which I love like I'm assuming the way your kind of partner or you know the co-parent does things is not like really like damaging your child obviously that's like really time for an intervention no hitting no emotional abuse exactly but you know even like I'm not a believer of saying for a timeout right like I don't believe in timeouts and punishments I I don't think they feel good to kids or parents and I also don't think they're effective no so time out's not effective I don't think so okay and I and we probably should have closed the hatch on I have to imagine that the going uh word in the profession of psychology and raising kids properly is you never spank them you never hit them yeah no okay all right for the record so maybe we'll get back there but just to go on the record and I think you can sense from my style not punishing or timeouts like doesn't mean you're permissive at all there's zero % permissive or even softness I think you know and not well there softness there's 0% permissive in those moments but we can get back there but let's say your partner does do that or the co-parent right like I would be the first to say to someone like do I think that that's like messing up your kid I I don't I really don't especially if for example in that situation let's say um I'm divorced and my now ex you know I just know that they do timeouts or this and I've tried to talk to them but you know whatever they're not getting on board with the style and to me what happens is like you have a kid they come back to you and they're like you know um papa gave me a timeout and we don't do that in my house and my first thing is I call my ex that's usually what I do or the school did this and I call the school I called the ex and I'm like why did you do that we don't do that what I think is really important and I actually find it very like relieving to as a parent be like what's actually most important is helping my kid understand their experience like we Center the other person and what they're doing wrong wrong instead of centering our kid we might need to call a parent the other parent and say like hey it would be really great to get on the same page could we could we do this course together that would just be great you don't have to agree with anything I I think that would be great but in that moment what my kid needs actually is more like wait that's kind of hard confusing so like in our house when you do something like you scream I hate you you know I intervene in one way and when you go to your dad's house he intervenes in a very different way it's a lot of like that's a lot of switching to make sense of you know or maybe my kid says um mom never apologizes to me after she yells and I would call you know or maybe it's my own wife and I'm like hey you know the importance of repair haven't you listened to all this literature you know I would like to have some influence on that but what I feel like my kid needs in the moment it's more like tell me what happened oh oh she yelled at you and yeah look something I know like I know Mom was I know she had a really stressful day at work and look this isn't your responsibility but you can just know this mom has a really hard time apologizing to her has a really hard time apologizing and actually when people have a hard time apologizing they seem cold and like they don't care they actually usually just feel so ashamed of what they did and the reason I'm telling you that is not because you have to take care of her but just so you know this so wasn't you and anytime something happens with mom that doesn't feel good and you feel like you can't resolve it like you can talk to me and I'm going to get out of roleplay for a sec but I think you can see like I'm not throwing my wife under the bus like at all um but I'm centering what my kid needs what my kid needs going back is they need to process that experience with an adult they feel safe with rather than being aloneness and I I often picture like this kid on the couch who tells me a problem at their dad's house or at school and I like go off to make a call and I picture them alone being like Oh like now I'm alone like I where's like I didn't really want you to go do that I just wanted you to like listen to me you know um there might then be a step two you know to kind of get on the same page or when parents say get on the same page I think the problem is that we're not like looking at the same page forget getting on the same page we're not even speaking the same language like people say to me my partner won't even watch a video with me that I just want to even even if they disagree that is the problem and frankly that's not a parenting problem that's also what I'll say to someone if you say to your partner look I've been a member of inside and it's been really helpful and it resonates and you don't have to agree with it but like I would love to watch this 4minute video if you're partner says no that has nothing to do with parenting that is a core relationship problem that they just don't care to do something that you say is important to you that's a that's a marriage problem that's all right so and I think it's really important and we talk about this a lot like if that was someone I'd coach them to say hey and you don't have to agree but if you don't commit to watching a 4-minute video with me and just talking about it a little bit and I promise I'll try not to be judgy or provy I'll just listen I don't really think we're talking about parenting I think you're telling me you don't really respect me enough to do the things I'm asking you to do and that'll that'll stick with me like that's the way I'd handle it yeah this is very helpful I'm curious about these ADHD diagnoses SL kids cuz there's a lot of uh you know um loose hand diagnosis this day these days um years ago I was a camp counselor took kids backpacking and I I learned an important concept of um when working with Adolescent and teenage boys which is be a channel not a dam you know when they're super energetic like they're not sitting still where it's not nap time there's just no way um so this notion of getting it out like allowing some place for physical or emotional catharsis that's safe obviously ly um and that kids have a lot of energy I mean damn it the adult population seems to be trying to regress themselves to have that energy so how can we blame them for having so much energy and uh of course there are children who have and adults with clinically diagnosed ADHD that really struggle but you know for the kid that's more energetic U maybe even has a hard time sitting still to the point of discomfort and when the rest of the world that we can't control is telling them like hey like your kid is like needs to be regulated on the subway on the bus in the classroom um you know what are some things that we can do in terms of communication with those kids and probably some of those kids are listening as well um and to just be a channel not a dam to allow their best expression to come forward yeah I mean I love this idea in general like we it's much more effective to tell anyone what they can do rather than telling them what they can't do right across the board with kids because there's usually a can that is possible and then like you can work with the urge instead of I don't even know trying to suppress it or have it not act itself out it's it's like our urges and feelings our forces like they're going to they're going to come out and so yes I think this idea of like me and my kid are on the same team here I think that's so important to start with any kid definitely you know if you have a kid with some intentional you know struggles like we're on the same team you can so easily get into me against you and then you look to shut down anything everything about them but yeah we're on the same team so let's say like it's hard to do homework right now I see you okay like let's let's take an amount of time and it seems like you have a lot of energy like let's do some heavy work or let's run outside and maybe homework always has to start after a period like that maybe they need a break but this idea of yes I'm working with my kid as opposed to against my kid is always going to be more successful do you think the some of the new emerging tools some of which you know I've talked a lot about but many many people have talked a lot about um things like meditation kids doing some long exhale breathing um you know in addition to the you know the way I grew up it was like PE time or recess time you like run around like crazy and um do you think that these tools are helping kids get some self-regulation or is whatever self-regulation they're gaining offset by the fact that um you know there's just so much more input you know we hear so much about the challenges of social media for adults but certainly for kids um you know bullying obviously being one of the more Salient ones but also just the fact that when they go home at night and they're in bed they're potentially still in interactions with their friends we used to have a a phone landline that we'd sometimes call one another on but I wasn't really much of a phone kid uh with my friends so when you're home you were home you were separated from all of that I mean how bad is it and um what are some things that parents and kids might consider yeah to mean meditation things like that like always like icing on the cake like that's always helpful and certainly like teaching kids real tools like those are like literally something I can do I've learned this meditation I have a mantra something like that like huge fan right you have to be able to like touch it in some way but to me I think what what's coming up is you bring up this larger point and it actually goes back to where we started it's like the cost to Children of parents not being able to set boundaries has never been higher and and at the same time it's never been harder for parents to set boundaries right and I think this stuff starts way before social media like to me when I think about the earliest years of a kid's life like you get so much bang for your buck in life from helping kids just learn to tolerate frustration and so much of kids early life right now in the world we live in is all about the immediate escape from frustration and not only escape from frustration but from frustration to gratification in like an instant it's like so fast like how did that just happen like it didn't used to be like that there wasn't even an option like me and you like I don't know you wanted a movie like I don't know maybe your parent could drive you to Blockbuster if you had an account and then like maybe I don't I remember going be like are they going to have it are they going to have it and then you see the thing and there's nothing behind it and you're like they don't have it that whole thing Blockbuster by the way was a video store just kid I'm just totally kidding I'm totally kidding but some people out there like I sometimes do this to myself you know yeah absolutely I used to love going to pick out movies at the at the V VHS store but if you think about that as one tiny thing it's obviously tiny and you think about like I remember that in my childhood and you think about that tiny moment compared to some parallel in a kid the there's no frustration the want and the gratification there's zero space there is zero space and and also I have to say our generation of parents and me too 100% me too our tolerance for frustration has gone way down because of the gratification world we live in which means our tolerance of our kids Tantrums is at a alltime low because we're like hey my life is like pretty easy in a lot of ways this is like a massive inconvenience so kids have more gratification than ever we have lower tolerances for frustration everyone does which means the way we interact with kids over and over and over plus just the natural things they're surr they're exposed to or not like Netflix versus Blockbuster just means like their circuitry around expectations and what feels good it like to me that's what really it scares me it does and like figuring out how to tolerate or even insert like literally insert frustration into your kids's life as early as possible to me is like is is is of critical importance I could not agree more and and I say that with the understanding that I have also shortened the latency in my reward prediction errors which is nerd speak for uh when I want to watch a movie I go into Netflix and they're like it's near infinite and I can get right then um if the internet's a little slow then I start barking about how slow internet is worse than no internet and you know you start observing yourself and you just go oh my goodness like what's going on yeah I mean there the ability to tolerate different weight times between anticipation and reward is so critical and that's what getting a degree is about that's what doing anything challenging is about um I I've gone on record saying that um too much dopamine without effort exerted in order to get that dopamine um is very detrimental well well that to me in all the screen time kind of discussion there's so much screen time and social media and like all the things that screen time do to for kids and again like my kids watch TV and they're young they have iPads like I'm so not a purist I'm a pragmatist and whoever's listening to this no one messed up their kids forever okay so we can just like we were talking about before use this information to make slightly different decisions on the margin that's the best it gets but I think about this when our kids are especially young and they're building this circuitry around like what does it mean to get success like what what are my expectations there how much effort do I have to put in and I think about like a young kid you know playing some mindless just dopamine giving gain the circuit they learn is like mindlessness zero effort dopamine and then I think and I find this really interesting like how many people say like their kid is six now they're having a really hard time learning how to read and they're all these learning assessments and the learning assessments are coming back like no dyslexia right and I know some of you families I say this with love is I say I literally think this is the first time in this kid's life that they kind of have to put like concerted effort without in the moment success and so yeah that like that looks like a lot of things it can it can even present like ADHD right because you know it can present like that it might be but it might also just be that these dopamine circuits have developed in a way that's so that's not conducive with something like learning how to read right and so when parents ask me now like I know reading and academic skills like what can I do when my kids are younger I got them flash cards no flashcards like I mean you can get flashcards that's fine it's not like detrimental but to me it's like well what is my kids's relationship with frustration because I think about this thing called like the learning space right again I'm visual like there's not knowing how to do something and then they're successfully doing something and the space in between is like the learning space that's what learning is and learning the learning space inherently is frustrating that's like the right feeling to be feeling and when kids have learned to collapse those two things then like they don't have a lot of space to learn versus I don't know even like I'm thinking about my kid who wants to like draw a rainbow or sun when they're young and they're like that doesn't look like Gan it would be easy for me to be like let me just do that for you and by the way yes I give myself permission to do that sometimes like sometimes like I can't deal with this I've got other things to do but sometimes I think like long and that long-term greedy like this is going to be the same circuit for learning how to read it is and for learning how to do that project and what if my only goal forget them drawing a son and I've got to tolerate The Whining my only goal was just to lengthen the amount of time they let themselves be in that learning space that's it because I think we know as adults it's not about getting to success that comes when it comes the longer amount of time you let yourself be in that learning space the more successful you can be with hard things because like it just is right you just got to Traverse through and so to me that's like honestly one of the things I'm most passionate about teaching parents is like literally like what do you do during that time then how do I change what my goal is if my goal is to stop my kids tantrum I'm going to collapse it but if my goal is just to lengthen that I might do something very different oh drawing a cir that's not you're right you didn't want to draw that oh drawing a circle is so hard and my kids can you do it for me can you do it like of course sometimes I will but I might say like I'm not going to do it sweetie I'm not you know why because I know you can do this a little more I have faith in you and I think this is so powerful to say to kids this is so frustrating and that's the exact way you should be feeling we don't want our kids to be F you should that's the right feeling I'll even draw that learning space visual this is where you're in the this is where you are you're doing an amazing job and it is actually interesting when kids are young like they actually do adopt that like someone said to me like I've been doing this stuff for a while and my kid literally says to me I like to do hard things mom like they they believe it like that's an amazing self-belief to develop it awesome so yes I think this stuff especially compared to how easy it is to get that gratification it's just it's like more important than ever to have an offset yeah I'm uh doing my best to get the word out into the world that the only reason the brain changes at all is if um there is these neuromodulators like epinephrine adrenaline in the body and brain because that's what signals that the nervous system needs to change if something can be accomplished there's no reason for the nervous system to change by definition there's also I don't want to been off into a a a neuroscience of of resilience and willpower lesson here but there's some amazing literature that um shows that there's this area of the brain the interor mid singulate cortex which is activated when people do things they don't want to do um and it generalizes to other things but this is not the I love to work out so I'm going to work out this is the I hate to work out and I do it anyway and it translates to success in academic Endeavors success in all sorts of environments and so I think um the beauty of it is that this brain structure is highly plastic and can be built up through one thing and that translates to others so doing hard things experiencing uh what I call lyic friction just as as a gateway to learning just understanding that it it always feels hard that that's what learning is in fact I can remember in graduate school even as a young adult my mid-20s I was struggling with an analysis um and my graduate adviser she was wonderful this way and I said she clearly knew how to do it and I said um can you explain how to do this and she goes no I go what I was like just get done and she's like no it's called learning and she just walked out she was also a great parent um to her children um and I also tried to get adopted by her and that failed so you know third time the CH exactly my poor parents like uh they they did their best and uh I'm grateful to them for many things but I think that um including the the encouragement to do hard things do things that suck um that are beneficial for us so it's it's it's a knife edge right now I'm reflecting it's like do things that suck I believe you it sucks and then what what did my mom used to say a lot you know hate me now love me later you know I loved her then and and I love her now but yeah there were moments where I was like I hate that you're making me do this um I don't know about that hate me now love me later old school um but but I think what she was trying to say is I have your best interest in mind yeah definitely that's right definitely yeah no definitely um can I say one thing just cuz it's loud in my head just like one of the things in this like I think it's easy and I'm hearing myself like we hear this and I think it's easy to listen be like oh man I never thought about it that way or I didn't know that or again we just spiral as a parents so fast like I messed up my kid forever like nobody messed up their kid forever it doesn't matter how that is just not true and this is where I think we can spiral into like yeah what's wrong with me and like I kind of ask parents in this situation to like come with me to a different location which is kind of like anger and I have started to feel angry and I think angry anger like tells us what we need so I'm like well what is that anger telling me like it is it is messed up the system is stacked against us that when you become a parent it is literally the hardest most confusing most triggering most important job we have and we are given zero resources right like nobody I know would tell a surgeon who never went to med school and was struggling at surgery that they were a bad surgeon they' be like wow like you probably like you probably deserve to go to med school and residency by the way like that's an important job you have and so I think it's easy to listen to all this and spiral into like oh no but I'd ask you to almost like feel a little like protective helpful anger next to it which is like wow like yes like this is an important job I have this is complicated and maybe there are resources out there that like I deserve and I think that like that's the perspective I would ask parents to listen from earlier you described the job of parenting as boundaries right imparting boundaries as well as empathy and validation I just want to remind people that your B like very basic but very practical uh job description for parenting is something that I think we can return to over and over again it also makes me wonder uh in thinking about the um generalizability of these con Concepts to other forms of relationship what about the relationship to self right it's something we don't often talk about yes um relationship to self we we want to have boundaries and we also want to be able to empathize and validate ourselves yeah and I think right like I don't know my friend didn't invite me I don't know I found out she had five friends for a dinner and I was like oh you know I'm so hurt I would I would say to I I believe myself like I'm allowed to feel that way I think our feelings love when we tell them they makes sense I just think there's something magical about that phrase it makes sense I'm upset I mean my friends were all there and I wasn't that that makes sense and and there's a boundary cuz when my feeling tells me well I'm about to plan a dinner party for 200 people and invite everyone I know but her I feel like there's important like you know what feeling like I'm not going to I'm not going to let you go that far and the image I always think about is like I'm the driver of my car and all the different feelings and urges like they're passengers and we can't get them out of the car you just can't they're in your body but you don't want to let them take over the driver's seat that's really what it is and as long as they're a passenger they actually won't cause you that many problems they'll be annoying and to me that's like hey I see you like I see you and I will often say hi to my feelings for that reason like high anxiety that woke me up at 4 in the morning you know like yes there's a lot of my mind Hi and then there's like a boundary like you're not like you're a part of me and not all of me so I think that phrase for regulating our own feelings you're a part of me and not all of me is the essence of validating and having a boundary what about our need I think healthy need to know whether or not the lesson stuck uh so I've observed this before a kid is catastrophizing about an upcoming event maybe a concert or a test or a homework thing or a social thing and like okay we're using all our best tools to try and help them and I believe you I hear you then and they go through the experience and they do pretty well maybe even great and then we say like did you notice you were so concerned before and you you did it yeah you really did it is there something that we can or should do to try and stamp down that that recognition because one thing that's so beautiful about childhood is the um short-term Horizon nature of childhood which kind of like trying I mean we talk about you know adults trying to take it one day at a time or even half a day at a time and kids are navigating on the basis of like first period class yeah second period class I mean um they're they're they're Horizon is often very close in and I do wonder if they're internalizing these these more Global lessons um on their own or whether or not we should uh try and help them internalize what they just did like do you get it you were super concerned you were like almost dissolving into a puddle of your own tears and I believe you that was the appropriate response then and now you did it like think about that is it good that we reinforce those those um those wins yeah I mean I think that I think our kids do internalize kind of the patterns right but but I hear you there are these moments it's almost like we want to like encapsulate it for them like hey that was a thing right I think kids pick up on whether our interactions were doing something for them or for us so if it's from a like hey that thing I taught you was really helpful right like it would just be like if my husband was like hey your presentation went well because I like told you to do that thing and I'd be like stop talking to me right but if he said to me hey like what was it that to that it's probably like that's helpful to talk out you know I'd be much more open so I love the phrase going back to like just real tools I'm noticing I think actually often we want to praise our kids or tell something just saying I'm noticing because again we want to be seen we don't want to feel controlled I'm noticing does that like hey I'm noticing you were so worried about this test we kind of talked about this way of like talking to your anxiety and and then I'm just noticing you like felt really good about how it went like even that I think cuz that's like the big thing now in our like crazy fast world we live in is just pausing to notice that's already like encapsulating or saying to your kid and and I think like a question is only a question when you don't know the answer right like sometimes we ask qu that they're just they have question marks but it's like a statement or criticism so if we say to our kid um that that thing I taught you was really helpful right do you think that's that what was helpful that's not really a question we already have an answer but if I say hey like I just thought it would be good for us to talk talk through for a second like what was it you think that like LED you to really feel good that day in the test then like if I really don't know what my kid could say I think they'll receive it and then they might say like oh is that thing we talked about like that's so great to know I'm even thinking about Spanish coming up and like I wonder do you think that would I think I wonder is also a great phrase for parents just wondering I wonder if that would be helpful there again they just like lower defensiveness because there's maybe there's like movement with wandering it doesn't feel controlling um so yeah I think I think there is like those are nice moment if it comes from a place of like connection not from control that makes sense um we had a guest on this podcast Lisa Feldman Barrett who's a world expert in emotions and um she explained that um in cultures where there's more nuanced language for different emotions um rather than the what I call the emogif of emotions um there's better emotion tolerance um so understanding that it's not just sad happy depressed uh thrilled but there's a lot of nuance it's very context dependent um can be very useful um do you think there's something to be gained for from letting kids um explore the range of emotions not just you know how do you feel good or bad I mean most adults need to learn that good or bad are valuations that's not actually an emotion like it's not actually an expression of how you feel but that's what we do for shorthand um you know do you think that let's just say in the United States um but elsewhere perhaps as well well that there's some value to like teaching kids to pay attention like like what is going on inside yeah like what is this feeling of what I call anxiety is it excitement and anxiety what like being able to better pinpoint what one is um coping with but also the positive aspects of emotion yes I mean I it's funny I am the clinical psychologist the question how do you feel I always find like very like a lot of pressure I don't know like I think that's I I tend not to ask my kid that but I T also never to have asked like patients that like so you know I think what we're getting at is we want and I think this relates to resilience like resilience is our ability in my mind to tolerate the widest range of emotions as possible because like as humans we're going to feel that whole range so the more of them you've learned to tolerate like the better off you'll be and so that's what I want for my kids I don't know if that has to explicitly come from naming although I think that point is definitely true the more things we can name the more things we can understand to me just showing up for your kid in a way that's like with believing maybe with boundaries um is probably the best way to help your kid tolerate the widest range of emotions because they learn that every emotion like can be held in connection with someone else right versus held in aloneness and is bad um so I guess that's the way I think through it maybe we could talk about adolescence and teenagers specifically um teenage years are wild I would say that the single most traumatic aging event and the most rapid rate of Aging that we ever experience is puberty I mean just fundamentally brain circuits that were for one thing or that were dormant change and come alive in ways that the world forever will look different to us feel different to us and our self-perception changes period it's something that biologists still understand at the level of hor hormes and hypothalamic circuitry but that um has really not been matched to a psychological understanding and vice versa so um like nothing is quite like the music you listen to when you're a teenager it like it brings you back the memories you form positive and negative stamp down boom now and forever the emotional salience can change but those are wild years what are some of the more critical needs of late adolescents and teens that you know are actionable um yeah you know and yeah I mean I'm just mean my teen years were were crazy but um even if they're less crazy they're always crazy yes yes so and one of the reasons I think at least in America that adolescence has seen a such a huge shift like my kid is out of control they're always out they're like always rejecting me I don't think is unrelated to the behavioral control approaches that are inherent in American parenting cuz like you referred to your kid becomes 14 and they kind of realize like wait I'm bigger than one of my parents like I literally don't care about their sticker charts anymore and we might have missed 14 years of building a relationship and so what that kid's adolescence is going to look like is markedly different than if for those past 14 years you weren't giving into everything no but you were leading in a sturdier more connected way so I really think this whole idea that American adolescence like reject everything I actually think not all of it a part of it is completely developmentally normal but a big part of it relates to this tradition of Behavioral control that kids cannot reject until they're at the age that they kind of could survive on their own which is adolescence so I think that's really important the things I would tell parents to really keep in mind that are critical number one is related to that like a teen's job is to separate and to start to form their own identity and I think there's a couple things about that parents need to know number one like I don't think we prepare parents enough for the true sense of loss they feel when their kids are adolescence because that's very real like you've just spent all these years and like you've driven them to every soccer and they kind of talk you in the back seat and maybe you have family movie nights and then all of a sudden they don't want any of that and it's just so important parents to know like I'm I'm going to feel sad I'm going to feel lost and if we don't know to expect it we often kind of Infuse that into a lot of anger toward our kid um and so I just think that's normal and we should talk about that more and parents of adolescent need to be talking about that with each other of course you miss that that's totally normal um number two related to that separation if you think about identity formation right like here's a kid and us and we're kind of close and they now we're at the stage we devel mentally their job at that stage just to figure out who they are they have to overcorrect like you have to kind of overcorrect in the amount of space you take because it's really the only way you can figure out like wait maybe I do want to take parts of that that part's okay and so I think that's like a powerful image to think about like they are moving far away that distance they take from you is not their final point they will move closer now going back to loss not as close as they used to be and that is different but that's not that's this is their way of trying to figure out who they are then the last thing I'd say that kind of relates that image it's like even as they move away I think parents massively underestimate how much they still need us they making efforts to connect and I always think like the difference in like an Explorer and a nomad is whether or not you have a home base and like if our teens feel like Nomads is not a good situation they're explorers they try a million different things but like they they really really do need us they they need to know that they have a home and um I'll never forget my private practice I I used to work with teens not that long ago just the teen sometimes the parents too and this teen came to me and this was extreme she had been um really in a in a in a bad place with her parents like intense intense conflict and um they got in this huge fight and she was really really upset and she was describing this to me she's like and then I was like get out of my room get out I hate you get out you know and I was just like sitting there listening and and then she like she I push him out I slam the door and was a couple minutes later open the door my heart's racing can you believe they weren't there can you believe they weren't there and to me it was just this like and again it's not about being a punching bag but I like under like her seeming anger and her like intense pain we're so close together in her own story that it's just over and over the same thing like they're going to reject you they're going to say get out of my room and yes it sucks but they want you to slip a note under their door after you've taken a couple minutes it says that was really tough or like wow that got out of control you're a good kid and I love you and I wanted to tell parents of teens you're going to do that there's going to be a pause and then you will will hear them rip up the note you will and like I swear to any parent that that still resonated and your kid is again trying to figure out how do I stay close with my parents and I'm figuring out my own who I am so like they rip up the note because like they almost like have to do it to like take in how much they're still desperate for those bids for connection sounds a lot like um the Dynamics of adult relationships although hopefully hopefully with a little bit less um dramatic uh accentuation um but you know even if it does I mean it's like these um these circuits that are laid down in childhood Early Childhood they persist right I mean I think if anything's become clear to me in understanding brain development and brain function it's that you know we don't discard circuitry for attachment and go oh you know that was for Mom and this one was for Dad and that one was for the dog and um and then the Romantic relationship is different we repurpose the circuits hence all the beautiful work on childhood attachment that's now being translated to adult attachment I mean I realize there's Nuance to it but you know I was um reflecting a bit on this again incredibly potent um phrase or mention of explorers versus Nomads of having a home base and thinking about uh these psychology experiments where children are observed in the presence of their caretakers sometimes the strange situation t where people are SE kids are separated from their moms and mom um and child typically mom nowaday it's also been done with other caretakers and dads reunite but one doesn't even have to know about those experiments all you have to do is go to a park or be out in public and see a little toddler venturing away from parent and then what do they do every once in a while they look back they're just trying to check to make sure they're there even the kids that are like taking off on the tricycle like crazy yes will eventually stop and look back it's like this fundamental circuit we're looking back you know and how far they feel they can go is in direct relationship to presumably the number of times that they recharged that they re that they recharge and were able to see that uh that verification that the parent was still there I think this notion of explorers versus Nomads and um being an Explorer obviously being a good thing a healthy thing um within reason um and Nomads just feeling a drift untethered yes you know one of the one of the scariest words at least to me in the um in the English language um so the note under the door yeah um it included the words I love you I I don't want to get too uh detailed here but those words sometimes are never spoken in a home sadly um sometimes are spoken so often and under so many circumstances that one wonders like do they lose their potency yeah um but I noticed that in that note there it finished I love you it's sort of like stating at the end of the day no matter what you say probably even what you do I mean i' I've gone I've been in the presence of parents of kids that were criminals that did horrible things they still love their kids so reminding kids that under any and all circumstances yeah and again and I think what's so critical cuz our brain collapses is that doesn't mean you think their behavior is okay and I get the fear like I would never want to send my kid the message that it's okay to quote do certain things right like that it's okay to just scream at your parents of course it's not okay it's just I think we miss like that happened like that happened already like if I dropped my phone and it broke and I was trying to understand why it broke trying to understand that doesn't mean it's okay that I dropped it like it just it doesn't it just dropped like it happened now what you know and yeah our kids need to know they need to know that they're loved and that again there's kind of like in that message I think like I still see you're a good kid under that moment and I actually think it's a powerful strategy for every parent to kind of conjure up a a good kid image like what is it was that that last time we were playing this game and it was just so fun or is it a memory of my kid when they were three and like I don't know they did this really cute thing and it kind of like really crystallizes that and like even under you know this bad behavior that kid like that kid's still there and the kids the kids who behave the worst are in the deepest pain I mean the adults too and that's not to say it's okay but again we're talking about relationships we want to be in like if you're in a relationship with your teen it's not one you're like this is toxic like this is my kid I'm going to be in a relationship with them so you know remembering that they're in pain teens are in a lot of pain they're exploring a new world frankly right now like teens have world we don't understand it that's so helpful for parents to approach your teen just as a tangible tool and say you know there's so many things in your world that I don't understand and frankly probably I might like criticize or judge like can you take out your phone this you know whatever it is this app you're on this video game like can we just even time box this 5 minutes like I just want to end this conversation saying I understand it better like I promise you that's probably going to do more for your relationship with your kid than anything else because yes they do and they might reject you and if you do again don't take the bait but ask again next week like again they they do they need us to to return yeah one thing's for sure none of us except those that are teens know what it's like to be a teenager in 2024 just like they didn't know what it was like to be a teenager for me in the late 80s early 90s how could they right right so um what what are your thoughts on like family meetings like once a week we sit down we check in you know I hear that people do this may participated in these before um do you feel like those can be use or is it or is it more um window dressing I mean I guess it depends what's happening in there I mean the idea of like hey there's a lot going on in our life and we have a ritual of coming together and talking things through working through problems like if that's what it is that's a beautiful thing like I hear that my first thought is I should do that you know um but you're right like life gets messy so but if it's done in a way where it feels we end and everyone feels a little bit more understood and a little bit more purpose and you know making things move forward in a positive direction that's amazing I think family meetings it's funny the way I think about them often which is just different is it's actually a great strategy especially when your kids are older and um there's like somewhat of an ongoing conflict so maybe there's like an ongoing conflict about how much video game time or you know how much you know they how late they can stay out and to say to a kid and again this just comes from again so important for teens we have to approach our kid like we're on the same team I always say me and my kid against a problem not me against my kid where they are the problem like and so to say hey you've been late you know or we have to figure out your curfew and like look you're a smart kid you're a good kid my number one job is to keep you safe but you're old now and if I just tell you a time it's same thing that happened last year we're getting fights all year why don't we sit down and we we'll do what I do in my office there's two people they each have ideas I'm going to bring a pad of paper and that's actually super important and I'm going to write down all of your ideas and my ideas and then we're just going to kind of go through and cross out the ones that you know feel completely unreasonable and I have a feeling when when we do that we're going to come to a good place so again you can see there's that like hope I'm giving like I hold the positive outcome same team I'm giving my kid Credit in advance this actually like really Su It's usually the opposite of what teens feel which is just my parents don't even listen to me or care and think they have all the answers I've heard this notion of you know um couple parents come first and kids come second and some people are probably like what you know well clearly never parented ah well no actually um it's an interesting idea perhaps not correct or incorrect but maybe Dynamic across time where the real question is if kids know that they are running the family in terms of what they do or their inability to not be attended to Etc um is driving the whole relationship that the parents are in yeah versus you know recognizing and here I'm I'm matching two parent home but we could talk about divorced or people with significant others or single parent homes um been in all of those um you got of Wonder like are kids really paying attention to how much they are being prioritized to the point where if they observe their parents tending to their own needs that they feel deprivation or is it make them feel safer like hey Mom Andor dad are taking care of themselves and can show up better yes I think that is critically important and it kind of goes again to boundaries like of a parent like my relationship with my kid is so important and I'm not going to let that take over me like that is not all of me I am not only a caregiver to my to my kid like I would stand by that all day long like is that an important part of me and it's still a part of me and I think this is really important to own as a parent because again we tend to get a like we get apologist for it or we look for our kids permission we'll say look I need to go out with Dad without you okay like we have a relationship too like and we again there's that job confusion and my kid feels that and again it's that kind of giving them too much power I've said this to my kids a lot so say why do you go out with Dad without me I say it's a great question you know first of all dad and I were married before we had kids our relationship is really important to us and we love being with you and being with you is different than just being the two of us and that really really matters to us and so you don't have to be happy about it you can you and let's say I have a babysitter I know safe with you can cry when I leave and the babysitter will hold you and we're going to go out to dinner and we're going to come back and you know we'll see you in the morning yeah I think that is so important I actually think this is another topic like this topic of like rage and Parenthood is like a big topic like the way why like why do I get to these moments of Rage so often that my screaming it's not just screaming at my kids it's really rageful and I think the parents often who are the most vulnerable to that are the ones where where they're not make they're not meeting like any of their non-caregiving needs which makes sense that a part of them is like screaming out like what about me I used to go to dance class I used to see friends I used to go out with my partner and talk about things other than you know our kids and so again if I think a kids need a sturdy leader right more than anything else and sturdiness is not allowing yourself to be taken over by any one thing including your relationship with your kid is it truly better for their to be two sturdy leaders and one sturdy leader I realize this is a controversial question yeah I mean I know and I know there's research to back this up that like having one kind of sturdy leader in your life is massively protective I really believe that and so when parents say my partner isn't I'm like we we have research this is true is two better than one I don't know the research like probably I don't know you know but what I think is important in there too is what's not great for kids is having like all the caregivers be some like perfectly attuned caregiver right like that actually does not set up your kid for life at all right because I don't know anyone who thinks the partner I'm going to be with one day is going to be perfectly attuned to all my needs let me go find that person so you know you have one sturdy leader you have two but like being sturdy part of that is you're going to you're going to rupture you're going to rupture you're going to messed up you're going to hopefully repair you know after um but sturdiness I just want to make clear is so not the same as like Perfection Perfection is creepy it's not a thing no one needs that I love that um it's so first time I've laughed out loud on this podcast about a statement like that um yeah the notion of perfection is is kind of creepy um but sturdiness is anything but creepy that's there's it's just such a beautiful word for all the right reasons um what about behavioral examples in parents so for instance if children observe parents um being affectionate to one another in appropriate ways right you know um you know attending to one another in in boundar but empathically attuned ways um do you think that projects forward into their notion of of what adult relationships are like and should be like conversely if parents are yelling at one another um do you think that projects forward into it's okay to yell in adult relationships yeah I mean I yeah I think kids are they're expert noticers they notice everything right as part of how they've learned to survive as such helpless you know humans so they definitely notice they definitely act like sponges um so yes if you're you know kind of privileged enough in that way to grow up in a home or you have parents who in general are fairly affectionate they take responsibility for their stuff they communicate in a healthy way I think that is like a true privilege you go into adulthood with yes the Other Extreme right you grow up with parents who you know they yell or they can even yell in scary voices again what I think is really important is the witnessing of that isn't going to be as impactful to a kid as the witnessing of it and nobody naming it and talking to them about it so this is why so often like kids will be in difficult stages intense Tantrums major issues at school and someone's like what do I do like what do I do with this well like I give you all the strategies in the world but if that is just your kids way of kind of manifesting all of their struggles with this like huge marital conflict that's happening it's not going to work so it's all part of the same system and so saying to your kid after you fight with your partner hey I think you heard Daddy and I screaming and I'm sure that felt scary because it does feel scary because they know you're their base so if their base is of a house is like you know Feels Like An Earthquake it feels scary like and you know another line I like it's like you were right to notice that we were using loud voices again I think that's massively confidence you know building um maybe what was that like for you or if you have a little kid just that's enough you know and they might look at you and say like can I have my snack now but it's still really sunk in so if there is a lot of conflict again I think it's really important we we talk about that with our kids don't leave them alone what about teens that are really Wayward um and this could be behavioral Outburst there's also the whole underside of this thing where it's also about withdrawal like the kids are withdrawn I mean we were talking about outburst and yelling there's also the example in parents or the instances in kids that they're just like really withdrawn yes that they're just like disengaged depressed depressed um maybe even dissociative who knows um but not good Y and this can show up on one end as violence on the other end is isolation it can show up as eating disorders it can show up as all sorts of things um you know intervention before age 18 is quote unquote easier in the sense that one has legal control but often times it's hard for parents to know like how bad is this yeah and you know I did an entire episode about cannabis and I spoke to some of the medical benefits of cannabis for adults who are non- addicts but I also talked a lot about some of the risks but let's take an example that I think is pretty common like kids 15 16 start smoking some THC with their friends and you go okay well everyone does that quote unquote not as bad as alcohol which I think is a lame argument this is lame doesn't make any sense again you're getting hit by a you know car isn't bad getting hit by a train but okay um but the point is you know most all parents like okay you know clearly they're self-medicating you know can't they think they can't stop them but you can stop them you know at what point do you then take you know you put them into a residential treatment program if you could even afford that I mean it's really tough for people to know how much to intervene in what is clearly not good behavior and it sometimes can be bad behavior and yet the kids are using it to self-medicate and there's a peer system that sometimes reinforces that yes I mean this is a huge landscape yeah maybe we have you back to talk just about this but but um maybe we can um prage that discussion but by like what do you tell people in your in your practice like get in there now pull the emergency cord and get this handled or do you say listen you just got to work with the you know work with this Sy tough problem I'm throwing at you here but I think the first thing is like how do I as a parent like kind of even assess is like this like is this normal is it not normal is it a problem is it not so I think there's a couple like things we could think about there number one just seeing like impact on overall functioning is always like a one barometer right so okay can my child perform the kind of tasks of their developmental stage okay so this is not the only thing but like are they still going to school wow I noticed since they smoking they're smoking a lot weeds their grades went from B's to D's like okay they don't care about school anymore they used to actually go out with friends now unless they're with this one crew where they smoke in the park like they're not even seeing these kids they used to be friends with they don't want to go to family functions anymore they used to play soccer like if I'm answering this i' be like wow I'm not really talking just about a marijuana problem I'm talking about my kid not engaging in kind of like the developmental tasks that I would say is just like it's time to seek additional support right another sign is just kind of how how limited their world has become be because of this right so again is this kind of taken over everything they do my kid is depressed let's say or you know and all of a sudden their world has gotten really really small and it's not just that that's the way they've always lived like there's a big there's a big change the amount of conflict in the home again like is there conflict when you have teens of course there is but like wow like is it really hard to talk to my teen for more than four minutes walking on eggshells to me is also a sign that we need additional help am I scared to intervene in a way that would actually be in line with my values that's not a good sign right then the other thing I just want to make sure everyone knows is to me like seeking additional help is a sign of every single thing that's right with a family and I think we think it's a sign of something that's wrong and it's like also a sign of what's right to your in terms of messaging that to your kid again I think about a kid who I used to saw see my practice she was probably 16 when she came to me she was cutting serious a lot right and I remember saying just intake hey how long have you been doing this she just two years oh like did you see another therapist before you saw me she's like no she was like very like kind of you know kind of quippy and quick and I was just like why and she's like well I told my parents that if they took me to a therapist I would go and I would just waste all their money I'd be quiet and then when they left me there I would just leave and who's going to stop a 14-year-old from walking away and they might as well save their money because they can't make me okay and again I just kind of sense to stay quiet and she seriously one of the next things she said is can you believe they let me make that decision literally said that wow validates everything you said up until now and it is this is why this is where like I feel like I get my best ideas like that's right like a 14-year-old can convince her parent that she won't go to therapy when she's cutting like that that is not okay and again then we go to okay so I'm going to say to my kid you are going I'm like no there's so much between that we're in these binary States your kid's feelings about therapy cannot dictate your boundary right but we can't just then come down harshly and so I coach parents in this all the time what do you say to a kid I love you hear me like I love you we're in a tough stage I see this problem and I do think even when our kids get older we can say this my number one job is to keep you safe it is not to keep you happy with me and I actually love you so much that I'm willing to do things that make you unhappy with meh that is actually how much I care about you and so I am going to be driving you and if you want to like curse at me the whole time I will sit in that waiting room and you know what I'm going to do the next week I'm going to tell you I love you I'm going to do the same thing and I think adults hearing that on some level there's some internal truth like I probably needed that like that feels oddly good because there's like you know I'm not messing around but there's this way where as parents we've said like the way to show my kid I'm not messing around is to be mean to them like there was nothing mean about what I said I think it was more loving than saying to a kid okay let me know when you want to go that is not loving and so I think like our teens sometimes in those moments they need us to do our job and like be the pilot like they it is the small amount of time where they're still a passenger when they're 18 they are the pilot and so we have this window there's nothing I want to probe more into that I think you you captured it beautifully and uh it gets back to this issue of safety like in letting them make their own decision when they're clearly in trouble like if anything could make a kid feel unsafe a teen or or younger or adult it's that yes yes it's like laying the passenger on the plane be like hey instead of uh rerouting how about you just come up here and fly that's that's exactly that's literally what it is and they're like I can't believe you believed my little protest now I'm in the like this they don't they don't want that that's why their words teens's words it's not that we don't believe them like as you see I'm big on believing their words often are a representation of their fears all of us in our worst moments get out like I feel like sometimes like that's their fear or like they're kind of talking to their emotion they're so like they're not really talking to you in that moment they're so disregulated and like just learning to like not take it so literally and be like what am I really believing my kid is in pain they're cutting my kid isn't paying their smoking weed 30 times a day and don't go to class like I'm the like I know that they that they need help and again any parent who can say that like to me is like the strongest parent and that is such a sign of Health I don't think I'd still uh be alive today if it wasn't for um non-parent mentors and just examples in the world these aren't always people that were like hey I'm going to take you under my wing and be your Mentor actually that was rarely the case but it people in my real life or in my um you know reading or you know there wasn't YouTube back then but um sometimes now you know people I've I'm a huge fan for instance of that these a yian psychologist James Hollis who has these beautiful lectures on um making a life um and I'm learning so much like I consider him a mentor sorry James you didn't have a choice you're you're a mentor but these people that we can internalize certain healthy aspects that our parents just just apparently can't seem to arrange for themselves yeah and that we wish they had but I think that we um as children of all ages um like we want perfect parents we don't get them um but it seems appropriate to me I love your thoughts it seems appropriate to me to have you know kind of a a foraging for examples of where we can get certain things that we can internalize for ourselves so that we can benefit that maybe our parents just aren't interested in capable of or even alive to provide us anymore yeah yeah I mean that like being everything to someone like I don't want my kids to ever say that about me my mom was everything she fulfilled my every need again I I do find that creepy whenever I don't know and like and just setting them up for so much relationship disappointment um my mom gave some things and you know we now that I also work a lot it's funny with my kids like there is this mom like when kids have a sleep over at her house I mean it is the best sleepover experience like I see pictures I'm like wow that was so thoughtful that was amazing she's like she puts together she's creative like and me and my kids joke like they're like yeah Mom you you're like bottom of the list and that stuff and I am I am and like I know I'm toward the top of the list and other things I don't I don't want to be toward first of all I don't want to hold myself to that standard that's like a great way to implode so yeah being able to say to my kid oh you guys want to have a sleepover you'd rather go to her house cuz that's okay like that's not an indictment me and so maybe this is some quote Mentor like figure for someone who can like put these details and make people feel really taken care of in that way that's great and I think yes giving your kid permission and encouragement again I think is such a gift to them later on like yeah our relationship with our kids becomes not only the foundation their expectations for their relationship with other adults me I also think is literally what they're attracted to I think when they're attracted to someone later on it's just the activation of that like earliest attachment and so if they can get activated around someone who seems to be pretty attuned and respectful and validating and boundar because they also have other things in their life and not everything like that's a privilege to say that's what I'm expecting so I think those other relationships and as a parent to hear your kid say my coach taught me this thing and sometimes they they say it in a caddy way so much better than what you said to do at lacrosse just to like take a deep breath and again this is where you can say like like I'm still a good parent even outside this moment like that's I'm so glad you're talking to me about this I believe you tell me more about this like such a beautiful example for your kid so being able to uh validate and embrace the fact that there are other sources of healthy upbringing um is you know not just perhaps is is clearly a good thing do I have that right I think that's right and I think if that's hard for a parent what I'd say is like it's a question without an exact answer but like where where did I learn that I'm supposed to be everything to someone like and is that and I think a lot of women we learn that in our families of origin to be good girls which really just means I have no wants and needs of my own and I just kind of gaze out and see how I can do things for you and I can be everything for you and then we have kids we don't realize we put that on to them but like you said those patterns travel with us and I find it like very relieving to be like maybe what if I don't W just gave me like a good percentage of energy back like I can I can do like so many other things now you know it's very it's like empowering I love it something that it's an unpleasant topic just by as soon as people hear the word but it's something that I think comes up on the child side the teen side and the parenting side and in adult relationships of all kind which is the dreaded entitlement oh dirty word parenting entitlement um maybe we could put some definition on entitlement and talk about um when it's bad is it always bad uh when it's neutral and when it's um I don't know is it ever good I entitlement doesn't sound like it's ever good but yeah I Health there is a healthy entitlement right and I think that is kind of the entitlement to like I'm allowed to want things and I'm allowed to at moments of my life even act on that to turn that want into a fulfillment of my want I think that actually goes back to what we were just saying like versus how can I please you like maybe I want to do something so I think that healthy entitlement that's a good thing but when I think when I hear parents say like please I just don't want an entitled kid they're not talking about that right and they're talking about and to me the story from my practice is just the key thing that makes us parents cringe was this family of seeing in New York City and they they were they were very wealthy and they had the 16-year-old son and they were flying I think back from Hawaii or to Hawaii they were just getting ready to board and first class was boarding and the sun goes up and they're like oh we were not like in first class we have to wait he had a basically a full tantrum in the airport like every parents worst nightmare literally and they came to me afterwards being like how did we like how did we get here right now this is a family in general it's true they they flew first class they had private planes had a lot of you know money but entitlement to me doesn't always have to be about money I'm going to give you my definition of entitlement I think it's very different but to me the definition like boundaries is useful because it gives you a pathway of what to do I think entitlement is the fear of frustration beautiful because if we go back okay that thing didn't start at 16 and if we we started you know I started kind of collecting stories and right this is a kid who they had and again like they had a driver there's nothing wrong with having a driver but I'm just thinking about like waiting for a Subway it's frustrating you just missed the subway we're going to be late like no right this was a kid who didn't make inci get older remember like didn't make the soccer team don't worry we have someone who's going to take you to the nearby Town New Jersey and get on that soccer team right um and I think about what this kid started to learn about being frustrated and it was kind of like frustration comes up and what gets layered next to it is someone else bringing you an exit frustration exit from frustration maybe even exit to success right and then I started to think like what would it be like if there was 16 years of kind of getting because it does Happ of that pattern and that circuit reinforcing because what you're really learning as a kid I'm frustrated and that's very overwhelming for me but like the adults around me must be scared of my frustration because they won't let me sit in it they won't let me feel it they will actually kind of run in circles to to not have me feel so I actually encode my frustration next to fear now I'm 16 and I'm expecting first class and I get you know lowly coach you know it's not people are like oh what a spoiled kid like I actually I I feel like this kid was like insanely vulnerable in that moment this kid was like I'm frustrated and what I expect to happen and what I know to happen isn't here and so it is explosive it appears as entitlement on the surface but is a deep intolerance and almost fear of frustration which is in your body so you're terrified of a feeling that is living in your body and it looks demanding because it kind of is desperate like you can't let this happen wow fear of frustration as the definition of entitlement uh lands like Square in the bullseye for me um and yes I think we all default to the kind of stereotypical example of the the ultra wealthy family kid uh there was that movie the toy in the 80s it's really Dreadful concept actually you know a kid that was just given everything and then wanted a person I it's really like talk about foul I mean it's just you know just bad at every level and then they tried to you know create this narrative where then you know there's a deeper understanding about humans and stuff that evolves from it but but the starting point point was you know and I I've observed this in certainly not my family but other families where kids are given everything they want it never feels like enough big surprise dopamine is a real thing the circuits recalibrate to a higher threshold they want more and more and more it's like that movie Wall Street what's your number more okay all right um nothing wrong with wanting things um but with without a sealing on any of that and without a a sealing on on Pleasure bounds on experience it crushes everybody that's also what that movie was about it just crushes people yeah so to build that into a child's neurology just seems like the worst possible thing um because it's not about the world being a place of immense possibility it's about the world being a place of of like snakes and broken glass everywhere except this narrow knife edge path that you follow that is all about in inite resources and ease that's right and I when I think it's fear is because if you're in fear you're in like a threat state which is why it when kids are in that state or adults it seems like nasty like and it's mean when you're you know and there's this like narrowing of your eyes right so I think that's really you know what's happening and it's not it's not always tied to money but the truth is and like money can easily buy a kid's way out of frustration and by the way it buys the parent out of having to tolerate their frustration while the kid is frustrated and so It's Tricky I think I've I've now like you know talked to a bunch of parents who grew up in um a very different way we very successful and I get it they're like I feel like I've I've earn i' literally have earned the right to have certain parts of my life be a lot easier right and like how do I though not how do I raise a kid who isn't entitled right and it is a conundrum right like I would think like you know we raise our raise our kids in a candy store it's hard to expect them to appreciate candy right and so like how do we how do we balance that gratitude the entitlement and I do think though that idea is like we just have to and sometimes like other people hearing this would be like yeah like my life is frustrating all the time and some peoples are right they won't end up with entitlement but for other families they almost have to be like I I have to like dose it I have to make sure my kids literally have experiences and I probably have to go through it too where we are almost like purposefully making sure they get enough of that you know so they can build different circuits yeah so much done P there I I think um it's clear that some of this is tied to financial means um I think it's a it's a pretty scary thing when someone looks out on the landcape of the world as infinite possibility um without any frustration um as we talked about earlier the ability to lean into hard things as as a skill that can extend to other things is is so valuable do you think that some of the smaller practices that any kid any parent any family regardless of means can lean into can really help there like like like um you know some people say grace or a prayer before a meal others simply Express gratitude but you know stopping and thinking about you know I mean being breathing bring being ambulatory being any number of of good things that allow us AG in life um about to eat food I mean those those moments I I think I think are I know that our our nervous system reflects on those yeah how could they not and just recognizing that at least something went into the creation of the the meal I think for like the entitlement stff and the frustration like there's all these small moments that we can start to make a difference and I think it's saying to yourself just cuz I can doesn't mean I will so like my kid's young and I picked them up from a play date and and I let's say I have a babysitter at home or my husband at home and I'm like I have to go to a store and some errands my K like can you drop me off first maybe I'm like you know what like no like you're going to come with me on I'm not going to say it this way but on boring errands because you just have to tolerate that like sometimes you have to do things you don't want to do and like you're not going to learn that by me telling you that you're going to learn that by experiencing that you know something with my kids you know the other day we were at an airport and like there were you know in the airport like it kind of winds around like to get and there was like no one there so they started to like duck under all the like things and it just made me think like as a small Moment Like entitlement also was like the rules don't apply to me in some ways I was like and I just remember you guys when we're in airports oh the the the lines leading up to security you cond you like mess them up and it wasn't like forever but I was like you guys like these things someone put these here for a reason and we're just going to it's like like I these things have to be such it's a small amount of frustration but she just like I don't always get to duck the line sometimes I have to like walk a little longer or I remember my kid saying and I'm not immune to this like I am in a financial position where I have someone come sometimes help me be my housekeeper right and she'll fold the laundry and I remember on a Sunday my son said to me when he was younger like why do we have to fold the laundry kind of like I don't think he said it but he was kind of like don't we have someone you know who could do that and I remember being like this is a moment where I could be like we're going to fold the laundry on Sundays you know who loves folding laundry maybe some people like I don't I don't love undoing the dishwasher it is inherently not that enjoyable but like and it's all frustrating it's just like not great and like I know I need to make my kids do that like they just have to go through that mundane thing um and so I think there's all of these moments taking your kid with you on errands you know doing the laundry right before you say to your kid let's go to try out on another soccer team just like oh you didn't make team maybe maybe Let It Go two days that's at least two more days of feeling upset and frustrated right they don't have to be these big Grand things but all of those little moments can add up in a really positive way what's your stance on household chores and should kids be paid for household chores um yes I have a whole guide to chores and allowance and I actually you know I think there's a lot of thought like should they be separate I don't know I think it could be done either way but to me the question for a parent is like what is the point for me like what is my goal for chores what is my goal for allowance right and I think that has to then structure how we do it so my guesses for chores part of it is I want my kid to number one maybe like help around the house want them to have that purpose also like I know for me for chores like sometimes your life involves doing boring things that is just true and like I want my kids to know that which means they have to experience it that's one of the reasons we do chores so for me if that's one of the reasons I'm not going to pay my kid because for me in my family what I think my kids need to get out of it it's just like knowing that sometimes you do boring things as part of being a good human for someone else that might be totally different so I think we just ask ourselves as parents like what am I trying to accomplish and then let me structure it around that across the course of today's discussion I I've been feeling both immense gratitude uh and relief for certain uh quote unquote hardships that I experienced um and things that my parents Made Me Do or ways that they were negligent and I was forced to figure things out also um you know some things so I was like oh like wish they had done this I think everyone listening to this will feel that way um and if you're lucky enough to still be in the parenting Child R or being a child process then uh there's still time so I guess there's always still time um in my introduction of this episode I I touched on a few of these but um tell us what you're doing these days to help parents and kids yeah um indirectly or directly to be more effective in their relationships and um and you know I know you you've written about this in books and you have a a wonderful social media account on Instagram and elsewhere I follow it um and it's there's oh so much learning there but um you know how are you translating this knowledge into um actionable programs yeah that is my like that is what gets me out of bed every morning is translating I always say deep thoughts actionable practical can do with today strategies yes that's that's the only way I can work I'm like tell me what to do to put that idea into action love it so you know a couple years ago one of the things that really struck me was just like I really did feel angry like this is so messed up we parents have the hardest job and it's the one that impacts the world the most and I don't think any of us think the world is in like a great place right now right n it's not right and this is and I remember someone coming up to me and saying parenting is also the only job you care about on your death bet and I think that's probably true if you have kids so like for every reason this should be the place that they're like that we invest the most or that the system is like set up to help us right and most people I know they don't want to parent the exact same way as they were parented maybe take parts and that is the way we'll parent it's just kind of the language we use and learning a new language we know is totally possible Right dual lingo has showed us that you can learn a new language it's hard sometimes you revert to your language of origin especially in stressful moments same thing parenting and then you go back and so I remember saying to some people around me like I want to create that like kind of dualingo for parents it is learning a new language and we should have a product where we have resources in one place we should be able to connect to other parents around the globe who are kind of doing this with us we should have access to experts we trust not because they always know better but they might just help us have a different mindset and some ideas to help us again and me my mind is just act more in line with your own values that's what it's about and so that's what we created and that's what I'm working on and that's our good inside membership and so excited about all the ways you know that's already impacting tens and tens of thousands of parents and that's where the resources are it's bite-sized it's actionable we're really known for our scripts it's like what do I say to my kid when like literally I like we have a script for that um and I think in a small way people like say like I come for the scripts and then I stay for the revolution like this is actually a journey of my own sturdiness and honestly becoming a sturdier more confident leader is the only way we can raise sturdy more confident kids well I've said this again and again throughout today's discussion but I love it I love uh the Gathering of it of information the organizing it and dispersing it in actionable ways and you've done all of that and you're continuing to do that and you also have the clinical background and you're a parent so you're speaking from professional and immediate experience and um you put oh so much work into it it I can tell that by this the directness and simplicity of the actionables that you've taught us today and also how much resides underneath those direct simple actionables um just beautiful I I've had many conversations on this podcast with many um brilliant people uh including yourself but this is um among the ones that I really say has has really me thinking and I don't think I've ever said wow so many times during a discussion and um there's just so muchled to be GED from from today's discussion thanks to you and just onf of myself and everyone listening um parents and kids and those who want to be parents and um and those who don't um and who have made the choice not to and are certainly engaged in other forms of relationship this is just absolute gold that you've provided us so thank you ever so much um your generosity your Clarity of

Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. Mark D'Esposito, M.D., a neurologist and professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. We discuss the brain mechanisms underlying cognition and the forms of memory required for focus, productivity, planning and achieving goals, and learning. We discuss neurochemicals such as dopamine and acetylcholine and how they can be leveraged to improve cognitive functioning. We also discuss concussion, traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease, and ways to restore or slow cognitive decline by using pharmacologic, lifestyle and behavioral protocols. This episode provides a modern understanding of cognition and memory and actionable tools to optimize brain health and function.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr and Professor Mark despasito Dr Mark despasito is a neurologist and a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California Berkeley he is a world expert in the brain mechanisms controlling executive function and memory executive function is the way in which we are able to designate and carry out specific cognitive strategies and it is fundamental to every aspect of our daily lives and because so much of being effective in daily life involves using specific context relevant batches of information in order to understand what to do and when and what not to do and when and to come up with strategies that are very adaptive for us to move forward in the context of relationships work school and Athletics and on and on there's really no separation between executive function and memory and today Dr desposito explains the neural circuits controlling executive function and memory how they interact the key role of dopamine in executive function and something called working memory and teaches us ways to optimize executive function and memory that is how to optimize cognitive function in addition to discussing how to optimize cognitive function in the healthy brain today's discussion also centers around how to restore cognitive function in disease or injury conditions that deplete executive function in memory such as traumatic brain injury concussion Alzheimer's Parkinson's and attention deficit disorders Dr desposito shares with us research findings both about behavioral and pharmacologic strategies to enhance executive function and memory by the end of today's discussion you will have learned from Dr despasito a tremendous amount about the modern understanding of cognition that is thinking and memory and the carrying out of specific cognitive strategies you will also learn a tremendous amount about how to optimize brain function and brain health before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Maui Nei venison Maui Nei venison is the most nutrient-dense and delicious red meat available I've spoken before on this podcast and there's General consensus that most people should strive to consume approximately one gram of protein per pound of body weight now when one strives to do that it's important to maximize the quality of that protein intake to the calorie ratio because you don't want to consume an excess of calories when trying to get that one gram of protein per pound of body weight Maui Nei venison has an extremely high quality protein to calorie ratio so it makes getting that 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight extremely easy it's also delicious personally I like the ground venison I also like the venison steaks and then for convenience when I'm on the road I like the jerky the jerky is a very high protein to calorie ratio so it has as much as 10 grams of protein per jerky stick and it has something like only like 55 calories so again making it very easy to get enough protein without consuming excess calories if you would like to try Maui Nei venison you can go to mauii venison docomond to get 20% off your first order again that's Maui venison docomo to get 20% off today's episode is also brought To Us by ju juv makes medical grade red light therapy devices now if there's one thing I've consistently emphasized on this podcast is the incredible role that light can have on our biology and of course I'm always telling people that they should get sunlight in their eyes as soon as possible after waking on as many days of their life as possible for sake of setting circadian rhythm daytime mood focus and alertness and improved sleep now in addition to sunlight red light and nearin red light has been shown to have positive effects on improving numerous aspects of Cellar and organ Health including faster Muscle Recovery improved skin health and wound healing even improvements in acne or that is removal of acne reducing pain and inflammation improving mitochondrial function and even improving Vision itself what sets you apart and why it's my preferred red light therapy device is that it has clinically proven wavelengths meaning it uses specific wavelengths of red light and near infrared light in combination that trigger the optimal seller adaptations personally I use the handheld ju every day the handheld ju is about the size of a thick piece of toast and I also own a ju panel that allows for full body exposure and I use that one approximately five times per week for about 10 to 15 minutes per session if you would like to try ju you can go to j.com huberman to receive $50 off your first purchase again that's ju spell jv.com huberman to get $50 off your first purchase today's episode is also brought To Us by eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity I've spoken many times before in this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance now a key component of getting a great night's sleep is that in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3° and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3° one of the best ways to make sure that those temperature changes occur at the appropriate times at the beginning and throughout and at the end of your night when you wake up is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's what eight sleep allows you to do it allows you to program the temperature of your mattress and sleeping environment such that you fall and stay deeply asleep easily and wake up each morning feeling incredibly refreshed and energized I've been sleeping on an eights Sleep mattress cover for almost 3 years now and it has dramatically improved the quality of my sleep if you'd like to try eight sleep you can go to 8sleep.com huberman to get $150 off their pod three mattress cover eight sleep currently ships in the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com huberman and now for my discussion with Dr Mark desposito Dr desposito welcome hi Andrew thank you so much for inviting me I'm really looking forward to our ation yeah you may not remember me but I remember you when I was a first year graduate student and uh you showed up at Berkeley one of the first people to really bring functional Imaging of the human brain to Berkeley bring a neurology and a clinical um emphasis to the Neuroscience studies there and it's really just um blossomed and it's been a real thrill for me to see all the Magnificent work out of your laboratory over the years and I know you also still see patients so the topics that are of interest to you I know are of great interest to our audience maybe we'll just start off with a few of the basics and um do a little functional neuro Anatomy lesson for folks not to scare anyone don't worry this will be accessible to everyone and just talk about the frontal loes and prefrontal cortex and a little bit of what those structures do because many times on this podcast I've said okay the neural real estate right behind your forehead is involved in context and planning Etc but you're the real expert here um how should we think about what the frontal lobes do and and their various roles in health and disease yeah so there's four loes there's a frontal loes parietal temporal occipital and the frontal loes probably take up more do take up more territory than the other Lo probably about a third of of the uh cortex and within the frontal loes uh I I don't I'm going to use sort of frontal loes probably in our conversation a lot but what I really mean is the prefrontal cortex So within the frontal loes there's also Mo areas that important for motor function as well um but when we're talking about the frontal loes and talking about it's you know involvement higher level cognitiv abilties real talking about the prefrontal cortex and this is what's considered sort of the highest level of Cortex in the brain and so yeah when you think when you think about it people assign it all sorts of functions almost every function you think of people have sort of put into the frontal lows but I think what we've all kind of uh moved towards is this idea of executive function this abil this ability to to plan to organize uh to really transfer our thoughts you know into an action and really to be guided by goals and and intentions and not be kind of take you know kind of ruled by sort of just automatic behaviors a word we use in cob ner science is called cognitive control so C control executive function is what we attribute to the frontal L and so you can think of it as you know the CEO of the brain or the uh you know or the conductor of the orchestra really the part of the brain that's that's really controlling the the the rest of the brain so yeah if you had to choose which part you wanted to not leave home it's your front it's your frontal loes speaking of which um what are some of the uh symptoms of mild frontal lobe damage um and severe frontal lobe damage a damage brought about either through uh neurod degenerative disease or physical injury I know we're going to talk a bit about both today or a lot about both um but how would lack of executive function uh show up um um maybe on in kind of a subtle level yeah I mean at first I should say is that it it shows up all the time because when when uh and and frontal lobe behavior is probably much more prevalent than than we realize certainly we think about it when you have a brain injury to the frontal Lopes and there's lots of neurological disorders like stroke and traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's disease that can affect the frontal lobe and there's a number of you know psychiatric disorders obsessive compulsive disorder and schizophrenia and depression that are thought to be frontal L dysfunction but when you're sleep deprived and when you're stressed and just normal aging the frontal loobe seems to be the first system that's affected because it really is involved in the highest level so when we're having a bad day when we're having difficulty sort of setting priorities when we're having difficulties achieving the goal that we've set out when we get distract you know when we get distracted um you know when we're not able to sort of adapt and be flexible these are all the type of things that are reflect that our frontal loes are not functioning optimally approximately what age does the frontal lobe circuitry uh come online so to speak I mean when I see a baby uh babies can Orient their eyes towards things but they're rather reflexive in in where they'll Place their eyes but um by time kids are three or four they can certainly you know play with blocks or interact with other children or their parents but it seems that you know full functionality the frontal loaves is it's really gradual at least that's my non-clinically trained assessment you know yeah I mean it's a really tough question to know when they're fully develop because these studies haven't been done when MRI was introduced and we were able to sort of image the brain in a non-invasive way uh then studies did start to come out trying to sort of map out at what age say your frontal LS fully develop and it seemed like it was early into your your 20s um you know I always say that it's not surprising that you can't rent a car until you're 25 that the insurance companies knew before n scientists did as to when your frontal lows have you know when your decision-making skills at their highest and so that's probably about right into your 20s um is probably before your frontal loes are fully developed and it's really interesting question is why why do it takes so long it's the area of the brain that takes the longest to develop and why is that and I think there's a reason I think that this sort of slow development frontales allows us to to explore allows us to to think about novel ways of solving problems allows us to take in the world if they were shut off earlier uh it it would lead to maybe a much more sort of rigid kind of you know less flexible kind of uh behavior that that we'd seen things so I so I think that that it helps to be uh it take a long time to develop but also it obviously leads to some problems sometimes in adolescence as as as we see sometimes can one see a lack of frontal L maturity in just the sheer number of physical movements that a child makes um so for instance in a classroom of uh you know let's say um you know fourth graders um oftentimes there'll be a range of uh a parent ability of kids to sit still or to listen um do we think that the kid that's having a hard time focusing and listening to instructions or steadying their body when they're told to sit still um I don't know if they still tell kids to sit but they were telling me to sit still when I was a kid um is that um somehow reflective of a you know slightly lagging frontal frontal L function um and maturity whereas that you know the the kids that can sit you know still and stoic and focus does that mean that they're a little bit more accelerated along that trajectory yeah it's hard to say I mean the frontal lobe is B is a big territory and we can get into it but there's you know the frontal L probably has 25 different sub regions within it and and so grossly we think about the frontal loes as the lateral portion of the frontal loes which is involved in these executive function probably supports these exective function abilities but then we've got another part of the frontal loes called the orbital frontal cortex which is probably involved more in Social and emotional Behavior so you know when we think again when we think about frontal L behaviors uh they kind of you have to break there's so many different type of frontal behaviors so that type of behavior which may be involved in sort of being able to inhibit you know your motor movements or maybe not being distracted May reflect that that system is a little bit delayed but it could be that another system the one that's involved in planning and organizes you know it's more developed and I I do think they they develop at different trajectories so with the frontal loes essentially um serving an executive or CEO type function goal directed Behavior intentions cognitive control uh these are the terms you used um where are the rules what do the rules look like you know when I think about brain function which I've spent a lot of my life thinking about we think about chemical and electrical signaling between neurons different neurons communicating more or less at a given moment reflecting some sort of circuit as we call it and then some Behavior or some decision comes out and if I for instance um have to get my driver's license renewed soon so if I go to the Department of Motor Vehicles what a lovely experience that is um the moment I get there that i s of lock into a certain rule set um when I'm home I'm in a different rule set when I'm in with my friends versus when I'm with my parents different rule sets and it seems that the frontal loobe is really good at um drawing on context based on knowledge of where one is um and then coming up with kind of algorithms that are appropriate or inappropriate to run in that context but what is the nature of these algorithms are they um of the okay shut down all um cursing in this environment um okay you're free to just quote unquote be you I mean when when it really comes down to it it has some interesting philosophical aspects too because uh just be yourself be authentic be vulnerable you know all these things make sense but of course one needs to be appropriate with the context so how how do does this work like what what is the what are the algorithms how how does this work right because because that's a pretty common example of our patients that they they don't follow the rules um they they you know if you're sitting in a someone's the doctor's office and the phone rings you you you know not to pick up his phone but the patients don't and they they may pick up the phone there's there's this Dr L who's a a neurologist from France published these beautiful papers in the 80s of all these things that patients did that just that broke the rules and and so and BR just kind of pulled to the their environment without having any context to it if he put a pair of glasses on the table uh and didn't ask going to put them on they would put them on even if they had a pair of glasses on already or he took them to their apartment and they saw the bed and they jump into the bed and go under the covers or he saw he had a nurse and she he put a blood pressure cuff there and she picked up the blood pressure cuff and just started taking his blood pressure again not asking him to do any of these things and so they they they just don't follow sort of the social rules but they're there they they haven't lost rules if you ask these patients was that the appropriate thing to do they'll say no they know it's not they know it's appropriate yeah they say no I'm not supposed to answer your phone but oh wow so they know better but they can't control the impulse exactly so it's it's it's so it's not a breakdown that the rules disappear it's that they can't apply the rule they can't apply the rules Pro properly and and and that's true for a lot of PA patients even with kids you know you tell them uh don't have anything to eat before dinner because we're having dinner and then they're sitting there having a sandwich and you say what did I just tell you you said well don't eat but I'm I'm hungry right as another sort of example sort of the frontal Lo's not completely kind of developed so when I think about rules I I think about the brain you know the brain processes information obviously but it also stores information the most important thing it does is store all sorts of information all over the brain and I think what the frontal lobes do is they store rules and what's interesting uh about the way it stores rules they seem to store the rules in a hierarch arcal fashion um and what I mean by that is that there's different levels to rules I like to give the example of uh playing golf I tell a story a lot about my good friend bob Knight when he hits a ball into the you know off into the woods and he has to try and hit the ball out of the woods he's holding on to all different levels of rules on how to successfully get his ball back towards the green so the most simplest one is just like where you know where is the FL you know I've got to maintain the uh orientation to get to the flag you know so he's holding that he also at a higher level rules he knows that if he kicks the ball it's a penalty so he's not going to do that right and then another higher level rule might be if I just keep doing this you know then this is going to be healthy for me so he's storing all this information at sort of at different levels of hierarchy and he's apply he's applying it to ultimately achieve this very simple Act of or not so simple Act of of hitting the golf ball so yeah so I just I think about sort of the frontal cortex is able to call upon the rule in the appropriate context and if you don't have your frontal loaves it it it doesn't get pulled up properly and those rules must be learned right they it there's no way I can imagine that one can be born into the world with these rules sets intact um I think about the the two marshmallow experiment that's sort of famous now um where kids are offered to eat uh one marshmallow right away or right defer and get two marshmallows these adorable videos of theid the strategies they use like Turning Away poking the marshmallow and you know there's some debate uh ongoing as to whether or not uh success or lack of success in deferring to the two marshmallow reward is um predictive of of other things in life but leaving that aside um am I correct in assuming that that task is a frontal lobe task the kids are given a novel rule you can have one marshmallow now or wait um patiently and then uh with and overcome the craving for that one marshmallow and then you'll get two um and presumably that um that experiment is engaging the frontal loes and you know we can only speculate but um some kids are able to defer some are not um and I can imagine that at that age there's a lot of neuroplasticity um strengthening and weakening of Connections in the brain on in an experience dependent way so does that mean that um children and perhaps adults as well can train up their prefrontal Court cortical abilities to strategize and defer in a way that's adaptive absolutely I mean definitely you can learn strategies to not only sort of learn rules um but but how to apply goals when when you start to think about that task in particular some of it has to do with sort of maintaining a goal and and maintaining a goal at different you know time scales right and children tend to sort of act on goals that are much more short on a shorter time scale you know I'm going to have the sandwich right now because I'm hungry as opposed to wait till till dinner which is a longer longer term goal and so yeah this default to sort of the shorter you can you can learn that maintaining a longer type goal uh can be much more beneficial uh than than the short-term goal even though it doesn't seem obvious and we all learn that right we as we as we get older most us we keep our eye on the ball of sort more long term goals and that's very predictive of how successful we can we can be the farther out we can maintain a goal and that's what the that's what the prefrontal cortex does it maintains goals and then applies those goals and if you don't apply them then you lose you know then you then all of this executive function breaks down do you think that these algorithms and rules that the prefrontal cortical circuitry can learn and indeed does learn can generalize so for instance when I my first year of college was the disaster uh for reasons that aren't interesting right now but then when I came back my sophomore year really spring of my freshman year I was like okay it's on it was I had to rescue myself and so one of the things I used to do was I would study um and I would set a timer so I refuse to get up even if I had to use the the restroom very very badly I would um set up all sorts of Behavioral constraints um and I like to think that I was building up my prefrontal ability to refocus on the material and fortunately for me there were no smartphones back then it was much easier internet we had email but no real internet browsing to to speak of and I like to think that the I sometimes call it uh and this is terrible um to call it this because it's not uh nearly exhaustive of the underlying function but I call it sort of like lyic friction it's like there's this friction that one feels mentally like you want to get up you want to use the restroom you want to eat something you want to call a friend but you stay focused on the task at hand do you think that that business of quote unquote staying focused on the task at hand can generalize because of the sensations it generates in the body and then you oh this is familiar this is just like studying but in a different context one is one stays focused or do you think that the prefrontal cortex is is so context specific that it needs to learn a Ru the rules for every individual situation and then this has all sorts of implications for Behavioral restraint and focus and attention deficit so uh if you could just speculate um I know a number of people are interested in how they can be more focused and people often defer to like what supplement what drug okay that those are interesting conversations but I think ultimately we're talking about neural circuitry yeah I mean it absolutely can generalize it that's been a frustrating thing into trying to develop what we call cognitive therapy where we we teach we try to improve someone's memory ability or we try to improve someone's executive function ability the the disappointing early results was always that yeah they get very good at the task that you've trained them at but it doesn't seem to generalize to anything else so if you teach them a you know a task they can do amazing things like match a finger to a color to a shape and put together all sorts of rules and then and they're really good at that task very quickly and then nothing's really changed in their real life but but I think we've learned on how to sort of on how to try and make it uh translate to real life and and so for example there's there's a therapy called goal Management training which is developed um by Brian LaVine and colleagues at the rotman Research Institute of Toronto where they've been very successful in teaching uh patients how to improve your executive function uh and how to make that translate into your real world but it's it's very hard work it's it's very therapist driven it requires um it requires a series of of trainings for example people learn uh they develop individual projects like planning a meal or planning a family vacation or planning a podcast and then they work through what's involved in that sort of very specific project how you how you stay focused how you don't just get distracted how you keep your eye on the ball how you break it down to subg goals how you um you monitor what you're doing how you don't let anxiety and procrastination get involved but it's a it's a very active sort of process but when you add all that to it in a very disciplined way over the course of many hours and many weeks it does translate patients and individuals to say yeah I'm just better at doing things I mean the whole goal is to do things right and and I'm just better at it I don't know what it is but I'm I'm not just better at what you taught me I'm just better at other things so I do have a lot of hope that these kind of therapies will generalize to the you know to people's real life I throughout the term lyic friction again not a technical or clinical or official term in any way but just a way to kind of capture um some of the interactions of the frontal cortex with other circuitry I mean there's far more um involved in ation and challenges focusing than the lyic system but it's it certainly is involved um when thinking about the frontal cortex I often think about its connections with other areas of the brain so maybe we could talk a little bit about those connections and and in particular the connections from the frontal cortex to let's call it um circuitry that controls reflexive behaviors um what are what is the nature of that circuitry and um can we make any general statements like does the frontal cortex really serve to um provide a quieting um suppressive function on reflexes or is it more of an Orchestra conductor where it's saying okay A little bit of that and a little bit of that um and then what's what comes out in Behavior or speech is something that looks very organized but is actually the the the reflection of a lot of selective filtering yes I mean the prefrontal cortex what's so fascinating about it is that it I would say it connects to every part of the brain uh cortex and the subcortex and almost every part of the brain connects to it so that I mean that right there tells you it's a pretty important area and it has to if it's going to be in this CEO you know conductor type experience uh role and so it's in this privileged position just anatomically so that that gives us great insight to how important it is and so it is connecting and then of course we could talk about it how it's connected to the body as well how it controls heart rate and respirations as well well so it's not just just the brain so um but it's really interesting like like you said is is it really just sort of maintaining telling you what's relevant and what's not relevant or is it allowing you to switch I I think it does all those things it it it definitely what we call sends these top- down signals it sending signals to the other brain about what you should be paying attention to and what you shouldn't be paying attention to so for example if you we've done studies with functional Imaging where we have them look at pictures of faces and scenes and that lights up the back of your brain your visual cortex has areas that are can process faces and process scenes and um but sometimes we have you just want to pay attention to the faces and not the scenes and other times we want you to pay attention to the scenes and not the faces well you know even though it's getting the same bottom up visual input the prefrontal cortex will will show greater activity to the relevant information it it'll it'll sort it's sending a signal say pay attention to the faces ignore the scene and uh or vice versa so it's it's directing all of this information that bombarded with to what's what's relevant but at the same time it's also uh allowing us to switch if if that we now have to go switch to another task it says okay this is not important now we're going to move over to this this other other task so there's many different components of how it can you know how it can kind of control Behavior but it does all of these things in this incredible way that we still don't completely understand but we know that's the source of of all of this control is coming from the prefrontal cortex I'd like to take a brief moment and thank one of our sponsors and that's ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens I started taking ag1 way back in 2012 the reason I started taking it and the reason I still take it every day is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas for vitamins and minerals and it ensures that I get enough Prebiotic and probiotic to support gut health now gut health is something that over the last 10 years we realized is not just important for the health of our gut but also for our immune system and for the production of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators things like dopamine and serotonin in other words gut health is critical for proper brain functioning now of course I strive to consume healthy Whole Foods for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day but there are a number of things in ag1 including specific micronutrients that are hard to get from Whole Foods or at least in sufficient quantities so ag1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals that I need probiotics prebiotics the adaptogens and critical micronutrients so anytime somebody asks me if they were to take Just One supplement what that supplement should be I tell them ag1 because ag1 supports so many different systems within the body that are involved in mental health physical health and performance to try ag1 go to drink a1.com huberman and you'll get a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 and five free travel packs of ag1 again that's drink a1.com / huberman you mentioned connections between the prefrontal cortex and the body um that's the first I've heard of that um and I'm not challenging that to the contrary I'm just intrigued by it um I'm aware that the hypothalamus and some of these deeper brain structures associated with more um let's call them primitive drives um temperature regulation uh hunger Etc connect to the body but uh what what's the nature of some of the connections with the front to the body yeah I was just sort of talking in terms of of our knowledge of how you know changing on one of your podcast you talked about how TMS to the prefrontal cortex can slow heart rate so I meant in that in that sort of way got it that that that yeah by by that by influencing cortical function will obviously we can influence uh organs like the got it so through some intermediate stations yes yeah I mean it's you know not to um not to be hyperbolic but I mean it seems like the prefrontal cortex here we referring to as the frontal loes um are essentially the seat of what makes us human and What Makes Us functional or dysfunctional in a given context right I mean uh I recall there's a syndrome cluver buy syndrome which has some vague um uh similarities to how you describe frontal cortex damage but there as I recall humans or animals um with that syndrome will act in a way that's not appropriate to context but more inappropriate like they'll they'll try and eat a ceramic cup or Draw with a piece of paper which obviously won't work it seems like with the frontal cortex it knows that a pen is for writing it just the person might say yeah I know I'm not supposed to write this but I'm just going to or write with it but I'm going to take your pen and write something inappropriate with it but it it's not that they people forget that there's a that it's a pen so it seems like it's drawing on um so rule sets but that something's intact it's like it's not like cluver buy syndrome where um like animals and people can try and like mate with inanimate art objects um which is one of the more Salient um symptoms I'll never forget that never forget that from from my cognitive Neuroscience course which you taught by the way um just throw that in there so yeah so how how should we think about this and here I'm trying to get at a kind of a broader understanding of brain function and context specific behavior um it so frontal cortex is like super sophisticated um but it doesn't have all the information right it seems like someone without a frontal cortex probably knows that you write with a pen you don't write with a piece of paper yeah I I think it's you know we think about it as it's you know the frontal CeX allows us to take thought and move it towards action and there's this disconnect between the knowledge and and action and the separation of action from knowledge and I guess I can reflect on my patience you know when I I've seen a lot of patients with damage all over the brain and all of the families of patients who have frontal Lo injury always say the same thing they're they're just no longer that person they're no longer my spouse they're no longer my best friend they're no longer my father just something they can't put it into words but they're not them anymore there's something has changed whereas if you talk to a patient with brok as aasia who has this inability to speak they can't get any words out you know this is a devastating problem they're still the same person they they they their personality hasn't changed they they feel the same person they just can't speak the way they get around in the world is different or if you take a patient with prosopagnosic which is uh this inability to recognize faces of course the way they navigate around the world is is is difficult and it's not the same but they're still the same person so there's something really special about the frontal cortex that allows us to be as you said sort of who we are and that's the difficult part like how does the frontal Lopes allow us sort of take um take who we are and translate that into knowledge so we're not I guess in other words saying just just having knowledge isn't what makes us who we are right it's to be able to take that knowledge and and and present it in a way that allows us to live life based on our intentions and our goals and our desires so much of things like stoic philosophy and um and even online Wellness culture are about um having routines um you know overcoming reflex by just having recipes scripts to follow each day um I certainly try to have my mornings be as what I call linear as possible and I find it's much easier in the earlier part of the day to just decide here's what I'm going to do write out a list do things in a certain sequence if I don't do that I go nonlinear as I refer to it and we'll get distracted and things of that sort but um earlier you mentioned sleep deprivation can impair frontal Lo function it does seem that um as the day progresses and certainly in the middle of the night it just becomes much harder to um control our our thinking maybe even our Behavior but um and certainly our emotions is there a frontal lob uh regulation of emotional states as well I know you have some recent work on this so i' love to hear more yeah yeah I mean as I was saying earlier the frontal L is a big place and and half of it is involved in these high level executive functions but the other half of it is in is part of the lyic system or that we call it the paralic system that's involved in Social and emotional behavior and so uh there's this intimate back and forth between these two areas of the cortex if you have just damage to these frontal to these areas that are kind of in the overal frontal lobe you will have many different impairments that we would call sort of social or emotional impairments and they're executive function will be quite normal and then you'll have the the opposite where patients with the lateral damage will have executive functions but they seem emotionally intact but but you know in real life when we have both these intact they're they're communicating with each other so right emotion and context and is going to influence our executive function we make bad decisions in stressful situations or situations we're not comfortable with it's it's where we might make a better decision if it's a quiet you know kind of quiet place um but it is something that we can I think you you're right you can you can sort of get into a routine and learn how to do things you know if you have very much planned out but what's so unique about us is how we can be flexible and adaptable right when when something novel comes up or there's something something unexpected comes up we can adapt to it and that's really what the frontal cortex is really important for um not just sort of making these plans routines and setting all the rules but being a when things don't go right how to how to write the ship right I will never ask you to um demonize technology um I certainly use a a smartphone um from waking till sleep um generally not in the middle of the night if I can avoid it uh and I generally avoid it but I'm trying to take what we've discuss this far and superimpose the the notion of smartphones and ask what are the rules what are the algorithms that we're learning when we use these devices and I'm not calling them adaptive or maladaptive they're clearly here to stay they've assisted in medicine I'm sure it makes it easier for doctors to communicate on the on the ward and and for um clinic and it's so useful right but contained in this small device um there are things like uh for instance text messaging where unlike 20 years ago we can have four or five different conversations very quickly while boarding a flight um there's a task switching element that was just not present in our life um prior to that um social media in particular this notion of being able to scroll so move if we really step back from this move one's thumb and access hundreds if not thousands of video content from dist which Each of which has a distinct context um and so I have to imagine that kids and adults have frontal cortices that are learning these rules and the rule is move your thumbs stay engaged emotions either positive veilance emotions or negative emotions I mean it's it's a fairly limited um landscape there when you really think about it but but the algorithm that's learned is to me doesn't seem exportable it doesn't help me prepare for a podcast at all I know that for sure doesn't help me go for a run doesn't help me listen with more focused attention to a family member or a friend or a significant other um it may make me more empathic or more angry I you know we can we can speculate but um again with no with no intention of demonizing social media does it seem that the the algorithms that are being run in our brain I mean are they neutral are they positive are they negative should we be worried um it doesn't seem like they translate to much else they they W I can't see a way in which they help us be better people in other domains whereas reading a book line by line and then going back oh I didn't even remember anything from that page going back line by line um playing a game of squash or something like that there I can see the real value of the rule sets that generalize yeah I mean I can you know just historically I grew up in a world when there was no smartphones as a resident and and so one of the most difficult things I do in practice is have to take care of patients in the emergency room and there's a real emergency someone's having gun control seizures or they're having a stroke and you know doing this back in the 80s or 90s and early 2000s when you went down there and you didn't have any smartphone you you could only rely on what's what's in your head and I could say now having the smartphone it hasn't it doesn't help me at all I I never you know it does not help me at all in making the kind of decisions that I have to make in the emergency room I'm I'm trying to decide you know what what what's the problem here what's the differential diagnosis what how should I treat it I'm just trying to make very going through an algorithm like you said in a common sense way and there's nothing on my phone that I can turn to to help me do that it has helped with giving me knowledge like back in the day I had to remember what the Dilantin dose was and have that in my head or go look for the piece of paper in my pocket and so I can quickly pull up you know I guess I'm a little bit you know there's information that I can access that I don't have to worry about keeping every single dose in my head or keeping everything in my head just facts in my head but uh outside of that there's nothing I can turn to that it's it's making me you know better making me make better decision so I I don't even need my cell phone I don't go searching my for my cell phone if I'm going to go to mer room or going to take a take a phone call so I don't see how it's helping sort of make your frontal Lo it can't be your frontal loes I mean it's another way of saying it but but on the flip side can it help you optimize frontal low function technology certainly it can we can maybe talk about it later there there certainly that's one way to get learn strategies is through a through a device that that's easily accessible and uh you know to you as opposed to a book or or having a therapist uh in your house yeah I suppose I worry that um too much of my time and other people's time and especially young people's time is um engaging in a algorithm that does not um generalize for adaptive Behavior elsewhere and and by comparison you know like a a game of soccer with friends or something right it's social social media is social um it's physical social media is not physical but we'll we'll rule that that portion out but there's a rule set um there's gold directed behavior um presumably some of the things that happen in a game of soccer with friends translate to some other domain of life um because it's a single context game of soccer whereas with social media I don't know anybody that goes and looks at One account and that's it and absorbs the information maybe comments has an interaction and goes it's it's hundreds or thousands of contacts so is there any risk or perhaps benefit to being able to um get this very detailed portal into so many contexts per unit time I mean the the forebrains never had done that in the course of human history as far as I know yeah I mean I think there is a risk but what Pops to mind you know having kids is is watching them navigate in their cars to places totally dependent on on Google Maps um I I think you're probably old enough to remember real Maps where you didn't I still have one in my I still I love paper maps I love Maps right where you had to really figure out you know you you had to go to a certain place and you had to either look at the map or or or ask stop at a gas station and ask these these these skills were something that you learned and you developed and it was problem solving and and uh and that's all gone now I mean it's it's I I wonder even if sometimes if if uh people even know the direction they're going whether it's West North or what set they're in because they're just following the directions so I we we'll see I I just can't imagine that that learned skill is not going to be detrimental to us at at some point and generalize in the generalize in a bad way right as as opposed to a good way um so I don't I yeah it does it does definitely worry me but like you said there's nothing on the phone that helps you plan a podcast nothing that helps me in the emergency room nothing helps a professor when he's giving a lecture so I agree with you that that the sort of having your head buried in in a cell phone I'm not yeah it's I don't see it being healthy for your frontal loves let's talk about working memory um some years back but still now you use working memory tasks and experiments in your laboratory if you would um be so kind as to explain what working memory is and then I'd love to talk about um some of the work you've done exploring the role of dopamine in working memory um because this is so critical to everyday life and I know dopamine's a bit of a buzzword these days but um the listeners of this podcast anyway are are um pretty sophisticated in terms of knowing that dopamine is not just about reward it's about motivation and goal directed behavior and I think dopamine intrigues for a good reason that it does govern a lot of our you know quality of life so um what's working memory yeah I mean working memory it's interesting I started studying at about 30 years ago and I don't think I realized how important it was when I started but what we mean by working memor is this ability to hold information in mind uh when it's no longer accessible to us so if you tell me your telephone number and I'm have to put it into my phone you know it's no longer there you just told me but I'll hold it in my working memory until I can punch it into my my phone it doesn't have to be something that comes from the outside world I could hold up uh you know I can pull up my own if I'm filling out a form and I want to pull up my social security number can hold that in mind too until I put it down so um when you think about it it's a very important uh you know ability that we have that we do very flawlessly and what I've learned more about working memory is is the working part of it it's not just this passive holding information on mind but it's being able to do things with the information it's being able to um you know when we when we do a bath problem which we don't do that much now that we have calculators but if you do that in your head you're able to sort of manipulate the information and and do the different parts of the problem or even if you're you know you're trying to find someone in a crowd and you're holding on to some face you're able to hold that face in mind and cross check it and search and and so there's there's operations to working memory it's not just you know it's not just this passive maintenance so when we start to think about working memory in that way we start to realize how important it is for it's you know I think of it as the foundation for for cognition just think about reading comprehension you can't understand this conversation if you can't hold in mind what's going on you know earlier in the in the conversation or when you're reading a book you know remembering the sentence uh before it so it just predicts all these abilities that that allows us to to read to to uh plan to organize and all the sort of executive functions that we're we're doing right we have to hold in mind rules we have to hold in mind goals we have to hold in mind all of these things in order to carry out behavior um you know so it's it's it's it's really come a long way in terms of how people are thinking about it I I I know that uh Matt Walker said that like you know sleep is our superpower but I guess one way to sort of use this term while we're awake working memory is is really our superpower because it it allows us to to translate as we said sort of our knowledge into action by holding this information uh in mind as we're thinking about what we want to do if we're going to think about dopamine in the context of working memory is dopamine an accelerator on working memory is it a facilitator I mean what is dopamine doing for working memory and maybe we could talk a little bit about the circuitry um I've talked about dopamine before on this podcast but there's a good chance that some of the people listening to this haven't heard those episodes so maybe we could just quickly review the three major circuits for dopamine and the one that's relevant for working memory yeah let me start with the working memory the circuitry for working memory because one one of the important things about working memory is the other type of memory is is long-term memory it's it's you you can working memory shortlived it's only as long as you're able to rehearse it and then it disappears whereas what we call long-term memory if I remembering what you had for breakfast or your vacation this is information that's gets Consolidated and and gets put into a a more durable form that we call long-term memory and the interesting thing about memory is that these are separate systems everything from working memory just doesn't pass into long-term memory there're they're two completely different systems and and two completely different parts of the brain that seem to control it um so working memory uh the frontal cortex seems to be very important for working memory when when we are holding information in line the neurons the brain cells in the frontal loes are active and they stay kind of active as long as we're holding on that information and they're more active when the information is relevant um and if we uh we we get distracted they'll get less active so it kind of the frontal Loops kind of track your uh you know track TR the memory that you're holding in mind another important thing about the circuitry is that um if we're holding in mind say digits you know the phone number well that information is in your back of the brain and so the the frontal loes is sort of keeping information in the back of the brain active because it's connected to the visual areas it's it's able to sort of keep that information active and so what what we've learned is that there's not these buffers in the brain where oh you know if you're holding verbal information it's in this little buffer if you're holding visual information it's in another buffer the whole brain acts as a buffer and and the frontal lobe can call up any part of the brain and keep that part of the brain active as it's as it's you know as it's trying to hold this information in line so the mechanism for working memory is just this persistent neural activity within the frontal LS and so then the question is what does dopamine do well dopamine is one of the neuromodulators that are made in the brain stem and IT projects up to different parts of the brain there's a system that goes up into the into the what we call the basil gangula which is important for motor function and there's another dope neric system that goes up to the frontal loes and what was discovered was that if you deplete DOP mean a working memory drops you get a significant impairment and working memory if if you deplete dopamine and if you replace it uh then your working memory will be improved and so DOP mean seems to be a modulator to help this persistent activity stay persistent consistent uh you know during the time that you need to keep this information in mind am I reaching to far to draw an analogy between dopamine's role in working memory that is to keep information online and the other established role of dopamine which is for movement for the generation of smooth movement um as evidenced by conditions like Parkinson's where people lack dopaminergic neurons or have damage to dopaminergic neurons and have a you know challenges in generating smooth movement what I'm essentially asking is can we think of dopamine as facilitating physical movement through one circuit but also kind of mental movement thought movement and um I'm thinking about for those just listening and and not watching I'm kind of rubbing my um index and middle finger against my thumb just keeping something online um it's sort of a movement of thought or information and then you kind of Chuck it away and bring about the next information is that is that yeah I think that's a good way of thinking about it and one might wonder well how can do me be important for memory but also be important for movement and and it's really simple it's just that it's acting on different circuits the the the neurons that go to the motor areas that carry dope mean will will when dope mean is expressed there then and boosted there then it will be involved in movement and lack of dope mean in the basil ganging will lead to neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease that has severe movement uh difficulty but when it's acting in the frontal cortex uh and expressed in the frontal cortex then it's going to improve working memory so it's just it's just a the nature of where the circuits are where the DOP mean is that's that's allowing it to have different kinds of actions and that's all for all transmitters the reason why OS choline seems to be more important for long-term memory is because it it's projecting to the hippocampus which is we know is another area that's important for memory and that's why asine doesn't boost your working memory but DOP mean does and vice versa I'd like to take a quick break to acknowledge our sponsor element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means zero sugar and the appropriate ratios of the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium and that correct ratio of electrolytes is extremely important because every cell in your body but especially your nerve cells your neurons relies on electrolytes in order to function properly so when you're well hydrated and you have the appropriate amount of electrolyt in your system your mental functioning and your physical functioning is improved I drink one packet of element dissolved in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning as well as while I exercise and if I've sweat a lot during that exercise I often will drink a third element packet dissolved in about 32 ounces of water after I exercise element comes in a variety of different flavors all of which I find really tasty I like the Citrus I like the watermelon I like the raspberry frankly I can't pick just one it also comes in chocolate and chocolate mint which I find tastes best if they are put into water dissolved and then heated up I tend to do that in the winter months because of course you don't just need hydration on hot days and in the summer and spring months but also in the winter when the temperatures are cold and the environment tends to be dry if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element spelled element.com huberman to try a free sample pack again that's drink element.com huberman so drilling a little bit more deeply into the role of dopamine and work memory uh you did some really lovely experiments uh showing that if um people who have low levels of dopamine um increase their dopamine uh pharmacologically I think the drug that was used was bromocryptine um that working memory improves um conversely if one depletes dopamine pharmacologically dop uh working memory gets worse um but as I recall there was an important Baseline that is important because it really mattered in terms of the outcome meaning if somebody already had relatively high levels of dopamine in this circuit increasing dopamine further with bromocryptine didn't impart a benefit and might have even made their working memory worse so there's a kind of inverted us shape function to this um how does one know whether or not their Baseline dopamine is low medium or high Ergo how do they know whether or not that they would uh want to explore going about increasing dopamine through any number of different approaches right well most people probably have optimal dopamine but there's a significant percentage that probably have too little or maybe too much and it's unfortunately we can't measure it in the blood um there isn't a blood test that I'm aware of that can can measure uh do me because it's stuck in stuck in the brain um peripheral dopamine in the blood doesn't is not a good readout it's not a good readout yeah and and especially when you're talking about dope mean in in areas like prefrontal cortex and um so we don't have a good read out there there's there's invasive procedures like positron emission tomography where we can inject a radioisotope um and that tags DOP mean and then we can measure how much we can do a scan that actually shows us how much dope mean this scan was originally developed to show Parkinson disease that that you can diagnose Parkinson disease by showing that there's there's less DOP mean in patients that have Parkin disas by looking at this this scan um obviously it's invasive you're injecting a r isotope it's expensive and it's not something we could all do but we had used it to show that it correlates very strongly with your working memory capacity so how much information you can hold online if you can hold four or five or six letters when I do a a span task um correlated with how much do me we can see in the pet scan so that that would be a a way that we could do it um so if you were to read out a string of a few numbers or letters um and and I can remember all of those a few moments later um Perhaps Perhaps my Baseline dopamine levels are U moderate um in the in the normal range whereas if I couldn't keep that online um that might be might be reflective of lower Baseline dopamine levels is that right yeah it's a it's a very strong proxy for dopamine so if you're you're working Maring capacity is seven letters when or numbers when I say 437 1506 if you 43 get them all back pretty quickly you probably have more dope Baseline dope mean than than someone who has five they're so it's it's a proxy for measuring someone's open so that that's one way of do it and that's actually how we did it in our original studies we we actually um grouped individuals based on whether their capacity based on this behavioral measure was high or low and like you said those who were that can only hold five or six letters if we gave them bromo crype which was the Doper nergic Agonist we improved their working memory uh we got them into sort of an optimal level but but those who were already Pi we actually made them we were we got them worse and the moral of that story was that more is just not better we're trying to get people optimal and so the real question is is you know if we want to get people optimal like you were inferring you have to know what their do mean is where where are you on this inverted you curve another way of doing it it uh is through um a Genet through genetic studies so we have don't mean uh all neurotransmitters have to be broken down and re-uptake into the into the brain cell in order to be used again and there's different ways of doing it and some cells uh it gets transported back into the brain cell and other other places there's an enzyme that that breaks it down well there's an enzyme called compt uh that is breaks down dope being in the prefrontal cortex specific speically in a large percentage of individuals that enzyme is either overactive or underactive probably about 25% of individuals it's overactive and another 25% it's underactive so probably half the population now this is going to vary depend on other where you live and where you come from and things but it but but maybe half the population either has an underactive enzyme or overactive enzyme if you have an underactive enzyme then actually more dopamine sits around and you you actually have more dopamine than others and if you have an overactive enzyme it's the opposite so we've actually shown that if you now go and genotype people with a simple saliva test and figure out do they have this genetic what we call polymorphism where just one amino acid gets changed and the enzyme becomes either active or underactive we can we can do the same thing as as grouping them by their capacity those that have the low dope mean we will make make them better and those who have sort of Baseline High dope me will will make them worse super interesting um maybe we could talk about bromocryptine a little bit and I'm not encouraging people to run out and take bromocryptine um bromocryptine as you mentioned is a dopamine Agonist um relatively short acting yeah four five hours six hours so kicks in about 90 minutes after as I recall you saying I've never taken it um how do people feel when they're on bromocryptine I mean when I hear uh dopamine Agonist I mean there are a lot of illicit drugs like cocaine methamphetamine that are increased dopamine but then again chocolate sex and food increased dopamine but the kinetics the time course and the levels are different for each of those things um dopamine of course being a currency of motivation and reward not not um directly related to any one compound but um I would think that based on the data you just described that um and given the fact that there are a number of people out there with challenges in working memory attention task switching Etc that there would be a strong interest on the part of the pharmaceutical companies at least and certainly the general public um in things like bromocryptine to increase dopamine to increase working memory given it it is our superpower yeah I mean one of the most disappointing things to me in my career has been that pharmaceutical companies have not picked up on this idea that that we could improve cognition and very specifically improve C process with very specific neurom modulators the the discovery that depletion of dope mean and not other transmitters and pairs working memory was made in 1979 um when I heard uh Pat G talk about this as a resident I was just amazed that there could be a single transmitter can change a single Behavior I was seeing very complicated behavioral deficits and it just seemed impossible to me that there could be such a tight link between a single you know a single neurom modulator and a single cognitive process and just open the door for me that this really could be a incredibly Ben official therapy for for any anyone with executive function or frontal low function so but unfortunately there's never been a Pharm company that's tried to develop a drug for improving cognition to this to this day and they I mean it's crazy for several reasons one is that the data are clearly there uh two these drugs are already established it's not like they have to go through safety trial again that that's already been done but mostly because regardless of whether one is a fan of the pharmaceutical industry or hates it the pharmaceutical industry in principle can make a ton of money doing this so I would think that they'd be heavily incentivized to do it so why have they um Turned a blind eye on this I'm not sure I mean when I realized um that I could test these drugs in in healthy individuals that that they were s if I gave them in low enough doses they were safe and and I had so much experience of them in patience that I felt comfortable doing it um then I started asking pharmaceutical companies you know do you want to get involved here we we can we this should be done I can't do this by myself we need to have real trials and real studies of how this will help you know and just was you know their eyes would always cross and never never got any any sort of traction it always went back to sort of disease you know what what disease are you um curing you know what what's the market for it is it a parking disease thing is it an Alzheimer's disease thing and this has been a general problem with Neurology it's very disease Centric it's always sort of and it's always focused on you know how can we develop a treatment for Alzheimer's or traumatic brain injury or stroke as opposed to how can we develop a treatment for working memory dysfunction which is a problem across diseases so the answer to your earlier question is these drugs are very safe they we give them in such low doses to heal the individuals they don't even know they can't even tell the difference between the placebo and the drug really don't even know which one they're on so they're not buzzing thinking like oh this feels good and my working memory is better they have no idea they don't even know their working memory is better until we we show them that their working memory is better so love it yeah so they're truly blind to what's going on um bromocryptine is but one of the dopamine Agonist um can think of a few other um koline like other things like that um do any of these dopamine Agonist um exert this uh impact on working memory or is it um does it vary by drug because different dopamine Agonist uh sort of hit different receptor Pathways and things like that yeah no it's not specifically the drug I mean the the reason for bromocryptine is that it's the oldest and it's the one I was most comfortable with I had to be comfortable with it clinically before I'd give it undergraduates at at pener Berkeley so there's nothing special but other agonists work similarly um there's a there's a drug that's develop a Park which is a compt inhibitor which actually inhibits this this enzyme that we're talking about and that that also will improve uh we'll have the same uh function there's been some future work that Nora and nephrine also seems to be helpful with working memory uh it's not as uh maybe not as um potent as as the dop energic and that that's the point I want to make another another disappointing thing about this whole field of the pharmacology of cognition um you know I I wrote a paper as a resident you know sometimes you're tending to say hey can you write this review paper for us and and I wrote one as a resident called the pharmacology cognition where I looked at all the animal literature on you know uh giving neuromodulators Aline BR um DOP mean or whatever and and there was a lot of there was a lot of animal literature sort of supporting that this would work in humans but was more striking to me was that it wasn't always just a single uh neurotransmitter there were studies where you'd give DOP mean and it wouldn't do anything you give acetal choline it wouldn't do anything but if you gave a low dose of both it would it would be really effective so these you know these trans systems don't act in isolation so we need to also study sort of how the combinations work and that's where another you know where the pharmaceutic companies have the infrastructure to do these kind of say it's very hard to do in a single lab to to do multiple drugs at at at one time you know and then try and look at trying to determine all the different interactions maybe we could talk about a couple of other drugs um that are legal or have and have FDA approval are known to be safe in the right context that um it seems would fit the bill here uh for improving working memory one is um Wellbutrin bronin uh I can never pronounce that um as far as I know it's a uh um epinephrine or norepinephrine Agonist you just mentioned that increasing epinephrine may have a positive impact in working memory and to some extent a dopamine Agonist is there any evidence that um Wellbutrin can improve working memory yeah anything that um boosts norer nephrine can do it the one that we've used that's most used is guanfacine which is actually a blood pressure medication so that's starting to gain some Traction in fact I think there was a study with Co with brain fog for covid showing that improved symptoms with it so there's actually some trials now that are are looking at guanosine and so I would say anything that boosts norepinephrine would be would be helpful um but then again I don't I don't want to leave out the other transmitters serotonin you know increasing serotonin increasing Aline boost other cognitive processes and then you know in a way they can help working memory we talked about working memory being being this Foundation well if if you give veloline and it kind of boosts memory well that can indirectly help your executive function or if you give a a drug that improves your focus then that can indirectly help you know working memory so what I'm really pushing for is is not just a single you know it's going to be one drug you know one drug it's going to be a cocktail and we have to not only figure out what the cocktail is but also figure out who we're giving it to what's T you know link it to the person's own makeup of their own neurochemistry when we get to a point where we'll know we can map out sort of everyone's dop me Norine serotonin levels and then we'll make real progress in in helping them because right now I sort of say with my students what we're doing is just it's just like cutting open the skull and just pouring it onto the brain it's we're not actually doing that we're not actually doing it but it seems that way we're not the Precision is not there yet well you it's great that you developed this um cognitive task that can be a proxy for dopamine levels the cognitive task again being um how many number letter strings somebody can remember um basically working memory performance um there are a lot of tests out there that claim um they can assess dopamine and serotonin a cocoline levels from a blood draw um I've heard of the Dutch test I've never taken it um but a few Mo minutes ago you said that really we one needs to do Patron Mission tomography Imaging which is fairly labor intensive most people don't have access to one of those um it's a clinical tool um so there are behavioral proxies there's neuroimaging but also to my knowledge I I don't know that there's any blood draw that will say hey your serotonin levels are low or your dopamine levels are are moderate your uh Etc there are a lot of companies that market these but are you aware of any clinical or other tools for getting an accurate read of neurotransmitter levels in in a person's brain aside from neuroimaging no and it and it's it's even more complicated than it seems because the Dober ner system is complicated because it's not only just the prefrontal cortex as we talked about it's also the basil ganglia and um so not only do we have to measure dope being just generally levels we have to meure the balance of the dop me in the striatum and the and the prefrontal cortex there's there's a model of dop me um function and its relation ex executive function that has to do with sort of the balance between these two systems that don't mean in the prefrontal cortex is promoting sort of stability it's it's keeping information in mind it's keeping these representations stable whereas the dope mean in the basil ganglia what it's doing is is allowing you to update and refresh you you know the information that you're that you're holding in mind this sort of stability versus flexibility so if you have too much dop in frontal cortex it could lead to a very rigid state where you you don't let anything in and and if you have too much DOP mean the straum and you get too flexible then you can get very distractable so there's a sort of balance of dope mean so it's not just how much dope mean you have in your brain it's it's how much what's the balance of the dope mean so I don't see a blood test as ever giving us that information but I do see there being uh a brain test that that can that can give us this kind of of information of of the two or at least a proxy for it so what I was thinking about when you were talking about asking this question you know for example if you measure pupilary pupil dilation that's a pretty good proxy for NE for the neurogen neric system right so at a given people will wonder what um how to do it we're not going to um go into too much detail here but at a given brightness in the room what we call luminance uh the peup pool tends to be smaller when it's bright and larger when it's um you're in a dim room that's sort of obvious um but at a given luminance the more alert aroused somebody is um arousal as a general term here um not not talking about a particular kind of arousal then the pupil tends to be more dilated it gets bigger the more um norepinephrine is is in the system so if somebody's pupils are really big in bright light that person's got a lot of epinephrine adrenaline right in their system do you use this clinically like when someone comes in are they those big old pupil pup and you're like okay they're probably on a stimulant yeah I mean a lot of what neurology does is is try to look for these windows into the brain and so I think there are a number of Windows into the brain that we're going to be able to develop that can reflect these neuromodulatory systems so that's why I've been so interested in developing biomarkers because really what a neural biomarker is is is trying to uh develop something you can measure easily and simply and cheaply with you know but gives you uh information about how the brain is working so that's a bi you know that's a neurop biomarker working Maring capaity is adult mean biomarker and and we're getting better at that but again we're not putting enough emphasis on it in my opinion to really sort of help you know improve brain health have you ever tried bromocryptine very early on but it's it's such a low do you know the at the dose that the my subjects were getting but like I said it doesn't it's so low you don't feel anything and I should say with even with patients um that take it they they rarely get any side effects sometimes uh with these drugs because this peripheral don't mean they can get a you nausea volume but it's extremely well tolerated you don't get any any anything feeling from it does it change reaction time it does and that's always the question of of how much of this is that we're just sort of speeding up we're just sort of making them faster but for all the the work we've done it's it's pretty convincing that it's it's not just how fast you're doing it you're doing it better uh you might find this entertaining um some years ago uh I learned that athletes uh were taking bromocryptine U pre- Olympics and in the Olympics I think it's a ban substance now um and the athletes that were taking it don't ask me how I know this but I could tell you offline um and I'm not one of these athletes nor was I supplying the Brom crype where using it because uh they were sprinters and it turns out that a lot of the sprint races are won by being first out the blocks there are other factors as well but that reaction time you know hundreds of milliseconds are the difference between Podium and no Podium um and bromocryptine was one of the drugs used it was not on the band substance list uh just a reminder that every Olympics you see there are lots of things being used that are not on the band substance list and I'm not trying to be disparaging I think there's just a lot of interest in augmenting neuromodulation for nervous system function bromocryptine was top of the list at that time I think it's on the band list now um there's a lot of um use of pharmacology now on college campuses and in high school and even in elementary schools and sometimes by parents for their kids to try and improve cognitive function most typically the use of adol viance rlin and other stimulants which are neat ergic dopaminergic Agonist okay so um with the uh discl claimer caveat whatever you want to call it that you know those decisions should always be made with a a trained psychiatrist um monitoring things what are your thoughts about um pharmacology for enhancing cognitive function given that the landscape of society is challenging and people want to perform well they need to be able to focus we've got smartphones distracting us and um to some extent um you know one could say oh well it's cheating to use pharmacology but a cup of coffee is a bit of a noradrenergic Agonist absolutely and um certainly can improves my focus as long as I don't drink too much of it right um yeah what are your thoughts and just yeah I think it you know it kind of gets back to what we talked about there being an optimal you know optimal level of of dop me in your brain I I think if you think about it as just more and more and more is better and that more is better then there's really no there's really no how do you know how much you should be taking there's sort of no that experiment was run in the ' 80s it's called the cocaine uh culture of of Wall Street in the ' 80s that we there movies about it and it doesn't lead to good places right right so so I'm all for optimizing function uh I want to optimize brain health and if you have an underactive you know enzyme that's not that that makes your don't mean levels then I'm all for trying to optimize that along with everything else we need to optimize in the brain so if we could figure out who uh yeah who is sort of on the lower end and boost them up I'm all for that the problem is we don't know if they're on the high end and some of these athletes were actually making themselves worse we know for sure I mean these are healthy pen and Berkeley undergraduates that we made them worse on working memory tests you know increasing by increasing their dope me just a little amount just tip them over just a little little amount and uh and so we we you know without the knowing then it just it seems like it's not well informed to taking it the other thing is I I I if we're going to do this we should do it right I think drugs like Aderall and Rin you know they were developed because they helped patients but they weren't necessarily developed with knowing how exactly they worked I mean that's how the pharmaceutical company work too yeah I mean just it works so let's do it I'm all for that as a physician um but if I had my choice uh you know drugs that boost up multiple all the catac colomines the ones that boost up dopamine epinephrine and norrine I I would steer away from those because you have no control over how you're modulating the system uh again I was sort of talking about a cocktail it's it may be a little bit of dope mean and a little more norrine but if you give take something like riddle and adol you're just getting the same amount so it's it's kind of if I was to start to sort of experiment uh then i' i' i' se you I wouldn't use Aderall aralin as the as the drug that I think would helpful even though they're clinically sort of useful I use things like bromocryptine and guanosine where they can modulate a very specific drug and then and then yeah then the goal is to to optimize and and that's what we're trying to do with cognitive theer therapy and everything sleeping better and better nutrition all these are aiming to optimize not you know reach some super human uh potential right just bring out the best in in people's abilities right um and I'm I'm so glad you mentioned sleep um I would say you know sleep is the the Bedrock it's the foundation of mental health physical health and performance I mean without that pharmacology might Bridge you for an afternoon but you're going to pay the piper somehow um our friend and colleague Matt Walker obviously has uh been beating that drum for a while um what about drugs like modafanil which are thought to be true cognitive enhancers um as opposed to um drugs that just kind of are designed to ramp up levels of alertness as many of the drugs we're discussing do yeah it's hard to know I mean I think certain um drugs just improve General abilities either they speed how fast you can process it or how efficient you can process or or narrow the focus of your attention and that just helps all abilities so it's so so it's hard to say I think just just has to be more work on really understanding what specifically uh you know these drugs are doing that's why BR crypting the doener story has been so interesting because it's a very specific effect with a very specific mechanism I like to see that be done with with other neurom modulators maybe we could talk a bit about some of the disease conditions that you treat and the role of working memory and dopamine in those conditions as well as other transmitter systems you know one subject that we haven't talked about on this podcast uh previously but is of tremendous interest to people is traumatic brain injury or concussion even mild concussion and um before we we recording today we were talking about football but just want to remind people that football is just one instance of an opportunity to get a concussion or traumatic brain injury most traumatic brain injury and concussion is not due to football it just gets a lot of the attention but you've got bicycle accidents car accidents playground accidents um uh maybe you could list off a few more um but how common is TBI and concussion and and maybe you could just perhaps list out some the other situations where you see a lot of this um that it's a bit more cryptic that people wouldn't necessarily think that sport or that that population gets TBI but they do yeah I think concussion uh is much more prevalent than we we realize and and the numbers have gone up and up not because it's becoming more common just it's becoming more recognized and I think uh you know we we underestimated and trivialized sort of what a concussion is you know is is that it's just a you know something that is um you know just you're going to recover from it I mean still the old school Thinking by a lot of neurologists is that everyone gets better within a couple of months you know just just wait it out and you'll get better that's just the normal time course of concussion but as we've studied it more uh we realized that there's actually quite a large percentage of people who a year out they're still suffering problems they still feel like they're not mentally clear and they still are sensitive to light and they still feel a little dizzy and and just the symptom you know there a host of symptoms that just one year later after a concussion where they didn't even lose Consciousness you know that something that they may not have even talked to their doctor about is is uh is is lingering um and so it's a real this we call this persistent postconcussion syndrome and that's the most worrisome to me because it is true that most concussions will recover luckily the brain is incredibly resilient incredibly plastic and it will heal itself um but there are a lot of patients where just it just persists and those are the most worrisome to me because we don't have very good interventions to try and help that and I don't think we take these patients very seriously when they're complaining of something that seems very vague and not very specific to most most doctors what do you tell a patient who comes in and has clearly had a concussion um mild or severe concussion you know maybe car accident maybe a sports injury maybe they were knocked out cold maybe not but they're having some headaches some photophobia you know sensitivity light just feeling not right I I've had a couple of these um unfortunately and you just feel off you don't feel quite right um and some of that manifests as Focus issues this was some years ago I like to think I'm through it I've had scans and I'm good um thank thank goodness um but what do you tell them besides don't get another one yeah well first of all I I explain what concussion is what I found in neurology a lot of What patients want to know is just they just want to understand their problem not walking in expecting a cure just just understanding what it is having someone understand what what happened to them is is very helpful and comforting so what we mean by concussion and we in the clinical world we use M traumatic brain injury kind of synonymously with concussion uh it it's it basically is is a tearing of axons it's the bra the brain cells have these long fibers that communicate with each other and they're called axons and when the brain violently moves forward and backwards if you're in a car accident and you have your seat Bel on and you suddenly hit you go from 50 to zero your head violently goes forward and violently goes backwards and that angular Force actually tears and stretches axons in the brain so if you've had a concussion you have torn some axons I mean luckily we have billions of them and so if you tear a couple of thousand you you will Rec you will recover but you you have torn axons it's a real neurological it's a real brain uh injury even if if even if you haven't lost uh Consciousness and you've only had symptoms for a couple of days um but there and there's a correlation the longer you've lost Consciousness and the longer your symptoms last the more axons you've you've torn there's kind of a direct relationship between the two so the so the mechanism is is these torn ACC so now nurses don't communicate with each other and and you know that the brain different brain regions are not communicating with each other um so and it turns out the most common place for axon SATs in the in the frontal loes and so now we talked about all these things that the frontal loes do to orchestrate the rest of the brain while it doesn't it has some injured Pathways and that's why a lot of the symptoms that patients have are these kind of mild executive symptoms this this mental fogus that they're describing is this ability just this unability to to to get things get things done they don't lose knowledge of who they they don't forget their name or you know forget where they live or lose memories from the past or anything like that but they just they don't officially get things done as well as they used to it only takes a little bit of a drop right you people think you have to have a big uh drop in performance to have it have a real life impact just a 1% drop and you're you're having a hard time doing your podcast or teaching a lecture or whatever you might do a 1% drop sounds like a um a frighteningly small change um required to to negatively impact life so um how about a poor night's sleep I mean what kind of drop in prefrontal cortical function are we looking at um from a let's say I normally get seven or eight hours or six to eight hours and I suddenly only get three or four are we talking a significant detriment I I do think so I I do think that yeah that that that the it is significant this a poor night's sleep and and and we all know we all notice that I mean it's very it's very obvious I mean um and you and and you know it's hard to sort of quantify I'm a baseball fan so I can quantify it like if you think about it in a pitchure and how fast they throw you know a small drop for them someone who's throwing 100 miles an hour just a small drop turns them you know from really Elite to someone mediocre maybe it's more of a 10% drop but but but it's still relatively small drop can have a a huge impact I think people think that just because you're a little bit off that's not going to that's not a big deal you kind of you kind of work through it and that's what most doctors say you just just just plow through it just just work your way through it you're going to get better and um as opposed to saying yeah you really had a brain injury um this is what happened we need to rehabilitate you just like we would do if you tore your anterior crucial ligament I don't know why teing your crucial ligament or your kiles tending gets more interest than than tearing axons in in your brain it's it's it's amazing to me that that there's more emphasis on Orthopedic injuries than than brain injuries yeah I don't know why that is either I think the brain is mysterious enough that um most people and and um many clinicians just kind of back away with hands raised but if you are in the field of Neurology or Psychiatry I suppose that then one has officially signed on to try and resolve these matters um so for somebody that um has a traumatic brain injury or or low-level con concussion excuse me um would part of the uh primary advice be to try and get one's sleep as as good as possible given that sleep deprivation can compound um traumatic brain injury uh induce deficits in working memory and who knows maybe a good portion of the deficits in working memory due to um traumatic brain injury and concussion is because of the sleep deprivation that it can cause so it get it can get circular know not only that but one of the most common symptoms that patients my patient with C have is is their sleep is disruptive they they they're and that's true in neurology it's fascinating almost every neurological disorder my patients complain their sleep and and I started asking you know not a lot of neurologists ask you how your sleep you know but I real I remember back from my residency one of the first things my attending would do when we got to the ward is said I just sleep last night and it just across the board you know patients are not falling asleep they're not staying asleep and it's it's uh we still don't understand why just brain injury does that so almost every concussion patient says I'm not sleeping well which then compounds you know compounds the problem so optimizing sleep obviously optimizing nutrition um there's a a question about activity it used to be that uh we used to recommend you know you had a concussion you should you should s don't go to work you know sleep you know just just take it easy for a while don't exercise keep the BL blind strong but now it's it's it's the idea is that you should really get up and moving as best you got to you got to do what you can tolerate you don't want to give yourself a you you don't want to give yourself more of a headache or more light sensitivity but as much as you can tolerate is is the the thought these days about sort of promoting recovery and then really getting your brain back working I think you know a lot of my patients they're off from work for a couple weeks and they they feel fine and they they think they're pretty much normal and the first day of work is a complete disaster because until you actually test it in real life you don't know how what kind of troubles you have so I don't recommend going back full steam but I do recommend going back trying to build up these these Stills skills again and then I think we you I think we need to develop therapies that people will will use um you know things like goal Management training which involves a therapist and you know health insurance doesn't pay for this so 99% of my my patients don't get any help you know by any kind of intervention uh unfortunately but now we talked about technology things like um brain HQ do you know about brain HQ so Mike merenik um which I know you've talked about with with Eddie um developed a a a company called posit science where where developed these brain training games that that can help improve specific cognitive functions and they're very easy to do because they're online and they you know they're there's science behind them and and you can you can do them so that in that way you don't have a therapist in your room but you can online sort of do these sort of things that are targeting specific Mech mechanisms to trying to improve the kind of things that we think are impaired by concussion and I'd like to see more patients get started on some of those things unfortunately if you go on the web and just say I won do brain training you'll be overwhelmed with things and you don't know what works and what doesn't work I I think the work that merenik and colleagues have done we'll provide a link to that I don't have any Financial stake in his in his work or products um trainings that is um but I will say I think Mike's work has been um tremendous I mean he is so far ahead of the curve 20 years ago everyone was talking about neuroplasticity in critical periods um they gave a Nobel Prize to it to my scientific great-grandparents David hubel and Toren and weasel um and they deserved that Nobel Prize but there was a kind of a central tenant of neuroscience at that time was that critical period plasticity ends around adolescence or one's early 20s and that is simply not true and merenik really I think one of the people who deserves credit for um making it clear that plasticity is ongoing it takes some focus and and work to access it in adulthood but that we can all access neuroplasticity but it it takes it's there so I don't know they should give merenik and Nobel too but you know I'm not on the committee so um just a little editorial there the description of specific cognitive trainings that can improve working memory in people that have had traumatic brain injury or concussion as well as our earlier discussion about the development of frontal Lo function and plasticity of frontal L function makes me wonder is the working memory circuitry and frontal loob function a use it or lose it kind of circuit meaning if somebody you know goes to high school graduates high school and then gets into a lifestyle or college and then graduates College as well and then gets into a lifestyle where they're not reading very many books they're definitely scrolling social media they're carrying out their daily tasks with you know apparently uh High degree of functionality um but they're not really pushing these forbrain circuits do we imagine that some of those forbrain circuits regress um AKA use it or lose it um seems to me that a few years back maybe 10 15 years back there was a lot of interest in you know how to maintain cognitive function in fact one of the most common questions I would get even as a neuroscientist primarily focused on the visual and autonomic nervous system was how do I keep my memory as I age it seems to me that training it up and then continuing to use those circuits is would be a really good way reading books without forcing oneself to finish the chapter even though distractions jump into one's head things like that um for me it's when I go to the gym I not to bring my phone and if I do I'll listen to one album of music but I won't allow myself to play on my phone I try I mean not interrupting a conversation with text messaging I mean basically the the landscape I'm trying to uh draw here is seems like the world is designed to to disrupt that the modern world is designed to disrupt working memory and cognition of the frontal loes right right and we need to do some real training just like muscles and atrophy and cardiac Fitness atrophies if we're not doing ready uh you know resistance and cardiovascular training is that set yeah I think that's fair I think you know of all the systems uh that decline with aging not every brain system declines but certainly the frontal executive system we're talking about is one that takes more of a decline than others that's just how it is with with healthy aging um not surprising it's it's the most complicated system and it's probably the most biologically costly and so you know the more complicated system is going to uh take more of a hit than than other systems and so certainly um I don't know about regressing but certainly we're not we maybe accelerating this this this uh decline that we know exist and but a way I would think about it though is is that not just um trying to prevent the decline but what we talked about before there's no reason not to optimize I mean if if everything is couched and I don't want to get dementia and don't want to get Alzheimer's disease and I don't want to get this and that I think that's not the way we should be looking about it we want to look about op optimizing health and and uh brain health and and and getting up to our optimal levels um because otherwise we're always playing defense instead of playing playing offense and that's really hard for neurologists we we have a hard time thinking about brain health even though we're the brain Specialists we think about brain disease and we're just now as a field start thinking about preventative neurology which seems and and thinking about it not just like stopping Alzheimer's disease but uh promoting healthy Health in a healthy brain just you know neurologists don't talk to patients about or healthy patients about being healthier I love how candid you are about the medical profession um and I like to think it's changing I don't know something happened in the in the 2020 2021 um era I I feel is just my my bias but I feel that the general public started becoming more aware of the things they might do to support their mental and physical health maybe they had more more time on their hands but I think there was just more foraging for information um I love the idea that through simple practices like forcing oneself to read a book chapter start to finish without looking at one's phone um even if it takes twice as long as one would like um redirecting one's focus when what Focus moves away is it's a way of keeping working memory and cognitive function online maybe even strengthening it as you said optimizing it um you know I think that there so much emphasis now on physical health which I think is great sleep thanks to Matt Walker you know you really you know brought that torch in on sleep um and now others like myself are are really you know trying to amplify the message of the critical role of sleep but also you know most people realize they should probably at least walk um as you know the 10,000 steps thing is not a bad idea um getting some heart rate up a few times a week or more maybe doing some resistance training a few times a week or more and then and not just for athletes but for elderly folks men and women you know um I feel like we need the same for cognition for me for uh brain function and there just isn't a structure to that no one can say right now you know you need to do uh three chapters of reading you know fiction per week or uh you got to read a you got to learn a few new vocabulary words and then write sentences with them they do it in school but then we're just you know set into the general population and right and most people I think regress right yeah I mean I I think the big problem uh with brain health is is trying to have a measure of what brain health is and it's interesting to me again as a physician um thinking about it from a neurologist standpoint um when you go to your family doctor your primary care physician every year from your yearly physical uh they examine every organ in your body except your brain your lung your heart you know your skull system your skin but what what do they do for you you know outside of having a conversation with you no cognitive task there's nothing no working memory task they don't measure your your brain at all and it's not their fault there we haven't provideed the field do not provided them with a test of of of brain health right and so part of the problem is we don't have a measurement of brain health I'm involved and something called the brain health project which is at UT Dallas um which is their goal is a study to enroll 100,000 people in uh and they've been developing a brain health index and that's a complicated thing to do but I I really believe they're on to something because it's not just cognition it's cognition it's it's social it's it's lifestyle like sleep and and it's it's um well-being you the brain a brain health index is going to cover all of these aspects so they've developed quite a interesting uh important index which which can um which does try to capture all aspects of brain health and then can be used to track uh where you can track your brain health over time with interventions that they've they've developed so we we need something like we need to First once we develop a brain health index that's that then then we have something to to follow and to and to be able to measure if if if we are optimizing our brain health otherwise how do you know if you're you're optimizing your your brain health you don't your doctor's not telling you you don't know um all these games you get on in the web don't really tell you um so when we develop that uh then all of the things that can promote brain health will be measurable and I think it will take off the way physical fitness did perhaps you get enough of it from your work but given what you know about brain health and approaches to brain health what are some of the things that you do besides sleep exercise nutrition um in terms of um trying to optimize brain function I mean do you make it a point to read fiction do you make it a point to learn new new skills like instruments things like that again maybe your profession and your and your personal life keeps you busy enough that you don't have to do those things I mean for me I uh Gathering organizing and disseminating the information for the podcast feels like the the the the heavy lifting mental work for me but but I'm keenly aware of the fact that we're I to read more fiction or um learn an instrument uh I mean everyone else around me would suffer if I learned an instrument but um that it would probably benefit me in some real way what are the things that you do or and that you um you think are kind of access points that hopefully people also enjoy yeah no I I I agree with that I I think when you have a a busy career and you're doing many different things like teaching and research and seeing patience I've always felt that I I'm maxing out on on on full my executive function is being tested to the Limit but you're like an ath you're like a professional athlete of the mind yeah in a way way but then then you realize there's that that's that's not you know that's not everything there there's so many other aspects uh everything emanates from the brain so you start to think about what should I be doing in my my life as as a a father and a husband what what what should I be doing you know in terms of promoting social interactions with friends and and uh what should I be doing for sleep and health uh sleep and nutrition um and it's fun you bring up books I I think you know I went probably 20 years where I never read any non you know any fictional book and said this this can't be good for for my brain and then just consciously started you know reading uh reading um books and reading his and more non-fiction books and just listening to books or reading I still like to read the hard hard covers you know likewise unfortunately when I was a undergraduate you know with Premed they don't let you take any courses that are interesting so I never learned any history or or you know all the books that I never read I started reading my kids you know English literature books that I never got a chance to and started reading history and so yeah I always felt just like just increasing you know just knowledge was was another you know like I said our brain just stores information that's one of its his jobs so that that's got to be useful but but again um all of these things that I do believe help brain health we need we need some way to me measure it I think um certainly if you feel healthy that's an important thing if you feel like you're healthy physically or mentally that's that's good that's a good start but if we actually have a way to sort of track it the way we can track you know heart disease and lung disease and skin and things like that I think that would really boost everyone's confidence that this is really making a making a difference on the basis of today's conversation I'm going to read some fiction uh I read a lot of non-fiction um and I enjoy it I listen to some Audi books but I I just it's crazy to me because I'm a neuroscientist by training and I understand neuroplasticity and I do know a bit about Fitness and the key role of remaining active kind of use it or lose it and maybe improve it right kind of that wasn't intended to rhyme folks um kind of behaviors but clearly based on everything you've told us that if we don't exercise these working memory and other Co circuits for cognition like why should they stick around and I and I'm beginning to think that social media as entertaining as it is and I I learn there and I teach there but that it's not a cohesive um plot right it's like those baby otters that really cool looking dog that I'd love to own I'm thinking about getting another dog um this interesting conference you know it's it's like random pseudo random tailored to me of course because that's what their algorithms do but but that's not following a plot character development um antagonist protagonist um uh any of the the like things that provide like cognitive richness um it's kind of obvious as I as I say this but I feel like we're divorced from these things that really helped evolve culture and evolved individuals and and it takes some discipline but like a run or going to the gym you do it a few times for shorter amount of time with less intensity and pretty soon you're up to speed and there's an upper threshold unless you're going to be a pro I'm not I'm certainly not going to be an English Lit you know Professor you know so I don't think uh obviously boosting executive function is incredibly important but I don't think it's going to happen just with technology I think it's going to need it needs human interaction I mean I I believe executive fun should be taught in you know school as one of the cour you know as as a course um uh this school management theor that I talk about could be taught in school it's what you do with your students for example when you have a graduate student um and they have to learn how to read the literature and design experiment and Carry Out The Experiment uh there's no techn ology that's going to just be able to teach them how to do that you've got to intervene sometimes and say stop reading all those papers they're not relevant okay or you know you're you you piloted this enough get going it's it's that kind of wisdom that that that you get when you get older that that that that allows that has to be uh has to be on top of the the technology so that's why I think um we also need to it needs to be directed so whether it's in school or whether it's in a patient I think there's still needs to be someone coaching us you know and I know that's why life coaches have have been some people really benefited from life coaches because someone just it sounds obvious when you tell your kids you know just write you know just just do it this way you know break it up into little pieces it seems so obvious but to them it's not always obvious and they just need to be told something simple for it to make a big difference and in school we were we were brought along step by step and there was context so why wouldn't it be the same in adulthood um I'm realizing I should probably learn how to play chess yeah seems like a good game right CH chess yeah any any one of the working memory you got to keep information online there there's a bunch else there um I think uh but as a tool to improve cognition um I was also thinking you know some people Orient more towards the Arts my sister is really great about um she's a therapist in San Francisco but also um takes like theater classes and she said you know like improv is like forces you to like keep on your toes keep the context there you're up on your feet like you know and I I wasn't a theater kid I did the crew I did like the pulling the curtains and stuff till I went and did other things but but but that whole Biz is about um being you know learning the novel rule set in the moment you know it's improv by definition absolutely I mean anything that requires you to have that you know where there's a goal and you've got to break it down to sub goals and you've got to do it simultaneously and you got to filter out the extractions and you know you know for example my my kids got me one of these pizza ovens for for uh Christmas and you know how you you think it's easy you just sort of make some pizza and throw it in the oven and done that's we're I'm on my third time and it's still not even round I'll come over and test that sounds good that sounds good um and and you're in a city with great food so the standard is really high um tempted to make a reference to the cheeseboard pizza but I want to keep the lines as short as possible cuz they're already too long um maybe we could talk a little bit about some other unfortunately common disease States um Parkinson's and Alzheimer's let's start with Alzheimer's I think um few few things um uh scare people more than the idea of getting Alzheimer's especially if they have Alzheimer's in their family first of all what is the genetic link with Alzheimer's if one has a parent or grandparent that got Alzheimer's is there a known um increase in in their one's risk for getting Alzheimer's it's not that straightforward as other diseases there's diseases like hunting's disease where it's a very strong link that if you have uh a parent you have a very high chance of getting it but there's so many factors that uh it's not necessarily case that you're you're increased your risk of getting it there are families where there is something special about the family where it just runs in families but uh I try to to um not scare my P patients children into worrying that that they're necessarily going to get Alzheimer's because it's not that straightforward as I understand Alzheimer's is a a nerd gener disorder um impacts the hippocampus among other structures there's been some debate in recent years as to whether or not the whole amalo hypothesis is real or not there's a bunch of unfortunately false data accusations and that whole thing but my understanding is that if you look at us slice of human brain from an alz a patient that died with Alzheimer's maybe even from Alzheimer that you see plaques and Tangles you see these um subcellar structures and buildup and that our basic understanding of Alzheimer's that's in the textbook and that most people have heard of um is still correct right yes okay because I think a couple years ago it was you know unfortunately the way social media sometimes can work is that you know the idea was that it was was all wrong you know all wrong and indeed somebody somebody fudged data they made up data and that's terrible um but Alzheimer's is a neurogenerative disorder includes the hippocampus plaqu and Tangles are present in the neurons those are not good for neurons as I understand so what's the controversy like and and why don't we have a treatment for Alzheimer's yet I feel like almost every other psychiatric disease including Parkinson like there there are certain things you can do to at least push the system in the right way why is Alzheimer's and other dementia is so tricky yeah I mean it's very frustrating because the neur degenerator it's just it's so uh so many factors that are probably involved in the path pathology that there's not one you know one single um transmitter the Parkinson's disease it's a decreased doope mean and so one transmitter can make a very big difference um early on an Alzheimers it was discovered that there was low AEL choline in in the brains and the only approved uh treatment for Alzheimer's disease is a drug that boosts Asal Coline what's the drug right it's called deasil there there's a few of them they're anticolon estras Inhibitors that boost Asal choline they've been around for 20 years or more and you know the reality is when you give it to your patients they don't see much of of a difference because it's it's not the primary deficit so the real problem has been trying to find out what is the primary mechanism that's leading to this the the wide range of cognitive behavioral issues and and and there doesn't seem to be at least one neurotransmitter that can make the difference and so now the push has been is there one is there something else that we can do can we can we block amalo can we block something in the pathology and again it just has not been successful it it's very frustrating because I think it was over probably 35 years ago I saw my first Alzheimer's patients and I don't believe I save that much different to them now you know except that we have a lot more things we can do just on the social side of things but unfortunately for drugs we don't have anything that's been really transformative um but again that that's I I think part of a and being an neurologist it sounds very depressing but I think part of the F what the family isn't always looking for a cure of course that's they'd like to have a cure but I think them understanding what's going on what to expect how to handle the behaviors is what they're really after at least until we find you know a cure Parkinson's you mentioned is a deficit in dopaminergic function do largely to uh degeneration of dopaminergic neurons there there's some some effective treatments right lopa um did you know there's this over-the-counter stuff that's sold that a lot of people take who don't have Parkinson's I'm not suggesting they take it um called Muna purines it's the velvety Bean yeah I've heard of it it's 99% elopa over yeah it's in present in like some energy drinks and supplements I people can go buy it I'm not suggesting they do that I actually tried it um boy feel being really dopamin out does not to me doesn't feel that good yeah I felt kind of agitated my vision got a little you know twinkly it did not feel like a high of any kind and then I felt lousy for a couple hours after it wore off yeah I don't think you can really get in enough elopa to get enough into your brain that that happened early in neurology when it was discovered we couldn't give our patients enough elopa without them feeling bad because it's also um metabolized in the peripheral and so it wasn't until we cinet came along which is has this debox decarbox inhib that blocks sort of the the the breakdown of doine that we were able to sort of get enough dopamine into the brain so I'm not sure yeah so that's why I think um it's not going to probably get the levels up high enough in in the brain so Parkin's patients are given lopa um or bromocryptine or drugs like that going back to alzheimer's for a moment I mean what do you tell it somebody who has early stage of Alzheimer's you just say listen try and get good sleep try and keep people around you stay cognitively engaged try and keep those circuits going through behavioral induced neuroplasticity but we're just going to watch the the the um steepness of the decline is that really is that really all we've got all we've got is to yeah is to help them uh with everything that comes up on a day-to-day basis a a lot of the problems um the memory problems tend to be something that uh families can help compensate for but but you do get to a point where you can't be with someone for 247 it's it's a real burnout for for caregivers a lot of the behaviors that come up uh patients get kind of delusions and agitated and and some of the uh medications that we use for uh other conditions uh are helpful for for treating that but it's really just a purely symptomatic therapy and the more socialization that patients get the tend they tend to do better there was a study back at pen way back that if you showed patients um family movies or family albums it was a real it was better than any drug you could give them to sort of help their behavior so there's still those memories are in there and they were making some type of contact that was was helping them emotionally that you couldn't turn off with with a drug so I think the more we do things like that the the more we'll be helpful for them at least in a you know symptomatically you I've seen a number of videos and on social media people with Alzheimer's who listen to a piece of music or people with Parkinson's that hear a piece of music and that seems to uh resurrect some at least emot context appropriate emotional state where he kind of brings the person to the to the surface um again um yeah it's a kind of a tragic situation for Alzheimer's right now it seems like if ever there was a call to arms for the neurology community and um biotech and behavioral Tech would be for for for Alzheimer's for the treatment of Alzheimer's yeah absolutely I will never ask a guest to um comment on the the the good or bad behaviors of other people except my own um but uh there's a Nobel prize winning neuroscientist and I visited him um he's at a big East Coast School uh back in 2010 and during the course of our one-hour meeting he consumed no fewer than four pieces of Nicorette gum and I said I got to ask what's this about by the way he's extremely sharp still um and he said oh yeah yeah yeah you know I used to be a smoker but smoking is really bad for you because you can get lung cancer dipping is bad for you because you can get mouth cancer but nicotine these are his words by the way is protective against Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and it keeps my brain sharp so I chew Nicorette all day long and I thought okay well he's not he is an MD actually um and I thought that's interesting and I did an episode of this podcast on nicotine it by the way can raise blood pressure it's certainly smoking vaping dipping or snuffing not good bad don't do it but there is some interest in the use of nicotine as a cognitive enhancer so I'd love to know your thoughts on that um and I'd love to know your thoughts on his statement about nicotine being um a potential way to Stave off Parkinson's and Alzheimer's with the caveat that he just kind of threw that out there and this guy's sort of known for just kind of throwing stuff out there every once in a while I have a feeling you know who this person is but um in any event what gives yeah well I don't know anything about nicotine staving off any neurogenerative disorder um but nicotine was used uh and was used in a number of early Alzheimer's studies just because of its effect on Co the coleric uh system so there is some truth to that uh the col energic system is is imp you know dysfunctional and Alzheimer's disease and and boosting the colon energic system probably is beneficial I mean patients that we give the Anolon necessories Inhibitors there are some families that say yeah he just he's he's remembering more and he's just doing better so they're there I've seen positive um things to it uh it doesn't really slow the course of the disease that's the problem the disease just carries on even though we're symptomatically improving the symptoms but again I think it's going to take both asine and something else I think we don't know should we give dopamine with the with the nicotine or the esal Coline or should we Nan nephrine I think it's going to be a cocktail which which again pharmaceutical companies you know have not tried a cocktail of neuromodulators for Alzheimer disee they've just tried Aline sounds like you should be running the FDA no disrespect to the current um people in charge by the way but maybe actually I'm I'm a um big believer that there shouldn't be individuals in charge of large organizations there should be panels I mean there's so much talk about diversity but they appoint individuals you can't get it right anytime there's when there's only one person by definition so right committees folks committees um anyway another editorial are there any sex differences male female differences in um sort of uh these dopamine levels working memory um injuries concussion like things that would Direct people toward different routes of treatment um given that you know maybe there's more susceptibility in one case maybe less susceptibility maybe certain neurotransmitters are more effective in um improving symptoms in in men versus women do you see that in the clinic yeah that's a great question um there was Emily Jacobs who's a professor at UC Santa Barbara now in the psychology department when she was a graduate student in my lab studied the role of estrogen on working and Dober nergic function and what she brought to my attention at the time and it was embarrassing that I didn't know was that there's the frontal loes are full of estrogen receptors there's probably more estrogen receptors in the fontal loes than any other part of the brain in men and women estrogen boost is dop me so you higher estrogen levels correlates with with increased dop me uh levels and and there were some anecdotal evidence that in post manop pasal woman women who were put on estrogen that they're working memory improved and there was a kind of evolving link between estrogen and frontal low function and she did this amazing study where she studied healthy uh Berkeley undergraduates at two points in time during the mental cycle when EST was at his lowest and what was his highest and she also um gentite them for this enzyme they we were talking about to know if they were sort of lower or higher on the dopamine level and then put them in the scanner and measured frontal function and and showed that there was a clear frontal low function was modulated by where they were in their estrogen cycle when they were low estrogen they were low dopamine and if they were low estrogen and low dopamine to start they were really had decreased frontal low function and decreased working memory ability so it it fluctuated uh based on this interaction between estrogen and dopamine suggesting that you know not only is dopamine is important but hormones are are clearly important and they they work synergistically so you know as we're develop in this this cocktail um we certainly have to bring hormones into the equation and learn more about it there's just so little information about um hormones and cognition yeah one of the themes that's come out of some of the episodes we've done with MDS who specialize in endocrine health is that for both men and for women um optimizing estrogen levels is really important for cognition and vascular function I think people mistakenly here okay testosterone men you know estrogen women obviously both hormones are present in men and women in fact I think um I know that testosterone levels in women are actually higher than their estrogen levels when you look when you sort of um uh use the same units of measure uh it just so happens that they still have lower testosterone on average than the typical male but that men whose estrogen levels are too low suffer cognitive defects and Vascular defects so this idea that more testosterone lower estrogen in men is is the is the ideal right and um uh it just doesn't hold it doesn't hold I mean unless you want to be dumb and have a heart attack it just doesn't it just doesn't hold um very interesting do we know what estrogen's doing there is it it's it's specifically raising dopamine um we don't have to get into the synaptic biology but so interesting yeah it's actually boosting dopamine activity so it's making more dopamine available yeah yeah it's it's really um amazing and and um and to think about it sort of fluctuating um certainly during the menal cycle we can think about how much it fluctuates an IND woman over 30 days but then you can think across individuals you can think about how how much it can account for individual differences so not only sort of knowing your dop me level but just knowing svest and uh C is really going to be important interesting is there any evidence that physical exercise can improve working memory and cognition separate from the known improvements in cardiovascular function and blood flow to the brain that occur with exercise like is there anything about going for you know a 45 minute bout of exercise you know pick your favorite exercise and then doing cognitive work immediately afterward when presumably the catacol mees dopamine or epinephrine and nephrine are going to be circulating at least in the blood at higher levels is is there has that stuff ever been explored in all of the groups around the country that are trying to develop cognitive therapies they they often use aerobic exercise as as as another type of therapy and and so for example the group at University Illinois uh champagne AR Kramer group has done aerobic exercise quite a bit and they can find it just as effective as cognitive therapy and improving executive function just straight up wow aerobic exercise wow and um and so you know the hard part in the real world is is how do you get you know a seven eighty old you know to do the kind of aerobics but but now with you know recumbent bicycles and now there has been studies with 7 year olds with just putting them in mostly with overcoming bicycles is sort of Designing we have to think about ways to design exercise that can get aerobics up but it's it's uh and you know neurologists are start I think you know my field is starting to realize that there's there's we got to tackle this at all all every way we can and so now I'm hearing you know you hear more neurologists talk about that you know 30 years ago no no neurologist would say you got to exercise more you know or just now it's sort talking about exercise and nutrition and sleep and and uh you know it's all becoming sort of part of our package of how we're going to help our patients but the arobic exercise is is super is super interesting and and I think it's going to be you know that that kind of made me think that um what we didn't talk about was mindfulness and so when we add a lot of these studies also if they add mindfulness train training to the hardcore goal Management training it's it's better than than just the the the executive training alone just learning skills to stop relax refocus kind of gives this sort of boost uh to Executive function as well yeah I think of mindfulness likea sort of well there's no such thing as traditional meditation I have to be careful here but but the the sort of stereotypical meditation of closing one eyes closing one's eyes excuse me sitting down lying down and and just focusing on one's breath and then redirecting one's Focus to maybe Third Eye Center you know area between the forehead just redirecting Focus redirecting I think of meditation of that sort as a focus exercise right it's it's not so much a perceptual exercise because thoughts are kind of you know doing what they're doing um it's like Focus exercise and that's half of the problem with not achieving our goals right is we we lose our focus and so building into sort of strategies to to main focus Focus uh you know to stop and relax and refocus is is an important strategy for boosting executive function so and that uh and it doesn't seem to matter what you know I know there's all different flavors of mindfulness so we just happen to use one when we were studying it it doesn't yet I don't think we know enough about how we should tellor the mindfulness but most forms of mindfulness will work of of the type you're talking about that's similar what I described as similar to what you just explored exactly I mean amazing to me you know 20 years ago if somebody wanted to talk about neuroscience and mindfulness yeah on a major University campus let's say Stanford or uh Berkeley was probably a little bit more tolerant of these ideas at that time just given the the kind of culture um they wouldn't have been laughed out of the room but but there was a lot of skepticism and I feel like now mindfulness meditation breath work the idea that oh my goodness breathing can impact your emotional state yeah I mean that should have been obvious but now that people are on then now of course there's a lot of interest in psychedelics that's kind of a new emerging therapy carrying more risk potential risk but it looks like it's very likely that some of those are going to make it through the the FDA filters at some point but the conversation we're having now you know neurologist and neurobiologist talking about mindfulness nutrition we're talking freely about nicotine you know we're not suggesting people do that bromocryptine as it to optimize cognitive function I mean this conversation would have never happened um seven years ago no it's just the field has changed yeah neur I he neurologist talk about it all the time do so do you try mindfulness and if you do does it make your day do you feel like you perform better that day yeah thanks for asking there two forms of yes the short answer is yes um I there's a very specific practice that I've used since 2017 that's really benefited me so much which is um I call it non-sleep deep rest but it's based on a practice called yoga Nidra where you just liee down and it's uh these are free audio scripts online we can provide links to these um and you go through a body scan and you do some long exhale breathing which emphasizes the parasympathetic AK relaxing aspect of the autonomic nervous system I know you know this I'm saying that for the audience um and it does involve some intentions and things like that but it can also just be um self-directed relaxation and I emerg from that with much more mental and physical Vigor than I did prior and this only takes maybe 10 minutes there's also a 30 minute script I do those and then I do uh mindfulness meditation the thing about mindfulness meditation that the biggest impact for me has been the problems of My Life um get re um I get a different perspective I start thinking about things in different domains of time like this thing that is like a problem that I've been dealing with for instance um I start to think you know like in the course of my lifetime this is you know a relatively small not small thing but in relatively small time bin and I sort of think about you know best course of action given its real role in my life and what I want Etc so I feel like it sort of orients me in time um so that's been a major effect for Focus the best tool I know is to you know put the phone in another room right that's kind of a don't um and I know our friend Eddie Chang neurosurgeon chair of neurosurgery at UCSF he's big on on mindfulness meditation do so do you meditate no I think that's one of the things we're talking about what should we do besides reading fiction I think that's that should be on my list because because I no because it's just amazing that I that the patients tell me about it and what we've seen from our our studies um you know a lot of this like again I was saying before is is if we had some measure of uh you know brain health that we could see the impact of it would sort of push us towards towards you know probably doing it more I think another thing that we didn't sort of talk we talked a little about with dopamine is are there other kind of brain states that sort of uh you know predict you know you know how you're going to respond to these therapies and and how if if you're going to benefit from them and and uh you know we've we've done a lot of work with sort of measuring sort of the large scale organization of the brain and brain networks and that's sort of very popular idea in in Neuroscience today sort of moving away from sort of what is this we've talked a lot about what the prontal loes do but the frontal loes are part of these networks in the brain and and um really sort of your this state of your networks is really important factor as well in in addition to sort of your your do you sort of neurom module you sort of neurochemical profile yeah tell me more about this I mean um you actually uh preempted my next question which was going to be and this is my favorite question to ask Carl diero taught me to ask this way back when like what are you most excited about now because I know the work you've published and and we and you've done a magnificent job of of sharing the details of that and and work of others um in a really informative and in some cases actionable way but what are you what are you really excited about like like if if there were no Financial barriers to your grants Etc you had a thousand people working what what what's the what's the thing that's hitting your dopamine circuits these days yeah well in the grand scale I'm excited that things that we've learned over the last 30 years not just in my lab or your lab or anyone's lab is actually now being translated to actually helping people I mean when people ask me what I do I say I'm a neurologist because that's at my core what I feel I am and I feel I got into this business to to to help people and so it's it's when you when you work for years and years and years and and it doesn't translate it it it's can be frustrating but but now I'm excited that I it seems that the things we've learned that all of us have learned in neuros science is starting to now translate into some into something and in Neuroscience what's sort of what's happened the last 10 years is we' we're thinking of the brain and in kind of grander scale is sort of it's overall organization not so focused on just this area or that area um when I when I talk about the frontal loes as being the most important part the the you know the uh conductor yes I I I am talking about one brain region but it it's a brain region like I said that's connected to everywhere and it's because it's connected to everywhere is what's really um the essence of why it's it's so important so uh some of the research I'm excited most about sort of taking away the names of areas and just thinking about the brain as a as a a big Network like like an airline Network or or electrical Network and how how different areas communicate with each other and when you think of it that way so for example an airline network uh you've got all these hubs all over the world all over the country in the United States for example you've got Chicago is is is a hub and and there's other Hub Milwaukee or Cincinnati but they have very different functions in the network as a whole right if if you're trying to get from uh New York to San Francisco which happened to me many times even though you're not going through Chicago if Chicago is shut down you're probably going to get delayed because it just has this huge impact on the whole system and you know if Milwaukee goes down you don't even know it you just fly right over the I'm sorry if anyone's listening from there are probably a few you kind of go through but but so thinking about the brain the brain is the same way the brain has these hubs as well and and you know the prefrontal cortex is is a hub like Chicago it's just an important Hub that keeps the whole system uh going and that's why it has much more of an impact when you when you when you damage it or you stress it as opposed to some other part of the brain and so what's exciting to me is not only is that making us thinking about disease differently because now we're starting to think about how is diseases affecting these hubs that the pathology seems to be like when you look at Alzheimer's disease and you look at schizophrenia and you look at a lot of diseases it's not just that there some microscopic change in some neuron it seems to be affecting hubs in the brain that are affecting the whole network and so we have a different Target to go after for treatments what what can we do to sort of boost you know a hub that's been damaged as opposed to thinking about it in a in a less specific way and then also as we've as we' really start to learn about how the the brain is organized in these networks we've also learned that measuring uh your network structure is very predictive of of of your well-being and how you respond to interventions so there's a metric called modularity which measures um how organized your brain networks are and the brain is made up of different modules uh different networks and these networks can either be very communicating with each other or not so communic communicating with each other and and the more segregated they are we call that more modularity they're kind of separate entities they're they modular and it turns out we can measure that with fmri we can put someone in a scanner we can do this resting uh fmri scanning and then we can measure how modular your brain is versus my brain and all of us are very different levels of modularity is it more advantageous to have more modularity as opposed to less yeah it turns out that it seems to be more avation have more so we can predict more separateness of brain of function between areas yeah that the networks are sort of more independent that doesn't mean they don't talk to each other but at at at sort of Baseline they're more independent resting state connectivity yeah they're they're more they're more independent as opposed to uh less independent with each other not unlike uh neuromuscular Junctions during development are what we call poly enervated uh that's why babies can move their limbs but not with a lot of coordination look at a one-year-old trying to eat spaghetti for instance it's hilarious look at that same kid 7 months later there's a lot more Precision to movement largely due to removal more modularity of con connections right right interesting so we we did a study where we took 12 traumatic brain injury patients and measured the modularity so you get a a number you know you just get a modularity index for each of the 12 people and then they underwent this goal Management training and we were able to predict who was going to improve uh on the training that those who had more start started off more modular benefited more from the training and it's turned out that this has been a very robust finding across studies now across different training uh different young old patient populations it's also predicted things like um whether someone in a coma is more likely to do well or if someone who's older is going to have a certain amount of cognitive decline or someone's going to respond to behavioral therapy if they're obsessive compulsive so there's something about this brain St that not only we can measure but actually is giving us insight into the interventions that we're doing which again is going to be much more helpful in determining what helps and what doesn't help if we know uh we know sort of what the state is before we start the intervention so interesting and um makes me think many things but um I'll just focus on two of them one is I love this idea that you and others are starting to look at brain network activity as opposed to overemphasizing the role of say prefrontal cortex or hippocampus understanding more that those are hubs in a larger theme of um of activation because you know if I had one wish for science communication it's that people would yes learn some terms like dopamine and frontal loes it is important to know the nomenclature but to understand that if you really want to be able to work with the information in a way that's beneficial you need to think about verbs not nouns right it's about the action states of these areas at those action states are always um involving multiple areas just like you can't talk about running as just like quadricep and hamstring flexion and extension you know and contraction it's just it just you can you can break it down that way and it's useful to know that but ultimately you're talking about gate and stride and things that that have a real verb action to them and we haven't had so much of that for the nervous system at a at a circuit level we've been able to do that for individual neurons that's the first piece and then um the second piece is that you know it occurs to me that there's so much Rich understanding of the different states of sleep you know Matt Walker was just here recording this series on sleep that we'll release later this year and you stages one two three four deep sleep slow wave sleep rapid eye movement sleep but we don't even really have a naming um system for waking States like we say Focus we say task switching but those are um just names we made up uh just as stage 1 two 3 and REM sleep are names that we made up but there seems to be a much richer understanding of like what rapid eye movement sleep is good for and what deficits in rapid eye movement sleep lead to then there is for instance how uh given I Network G I'm going to make this up like calling a certain Network activation State like State a like we we the I feel like Neuroscience is tasked the field of Neuroscience now is tasked with with giving us understanding of the verb States and like what like these waking states of Mind are very mysterious and and for the general public this is important because people wonder like is my focus poor or is it is it good is my Tas switching ability good I mean we only tend to look at you know are they functional enough to do their job and manage their family manage their lives we don't really have metrics but for sleep we have metrics and Commercial products can measure that you know sleep tracker Rings wristbands mattress covers that I mean this sort of thing well you know yeah I I think modularity can actually be that metric some Metric of of your large scale organization of your of your brain can be that metric we we've there's a number of labs that have done this have measured modularity in real time so what I was talking about were just getting a snapshot of this is what your Baseline modularity is but we can also look at modularity how it changes on a second to second to minute to minute basis and um one of my forign post SE she just did a very simple experiment where there were nois there were sounds and the the functional my scan is very loud so you you can't hear very well but every once in a while there'd be a sound that was just above the this the level of the noise of the of the scanner and all you had to do was sort of uh you know press a button if you heard that sound and you didn't pick it up all the time you know you maybe 80% of the time you heard and sometimes 20% of the times you didn't hear it well she measured their modularity on a momentto moment basis and she could predict if they were going to get that if they were going to be correct or not and wre and and wreck the sound before they they got the sound if they were highly modular boom they they they got it if their brain had gone into this kind of you know diffuse less mod State they they missed it and so I could definitely see as you're talking about where if we could develop a modularity metric in real time on a device uh this would be GameChanger and so and that's sort of what I'm you know what I've been interested in do what's excites me is that we're not going to do with a SC obviously you can't walk around with a scanner in your head right and and even I don't think you could even do with the EG I think can we develop a proxy for modularity with some more simple way of doing it can we extract this maybe out of heart rate variability or for oxygen um I've been I've been working uh with uh some colleagues the a former student uh uh Brian Miller and postdoc of Adam gazali's West clap who have a company called Nur scouting where they are able to um they have we've been sort of doing scanning and also collecting physiological data to to try and determine if there's some Pro we can measure the modular and the scanner but can we pick that up in the in the physiology data because they can collect you know oxygen and heart rate variability and and other metrics that may be kind of a readout of that and then then we'd have a brain state which is what you were looking you know you're looking for some brain state but it's not I think people are thinking we're we need a helmet or something like that we need just something simple right that reads out brain State just the way we read out other physiological uh information from our our watch or or something like that well the Sleep trackers of various kinds have certainly been able to pull out information about rapid eye movement and other stages of sleep I mean key metrics not every metric not what you would get with person wearing a EEG uh you know probe or something you know set of probes but C information that can be used um one thing that has me a little bit perplexed um and uh I'm almost reluctant to bring it up but I'm going to do it um is that I did a couple episodes about psilocybin and the use of um Sil cybin for the um treatment of depression this is Robin cardart Harris from UCSF and I also did a solo episode emphasizing of course this isn't recreational use we're talking about we're talking about for treatment of depression but there there's a lot of neuroimaging about um of patients before and after U macro do cocy and this isn't micro doing and one of the major takeaways is um increased resting state connectivity which by virtue of what you just described might not be ideal for cognitive function it might be good for um social emotional function and I'm certainly don't want to disparage the beautiful work that's being done there but you said that increased modularity predicted improved function especially with cognitive interventions uh Sil cybin seems to uh induce fairly significant Inc increases in crossmodal talk between brain networks in other words less modularity so um should we be concerned no it's just it has to do with how we uh make these measurements and and connectivity doesn't mean the same you know there's different types of connectivity um and so I like to when I think about connectivity we talked about this connectivity of of a brain State and versus a brain trait so when we're talking about you being highly modular as a trait uh that's very different than what your modularity is like in different states it it actually turns out you do when you do these highly executive demanding tasks you get less mod you get less modular because you have your networks are communicating with each other so it's important to be for networks to get less modular when it's a more demanding task but that's very different than than whether what's your you know what's your Baseline modularity I see because it's you got to get from your your you know where your Baseline is to this other state and a lot of it has to do is like going from one state to another not not so much sort of the absolute sort of differences so that's that's interesting I didn't know about those results but it's interesting that uh that it does affect sort of connectivity in that way I think the drugs that are going to be helpful are going to are going to promote sort of networks talking to each other as opposed to networks not communicating with each other in your clinic do you ever combine drug therapies cognitive training and things like transcranial magnetic stimulation do you use stimulators yeah so I think um you know I have a lot of patients that I've referred for uh for its approved use which is depression so I'm very excited about sort of the the work that's being done with it as a as a for depression but we haven't really had any improved uh anything that's been for um you know for cognition so there there are bunch of studies anotal small studies where you can give trans simulation frontal cortex and working memory improved but they really haven't been done in ways that are we don't know if it generalizes if it's if it's going to be how you know the way it's been done in depression in a way that can really be but I but again it's just a matter of doing it I think it will be part of the things we do drugs TMS um and all the other things we've talked about it's not just going to be one one thing and and it gets back to networks right what this is doing is really changing how nodes you know the the interaction of regions it's not about sort of just increasing or decreasing activity in some mysterious part of the brain it's just sort of restoring the balance of a of a of a network well Mark I just really want to thank you you um you g given us an amazing tour of uh basically five Fields I threw a lot at you um you know as a neurologist but the way I'm I I'm slightly reluctant to do this but um I'm going to tell you a joke um that was told to me um uh so that there are these people stranded on an island and um they're they're really stuck and they're running out of resources and um by the way this joke was told to me by a physician and all of a sudden this hot air balloon and comes over and they're like my goodness so they start they write help in the sand and they you know and um hot air balloon directly over them kind descends almost you know almost to them and um and then someone in the hot air balloon says you know I'm doing the measurement and it's exactly 76 feet down to those people and then the hot air balloon takes off and goes away and the people on the beach one of them is a physician and he goes those were neurologists I tell that joke because that was the old school view of Neurology that um neurologists were great at describing things talking about the terrible conditions they could observe in great detail but that they uh did not do anything about it you on the other hand and I'm guessing others in the field but certainly you have proven today that you that joke needs to be revised whereby there's one at least one neurologist who casts a line down and and shimmies down in a assists them and and pulls uh those uh stranded uh people on on the island up to the uh the balloon because uh today you've described the the underlying nature of some of these things like working memory deficits traumatic brain injury concussion Alzheimer's Parkinson's again I threw a lot at you and you you responded with in in thorough clear detail but also a number of things that that clearly can assist in these in these um in these situations such as bromocryptine mindfulness exercise and uh and really as a as an exploration of of what can be done interventions and so um for all those reasons and for tolerating this terrible joke that I just told um I want to say thank you because um I've learned a ton and I know the audience has learned a ton and much of what we've learned has us um looking in the directions of of possibility to to alleviate these situations and and as you point out for the already healthy even to optimize brain function and health so for all of that thanks for uh sliding down the Rope to the to the island well I'd say you know on behalf of all the neurologist in the world thank you for appreciating what we do it's just it's just so important to try and get this message apart like I said you know with patients we just try to have them understand what what it is that they're going through and I think today patients have to really be advocates for themselves and so I think the more they learn about all of these possibilities the more they can go back to their their doctors or whoever and try and ask for you know what about this what about that is do you think this would help me because we have to be advocates for our own health and and the only way we're going to do that is just make people understand what it is that the possibilities are so thank you it was a lot lot of fun a great time well Amen to all of that and uh hope to have you back again thanks so much

Title: Oral Health Protocols
Published: 2024-02-13 22:01:07 UTC
Description:
Dubbed by ElevenLabs

The new Huberman Lab episode is all about oral health. It covers everything from brushing and flossing, as well as how to repair cavities without drilling (which depends on how deep they are into the tooth, of course), as well as the oral microbiome, which is critical for whole body health, gum health, the legitimate concerns of being a mouth breather, especially during sleep, and much more.

Researching this episode has led me to significantly revamp my oral health protocols. The good news is all of them are easy, take a limited amount of time, and are either zero cost or will save you costs.

Many of the suggested protocols from experts are counterintuitive. The field of oral health has undergone significant strides in recent years, and the episode reflects the latest.

Transcript Language: English
Let's talk about oral health. Most all, not all, but most, all mouthwashes, especially those containing alcohol, are terrible for oral health. No specific food, not even sugar, causes cavities. Cavities are caused by bacteria that feed on sugar. The real big question with toothpaste is always, should I use a toothpaste that has fluoride, or avoid toothpastes that have fluoride? Some people, I remember this in college, would say, "Oh, you know, if you've got a, you know, "you've got a, like scratch, in the back of your throat, "you're getting sick, you know, you should drink." And that's what they said, "You should drink, it's going to kill that thing off." Well, guess what? It does the exact opposite. So xylitol is a very potent tool for improving oral health. So I strongly suggest that all of us take a look at what we are currently doing for our tooth and oral health, and consider what modifications are best for us.

Title: How to Improve Oral Health & Its Critical Role in Brain & Body Health
Published: 2024-02-12 13:00:54 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I discuss the importance of oral health for dental and microbiome health and general physical and mental well-being. I explain science-supported protocols for strengthening your teeth and gums, including how to remineralize your teeth. I cover the best approaches and timing for brushing and flossing, tongue, gum, and oral microbiome care and how oral health is critically important to offset metabolic, cardiac, and brain diseases, including dementia. I also discuss proper nutrition for oral health, fluoride, and how sugar and mouth breathing can accelerate tooth decay. This episode ought to be of interest to everyone seeking to improve their physical health, mental health, and lifespan, given the critical role that oral health plays in all of these.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today we are discussing oral health now when most people hear oral health they immediately think tooth health and appearance and presumably fresh breath or lack of bad breath as well and while of course two and breath freshness whiteness and health is a critical component of oral health today you will learn that oral health including the oral microbiome the health of your pallet your tonsils indeed the entire oral cavity is an extremely important component of General bodily health so much so that today we are going to add a seventh pillar to the so-called six pillars of mental health physical health and performance this is not a trivial step to add a seventh pillar to these six pillars if some of you have been listeners of this podcast for a while you may recall that the six pillars of mental health physical health and performance that is the six things that everyone needs to invest specific protocols into each day are in no particular order by the way sleep sunlight and light exposure generally which by extension also includes dark exposure nutrition exercise which we could also call movement both cardiovascular exercise and resistance training stress management and relationships and social engagement including relationship to self and today we are going to add oral health and microbiome health and I suppose we could generally call this oral and gut health because as you know if you think about it your mouth your oral cavity and your gut are contiguous with one another we are going to add oral and gut health as the seventh pillar of mental health physical health and performance because as you will learn today there are so many aspects of oral health and daily protocols for oral health that extend to cardiovascular health to metabolic health and indeed to brain health and to staving off diseases in all of those bodily compartments I cannot overemphasize enough how much oral health influences your general bodily health so today you will learn about Oral B biology and health we won't go tooo deep into the biology but we will go deep enough into the biology that you will learn some incredible things such as your teeth have the ability to literally fill back in cavities that have formed provided those cavities haven't gone too deep into the teeth layers yet you will learn that saliva While most people think of it as just spit is an incredible substance fluid that contains all sorts of interesting and important things that allow you to rebuild the strength of your teeth and indeed to support the health of your oral cavity and gut microbiome and body generally so saliva is super interesting and important and today you're going to learn many many protocols including zeroc cost protocols protocols that will actually save you money as well as some lowcost protocols to both restore improve and maintain oral health and in doing so maintain and improve your overall bodily Health before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is matina matina makes loose leaf and ready to drink yerba mate I often discuss ybba mate's benefits such as regulating blood sugar it's high antioxidant content the ways that it can improve digestion and possible Minal protective effects I also drink yamate because I love the taste while there are a lot of different choices of yamate drinks out there I love matina because again they have the no sugar variety as well as the fact that both their loose leaf and their canned varieties are of the absolute best quality so much so that I decided to become a partial owner in the company although I must say even if they hadn't allowed me to do that I would be drinking matina is the cleanest tasting and best yeram mate you can find I love the taste of brewed loose leaf matina yerbamate and I particularly love the taste of maa's new canned cold brew zero sugar yerbamate which I personally help them develop if you'd like to try matina go to drink maa.com huberman right now matina is offering a free one PB bag of loose leaf yerbamate tea and free shipping with the purchase of two cases of their cold brew yerbamate again that's drink maa.com huberman to get the free bag of y brate loose leaf tea and free shipping today's episode is also brought To Us by Roa Roa makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly under different conditions Roa understands this and designed all of their eyeglasses and sunglasses with the biology of the visual system in mind now Roa eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially developed for in sport and as a consequence you can wear them without them slipping off your face while running or cycling and they're extremely lightweight Roa eyeglasses and sunglasses are also designed with a new technology called float fit which I really like because it makes their eyeglasses and sunglasses fit perfectly and they don't move around even when I'm active so if I'm running and I'm wearing my glasses they stay on my face most of the time I don't even remember they're on my face because they're so lightweight you can also use them while cycling or for other activities so if you'd like to try Roa glasses go to Roa that's r r.com and enter the code huberman to save 20% off your first order again that's roka.com and enter the code huberman at checkout today's episode is also brought To Us by Helix sleep Helix sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are of the absolute highest quality I've spoken many times before on this and other podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is to make sure that your mattress matches your sleep requirements the Helix website has a brief two-minute quiz that if you go to it will ask you questions such as do you sleep on your back your side or your stomach do you tend to run hot or cold during the middle of the night as well as some other questions that allow you to determine the optimal mattress for you when I took the quiz I personally matched to their dusk mattress dsk which has allowed me to significantly improve my sleep so if you're interested in significantly improving your sleep go to helixsleep.com huberman take their brief two-minute quiz and they'll match you to a customized match mat and you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order and two free pillows so again if you're interested in trying Helix go to helixsleep.com huberman for up to $350 off and two free pillows okay let's talk about oral health this absolutely critical aspect of not just having fresh bright teeth and no cavities and fresh breath or at least lack of bad breath one would hope but also total body Health as I mentioned a little bit earlier oral health is inextricably linked to all aspects of brain and bodily Health both in the short term and in the long term and it is perhaps the most overlooked aspect of mental health and physical health so today I'd like to start off with a quiz I'm going to ask you which of the following three categories you believe you best fall into okay the first category is those of you out there who brush and floss every day probably twice a day and who make some effort to try and keep your teeth clean who like the feeling of your teeth being clean and who pay a fair amount of attention to whether or not your teeth are getting whiter or not getting whiter maybe whether or not your breath is fresh or not fresh maybe okay these aren't requirements for being in this category but maybe you're somebody who also uses a mouthwash or uses mints or gums in order to try and keep your mouth smelling and looking fresh and your mouth clean okay so this first category uh does not require that you do all of those things but let's just make a basic requirement of participation in this category that you routinely brush at least twice a day and that you floss at least once a day okay if you fall into that category you are in category one and by the way if you're in category one and you do those things and you do a bunch of other things like tooth whitening and maybe you go to the dentist especially often more than the recommended twice per year that still puts you in category one okay second category are those of you out there who are let's say a bit more blasé about your oral and tooth care those of you that perhaps just brush your teeth in the morning so that your breath is fresh you clean out that kind of sticky feeling in your mouth that's accumulated overnight that sometimes brush and maybe floss at night but you know a lot of times you fall asleep without doing that or you don't feel like doing it or perhaps that don't really floss at all okay that perhaps go to the dentist once every 6 months maybe a little less maybe once a year once every couple years so while there's a bunch of different things that could put you into Category 2 let's make a basic requirement for belonging to Category 2 that you brush your teeth once a day but not twice a day on a regular basis or that you brush twice a day but that you rarely floss okay that would put you into what I'm calling category to and then of course there's the third category that maybe some of you out there fall into and this is the CATE ategory of people who are extremely diligent not just about tooth care but also about oral health generally about maintaining the microbiome of your mouth about making sure that your gums are very healthy about making sure that your soft pallet and hard palet is very healthy about making sure that yes your teeth are clean that they're devoid of as much bacterial buildup and other stuff in there that can cause cavities but also that you're paying careful attention to your oral micro probiome and the overall milu of your health in the mouth and the fact that your mouth is linked to all these different aspects of brain and cardiac and metabolic Health okay if you fall into that third category great but let's be honest most people I would argue 95 maybe even 98% of people or more fall into either category one or category two so as you're hearing this you're probably thinking okay well if I'm in category one I'm good right I go to the dentist twice a year I brush in floss use some mouthwash I even brighten my teeth I you know I make sure that if I had a sugary meal I'll rinse out my mouth I try not to drink acidic Foods things that we'll discuss today as to whether or not they actually have relevance for cavity formation or not but guess what if you are in category one as I described it or category two chances are you are doing things to really deplete and disrupt your oral health that's right even if you're paying a lot of attention to tooth Health chances are if you're like most people out there simply because you don't have the latest information on what oral health really is and how to best support it chances are you are doing things that yes might be keeping your teeth white and clean and you're not getting cavities or you're not being told you have cavities that need to be filled when you go to the dentist twice a year or more but that you are disrupting your oral health in ways that are depleting other aspects of your brain and bodily health and I'm not here to scare you I'm just here to tell you that if you're in category one okay you're clearly doing some things that are beneficial for you but that there's some additional things that you can do and a few things to avoid doing that very likely will improve your overall bily health very quickly and the good news is those things are also zero or low cost or in some cases can save you substantial cost now if you're in category two chances are you are depleting both your oral health and your overall bodily Health but here's what's interesting some of the folks in Category 2 that are not doing as much for the let's say hygiene and freshening and whitening of their teeth actually have a healthier overall oral microbiome that's not always the case but often it can be the case so what you're going to discover today is whether you're in category 1 or Category 2 there are some wonderful and easily accessible practices that are well backed by science and by the way in preparation for this episode I also consulted with no fewer than five dentists including a pediatric dentist I talked to a periodontist I talked to people who fall into the functional dentist category I talk to people with a bunch of different orientations who are all heavily qualified to talk about and to make recommendations about oral health and tooth Health Etc and what I'm going to deliver today is essentially the overlap in the vend diagram of what they all agreed on I'll highlight a few differences that they each had and that several of them they do fall into different camps but I was positively surprised how much overlap or consensus there was in terms of best protocols for tooth and oral health and by the way if you're in that third category of the person that's doing a lot for their tooth health and appearance and breath Etc but also oral health and microbiome I'm sure that today you'll also learn some new health practices and some things that will allow you to expand on your already terrific practices for oral health so let's get into the material about oral health focusing first on two tooth anatomy and health and some a little bit about mouth Anatomy I promise to not go into this in too much depth but we really need to have a firm basis a foundation of understanding of what the mouth cavity really consists of and I'm not just going to throw a bunch of names out there for sake of nomenclature I don't need to Cloud your hippocampus with that sort of information unless it's functional information but it is critical functional information for the rest of our discussion where we'll talk about ways that you can really build up the strength of your teeth even if cavities have already started to form and how to really get your saliva to be the best healthiest saliva for your overall mouth and for your gut and for your brain your heart Etc okay so let's talk just briefly I promise briefly about the anatomy and a little bit of the physiology of the this stuff okay the teeth we're all familiar with what teeth are and the tongue the tonsils in the back of the mouth we have our soft pallette hard pallet gums let's talk a little bit about how all that fits together centering around the thing that most people think about when they think about oral health and that's the teeth it's just a good jumping off point for us your teeth are layered structures like pretty much every structure in your body is a layered structure it's just the way those structures form cells are born at one location they migrate out and form Stacks or layers those different layers have different cell types and your teeth are no exception so while there are different kinds of teeth in your mouth teeth have an outer layer which is the enamel the enamel believe it or not is not white it is translucent light can make it through but it's not transparent it's not like a clear window it's translucent light can make it through but it's a bit opaque okay beneath the enamel is a structure called Dentin Dentin is important for today's discussion because as it turns out cavities form not surprisingly from the outside of teeth Inward and Cavities as the name suggests are holes that bacteria burrow down through the enamal and if you're unlucky make it down to the Dentin our goal meaning your goal goal is to engage in Daily protocols that's right daily protocols that are simple and fast and zero or very low cost that allow you to avoid the formation of those cavities yes but also that can allow you to fill in those cavities this is one of the most important things to understand about oral health that frankly I didn't know until I started researching this episode and talking to all these experts in the field which is that you can repair cavities that have started to form that's right your mouth environment based on its chemistry and some things that are mechanical but mostly based on its chemistry in particular how acidic it is or how basic it is is always in a state of what's called either demineralization or remineralization now those words are hard to say and they're especially hard to say fast so demineralization remineralization it's a little bit of a tongue twister today I'm going to use a shorthand that's a convention in the Dentistry field which is De Min or remin to refer to demineralization or remineralization remineralization is good it is the process by which within the enamel and to some extent in the deeper Dentin layer of the tooth but especially within the enamel there can be the addition of new minerals that form very robust essentially chains of crystals okay if you've ever looked at a crystal of any kind under a microscope or you've seen a picture of it they are incredibly well organized they form a lattice of very strong often although they're weaker crystals too very strong bonds and structure it's like the structure of a really well-formed building okay remineralization is the process of putting minerals back into that crystal structure and it's actually possible to fill back in those cavities that bacteria have started to form especially when those cavities have burrowed down into the enamel but have not yet made it into the Dentin layer of the tooth or teeth okay this is very important to understand it's especially important to understand the context of the fact that typically not always but typically if you have a cavity formed at one tooth and let's say it's just halfway or 3/4 of the way through the enamel layer that if you have cavities elsewhere in your mouth chances are that they are at the same depth or level not always but chances are and that's great news if those cavities have not yet made it into the dtin layer why is it great news well I don't know about you but I don't like having my teeth drilled I don't like having cavities drilled and filled I had a very traumatic childhood with respect to dentistry and oral health I'll talk about it a little bit later in the episode it's not that I had tons and tons of cavities I actually had this other issue where my adult teeth came in behind my baby teeth I had have all my baby teeth pulled I had to get a bunch of injections of Novacane in my mouth I didn't like getting injections into my mouth so I opted to have any cavities I had drilled without Novacane it's not cuz I was a tough little kid although that definitely toughened me up it was because I hated having syringes in my mouth I might have even bitten a dentist or two or three I don't bite the dentist anymore I thank the dentist by the way I think dentists are wonderful regular cleanings are wonderful we'll talk about frequency of cleanings but here's the point if you are somebody who enjoys getting your teeth drilled well then I don't know what to say but if like most people out there with proper wiring of your neurology well then you don't like getting your teeth drilled and you can avoid it in many cases by remineralizing that enamel layer of your teeth now if there's a demineralization down to the deeper Dentin layers of the tooth then most often you're going to need it to be drilled drilled and filled as they say or as some people say which is a bit more cynical drill fill and build because you get charged for that or your insurance gets charged for that okay back to some tooth anatomy and mouth Anatomy we talked about the enamel layer of the tooth on the outside I told you that it either can demineralize demmin or remineralize remin this is a key Point your teeth are always in a state of either demon or remen that's right either demon or remen it's not both at the same time it's one or the other and it is largely dependent on the p that is the acidity of your mouth which is largely dependent on how much saliva you're producing and the mineral content of that saliva keep that in mind I think it's a very important point now another key point is that next to your teeth right you have your gums the gingiva as it's called now the gingiva provides a really important role in keeping the teeth stable we don't often think of it like that but even though that stuff seems gummy and soft it is soft tissue it is very important for fixing the teeth to the Bone it's not just about the roots that extend down into the Jawbone below the gums are very important for keeping the teeth where they are there's actually a little ligament too between gums and the teeth that resides a little bit deeper but the gums form a critical barrier between the oral cavity and the deeper layers of what eventually is bone and into the general blood flow or bloodstream of the body now this is so important to understand that the gums are a seal around the tooth this is why when you go to the dentist they're paying attention with that little pick they're paying attention to how high or hopefully low the tenting is the the the little recesses or pockets of gums along the the here in my mouth yes I'll try not to do that during today's episode point to my teeth so much so that I'm then you know you can't understand what I'm saying that the gums are providing a seal between the oral cavity and essentially the bone and the general bloodstream now this is so critical because let's just take a step back and think about the oral cavity and what a remarkable place it is think about it this is a gaping hole in our body okay we have some other gaping holes in our body but those tend to be sphincter based holes yes I realize there probably some Chuckles as soon as you say sphincter like yes the anal sphincter okay we're anatomists we're biologists we can talk about that stay shut stuff is generally not going up there and if it is not very often okay your nasal passages yeah those are holes but you know there's a lot of stuff there there's mucus to catch stuff there's a CRI form plate there's a bone there's a bunch of things that act as barriers between the nasal cavities and the Brain which sits right behind it the olfactory bulb and yes we have eyes and then you know we have the outside of the eyes and there's a you know a susceptibility there but we have our blink reflex there's a also an ocular microbiome there's a bunch of things there but think about the just this gaping hole in the front of our face that we use to eat and speak and breathe okay it's a huge hole and as a consequence it's filled with bacteria from our outside environment all day long all day long sometimes at night although we're going to talk later about the critical critical need to be a nasal breather at night and not a mouth breather not just for sake of staving off sleep apnea but also because turns out the dryness of the mouth is one of the ways that you really can throw off your oral health in major ways in fact it's one of the leading causes of tooth decay in people like methamp addicts or if you see people that are mouth breathers their oral health and their teeth generally but certainly their oral health is severely depleted so you've got this big hole in your front of your face and you're talking and eating and moving about during the day even if you're a nasal breather when you're not talking or eating and all this bacteria is getting in and it's a really moist environment and it's really warm so the combination of bacteria moist and warm means that this thing is like a petri dish for growing stuff that could potentially be really bad for us but but it has this incredible feature which is that if the pH is right then the bad stuff is killed off doesn't make it into our system doesn't disrupt our oral health or our bodily Health it also has a critical feature which is that the bacteria that are good for us proliferate and supports the sealing process of the gums against the teeth and tooth health and tongue health and pallet Health Etc okay so the oral cavity is Amazing by virtue of how vulnerable it is but also how robust it is and the way it stays robust is by keeping the saliva healthy now there are other ways too but that's one of the main ones and it's a huge portal into the rest of the body and if the oral cavity isn't amazing to you already based on what you've heard thus far think about this if you get a cut on your arm or your hand or your shin unless you're one of these remarkable people that always heals up without a scar as long as you're about 25 years or older typically you'll form a little bit scar there'll be something noticeable there the oral cavity also can take cuts and burns and things like that unfortunately those things occur but with rare exception heals up with nearly zero scarring sometimes there's a scar but nearly zero scarring which is remarkable why well it's basically an open wound with a bunch of bacteria in it and it's warm and it's moist so clearly there's something special going on in this thing that we call the oral cavity indeed there is and it's anchored in the fact that if we treat it right you can encourage remineralization how do you do that by keeping the saliva healthy how do you do that by supporting the proper bacteria within the mouth and making sure that you're eliminating the bacteria that you don't want or at least limiting those bacteria and today we're going to talk about how to do that and by virtue of doing all the things that support tooth Health you're also going to support gum health okay those gums are critical because they form that barrier that if it gets too big if those Pockets those recesses get too big and you're not taking care of the bacteria in your mouth when you're not getting rid of the bad bacteria those bacteria worm their way down into the deeper recesses near the roots of the tooth sometimes into the tooth we'll talk about that and can get down into the bone and then can cause serious serious issues this is so-called perodontal disease and perodontal disease is associated with all sorts of really bad stuff including Alzheimer's okay this is not just some Wellness culture woo science leap to alzheimer's there's literally evidence that the specific bacterias that cause recession of the gums can cross the blood brain barrier if they make it into the general circulation and potentially cause Plax and Tangles some of the Hallmark features of neural degeneration in Alzheimer's okay probably not the only cause of Alzheimers but potentially one of the major causes this is a new Theory but it's one that a lot of people are starting to pay attention to and it's also very clear that bacteria make it down into these deeper recesses near the roots and into the bone that you can end up with issues related to cardiac health and certainly metabolic Health okay so again the goal today is not to scare you it's not to spend too much time um on all the terrible things that can happen but rather to emphasize the positive which is that if you do the right things at the right times especially if you do them on a regular basis that you can really improve the health of your total oral cavity and your teeth and your breath and all the other stuff that people care about for Aesthetics and interpersonal interactions will flourish as well I'd like to take a brief moment and thank one of our sponsors and that's ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens I started taking ag1 way back in 2012 the reason I started taking it and the reason I still take it every day is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas for vitamins and minerals and it ensures that I get enough Prebiotic and probiotic to support gut health now gut health is something that over the last 10 years we realized is not just important for the health of our gut but also for our immune system and for the production of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators things like dopamine and serotonin in other words gut health is critical for proper brain functioning now of course I strive to consume healthy Whole Foods for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day but there are a number of things in ag1 including specific micronutrients that are hard to get from Whole Foods or at least in sufficient quantities so ag1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals that I need probiotics prebiotics the adaptogens and critical micronutrients so anytime somebody asks me if they were to take just one supplement what that supplement should be I tell them ag1 because ag1 supports so many different systems within the body that are involved in mental health physical health and performance to try ag1 go to drink a1.com huberman and you'll get a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 and five free travel packs of ag1 again that's drink a1.com huberman okay let's talk about how cavities form because I think this is the major question that people ask when asking about or thinking about oral health as I mentioned before cavities are literally holes they're fenestrations as the uh nerds call them nerds like me call them little fenestrations little holes down into the enamel that if they make it down to the Dentin layer of the tooth most likely do need to be drilled and filled and presumably build okay but your goal I think all of our goal is to try and keep our teeth in a state of remineralization by keeping the pH that is the relative acid alkaline balance of the mouth such that the saliva supports remineralization now let's think about how a cavity actually forms turns out that no specific food not even sugar causes cavities cavities are not caused by sugar cavities are caused by bacteria that feed on sugar and now that's not just a little bit of a Twist in the mechanism that's a critical point there's no specific food not even pure sugar not even like a hard candy like a delicious Jolly Rancher I used to like those when I was a kid they get stuck in your tooth that causes cavities no it's the bacteria that feed on sugar that then produce acid that burrows down through that degrades that demineralizes the tooth in this very focal area that we call a cavity okay now if that isn't surprising enough get this the bacteria that causes cavities by eating sugar and releasing this acid while there are several of them the major one is called streptococus mutans or what I'll call strep mutans for short strep mutans is not something you're born with it's actually a communicable bacteria that's right you give it to one another through how sharing of glasses sharing of bottles kissing on the mouth Etc now I am not here to tell you not not to do any of those things I'm certainly not here to tell you that however and by the way in researching this episode I did learn that there is a specific category of person out there typically they are a dentist or married to a dentist that have opted believe it or not to never kiss their children near or on the mouth so as to help their children not get streptococus mutans because almost all adults carry it not all but it's communicable like a STI or like a flu or like a it's communicated between individuals we are not born with it now that's a whole area of U let's just call it biosocial ethics decision-making that I think most people are not going to be too concerned with or at least act on because let's face it most people are not going to change their overall behavior of kissing or usage of bottles or glasses in order to avoid getting strep mutans most people in the world have strep mutans or will get strep mutans and it lives in the mouth okay it just resides there strep mutans is there and it's hungry what's it hungry for sugar when there's sugar present it eats it it produces acid the acid produces cavities taking teeth from a state of remineralization to demineralization or and by the way this is really important if your mouth is already in a state that's more demineralization mode so to speak well then it will capitalize on that and it will cause cavities much faster okay so keep in mind that acidity is bad for the mouth does that mean that you should never consume a lemon or and by the way yes I'm guilty of everyone a while chew a lemon slice or drinking water with lemon in it or carbonated drinks or sodas or tea or anything that has acidic flavor no likewise should you completely avoid ingesting any kind of sugar because strep mutans love sugar no turns out strep mutans like sugars in the form of complex carbohydrate sugars too so if you eat pasta or rice or oatmeal and some bread every once in a while as I do I'm an omnivore I eat meat and fish and eggs and also starches and vegetables and fruits I'm an omnivore as most people are well then strep mutans has an opportunity to eat the sugars that come from those other carbohydrates does that mean that if you were to have a zero carbohydrate diet no sugars no starches Etc you would reduce the opportunity for strep mutans to consume sugar and release acid maybe maybe however most people won't do that and strep mutans is a very clever maybe even diabolical bacteria and if you are on a zero carbohydrate zero sugar diet there's some evidence that strep mutans will figure out ways to feed on other components of food in order to create this acid to then create cavities in your teeth so the key thing to understand here is that cavities form form not from foods not from sugars per se but from strep mutans and other bacteria that eat those sugars and create acid hence the critical need to keep your mouth as alkaline as possible which does not mean that you can never drink some lemon water or coffee or tea here's the key point that everyone needs to remember because this dovetails beautifully into how often you should brush and floss and when you should brush and floss specifically the key point is the degree to which your mouth is in a demon state or a remin state and the degree to which cavities have the opportunity to form is dependent on the amount of time the amount of time in which your mouth is net acidic or net alkaline the amount of time that you are in a demineralization mode or remineralization mode okay so it's the amount of time no one no one can avoid having their mouth be acidic every once in a while or ingesting a sugar or a food that strep mut mutans can feed on and produce acid the key is to try and reduce the amount of strep mutans and reduce the amount of acid in the mouth that's the best way to reduce cavities and even reverse cavities that have started to form now in a moment I'm going to tell you about fluoride because I know there are a lot of questions about fluoride but in order for you to understand what I say about fluoride and to make the best decision about fluoride both in drinking water and toothpaste etc for you you have to understand the remineralization process just a little bit just a little bit so a little bit of chemistry here a little bit of structural biology and this will be fun I promise even if you know no biology no structural biology no chemistry you're going to like this part and it's very simple those minerals that form the crystals within the enamel and some of the deeper layers of your tooth or teeth rather those crystals form through a specific type of bond and those bonds are very strong think of them like Lego chains but these are not you know just conventional Lego chains these are Lego chains that when they stick when two pieces come together things are tough to pull apart they're not indestructible but they're tough to pull apart and they're also special because unlike a string of Legos like a single string of Legos these bonds that form during remineralization of the teeth are interdigitated with one another or rather are at angles with one another that make those bonds especially strong any architect or somebody that understands structural biology will understand that bonds can be weak or strong depending on whether or not they're linear whether or not they're crossed whether or not and lates there's a whole bunch of interesting you know angled forces stuff that the Architects will understand and the the construction workers will understand at a very intuitive and and concrete level no pun intended and on and on but just think about it a bond is only as strong as the number of different points at which it can resist shearing and pressure so the way that these re remineralization bonds form is through the addition of specific minerals at specific angles and the naturally occurring mineral mineral that's responsible for the majority of these Bonds in the enamel and teeth is called hydroxy appetite what a great name if you're talking about oral health right because we use the mouth for a lot of things you can think of the small list or long list of those things there are many of them you know depending on who you are and what you like to do with your mouth but the point being that we do indeed eat with our mouth appetite is part of eating so you just remember hydroxy appetite bonds and they are very strong but they're not indestructible acid can actually break those bonds okay that's the mineralization process now fluoride is a substance that is not a vitamin it's not a mineral it is not an essential nutrient but that in the last century it was discovered can actually replace some of the hydroxyapatite bonds in teeth and actually make those bonds hyper strong super physiologically strong now we'll talk about the safety considerations with fluoride in a little bit because there are some safety considerations but it was decided in Mass in the United States and Europe that the addition of fluoride to the drinking water and to many toothpastes or tooth powders would be useful because it creates these super physiologically strong bonds within the minerals of the teeth and indeed it does it does fluoride gets between those Lego pieces and makes them extra extra strong and this is why fluoride is added to the drinking water but and this is very important to emphasize but nowadays there's a really polarized debate about fluoride because some people out there believe that fluoride can disrupt thyroid Health might be disruptive for brain health certainly if fluoride levels are too high in drinking water or any substance it can be very dangerous it can be a poison but of course the dose makes the poison right fluoride itself may not be poisonous at very low levels but there really two camps now that have formed and I'll just illustrate those two camps by virtue of what's happening right now right now in the state of California there is a major lawsuit against the government because people want fluoride removed from the drinking water because of the long list of bad things that excessive I want to highlight excessive fluoride can do for bodily and brain health especially in kids but also in adults at the very same time meaning right now there is also a major lawsuit this one in Buffalo New York from Mostly parents who are suing the City of Buffalo saying that there was not enough maybe even zero fluoride in the drinking water for some period of time and as a consequence their children's teeth or oral health or both is depleted and they are suing for damages okay so there this is a really polarized camp now I did a full episode of The hubman Lab podcast all about water and I talked about fluoride levels which levels are thought by the CDC to be safe which levels are not thought to be safe I talked about some of the theories as to how fluoride might disrupt function of the thyroid and some considerations there please check out the time stamp in that episode I link to that time stamp in the caption for this episode but the important Point here is that if you are at all concerned about fluoride in the drinking water the simple answer is to just filter the water that comes out of the tap if you're concerned about fluoride then I suppose you'd probably want to avoid toothpastes that have fluoride indeed there are some I will provide links to some of those in the show note captions for this episode there are a variety of these zero fluoride toothpaste that have started to accumulate but keep in mind that when fluoride is introduced into the bonds of the mineral of the teeth they do make the teeth really really strong but and all the dentists I spoke to emphasize this point the bonds that form are not the natural bonds now the fact that they're not the natural bonds doesn't necessarily mean that they aren't good for us or that they're bad for us but the bonds that form when viewed under what's called electron microscopy look different they look wavy they're not smooth bonds and they do increase the so resistance to different forces including cavities or acid that would create cavities to be specific they make the teeth stronger structurally so resistance to chipping Etc but there is a growing concern about excessive fluoride which by the way if you drink a lot of tap water you're going to be exposed to more fluoride than if you drink less tap water that's just kind of stands to reason but people don't really talk about this right when you talk about x amount of fluoride by concentration in a given liter of water or gallon of water you also have to ask well how much tap water are you drinking every day okay you have to ask that question right it's not simply the concentration it's how much you're Ines overall and that's something that's much harder to control for again in the water episode I talk about ways to eliminate or reduce fluoride in the drinking water if that's a concern of yours but if you want to know why there's fluoride in drinking water it's because government's figured out hey well if we want to reduce tooth decay what's the simplest lowcost method to do that well it's to put fluoride in the drinking water and you now also now know why there's fluoride in a lot of toothpaste but given the concerns about thyroid Health potential concerns about brain health now you also know why many people including some dentists that I spoke to are not big fans of fluoride both for children and for adults so you just have to make a decision for you I'm not here to tell you what to do you just have to decide are you Pro neutral or against fluoride in you're drinking water and if so are you going to filter are you going to completely avoid drinking any water maybe even cooking with any water from the T and on and on but now you know why fluoride is in drinking water and fluoride is in toothpaste if you're somebody who's concerned about fluoride in either or both of those sources well then what you really want to think about and what most of us probably should be thinking about anyway is trying to increase the remineralization state of our teeth and mouth in ways that don't create the opportunity for any other health hazard and I will say this as well which is that there's some data not a lot but some data that fluoride might not be so great for our oral microbiome and as we'll soon learn the oral microbiome is critical for our oral and overall all Health I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor insid tracker insid tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals now I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term Health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test a major problem with a lot of blood tests out there however is that you get information back about metabolic factors lipids and hormones and so forth but you don't know what to do with that information with insid tracker they make it very easy because they have a personalized platform that allows you to see the levels of all those things metabolic factors lipids hormones Etc but it gives you specific directives that you can follow that relate to nutrition behavioral modifications supplements Etc that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you if you'd like to try inside tracker you can go to insid tracker.com huberman to get 20% off any of insid tracker's plans again that's inside tracker.com huberman so in a moment we are going to get into what to do the to-dos the behavioral to-dos and some of the other to-dos for trying to keep your mouth in the best possible remineralization State the best pH for tooth health for gum health for avoiding periodontal disease maybe even for reversing some aspects of tooth and periodontal sickness because indeed you can do that if you shift your mouth to the correct pH if you're putting it into that remineralization mode okay however before we get into the todos I think it's very important to discuss the do Nots that every dentist and periodontist I spoke to agreed on the Quick List as I'll call it of bad for your teeth bad for your mouth and therefore bad for your brain and body are not surprisingly perhaps alcohol which by the way I did an entire episode about alcohol it's one of our more popular episodes I'm not here to tell you to never drink if you're an adult who's not- alcoholic but the cut off seems to be two alcohol based drinks per week Beyond which you run into trouble and yes zero is better than any but here when we say alcohol is not good for oral health and for tooth Health what we're talking about is the disruption that alcohol creates to the microbiome and the way that it Alters the pH of your saliva and places the mouth and the teeth into a demineralization state that's very clear it also kills certain cells of the mouth some people I remember this in college would say oh you know if you've got a you know you've got a like scratch in the back of your throat you're getting sick you know you should drink and that's what they said you should drink it's going to kill that thing off well guess what it does the exact opposite it kills off a bunch of things that you want like the cells in and around the mucosal layer of the mouth that are actually going to provide immune support and eliminate those bacteria or viruses uh that are making you sick Etc so alcohol is bad I'm not saying you shouldn't drink at all if you're a non-alcohol adult you have to decide for you but just understand that if you're drinking alcohol that you want to pay extra attention to your oral health and your tooth care practices especially on the days around that alcohol consumption and if you're somebody who doesn't want to drink alcohol now you have yet another reason to not drink alcohol the second thing on the no fly list or the not good for us list for sake of oral health are stimulants now of course things like methamphetamine which are you know severely dilus addictive drugs for all sorts of reasons they kill dopaminergic and other brain neurons they are highly addictive um and on and on but also stimulants like adderal viance etc those stimulants basically any drug that increases epinephrine and norepinephrine so called adrenaline and noradrenaline are the other names for those are going to have a negative effect on oral health does that mean you should stop those medications if you've been prescribed them no it means that you should do some other things to try and offset the negative consequence of stimulants why would stimulants cause such disruption in oral health well there are really two reasons there's a chemical reason and there's a mechanical reason the chemical reason is that stimulants change the pH of your saliva making the mouth more acidic which makes strep mutans and other bacteria more capable of creating cavities down into the teeth they take your mouth and your teeth from that remineralization state or I've been referring to it mode to that demineralization demon mode demon mode that's a way to remember it's bad demon mode demon mode not good maybe in a video game demon mode is good Demon mode not good for the mouth demon mode demineralization mode so there's a chemical reason why stimulants disrupt the oral health milu and cause disruption in tooth health and degradation demon of the enamel of the teeth and deeper layers of the teeth and this is profoundly evident in meth but the other reason and this was a reason that was shared with me by a physician an MD from University of California San Francisco who interacts by virtue of his profession with a lot of Methamphetamine addicts who have terrible teeth is that stimulants encourage mouth breathing watch a meth addict or watch somebody who's on a high dose of stimulant and they tend to mouth breathe because of the shifts in autonomic nervous system function they tend to be mouth breathers so it's the drying of the mouth that also shifts the mouth from that remineralization mode to demineralization mode so if you do take stimulants by prescription I would hope not methamphetamine or elicit drugs but if you take prescription stimulants and by the way things like Wellbutrin modafanil they do qualify as stimulants even though modaal is a little bit of a special case any drug that increases norepinephrine epinephrine any stimulant and yes indeed coffee we'll talk about coffee as well and tea will make the saliva more acidic and make your oral health po potentially less good mouth breathing bad for oral health bad for teeth bad bad bad there's just no question about it so today's discussion I'm calling oral health but that includes oral Airway health and I've talked before on this podcast about the fact that if you can be a nasal breather be a nasal breather please as long as you're not speaking as long as you're not eating try and breathe through your nose if you're exercising and exercising really hard like you're running really hard fine mouth breathe I don't think there's any evidence that staying in nasal breathing mode all the time while exercising is best for performance in fact to the contrary there are times when you need to mouth breathe and there's Sports where you need to Exhale through the mouth specifically certain martial arts for instance so not saying don't ever breathe through your mouth but as much as possible try and keep the oral cavity moist and closed okay this is critical so stimulants dry out the mouth they increase the acidity of the saliva that's bad smoking cigarettes and yes also cannabis and yes vaping does this too it's so funny anytime I talk about smoking being bad people like well what about cannabis well I didn't episode about cannabis cannabis does have certain medical uses that are very interesting and um there's good evidence for those but for many people cannabis is not a good idea you can check out that episode to decide for you then people ask what about vaping vaping is not as bad as smoking right that's what they say where they're sort of asking saying hoping wishing fantasizing and the truth is that vaping is terrible for your oral health as well is it as bad as smoking probably not but it's bad for a bunch of other reasons that offset any gain or gains you would get from vaping instead of smoking so just know that if you're a smoker or a vapor or if you vape rather that you're going to want to pay extra attention to some of the other protocols discussed and that we will discuss going forward in order to try and support your oral and therefore your whole body Health Okay so we've got alcohol stimulant smoking SL vaping and by extension dipping tobacco frankly not good for oral health or tooth Health in fact they can be proc cancerous to the gum tissue it's well established and they can also cause degradation of the gum tissue and even some of the underlying bone if you tend to do it on the same side all the time or often at all so that's not good we already discussed that sugar is not good for oral health does that mean you can never ingest sugar no of course not enjoy the sweets you enjoy every once in a while enjoy a nice pastry um you know do as you will um if you're somebody who never eats those things great but then understand that any carbohydrate any starch provides a sugar that strep mutans can eat and create acid and demineralize your teeth create cavities that is so avoid sugar in excess and if you eat sugar try and rinse your mouth after and ideally you would brush maybe even floss after okay I do know those people that after every meal they run even in the middle of the day they run to the bathroom and brush their teeth and floss and that's great but most people don't do that so swishing water rinsing your mouth out again plain water maybe with a little bit of salt in it is going to be beneficial we'll talk about mouthwash es later just to give you a little window into where we're headed with that most mouthwashes terrible terrible for your oral health especially alcohol-based or antiseptic based mouthwashes except under certain conditions prescribed or otherwise okay so if you eat any sugar and frankly after you eat anything it's a good idea to try and clear as much of that food product from your mouth you may not think you still have food in your mouth and teeth but trying to you know swish some water maybe spit it out maybe swallow it that's up to you are you a spit or swallow not my business don't want to don't tell me don't put it in the comments just decide for you but sugar and other food products residing in the mouth for long periods of time not good and similarly acidity foods that are acidic so certain things like citrus fruits which I love I love oranges I have an orange tree in my backyard now and I absolutely love it I love oranges grapefruit I just I love the peel I even eat the peel sometimes it's so delicious and no one's telling you not to eat acidic Foods or to avoid atic drinks like lemon water or carbonated lemon water some people are really extreme and they decide to just use a straw when they drink those things in fact the dentist I spoke to said yes could you ask people please if they're going to drink acidic drinks to try and use a straw but then I said well you know a lot of straws they disrupt the environment most people aren't carrying around metal straws or you know and what about the turtles this kind of thing and they said well okay here's the real truth the real truth is it's the amount of time that the mouth is exposed to that acid so if they're going to drink it drink it over the course of 10 15 maybe 20 30 minutes and then be done with it rinse out the mouth with a little bit of water and try and clear out that acidity it's not about completely avoiding acid foods or sugary Foods or acidic drinks it's about again limiting the amount of time that the overall milu of the mouth is acidic because of this whole demon remen thing strep mutans and the acid created by strep mutans that can derode the teeth and the fact that if your mouth is kept acidic for long periods of time you're going to provide the opportunity for faster and deeper development of those cavities and keep this in mind again anytime we talk about demineralization the formation of cavities remember it's like a seesaw it's either demon or reman but not both so anytime you're demineralizing your teeth you're also not remineralizing your teeth okay so really avoid alcohol stimulants smoking vaping sugar mouth breathing acidic Foods acidic drinks but many of us most of us can't avoid any sugars any acidic Foods the other things can be avoided but some of us are prescribed these drugs and need these drugs some people like a drink with alcohol in it every once in a while and it's perfectly fine for them or they've deemed it perfectly fine for them in that case try and rinse the mouth try and keep the milu of the mouth as moist and as basic or alkaline rather less acidic as possible so to translate this a bit more to the real world if you're somebody like me who loves tea I drink cold brew zero sugar y bate that's my favorite source of caffeine I also like a nice black double espresso or coffee every once in a while it's fine to drink that but you don't want to sip on those sorts of things all day and you don't want to sip on them for hours and hours and if you're going to combine those things with some acidic Foods or with any kind of food you know try and get your meals done wrap them up and rinse your mouth and move to the next part of your day and that actually Segways into a really important point that came about when researching this episode that if I had to highlight bold face underline and light up one particular protocol that I think most everybody is not thinking about is that there are certain times in the 24-hour circadian period in which your mouth makes the maximum amount of saliva okay and that the saliva has an opportunity to be the optimal pH that is chemistry for encouraging remineralization of your teeth and that's during the daytime and especially through the middle of the day now there are a couple things that can disrupt that for instance eating anything I don't care if you're carnivore or vegan whatever omnivore when you eat you change the pH of your saliva and you're introducing those sugars that the bacteria can feed on so one thing that became very clear to me when researching this episode talking to experts reading manuscripts and also reading some really interesting books about remineralization opportunities for the teeth is that having a stretch of time of maybe two four six hours or more where you're not eating anything or ingesting anything that's acidic in terms of liquids can be very beneficial now this is a vote in support of so-called intermittent fasting this is something that I practice typically by eating my first meal somewhere around 11:00 a.m. every morning sometimes earlier sometimes have a little breakfast at 9:00 if I particularly hungry but typically I eat my first meal around 11:00 a.m. or noon and then I eat my last bite of food by about 8:00 p.m. not Everyone likes to do intermittent fasting and I realize for sake of weight loss it's probably interchangeable with caloric restriction generally and there's a lot of debate as to whether or not intermittent fasting is going to extend lifespan whether or not it's better for metabolic Health than simple caloric restriction I don't want to get into that debate frankly it's a barbed wire debate that's been carried out on this podcast and elsewhere before and I think this is ongoing I think it's the the best way to couch that debate but in researching this episode it became very clear that we have an amazing opportunity during the day especially in the morning and throughout the day to create a lot of saliva that's the right pH to support remineralization of the teeth provided that there isn't a lot of food or acidic liquids in the mouth at that time so at least to my mind this is an interesting opportunity to place intermittent fasting which again or even just gaps between meals not constantly snacking or sipping on acidic beverages throughout the day as an opportunity to create that healthy milu during which the teeth can remineralize and the overall oral health can improve now does that mean you should never eat or drink anything during the middle of the day no I'm not saying that I'm saying that if you're going to do those things try and clear them from your mouth as I described before now many of you will probably say hey during the middle of the night I'm not eating or drinking anything for some of you that might be the only time that you're not eating or drinking anything because you're asleep one would hope you're asleep but here's the interesting thing every cell tissue and organ in our body is on a 24-hour circadian clock I think many of you have heard heard me say that in the context of viewing morning sunlight and other protocols that I you know suggest on the huberman loud podcast but here's the interesting and important point in the middle of the night indeed you're not ingesting any food or fluids presumably but your saliva production is dramatically reduced again dramatically reduced and as a consequence if there's food or rather food opportunity for strep mutans and other bacteria to feed on and create a to erode your teeth the saliva necessary to offset that to combat that is simply not present or at least not present at the same levels that it is during the day so this is a sort of two-prong protocol on the one hand I'm saying you might consider trying to introduce maybe an hour or two hour or longer stretches during the day in which you're not ingesting any food and if you're drinking anything it's not acidic or if you are to try and rinse away that acid as much as possible so PL water would be great avoiding carbonated lemon water would be great but if you like those things and indeed I love those things I love carbonated lemon water I love things like yamat indeed the yate I like is cobw zero sugar but has some lemon and ginger in it okay that's fairly acidic but then drinking it down either pretty quickly or if you're going to sip on it then rinsing it away with some water and not doing that throughout the entire day and indeed I tend to drink my caffeine early in the day and not so much throughout the day maybe a little bit of mate in the afternoon sometimes okay so that's one aspect of maintaining or encouraging the correct pH of saliva to remineralize your teeth right create these windows of opportunity where there's a lot of saliva for long stretches of time during the day as long as possible while still making it compatible with your nutrition needs and your hydration needs of course the other prong or the other aspect of this protocol is that at night when you go to sleep you need to know you're not producing very much saliva and that's the critical time to make sure that there is as little opportunity is possible for strep mutans and other bacteria to feed on sugars or other food products and thereby to create acid that creates cavities and so this is a very important protocol that every single dental and oral health care professional I spoke to supported and indeed Champions which is if there is a most critical time of day or night to brush your teeth and floss and clean your teeth it's at nighttime it's at nighttime why am I saying this with such whispered importance well I think there are many people out there in particular people that fall into that second category that I mentioned at the beginning of today's episode that wake up in the morning and brush their teeth maybe even use mouthwash maybe floss and do a bunch of things to try and get their mouth clean and fresh especially if they're going to interact with other people during the day and to get rid of all the kind of stickiness and you know mouth you know morning breath that kind of thing but that at night they're finishing dinner maybe having some dessert doing some work and passing out without brushing their teeth or flossing or simply getting too lazy to brush or floss and by the way I'm going to raise my hand and just say for many years I was in that category I know ew gross but I was in that category I had high motivation to brush in floss or at least a brush in the morning very little motivation to do it in the evening every professional said if you're going to brush and floss just once per 24 hours and that is not what they recommend by the way but if you were going to do it just once the critical time the most essential time to brush and floss and clean the mouth and get the millu of the mouth correct for tooth care and mouth overall oral health is at night before you go to sleep because you already know the mechanistic backbone for this argument because at night you're producing far less saliva and if there's any food product there that the bacteria can feed on the saliva isn't there to combat that because it's a constant battle between acidity and alkalinity your saliva is coming in trying to save everything and the strep mutans is trying to destroy your teeth and the acid is the Weaponry they use and what fuels that Weaponry what provides them more ammo to destroy your teeth are sugars and acidity so if you were going to brush your floss and ideally you do both only once per 24 hours it would be at night before going to sleep indeed so much so that I would say that nighttime brushing and flossing is perhaps one of the most important things that we could do for overall oral health care we'll talk about what to do what to use for brushing and flossing in a few minutes but that's absolutely essential I do not want that to be translated into you only need to brush or brush and floss once per 24 hours every professional I spoke to and all of the data point to the fact that doing it twice per 24 hours is best or perhaps even three times per 24 hours but let's be honest most people are not going to brush and floss three times every 24 hours some will but most won't and now of course I've been saying brushing and flossing but I haven't talked about the incredibly extensive landscape of how to brush and floss so now let's take ourselves back to being little kids right when we were taught to brush our teeth in a particular way you know you're supposed to spend a certain number of minutes set a timer supposed to floss in a certain way every time we go to the dentist they tell us to floss in a certain way do this not this what do the data really say what are the modern health professionals in dental and oral health really suggest in we do when it comes to brushing and flossing and fortunately here there's a near uniform consensus there's always that outlier that person that says to do things a little bit differently or no there's in fact one person very prominent in the dental health space that is not a fan of flossing but they are really the outlier the vast majority of dentists out there all say the same thing you need to brush you need to floss you need to do it twice a day or more and you need to do it correctly so now let's talk about what Cor correct brushing and flossing really is okay so I'm not going to demonstrate how to brush your teeth but one very actionable protocol that was told to me by all the dental professionals I spoke to was use a soft toothbrush now this one hurts or I suppose hurts less anyway it hurts my heart a little bit because I enjoy very much using a medium or hard toothbrush and really like scrubbing back there especially in the teeth in the back it just feels good I feel like I'm doing something good I get into the backs of the teeth the fronts of the teeth I know I actually enjoy brushing my teeth especially lately don't ask me why but I do but every single one of them said that that very vigorous brushing with medium or hard as they're called bristles really disrupts the interface between the teeth and the gums in ways That's not healthy for the gums and actually makes tenting of the gums and those Pockets those recesses as they're called far more likely to form and every single one of them said if you are regular with your brushing and especially if you're brushing and flossing regularly that a soft toothbrush that is one that's moved in a circular motion on the fronts and backs of your teeth for all your teeth and that is gentle you're not providing a lot of pressure is going to be the best way to break up that bofilm layer each and every time and promote the best tooth and overall oral health so I suppose um manufacturers who are making medium and hard toothbrushes maybe give us some w rationale for that um you know because the dental professionals that I spoke to and again I spoke to a fair number of them all said the same thing soft toothbrush Notch just better soft toothbrush best likewise if you use an electric toothbrush which I now do sometimes I switch back and forth but if you use an electric toothbrush it was recommended that you not provide too much pressure that you really try and keep the tips of the bristles on the the teeth and gums and yes it was also suggested that people brush their gums this is interesting for people out there who have tooth sensitivity one of the major suggestions from people in the dental and perodontal field at least the ones I spoke to was to actually brush your gums lightly to increase circulation of blood and other nutrients to the deeper portions of the tooth that actually extend into the bone now there is a tremendous amount of blood flow to the gums anyone who's um you know sort of nicked their uh gum with a while while flossing or with a toothpick can tell you bleeds very readily and that's not a good thing right you don't want to create bleeding of the gums we'll talk about bleeding of the gums during flossing in a moment by the way so don't jump the gun just yet I said jump the gun not jump the gum by the way if you are brushing your gums make sure you're using a soft toothbrush if you're using electric toothbrush make sure you're going very lightly on the gums and because there's so much blood flow to the gums it does encourage a lot of circulation to some of the deeper cavities of the tooth as it turns out I don't want to reverse to tooth anatomy in any kind of detailed way now but of course within the tooth you have again enamel you have the Dentin you've got What's called the the pulp or the center there's a lot of nerves inating the center of the tooth there's a bunch of other tissues and and the bone around it and layers Etc and when you massage or lightly brush the gums around there you're encouraging a lot of blood flow to those deeper components of the tooth which are really the live and active components of the tooth that require blood flow and nutrients so this is a good thing in fact it's probably such a good thing that most people perhaps all of us should do it but most people probably won't take the time to also brush their gums but if you have a little bit of time it can be beneficial especially if you have sensitive teeth the idea that's of emerging now in the dental field is that it can help promote resilience or less sensitivity of the teeth to things like hot and cold and maybe even to pressure so before we talk about flossing I just want to reemphasize that the reason to brush your teeth and the reason to brush your teeth lightly or without too much pressure that is is that if you're regular with your toothbrushing and flossing the main goal of brushing is to break up the biofilm layer that provides a substrate for strep mutans and other bacteria to layer on thicker layers of bacteria so-called plaque that will eventually turn to Tarter okay if we really want to gross ourselves out and really motivate brushing and flossing maybe we should describe that what happens with strep mutans is it forms these strand-like bacteria so these are like little Celia so they're attached to the tooth is the bofilm layer so like little strands of strings but if enough of it accumulates and it gets thicker and kind of Mossy it's kind of like you know thicker it looks kind of sponge form and that's the plaque and then if enough of it forms and there's enough acidity in the mouth then it forms tartter which is the hard caked on stuff that requires scraping off by the dentist you know and some people get a lot of tartar some people have less Tarter buildup depending on how diligent they are at removing the bofilm with brushing now you can remove biofilm and plaque with brushing but once it starts to form tarar that is once it's layered on sometimes it has a yellowish tint to it then you really start to run into trouble because brushing and flossing will not remove that tarar and that's why the dentist needs to get in there and scrape it away so it's ideal to be diligent about removing the bacteria while it's still in that strand or plaque form ideally within this when it's still in that strand form removing that bofilm if you've ever been to the dentist you may recall they'll do this tooth polishing you know they'll do that thing the kind of gritty stuff on your teeth and you wonder um you know is this to make my teeth whiter and indeed it can create a bit more shine or Sheen to uh your teeth but the main reason for doing that it turns out is to make the surfaces of your teeth smooth after all they do it on your backs your your teeth too right if they're good dentist they do on the backs of your teeth as well why would they do it there it can't be for cosmetic purposes well they do that because the smooth surface makes it harder for those strands that bofilm to stick and form and certainly for the more dense plaque and Tarter layers to build up on top of it so they're making your teeth smooth so that the the bacteria can't adhere to it as readily but it's the daily Protocols of tooth and oral health that are really critical we'll talk about dental visits and frequency of dental visits and what a dental visit is really about is it always about cleaning or filling Etc but in the meantime brushing and brushing often enough such that you don't get any buildup of bofilm for very long periods of time a eliminating or reducing the amount of plaque and tartter that builds up is going to be your best strategy for improving tooth Health now what about flossing there's a little bit of debate about flossing in the Dentistry field some people say if your gums bleed when you floss you need to floss more in fact most dentists I spoke to said that but they also emphasize that you need to floss correctly you can't just pull the floss down onto the gum in between the tooth you need to Glide down the side of the tooth get a little bit underneath the gum and use a circular motion and then lift up from between the two teeth which frankly is a lot easier if your teeth aren't very very close together right some of us have teeth that are very close together and when you try and bring it up through the teeth it's more of an effort okay but they really all emphasize trying to not drop this you know rather sharp floss and the you know here we could also be talking about the tooth pick based floss where there's a little Arc with a with a a little bit of floss across from it the ones that you can buy some people actually use toothpicks they're old fashion method um frankly most dentists I spoke to don't want people jabbing their mouth and gums with toothpicks you can decide for yourself but almost all of them except for one felt that flossing is a great idea for tooth health and that if your gums bleed when you floss correctly as I just described what correct flossing is that you best strategy is to floss at least twice a day between all of your teeth and if you're not going to floss twice a day for whatever reason in protest or for lack of time at least once a day and when would that once a day be it would be at night before going to sleep for the reasons we talked about earlier and several dentists I spoke to said that using a water pick is going to be better than using more typical floss or for or using those toothpick based floss approaches because it's gentler on the teeth I personally have not used a water pick but I'm sort of intrigued by the the concept because it sounds like it's um much harder to damage the gums and teeth by doing it and that it is at least as efficient as standard flossing so for those of you that have the disposable income and the interest in using a water pick sounds like it could be a really good idea for the vast majority of us like me just getting some traditional uh floss and using dental floss um at least once a day at night and ideally also in the morning after brushing that seems like the most direct and lowcost strategy I should just mention that the pediatric dentist that I spoke to mentioned that flossing is really about removing food product from between the teeth and therefore children younger than six who typically have big spaces between their baby teeth and their adult teeth have not yet come in in fact that's what those spaces are about by the way unless you're me and when you were a kid your teeth were too close together and all your adult teeth came in behind those teeth it was really miserable experience for me most kids their baby teeth are spaced out a bit and in order to allow the adult teeth to come in to erupt as it's called such a dramatic word I love reading this literature you know when the molers erupt it's like whoa no it just come up through the gums those spaces are really there for the adult teeth to come up through the gums and so it was suggested that children who have those spaces between their teeth and the spaces are big don't need to floss between those teeth because it could cause some damage to the gums rather they should just focus on their brushing now let's talk about some protocols that involve changing the chemistry of your mouth not just immediately after meals or during brushing or flossing but really around the clock and one of the key protocols that I'd like to discuss is the use of an artificial sugar called Xylitol xylitol is a very low calorie sweetener I can place it among the other low calorie sweeteners like aspartame sucrose Stevia Etc but what's unique about xylitol is that very much like standard sugar or any kind of carbohydrate sugar the bacteria streptococus mutans loves to eat Xylitol but when streptococus mutans eats Xylitol it doesn't meaning it cannot produce the acid that normally would demineralize the teeth and create cavities in addition to that when streptococus mutans eats Xylitol it kills streptococus mutans so what this means is that if xylol is present in the oral cavity after a meal say in the minutes and hours after a meal then any strep mutans that happens to be there is going to preferentially feed on the Xylitol not other sugars and it won't be able to release acid and because Xylitol can actually inhibit the growth and that is the proliferation of more strep mutans we've got a twofer we've got a situation where strep mutans can't release acid to demineralize the teeth and potentially cause cavities and the total amount of strep mutans that can grow that can proliferate in what are called colonies literally the bacteria colonizes on the teeth in that forming that bofilm well then that can't happen so xylitol is a very potent tool for improving oral health in this way in addition Xylitol reduces inflammation of the gum tissue and other soft tissues of the mouth and so xylitol is providing an array of positive benefits especially when it's present to the mouth immediately after meals and for that reason there are a number of different dentists that have created Xylitol products in the form of gums or in the form of mints specifically to be used after meals so by chewing a few of these Xylitol mints or by chewing a Xylitol based gum immediately after a meal you're taking substantial steps towards improving the chemical milu of your mouth and inhibiting the proliferation of cavity forming streptococus mutants now you can also find some literature on other proposed benefits of Xylitol such as you know improving overall microbiome uh such as reducing inflammation in other tissues besides the gums and within the mouth there is some evidence that it can support the gut microbiome because of course the oral microbiome and the gut microbiome are contiguous they have different compartments I mean you might even be surprised to learn that within your mouth there are different niches as they're called for instance there's different microbiota that live on the gums versus the hard pallet versus the soft pallet back in the throat and then as you descend into the gut Etc and it does appear that Xylitol has certain positive benefits for all of those different gut microbiome niches but the literature on that is less well substantiated than for instance the literature showing that if xylitol is put in as a surrogate sugar substrate for strep mutans that it disables strep mutans and can prevent the formation of cavities now as far as I know when consumed in mint form or gum form I'm not aware of any specific side effects or bad effects of Xylitol provided that it's not consumed in excess but as with everything dosage matters so if you're somebody who wants to explore the use of xylol gum or xylol mins after a meal I wouldn't suggest going from consuming zero Xylitol mins to consuming 50 a day or something like that or even 10 a day you might start off slowly and just consume one or two after a meal maybe just your morning meal maybe just your evening meal something of that sort rather than chewing Xylitol gum all day long etc etc I'll just mention one other positive benefit of Xylitol gum which is if you use Xylitol gum after say your noon meal or your early Day meal it further increases the production of saliva which as we talked about before is a great thing because one of the best ways to support oral health and tooth health is to have a long stretch of time in the middle of the day where you're producing a lot of healthy saliva in large amounts because again saliva is this incredible stuff that's supporting remineralization of the teeth so lots and lots of reasons to think about maybe consider using xotl gum or xotl mins there are a number of different ones available out there I have zero again zero Z Financial relationship to any of those Mint or gum companies I'll provide a link in the show note captions to One Source the company and the products were developed by a dentist Dr Ellie Phillips who is quite prominent in the public health education space around dental health some of her views are a little bit controversial like her views on flossing other of her views I find frankly quite ahead of their time in that she's been talking about a number of these things like promoting the health of the oral microbiome and the potential value of Xylitol gums and etc for some period of time I think most of the information that she puts out there is supported by other dentists and she still suggests regular Dental visit so um you know nothing Renegade out there or heretical uh again there are other sources of xotl gums and mints that you could consider I'm simply putting a link to the one that I use because I happen to use them and like them so I'd like to use the discussion about Xylitol as a segue into a discussion about toothpaste because there is a lot of controversy out there about which tooth space are better for us maybe even bad for us and best for us I think it's fair to say based on what we all now know about xylol that if you can find a toothpaste that contains Xylitol as a sweetener that can only be a good thing and indeed there are a number of them out there we'll talk about specific sources in a little bit but let's just put Xylitol on the um short to not so short list of things that would be great to have in a toothpaste for all the reasons that you now understand the real big question with toothpaste is always should I use a toothpaste that has fluoride or avoid toothpastes that have fluoride and in order to answer that we have to go back to our earlier discussion about fluoride it really depends on whether or not you're somebody that thinks that fluoride is great because it creates these super physiologically strong bonds within our teeth the crystal structures are that much stronger than when formed by hydroxy appetite or whether or not you're somebody who is wary of fluoride that you're concerned about potential brain health issues or thyroid issues and you know here I think people really do fall into either camp or the camp frankly of I don't know should I be worried I don't know if I should be worried I personally grew up using fluide toothpaste we had the kind of standard name brand fluoride toothpaste um in our bathroom I brushed my teeth with those for years whether or not that negatively impacted my health or not I don't know uh get my blood work done my thyroid hormones are normal um my brain works at least you know reasonably well but I do realize that some people are very concerned about fluoride and they just don't want it anywhere near their kids they don't want it anywhere near themselves so if you're somebody who's going to air on the side of caution with fluoride and you are seeking a non floride containing toothpaste there are such toothpaste out there and most of those if not all of them contain you guest it hydroxy appetite they contain the minerals that naturally form the bonds that create that additional enamel that can potentially fill in cavities and by remineralization of the enamel and some of the deeper layers of the tooth so if one is seeking toothpaste and you want to avoid fluoride you'd want to find something that ideally had hydroxy appetite and something that had Xylitol and they often also contain some sort of mild abrasive okay not a not a really scratchy abrasive substance um but a mild abrasive that can really allow for breaking up of the bofilm that we talked about earlier now I've provided links to a couple of sources for such toothpaste and also for these little toothpaste tablets um that I've been using lately as well sometimes switch back and forth between the two these are tablets that you chew up and then you uh brush your teeth immediately after you with your wet toothbrush both of them work quite well again I want to be clear that the companies that I've provided links to in the show note captions are companies for which I have absolutely zero Financial relationship I do know some of the people that started these companies I actually discovered these companies because these people are dentists or periodontists or other people in the oral health field uh but I also want to be very clear that there was no exchange of promo of their products for information or otherwise I simply tried and like the products and I just so happen to have learned some things about Oral healthc Care from these people separate and away from anything about toothpaste or Xylitol Etc okay so want to be very clear that I do believe these are quality sources these are the toothpaste and tooth tablets that I happen to use gums and mints that I happen to use large part as a consequence of researching this episode but I pay full price for them I'm certainly not suggesting that anyone else has to use them they just represent one option if you're looking for non- fluoride containing toothpaste and some other things to promote oral health and I'm sure there are other sources out there and if you'd like to refer the various viewers and listeners of this podcast to those sources because you feel very strongly about those other sources just put those in the comment section on YouTube okay let's talk about mouthwash or mouthwashes plural at the beginning of today's episode I said let's determine what category of oral health you are in are you somebody who pays a lot of attention to oral health you brush and floss at least twice a day you're using mouthwashes tooth whiteners perhaps as well or are you in category two or three well here's the deal most all most all not all but most all mouthwashes especially those containing alcohol are terrible for oral health simply put they deplete certain components of the mucosal lining of the mouth and they disrupt the healthy components of the oral microbiome so for those of you that rely on such mouthwashes I would really encourage you to learn more about them you're about to do that now you're already doing that now and to really consider whether or not they are helping or harming your oral health now I'm not suggesting that you create a scenario where your breath is causing other people to dissolve into a puddle of Tears or back away from you quickly that's not what you want that's not what I want that's not what anyone wants but I think it's important to realize that these alcohol-based mouthwashes are not good for us in addition they're antiseptic mouthwashes some of which contain alcohol some of which don't which sometimes are prescribed for very serious bacterial overgrowth and infections of the oral cavity if your dentist or physician or periodontist prescribes those I certainly am not going to try and get in the way of that prescription that's between you and your healthc care professional but you would be wise to ask them whether or not these chlorohexidine type mouthwashes Etc are potentially bad for other components of oral health or microbiota in the gut generally because in some cases they have been shown to be not good for us at the same time we don't want overproliferation of really bad bacteria in the mouth so we don't want infections to run wild either most people however are using mouthwashes to freshen their breath and to kill off additional bacteria in the mouth that they might believe they couldn't get with brushing or flossing if if you are somebody who really wants to use a mouthwash for that reason I encourage you to try and find a mouthwash that is not alcohol-based and that is not a strong antiseptic or that if it is an antiseptic that it's not alcohol based okay and such mouthwashes exist out there they're a little bit hard to find I'll provide a link to at least a couple of them in the show note captions here I have to say I have not tried those mouthwashes yet they do come from sources in which they were developed by licensed mental healthare professionals but this is always the case when somebody's selling something it's worthwhile to do diligence now as we talk about toothpaste and mints and gums and mouthwashes I think it's worth taking a step back and also asking the question are there any zero or very very lowc cost or even cost-saving alternatives to any of this and the great answer is yes there are actually a number of things that you can do with basic over-the-counter stuff from the grocery store that all the dentists I spoke to said yeah that's a pretty good option it's not the best option available perhaps but it's a pretty good option and in many cases it's better than the typical commercially available toothpaste or mouthwash for instance I would imagine based on everything I now know about the structure of teeth that using something like baking soda to brush the teeth would indeed scrape off the bofilm perhaps even whiten the teeth a little bit although as we talked about earlier you're not really whitening the teeth you're actually just changing the um reflectiveness uh and some of the composition of that enamel which is translucent so that you can see the underlying components better well I talked to several dentists and they told me that baking soda actually is fairly low on the abrasiveness rating scale they have a specific rating scale for this that we don't have to go into but it's actually considered quite safe for the enamel of the teeth especially if you're brushing with a soft toothbrush and you're not like really grinding the stuff against your teeth at maximum intensity or even near maximum intensity so it turns out that baking soda and water is actually a pretty good toothpaste if you're not going to go buy a toothpaste so that's good news now you may have heard that you can make a sort of mouth wash or mouth rinse with baking soda water and a little bit of hydrogen peroxide I want to emphasize a little bit but I'm also going to emphasize I don't think this is a good idea at all why is it not a good idea at all well first of all when we were kids we used to take baking soda and hydrogen peroxide and put them together to simulate volcanoes so um that tells you right there the kind of chemical reaction that you're going to get but in addition to that it's pretty clear that hydrogen peroxide unless there's a specific medical recommendation to do so is not something you want to introduce to the oral cavity now this is something that I'm very familiar with because when I was a postto so this is in the 2005 to 2010 stretch I started to get some pretty bad caners saurus I don't know about you but krur feel awful to me I hate them when you eat they hurt when you swallow they hurt when do anything they pretty much hurt and someone gave me the recommendation to use a little bit of baking soda dissolved in some water and a little bit of hydrogen peroxide to use that as a oral rinse and of course then to spit it out and I did that and actually what happened to me is I got almost quarter siiz ulcers on the roof of my mouth and on the sides of my mouth it took those little canr saurs which were annoying and kind of painful and turn them into full-blown ulcers I know this because when I stopped using it those healed up almost immediately and then when I spoke to some dentists and peridontist they said oh yeah yeah hydrogen peroxide is just far too abrasive for the mouth cavity and the reason I raised this is because I don't think I'm alone in that if you kind of venture into some of the um let's call it alternative recommendation space for oral health um you may hear that things like hydrogen peroxide can be useful for gargling with or swishing with if you are starting to get a little bit of a throat tickle maybe an infection it turns out it's a really bad idea now if there are Physicians or oral health experts out there that strongly believe in the use of hydrogen peroxide rinses or gargling with it to promote oral health for any reason let me know in the show note captions I don't want to go against any of those recommendations but this now considered kind of old school recommendation of creating one's own mouthwash with a little bit of baking soda some hydrogen peroxide and water does not seem like a good idea not just based on my experience but every one of the dental professionals that I spoke to that said it does seem that creating a high salt solution okay so taking some salt putting in water dissolving it and then finding the point at which it won't quite dissolve because the concentration of sodium is just high enough and using that as of course not something to swallow but rather as a dental rinse so putting your mouth and swishing it around and then spitting it out and it's going to taste very salty and then taking a swig of water you know just plain water and then swishing it around and then spitting it out that actually provides a really nice milu for the produ production of healthy mouth bacteria it's near zero cost suppose you need a little bit of salt low water and a glass to put it in but it's basically zero cost and if you think about it that high saline or high salinity solution is a lot like the sort of brins and the liquid that comes from these low sugar Probiotic foods that earlier I was suggesting and in other episodes I've suggested could be really healthy for swallowing for the gut microbiota but again I want to be very clear do not do not swallow high salt concentration fluid we're talking about a Swish and then a spitting it out as a way to improve the overall milu of the mouth to get the pH right to promote the proliferation of healthy microbiota components Okay so we've talked about some commercially available gums and mints containing Xylitol we've talked about some commercially available toothpastes indeed some toothpaste that you know almost fall into the very Boutique category because they have all these things that are known by dentists and uh peridontist to be great for oral health but those can run some cost right and so I do think it's important that we also talked about the use of just baking soda with a soft toothbrush and some water and gently brushing the teeth as a great way to disrupt the bofilm and clean your teeth and a high salt solution as a Swish and spit followed by you know uh Swish and spit with clear water clean water no salt in it as a Essen very low cost or zeroc cost mouthwash Far and Away different from the heavily scented alcohol-based antiseptic mouth washes that are commercially available and that we know are basically not good for our oral microbiome in addition I'd like to point out that those alcohol-based mouthwashes that many people in the world use are also known to reduce the amount of nitric oxide that's produced in the oral cavity and that's very important for the production of nitric oxide elsewhere in the body why is that important well nitric oxide promotes vasodilation not just within the blood vessels that line and feed the oral cavity but also the throat also in the nose also in the brain also in the heart so what we're talking about here is a substance that is indeed increased when we for instance nasal breathe we know that dramatically increases nitric oxide we're talking about a substance that when the oral microbiome is preserved in its healthy State tends to increase in production and we're talking about a substance that's really good for small capillary vein and arterial health because it allows for the passage of blood both for the delivery of oxygen and other nutrients to tissues but also the removal of waste products from tissues so we don't want to do anything that reduces nitric oxide unless there's some specific medical condition that leads us to want to do that so for most people increasing nitric oxide or keeping nitric oxide levels stable is the state that we want to seek and these alcohol-based mouthwashes are known to deplete the production of nitric oxide so there's yet another reason to avoid the use of these alcohol-based more typical over-the-counter mouthwashes by the way this is not a scare tactic against mouthwashes I'm sure that if you use mouthwashes you're still producing some nitric oxide but I think nowadays many hopefully all of you are interested in doing whatever you can to improve your mental health physical health and performance and if there are things that you are doing that are inhibiting those in any way that you'd potentially want to at least think about those maybe remove them from your protocols especially if there's a cost to them that you can remove in other words you can save on costs so again lots of reasons to move away from the alcohol-based standard antiseptic mouthwashes aside from the Improvement in your breath that by the way can be better achieved by supporting the oral microbiome other ways that we've discussed there's really no clear Advantage as to why one would use one and there apparently are a number of disadvantages anes now earlier we talked briefly about canker sours they are really uncomfortable there are a lot of theories as to why canker form and they're a lot of products and theories as to how to get rid of canker sorus well indeed there are some ways that we can prevent the formation of canker sorus and accelerate their healing and that actually has to do with promoting the health of the gut microbiome so there's a clear link between gut microbiome and oral microbiome in a way that can either promote or reduce the formation of canker sores and can actually help heal canker sores and to my knowledge the best way to support a quote unquote healthy gut microbiome is to consume at least one to four servings of low sugar fermented foods per day I mentioned what some of those are a little bit earlier I also did an entire episode about gut microbiome we've hosted expert guests on the microbiome including Justin sonenberg from Stanford school of medicine and for sake of time I can just briefly list off the things that are known to promote a healthy gut microbiome and that would indirectly support the healing and prevention of canker sorce and those are consuming one to four servings of low sugar fermented foods per day for instance consuming enough Prebiotic fiber so consuming enough fiber in the diet through fruits and vegetables or perhaps supplementing Prebiotic or probiotic fiber and in some cases if somebody is really dis biotic or if you've been taking antibiotics actually taking a pill form or capsule form probiotic but it's not something that I recommend people take consistently and I certainly don't I think by ingesting those low sugar fermented foods on a regular basis by trying to make sure that you're getting enough sleep each night this is key probably should have mentioned this earlier in the episode uh but you know one of the folks who I have great respect for in the public health discussion around dental health is Dr Mark bheen he goes by ask the dentist on Instagram he's actually a retired dentist uh but he's been deeply involved D in the kind of evaluation of the consumer product space as it relates to dental and oral healthare for a number of years um and Mark Beren in addition to discussing all the various topics that we've talked about today such as Xylitol and fluoride yes or fluoride no etc etc has also been a big proponent of people paying attention to that first pillar of mental health physical health and performance which is sleep and pointing out that when people get fewer than their necessary allotment of sleep each night so typically most people need 6 to 8 hours some people need more some people need a little less but getting at least 6 to8 hours of quality sleep per night which supports the health of the gut microbiome and oral microbiome and thereby indirectly supports the health of the entire brain and body so um Dr burin and others have talked about this but I really appreciate that he's championed the importance of sleep among other things but certainly sleep as a way to support the oral microbiome so we've talked quite a bit about teeth and gums a little little bit about mucosal lining and throat one thing that we haven't talked very much about is a hung the tongue your tongue is obviously a very important component of your mouth and as I mentioned earlier different niches different locations within the mouth have different microbiota living on them both good and quote unquote bad meaning ones that we'd like to promote the proliferation of because they reduce bad breath and promote oral health and all that good stuff and quote unquote bad bacteria because they make our breath smell bad and because they deteriorate the various tissues of the mouth I looked pretty extensively into this issue of tongue scraping and it's an interesting one and every licensed dental health care professional I spoke to in preparing for this episode agreed that yes it can be a good idea to scrape the tongue and each one of them cited the fact that a number of unhealthy bacteria can build up on the tongue across the course of the day and throughout the night much in the same way that biofilm can build up on teeth although through a different process different bacteria and that scraping the tongue or brushing the tongue can be advantageous for removing that bacteria what was interesting is that several of them pointed out that lightly brushing the tongue may in fact be better than scraping the tongue because they argue that especially when people use those steel tongue scrapers that few people know how to use them with sufficient Force to remove the bacteria but not so much force that they don't damage the tongue tissue and the tongue is a very fragile soft tissue so the recommendation that they relayed to me was to suggest once or twice a day brushing of the tongue but here's an important point they all suggested that you use a separate toothbrush to brush your tongue than you would to brush your teeth okay so if things weren't complicated enough already about using a separate toothbrush why well they gave two reasons one is they want to prevent crossover of the bacteria between those two different tissues especially if one is brushing the tongue too vigorously you don't want to introduce bacteria from your toothbrushing onto your tongue of course you can rinse it in between but the ideal situation is to use a separate toothbrush for the purpose of brushing the tongue now that opened up a whole exploration and discussion about toothbrush care we can probably do a whole episode all about toothbrush care but we won't suffice to say that when you brush bacteria off your teeth or tongue and presumably the toothbrush gets moist if by no other means certainly by means of your saliva being on it then you rinse it off and then even if you were to dry it off with a clean um some sort of clean towel or something like that and you set it out a lot of bacteria are going to proliferate on that toothbrush so this opened up a whole discussion about you know should you cover your toothbrush or let it dry out in the air should you use UV irradiation uh to sterilize your toothbrush and frankly it took us me down the rabbit hole of toothbrush care so far that at one point I just I just screamed like Uncle like enough I I think um one has to decide how much bacteria they are willing to tolerate living on their toothbrush in between toothbrushing um anywhere from zero where you use a new toothbrush or toothbrush head every single time you brush that seems unreasonable or at least economically unreasonable for most people versus replacing it once a week versus once every two weeks really there's no specific recommendation I can make all I can say is be aware that bacteria are growing on the toothbrush head try and avoid contact between the toothbrush head and any um unsanitary surfaces try and rinse and dry off the toothbrush head all these things are recommendations that were relayed to me and that just make good common sense now prior to this episode I put the call out on social media for questions about oral health and one of the questions that came back from many hundreds of people was what about fillings what about Metal fillings what about sealant are they safe well most dentists will tell you that sealant are safe they are now made from compounds that are generally not thought to cause any major issues to be honest I did not do a deep dive into the chemical composition of different sealants because it turns out that different Dental practices use different sealants I'm sure that if I looked hard enough I could find um some really bad stuff in sealants I'm sure I could also find some reassurance that at the concentrations and conditions that they're introduced to teeth that they are better alternative to having deep cavities into the teeth and that actually gives me an opportunity to raise something that I perhaps said earlier but I want to reemphasize which is I've been talking about how you can remineralize the teeth and how that's critical if you want to maintain and build up your tooth and oral health but it's very clear that if the cavities get down into the denting layers of the tooth that in most cases there is no remaining opportunity to remineralize the teeth you using the sorts of practices we're talking about today and that indeed it's very likely that those cavities need to be drilled and filled okay now that's not always the case and this is one reason why I highly recommend that if you've listened to this episode and if you're here at this point in the episode and you've listened to the episode that you talk to your dentist ask them if they say you have a cavity how deep are these cavities do you think there's an opportunity for me to remineralize the teeth if I do the following things and if they tell you look you have a cavity or cavities and they're simply too deep into the tooth that you can't remineralize your teeth and fill those in well then you know you should trust them they're the dental professional if you don't you should find a different dentist however they may be surprised and who knows pleasantly surprised for you to uh say Hey you know I heard that you can actually remineralize teeth and if I've got a cavity but it's still not through the enamel layer you know if I'm really diligent and you know use some zotol and maybe some hydroxy appetite and avoid certain things and do certain things discussed in this episode that I could re uh remineralize and fill in those cavities that said there of course will be situations where you need to get those cavities drilled and filled especially if they make it into the deep deep layers of the tooth and you do not want those cavities to persist and for bacteria to proliferate in those deeper layers of the teeth and down into the bone that is oh so bad for reasons we talked about earlier not just for your mouth and your teeth but for your General Health and brain health included so for that reason and also because you know the history of Dentistry was such that you know in the early part of the last century if you had a toothache in a cavity what did they do they pulled the teeth they extracted the teeth then at some point this business of filling teeth became industry standard so people would get metal fillings now the types of metal fillings that people had and have depend on when they got those fillings there were were believe it or not lead fillings this is not good you don't want lead in your body for all sorts of reasons it is terrible for brain health that's why it's now illegal to contain in paints and many household goods you don't want lead fillings but some people had lead fillings or silver fillings or a combination of lead silver and other things and many metal fillings that were given and sometimes are still given depending on where you live in the world and Country and the kind of Health Care and costs that you have available to you contain mercury now I asked several dentists about this and said well if somebody has a metal filling that likely has mercury in it do they need to have that metal filling removed and all of the dentists I spoke to said it depends but generally the practice is to leave those fillings in and try not to disrupt them now they also provided a important recommendation which is if you have metal fillings that contain mercury or that you think might contain mercury to avoid disrupting those fillings through the use of things like Mastic Gum we haven't talked too much about mastic gum um I've used mastic gum before not for long periods of time it's a very thick gum uh you know the original use of mastic gum and the the kind of origins of Mastic Gum are like a treap kind of substance that you chew on supposed to strengthen your jaw Etc um I don't use it any longer I use it for a short while doesn't taste like much of anything some people believe there are certain anti-inflammatory and other health benefits of Mastic Gum I haven't really explored mastic gum in enough depth or detail to comment on any of that but a number of dentists said well if you have metal fillings chewing on the like Mastic Gum or you know hard candies where you're really chewing on on that hard candy which by the way you're supposed to suck the hard candy the Jolly ranch you're not supposed to chew on them but that some people will do that they'll just naturally chew on those can actually disrupt and liberate some of that mercury and that would be bad and keep in mind also that when Mercury is contained in a metal filling it's not really bioactive in that mode but if it's liberated then it can get into the bloodstream and potentially cause other issues so this is a somewhat controversial topic so much so that in certain countries and I believe in the EU somebody checked me on this but I believe that in the not too distant future metal fillings will no longer be used in the European Union perhaps elsewhere in the world they're sometimes still used in the United States there's a lot that's changing in this landscape around fluoride around metal fillings Etc so it's very Dynamic landscape right now I think suffice to say that if you have metal fillings currently try not to disrupt them in a way that could liberate that mercury however if you have them and you're really concerned about them talk to your dentist ask what the various options are see whether or not they could be replaced with something safer and if the process for replacing them is really worth the trouble and again to just go back to the larger point of whether or not you should get cavities filled whether or not you need that root canal that was a very common question a lot of people said do we really need root canals do we really need to drill cavities you know my observation based on now having talked to a number of different practitioners in this space who really pay a lot of attention to the peer reviewed research the old school practices the new practices and where everything is headed is that you know there are indeed instances where people need root canals there are many cavities that are just too deep into the teeth that remineralization of the teeth through the sorts of protocols that we're talking about today is not going to cut it that they really need to be drilled and filled and of course we hope those dentists are doing that as little as is required to maintain dental health I also would hope that dentists are talking to their patients about ways that they can improve their oral health and indeed there are a lot of cases reported online where people will go in get X-rays and an exam they'll talk about all these cavities that they have and then they go home and they do a bunch of practices and they are able to remineralize their teeth and to essentially reverse those cavities and I certainly don't doubt those stories but it's simply not always the case that we can remineralize our teeth and fill back in our cavities if those cavity recesses are too deep into the teeth they need to be drilled and filled now that raises a final set of questions and points which is do we really need to go to the dentist twice a year every six months that's the general recommendation and this was a tricky one to ask dentists because of course dentists are highly incentivized to see their patients and I'm not somebody that believes that everything is a you know is an attempt to make money but look when money is involved things can get complicated now what was really great is that the feedback I got from dentists was very balanced I mean I must say that the community of dentists um seems like a really wonderful Community I don't know how they treat each other but they were very kind very generous with information with me and at the end of this episode just before wrapping I'll refer you to a couple um online oral health and dentist Educators that I think are providing some really useful content on a consistent basis and I'll provide links to those in the show note captions but here's what the consensus was this business of going to the dentist twice a year makes sense it makes sense from the perspective of quote unquote routine cleanings but everyone acknowledged that those routine cleanings while they can remove tarar that's built up that would be very very difficult for people to reverse or eliminate at home and while they can identify cavities and tell you how far a cavity has developed into the tooth Etc every one of those dentists agreed that those routine cleanings are not actually going to help remineralize your teeth except to the extent that they remove existing bacteria plaque and tartar and so all of them said that they wish for and that they really strive in their own practices to promote more oral health daily Protocols of the sort that we've talked about today which I think is just great I think obviously I believe in medical professionals providing routine care I also believe in each and all of us doing things for our health not just oral health but sleep Health mental health physical health Etc to try and not just maintain but really bolster our brain and body against disease and also to bolster our Vitality to feel really great energetic focused sleeping better Etc so it was refreshing to hear that they feel that way as well and in addition to that all the dentist I spoke to said that you know setting aside situations of like reconstructive uh surgery for the mouth or perodontal surgery which often is needed if that those recesses into the gums and gingivitis and and worse have started to really develop and proliferate all of them emphasize that the twice a year Dental visit is not just about getting the cleaning it's really the checkup to evaluate how those daily practices are emerging so it's sort of like going to the doctor for a check up on your BMI on your blood pressure but also things like blood tests things that typically we don't do at home unless we're accessing those through um particular sources but all of them emphasize that going to the dentist twice a year is not just about those cleanings it's also about establishing what the Baseline level of health is in one's mouth and teeth and having that on record and in a very detailed way so that one can check back routinely twice a year and discover whether or not in fact they could get away with perhaps one cleaning a year because you're so diligent about your brushing flossing Xylitol uh not being a mouth breather and on and on or perhaps if you're not being very good about those protocols or and this is important if you have some of the genetic variants that create an over proliferation of certain bacteria that predispose you to gingivitis or that predispose you to excessive buildup of tartar this is the reality that some people have genetic variations that create a susceptibility to certain things both bacteria and other conditions in the mouth that make it such that those people perhaps need to go to the dentist not just twice a year but perhaps four times a year or six times a year indeed there are some individuals for whom either because of lack of diligence to protocol and or genetic issues actually need to go to the dentist every single month for major cleanings but fortunately if we are diligent about these daily protocols nighttime protocols and we really are are paying attention to the components that can create healthy saliva and remineralize the teeth and that can fill in any cavities that begin to form and we're staving off the production of mutants and we're scraping away that bofilm on a regular basis that we are going to prevent the need for so many routine cleanings and even if we are still getting those two-year routine cleanings you know for those out there that are fortunate enough to have that covered by insurance or can afford it well then all the better because as I mentioned at the beginning of today's episode oral health is not just about having clean straight white teeth and fresh breath it's not just about that all of those things are great to have but oral health is about all of that and it's also about reducing cardiovascular disease it's about reducing irritable bowel syndrome yes I know that we haven't done an episode about this yet but I get oh so many requests to do episodes about irritable bowel syndrome and other colitis type uh you know boweling gut issues that people have and it's so clear that oral health and promoting oral health has been linked to promoting positive gut health as well maybe even reducing and possibly eliminating some of the symptoms of irritable bowel disease because again the mouth and the gut are contiguous with one another they're related and a lot of the bacteria that can cause things like gut issues are making their way into the body not directly through the gut but through the oral cavity because of the richness of blood flow to that region so again today we've talked about a lot of different protocols ranging from cost saving to zero cost to low cost to let's just be frank higher cost products and protocols such as water picks Etc the point of today's discussion was essentially three-fold first of all to really Tamp down in our minds the importance of oral health not just tooth Health but oral health on the whole because of its relationship to brain and body Health on the whole so much so that I'm placing it right up there next to the other six pillars of sleep nutrition MO movement stress modulation relationships and light as the seventh pillar of critical to attend to on a daily basis in order to promote our mental health physical health and performance the second point is that there are many things that we are probably doing currently that we could do differently either by doing them more or perhaps less or eliminating them all together things like considering whether or not these antiseptic alcohol-based mouthwashes are good for you or not they're not they're bad for you in my my opinion but you can decide for you how often you brush when you brush whether or not you decide to use Xylitol Etc as ways to improve your oral health and of course in doing so the strength of your teeth the brightness of your teeth the freshness of your breath Etc but through some means that I think for most people they weren't aware of I certainly wasn't aware that we could remineralize our teeth at any moment by changing the acidity the chemical millu of our mouth and that they're very straightforward cost saving zero cost and low cost ways to do that and then the third point is that today's discussion by no means was exhaustive right you may be exhausted but it was by no mean exhaustive meaning we simply don't have time to go down the rabbit hole of all these other promoted Health practices such as for instance oil pulling a lot of people out there believe that if you take olive oil and swish it around your mouth and spit it out that that's good for your mouth and indeed some Dental healthc Care Professionals I should say licensed Dental Healthcare professional said yeah I think there's some benefit to that there's the whole story about vitamin D and whether or not we're getting enough vitamin D can indeed impact our tooth health so make sure your vitamin D levels are sufficient make sure you're getting some sunlight again this ties into some of the other six pillars am I suggesting that everyone do oil pulling no I don't think the peer-reviewed evidence on oil pulling is sufficient to suggest that people do that but as a practice considering that it's you know essentially near zero cost you know taking a little bit of olive oil and swishing around your mouth and spitting it out couple cents maybe um you know if that's something that you feel benefits you great if you are aware of some terrific peer reviewed research on that and you want to put a link to that in the comments on YouTube great please send them my way I'd love to review them but my point is that there are a lot of different practices that have been promoted including oil pulling and a bunch of other things that start to get pretty far into the esoteric which doesn't necessarily mean that they don't have Merit but today I've really tried to focus on the major ones the ones that relate to what most everybody could and should be doing like brushing and flossing rinsing getting the oral microbiome healthy reducing the amount of strep mutants and the opportunity of strep mutants to create that acid that's going to deplete the enamel of your teeth and lead to tooth decay trying to limit the amount of recessing of the gums and perodontal disease and for all the reasons that we talked about before keeping a healthy mouth including healthy teeth healthy tongue healthy gums healthy pallet and all the rest is oh so important not just for your mouth not just for speaking and smiling and looking the way you want to look but also for your heart also for your gut also for your believe it or not your skin didn't have time to go into this but it directly relates to skin health and for your brain health so I strongly suggest that all of us take a look at what we are currently doing for our tooth and oral health and consider what modification are best for us if you're learning from Andor enjoying this podcast please subscribe to

Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. Kay Tye, PhD, Professor of Systems Neurobiology at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Investigator. We discuss the neural circuit basis of social interactions and loneliness. We also discuss how animals and people establish themselves in a group hierarchy by rank and how the brain responds to dominance and subordination. 

Much of our discussion relates to how social media impacts our sense of social connectedness or lack thereof. The topics covered in this episode are directly relevant to anyone interested in the neuroscience of mental health, work-life balance, abundance versus scarcity mindset, and interpersonal dynamics.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr K Tai Dr K Tai is a professor of neuroscience at the sulk Institute for biological studies she did her training at MIT and at Stanford and is currently an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute which is a highly curated group of individuals who are incentivized to do high-risk High reward work and Pioneer new areas of biological study throughout her career Dr Kai has made fundamental breakthroughs into our understanding of the brain including demonstrating that a brain area called the amydala which most people associate with fear and threat detection is actually involved in reinforcement of behaviors and experiences that are positive and involve reward her current work focuses on various aspects of social interaction including what happens when we feel lonely or isolated indeed today K Tai will tell us about her discovery of so-called loneliness neurons neurons that give us that sense that we are not being fulfilled from our social interactions she also describes a phenomenon she discovered called social homeostasis which is our sense that we are experiencing enough not enough or just enough social interaction irrespective of whether or not we are an introvert or an extrovert we also talk about social hierarchies and social rank how people and animals tear out into so-called alphas and betas subordinates and dominants Etc in all sorts of social interactions I think everyone will find that discussion especially interesting and we talk about the role of social media and online interactions and why despite extensive interaction with many many individuals those social media and online interactions can often leave us feeling deprived in specific ways we talk about the neurochemical the neuros circuit and some of the hormonal aspects of social interactions it's a discussion that by the end will have you thinking far more deeply about what is a social interaction and why certain social interactions leave us feeling so good others feeling sort of me and why other social interactions or lack of social interactions can often leave us feeling quite depleted even depressed it's a conversation Central to mental illness and the understanding of things like depression and anxiety PTSD and isolation and it's a conversation Central to mental health and in order to build healthy social interactions before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity I've spoken many times before on this other podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance now one of the key aspects to getting a great night's sleep is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3° and in order to wake up in the morning feeling refreshed your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3 degrees eight sleep makes it extremely easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment at the beginning middle and throughout the night and when you wake up in the morning I've been sleeping on an eight Sleep mattress cover for nearly 3 years now and it has dramatically improved my sleep if you'd like to try eights sleep you can go to 8sleep.com huberman to save $150 off their pod3 cover eight sleep currently ships to the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by levels levels is a program that lets you see how different foods and different activities and your sleep patterns impact your health by giving you real-time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor now blood glucose sometimes referred to as blood sugar has an immediate and long-term impact on your energy levels and your overall health one of the best ways to maintain focus and energy throughout your day as well as to keep your so-called metabolic Health in best order is to make sure that your blood glucose never spikes too much nor does it get too low with levels you can monitor how different foods and food combinations impact your blood glucose levels on a momentto moment basis I've been using levels for some time now and it's really helped me understand which foods and food combinations exercise schedules and sleep schedules are optimal for my blood glucose levels and how that translates to energy levels and other metrics of Health if you're interested in learning more about levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor you can go to levels. link huberman levels has just launched a new CGM sensor that is smaller and has even better tracking than before right now they're also offering two free months of membership again that's levels. linkli nk/ huberman to try the new sensor and two free months of membership today's episode is also brought To Us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means zero sugar and the appropriate ratios of the electrolyte sodium magnesium and potassium and that correct ratio of electrolytes is extremely important because every cell in your body but especially your nerve cells your neurons relies on electrolytes in order to function properly so when you're well hydrated and your hydration also includes the appropriate ratios of electrolytes your mental functioning and your physical functioning is improved I drink one packet of element dissolved in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning as well as while I exercise and if I've sweat a lot during that exercise I often will drink a third element packet dissolved in about 32 ounces of water after I exercise element comes in a variety of different flavors personally I like all the fruit flavors so raspberry and watermelon are my favorite I also like the Citrus flavored one frankly I can't really pick just one of the fruit flavors I like them all so much and it also comes in chocolate and chocolate mint flavors which I find are best in the winter months because of course you don't just need hydration on hot days and in the summer and spring months but also in the winter when the temperatures are cold and the environment tends to be dry if you'd like to try element you can go to drink El El spelled lm.com huberman to try a free sample pack again that's drink element.com huberman and now for my conversation with Dr K Tai Dr K Tai welcome Andy huberman what a treat folks are going to hear you call me Andy and wonder if my name is Andy I always know who I'm speaking to according to whether or not they call me Andrew which is my family and people that I know after a certain period of my life Drew which are people that know me through my very brief and a non- illustrious career in boxing and Andy which are people that met me as I was coming up through science uh let's just put it this way there was another Andrew we did a coin flip and I lost so Andy is fine Andrew is fine whatever makes you comfortable what's important today is not how anyone refers to me but rather the discussion about your work which is spectacular I've known you a long time and I've been following your career and it's just been a amazing and wonderful to see the contributions you've made to science and also to the culture of science so we're going to talk about both of those things to kick things off let's talk about a brain structure that most people I think have heard of but that is badly misunderstood and that's the amydala most people hear amydala and they think oh fear that's what the amydala is all about but you know and I'm hoping you'll educate us on the fact that that the amydala is actually far more complex than that and far more interesting than that so when you hear the word amydala where does your mind go I agree that a lot of the the bandwidth on the amydala has been occupied by fear studies but we've known actually for really long time that the amydala is important for all sorts of emotional processing since cluver and buy performed lesions on on monkeys and found that monkeys would then have flat affective responses to all sorts of different stimuli poop food inanimate object whatever it was just nothing no emotion no emotional response no motivational significance however you want to phrase it to things that usually would make you either you know disgusted or excited or neutral and so um I think that that knowledge about the amigdala was there from the beginning it's not something I came up with um but then it's interesting it's almost a it's a meta statement or meta observation about how scientific research progresses sometimes you make a lot of progress in one particular vein because it's easy to press forward there but it's important to also think about all the other parts and filling in the space in between to make sure you haven't missed anything so the narrative about the amigdala became about fear and I think also just when we think about survival when you are an animal in the natural world especially if you're a prey animal which is the majority you know that's a lot of animals um then you need to prioritize escaping a predator it's immediate threat on your survival versus reward set mating drinking water getting food these things can be done later escaping this Predator is Paramount and so there should be some natural asymmetry in how we process emotion at Baseline and so that's something that we've looked into a lot as well but um I think the the big picture discovery that um my team has contributed to our understanding of the migula is that it represents a fork in the road uh for processing emotional veence and thinking about all these old psychological theories about how do you emotionally evaluate the world around you what's what's the what's the chain of events is there a chain of events what's happening in a certain order um versus what's happening in parallel for example one model is you know there's all this information that comes in and then we have to filter out what's important um what's going to be something I need to pay attention to versus what do I need to ignore if I'm driving I need to pay attention to the road this this light this pedestrian just started walking versus you know what it feels like for my sock to be touching my foot not super relevant right now or the my butt against the seat not nothing I need to pay attention to I need to focus on you know the dynamic information then you have to select you know the Second Step would be selecting whether it's good or bad and what you want to do with it and so that process I think the selection of whether you're um assigning it a positive or negative veilance happens in the amydala so glad you brought up this word veilance I think it's a word that some scientists but most of the general public are probably not familiar with so let's um talk about veilance and then I want to go back to the amydala and um kind of explore some of its diversity of function a little bit more so when I hear the word veilance I think goodness versus Badness yeah of something is that basically basically it's been used in a lot of different fields I think of that you know negative and positive numbers or or um but it's an analogy that we take to just mean yeah net positive net net negative and it's it's a intentional departure from the word value um value becomes very scalar everything's on you know it can be in the same direction with different magnitudes is often how we think about value it it could be representing both valances but um often it's a small reward and a big reward or small punishment and big punishment is how experimentally we parse um value and so veillance is just asking about um how your brain responds to things that are good or bad what are neurons that might respond similarly to things that are good and bad you know those might be importance neurons rather than um positive or negative veilance neurons so yeah I I think it's a it's just a term that that signifies that next step so when we walk into say a novel environment um do you think that our amygdalas are active and really trying to figure out whether or not an environment a set of people or person is safe and really just check that box first in order to be able to do other things is you know is this business of um determining veilance and the role of the amydala in that kind of the first gate that we have to walk through anytime we're in a new environment for instance you showed up here today and you mentioned you know I think I locked my car and um and I said you'll be fine in this neighborhood either way and then you walked in and presumably you were taking in the new environment meeting some new people um we had a little discussion about caffeine uh a little discussion about alcohol and presumably because you and I know one another you felt safe I would hope so but presumably the amydala is always performing this role even if we have some prior knowledge about something just figuring out am I safe here where are the exits where are the entrances uh who's here what's their story um do you think all of that is is operating and do you think it's always conscious or is it largely unconscious to us okay so there's a few different questions there um first I want to address the the question about novelty and then I want to come back to this the other issue of conscious but um the way that amigdala works is its job is is to assign meaning to anything that could have motivational significance and so if it's a brand new thing we're paying attention we're seeing if if it if it mattered did it matter and so I think anything that's novel even if we don't know what it means a loud sound you've never heard before um um even if it signifies nothing of motivational significance the first few times that you're presented with it you'll get an amigdalar response so you see this in the lab play the tone for the first time and then there's a response that rapidly decays when the tone doesn't end up predicting anything that the the animal can can detect or human is this also true in this is true in humans um if you're the type of person that puts your phone on do not disturb versus has it on vibrate and you know sometimes it's always vibrating and it's just it vibrates all the time whereas I put my phone on do not disturb and so when someone else's phone rings it's very startling to me but they're they don't even notice because their phone that's just the sound their phone makes it makes it all the time so I think it has to do with how many times you're presented with it and it's a startle response so the first few times that you are presented with a stimulus uh the amydala will respond and then it decays very quickly and then only if that stimulus predicts something important or something rewarding or or punishing then uh will will it begin to respond again so it's it's like you're giving everything novel a chance to to tell you in one trial in single trial learning um if something's going to happen and so um I think a fire alarm is a great example you know fire alarm goes off you're you're instantly you know you're looking around is there anything happening even even just people rushing out you know there's there's this the Salient thing that you're going to respond to and you know if you have lot of fire drills then you might respond differently after a while so I think that's the habituation component you mentioned that the igala will respond to a novel stimulus um and if it predicts something interesting then other things happen we'll talk about those um if not the amydala stops responding and you said something really important which is that the amydala will respond to something that is predicting reward or punishment and I think most people don't realize that in fact I think a lot of early career neurobiologists don't realize that that the amydala is not just involved in fear and Punishment um so when we talk about the amydala presumably we're talking about the amydala complex a bunch of other things so is it true that there are neurons in the amydala complex that predict reward and others that predict fear and Punishment yeah so um as a graduate student I worked on a part of the amydala called the basolateral amydala it's still a complex within the broader amydala um this brain region is cortical like in that it's mostly glutamatergic neurons with some gab argic neurons mixed in but without the same structure that the cortex has um and I studied the that mdala in the context of reward I found essentially that when you induce plasticity you get a synaptic strengthening when you uh when animals learn things amigdala neurons fire in response to cues that predict rewards and this was you coming into the context of a field that had shown that this happens with fear and so this became I I remember my the very first time I gave um a SC a presentation at a scientific conference I was a junior graduate student I was given a 10-minute talk at the you know inaugural amigdala a Gordon research conference many famous professors were speaking and there were two talks about the amigdala and reward and I was one of them and the response to the talk was just how is this possible how can how can the amydala how can how can you get the same readout for reward and fear and really it came to be there's two two possibilities I mean there's more possibilities but the main two possibilities are number one that the amydala wasn't specific for fear at all it just responds to anything important if it's important it responds period the other possibility is that the amydala is sending has different neurons that respond to positive and negative predictive stimuli and sends this information to different Downstream targets to respond differently obviously I respond differently to a reward I walk towards it I I consume it a punishment I'm avoiding it and so clearly the behaviors are diametrically opposed and so to me it seemed very possible at least that that there was a Divergence point and maybe this could be it and so we just did some very simple experiments when I first started my lab to trace the projection targets of amydala neurons and record and so everything's all mixed up together so it's not obvious that they would that that this would be a fork in the road but when you look at them you do see that there are projections that come from the amigdala that are predominantly encoding either reward or fear and there's many different projections and um you know this is just the beginning but this was a time when it was a novel concept to even think that neurons from one region could have completely different functions going to different Downstream targets which now seems totally obvious um and it there's hundreds and hundreds of papers showing it now but at the time it was difficult to get this work published because that's just not how people thought about information moving through the brain I guess well I think um first of all such important work and so wonderful to be uh early in the the phase of recasting how the brain works which is what you did um I think most people in the general public still think amydala fear and uh clearly it's able to Signal reward and Punishment as you discovered and are now pointing out um I'm curious does the amydala have a direct line to some of the organs of the body that can change our bodily activation State heart breathing rate um muscle tension because I think most of us experience fear and reward as both in our head in our brains but also of the body great question great question so um I'll tell you the clues that lead me to my current working model which may you know is not necessarily the final word but I would say that I think the amydala complex as we're discussing it these 13 subnuclei that reside you know in the temporal lobe they are important for assigning importance but they're not important for producing the actual autonomic arousal that we associate with Panic or fear the reason I say this is there's a famous case study patient SM who have has bilateral damage to her amyd and um in you know no responses to emotional faces no responses to fearful stimuli um but if you if capable of having the Panic response due to low to to Suffocation associated with with Suffocation and so there's still the ability to produce that panic and arousal response um it's just not the cognitive evaluation of it I think that's what we think the amydala is doing is assigning that it it does receive information from the rest of the body um there are for example gin receptors in the amydala things that can sense hunger and um we've done some some work looking at this kind of inspired by I'm not sure if this if you're familiar with this study um it's a controversial study Dan zigger 2011 but where the Supreme Court judges they they looked at Supreme Court Judge rulings on on parole decisions um across the day relative to meal breaks and you can see right after it's like it's like breakfast you know 90% everybody's getting P everybody's getting out yeah and then it just drops to 10% then there's lunch then we're back to 80% and then it just precipitously drops to single digits again W so the judges are changing the leniency of their rulings depending on how wellfed they are you know there there are counterarguments to this but that is strongly what the data suggests you know it is not a controlled study it's just a striking correlation um but it's the it's it's not a completely novel concept the hangry phenomenon I'm sure I don't know everybody's different I certainly experience it um but we we think that when you are getting strong signals from the body for example you know I think I think the amdal is going to be able to detect a lot of different homeostatic inputs even though we haven't we don't have evidence for that yet but for specifically energy balance when you're hungry um your amydala can detect it perhaps through grin receptors or other other you know mechanisms um and then what we see is that in that food deprive after one day of food dep deprivation for mice um you can see this shift in the balance between the positive veilance um encoding projection neurons and the negative bance and coating projection neurons and a at Baseline fear trumps all the negative projection neurons you know can silence the reward projection ones which makes sense if I need to run away from this Predator you know I can't I can't worry about eating this food right now but if I'm in a near starvation like state which for my they have very high metabolism so one day without food is a really big deal deal um they only last a few days so um at this point they are kicking into survival mode where actually getting food becomes the the greater need and you'll see animals you know hunting in ways they normally wouldn't hunt when when they're really desperate and so this mode of of food deprivation shifts things so that the reward um pathway actually has stronger power to to influence and silence the uh fear pathway than before wow the brain is so smart it really is it can take what we normally think of as a priority list fear and staying safe is more important than food reward and then if food and acquiring food is critical to survival it can invert all that is what you're saying exactly amazing and it happens you know in a day it seems reversible so that's something that we're looking at right now and thinking about um how specific is this this to food is this true for lots of different things what about exercise other other stressors that are you know potentially more positive the amydala is able to detect a lot of different signals from the environment and we're not sure how all of that gets in there um so I think one of the the detection of the environment has been you know really well worked out in terms of our basic sensory modalities but think about the things that really affect your emotions day-to- day at least for me as a human in this Society the things that affect my emotions mostly today are almost entirely social interactions very subtle ones ones that don't seem to threaten my life or safety you know very small subtle um social interactions are are what you know have the greatest bearing I think on um my emotional evaluation and my emotional bandwidth and what is that how do we detect that how do we assemble this information apply all the Nuance you know put on the onion layers of social programming to come out with whatever you know I interpret this gesture to mean it's it's pretty incredible and so that's kind of where uh my research program has has been sliding it's such a interesting area let's drill into it a bit um and to put it in context maybe um talk about social media um so on social media um whether or not it's Instagram or X those are seem to be the two major platforms I'm not on Tik Tok um people say stuff sometimes they say positive things sometimes they see say negative things sometimes they say things that are sort of neutral um so it seems to me that nowadays if one is on these social media platforms that we are um we've sort of crowdsourced this phenomenon of social interaction in a way that we hadn't before because I I grew up prior to the Advent of social media and I could bring my physical body into certain environments and not others even at high school I could hang out we had an area called the Batcave where you know skateboarders and some other at that time Misfits hung out with the quad where the cool kids hung out um Etc you could you could pick your Niche okay social media is not like that you can pick followers they can pick you Etc but I think since most people have social media nowadays seems or on there in some ways that we've placed ourselves in the center of an arena which we have a ton of incoming input we all most of us have amigdalas two of them amigdala you pointed out one on each side of the brain and presumably we're on these platforms to receive positive feedback and avoid negative feedback however there does seem to be a cohort of people who seem to like the friction of com combat or kind of let's just call it high friction interactions or moderate friction interactions they like to argue they like to parse ideas it's not all bad necessarily um so have you ever looked at social media in your in your own mind looked at social media through the lens of of amydala filtering or through the lens of of neural circuit filtering and wondered um what's going on there that someone with without your in-depth knowledge of these brain circuitries would not think to uh look at that landscape through or maybe we could just do that now as a as as a kind of playful exper I like that um so I a lot of people ask me about social media from the context of is this of is this social contact meaningful is this positive does this count does this help you not feel lonely um and of course I don't know the answer we haven't done that particular study yet and I don't I don't know of that specific study having been performed but my prediction um is that it's not going to do much because I I believe that a key component of what I would consider social contact heavily depends on having some interbrain synchrony some interaction in in that is synchronous and I think with social media sometimes there can be an engaging dialogue that plays out in near real time but generally speaking it's asynchronous you're looking at things that are happened that you're not a part of you're excluded from all these things they happened in Australia yesterday and I'm on there saying cool love it and then the person's already asleep yes exactly that's what you mean by ASN asynchronous like that we're not experiencing things at the same time it's not a shared experience you know that in in terms of that having that Bond necessarily and so I've never actually been asked about how the amydala processes social media um I guess I think what happens is you know the amydala is just responding to stimuli it's sending up bottom up signals you know it's a caricature of of um bottom up and top down processing let's give an example that I'm I'm walking down the street and all of a sudden I hear like a really ferocious dog barking at me all going crazy and then I get super scared and then I realize okay there's a fence so the amydala detect you know heard the dog barking he there's a dog barking and you know I'm freaking out then my prefrontal cortex realizes there the F it looks very sturdy this fence looks stable and then I'm relaxing and I'm resuming my walking normally you know I think that's sort of the dance that our brain is doing when we have top down and bottom up uh information that we're trying to stay focused so for me I think when I'm on social media there's so many stimuli that that are evoking responses and um to be completely transparent and I know this is not something that everybody else does or can do or is necessarily what's best for them but I work very hard to control input from the top down um in terms of I really really limit the amount I I basically don't check email or go on social media I would say I'm on social media or email less than one hour per week basically per week per week all I have to say to that is congratulations we'll talk about social media again in a second but as a fellow professor email once a week I've heard of people scheduling their times for email responses but once a week that is awesome I have have people who help me get through it and filter out what's important but otherwise I just whenever I do my own email I say yes to all these things then I make all these plans and then I'm and then I'm have too many trips and I'm responding fra fragmented fragmented and it's just you know overc committing and I think um I know my limits sometimes it's difficult for me to be in my amydala mode responding to stimuli and yet letting my prefrontal cortex do its thing so I've set some very heavy prefrontal cortically selected limits of the input I put in so that my brain can function and be clear I can't be creative I can't have epiphanies if there's all this clutter of like writing this person back and blah blah blah blah blah tweet tweet it's just you know trash out wipe squeegee squeegee the brain down so that we can actually grow something beautiful and new well and I want to re-emphasize what I said in my introduction which is that I mean you are oh so productive and when I say productive I don't just mean productive like plug-and chug you you the work you've done is incredibly creative you transformed our understanding of what this famous structure the amydala actually does I mean you've made so many important discoveries as a consequence of presumably other things but including wiping away all this incoming and clutter as you said controlling the top- down inputs I have to ask just from a practical standpoint during that one hour a week are you reading every email that came in or are you just being very selective about which emails so you're not opening most emails no I don't open most emails amazing no I just I search for the ones that my assistant identifies as the one I need to open there's like a list of things that I'd be interested in and then we'll go through the list and then you know sometimes it requires me to go and find the email and respond to it myself because it that is and then I will do that for 10 you know 10 10 minutes a day or something do you recommend get out of there as soon as I can love it um do you pass on this advice to the people that you train I think it depends on what resources and what's your what's the what's your job right now right so I think um as a trainee I definitely did my as assistant professor I did my own emails but at a certain point um I was just never getting to the bottom and then it would just stress me out make me feel overwhelmed and what is my job my job is to number one be a stable core of a sustainable research program and um that just requires me having a lot of mental health and well-being and um and and clear-mindedness and I need to be able to come up with creative ideas I need to be able to Sprint when there's a deadline and I I just can't exhaust my system with unnecessary I would call them quad four in the time management quadrant if you're familiar with this you know important urgent certain things are urgent but not important some things are Urgent some things are neither important nor urgent that's most emails are are like if you read time management literature and you have the luxury to have someone else help you or something that's like so well trained to be really good at Capt capturing things that are important and you know sometimes I miss emails but emails are not the way my traines would reach me they would reach me in a different way um and then emails are for everyone else that I didn't give my number two you know I feel so honored to have have your contact I'd like to take a brief moment and thank one of our sponsors and that's ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens I started taking ag1 way back in 2012 the reason I started taking it and the reason I still take it every day is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas for vitamins and minerals and it ensures that I get enough Prebiotic and probiotic to support gut health now gut health is something that over the last 10 years we realized is not just important for the health of our gut but also for our immune system and for the production of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators things like dopamine and serotonin in other words gut health is critical for proper brain functioning now of course I strive to consume healthy Whole Foods for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day but there are a number of things in ag1 including specific micronutrients that are hard to get from Whole Foods or at least in sufficient quantities so ag1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals that I need probiotics prebiotics the adaptogens and critical micronutrients so anytime somebody asks me if they were to take Just One supplement what that supplement should be I tell them ag1 because ag1 supports so many different systems within the body that are involved in mental health physical health and performance to try ag1 go to drink a1.com huberman and you'll get a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 and five free travel packs of ag1 again that's a drink a1.com huberman I think this is wonderful advice for people to hear um we have a future guest on this podcast named Cal Newport he wrote the book deep work and he has another book called the world without email he's a computer science professor at Georgetown where he talks extensively about the tremendous career but also relationship and life value of doing essentially what you're describing although I do think Kay that you represent kind of the extreme of what I've um become aware of in terms of people that can limit the amount of time on uh social media platforms and email anyway I just want to say um congratulations I just want to say that again and I think it even if people don't reduce to one hour per week I think that making some effort toward reducing the amount of incoming as you said controlling the top- down inputs to the amydala but also to the rest of the brain involved in Creative processing Etc is so key and we actually do have agency it's just as it's it's tough um sometimes to build up that discipline so uh you're doing a tremendous service by sharing that somebody as successful as you does this presumably is successful in part because you do this could we by extension say that many people since billions of people are on social media are likely um triggering the activation of their amydala clouding out other more potentially productive activation of their neural circuits by sort of just making themselves freely available to the to the uh thoughts and words and impulses of others I mean to me it seems the answer would be yes but I'd like to know what you think I mean I think um and there's something to be said there's definitely been moments where I've I've you know gone a deep into social media and spent more time in a certain burst right that is isolated and I think that there's a lot to be learned from social media so to actually to bring it back to one point you mentioned earlier um on social media sometimes people Pro just want accolades and sometimes there's a lot of of friction one of the reasons I stay on social media even though I'm making this big effort to sort of declutter my Consciousness is because of that feedback especially when you know for someone like you I imagine this has got to be super true and even for me at a certain point in my career it just felt like people don't want to tell me bad news to my face as much anymore everybody's so positive all the the time and you know what they what are they really thinking and social media allows you the protection of anonymity to say what you really think without um consequence essentially and so on the one hand the consequence-free um nature of being able to just say things can be very dangerous but at the same time for me I really value just being able to receive it I I'm you know know I'm a big girl I can filter out what I want when I get the all the inputs but if I don't receive the inputs sometimes it's hard to learn from the feedback I'm not getting so even sometimes feedback is given in a not very nice way I can still create a model for someone else that has this perspective that I can take with me and that can be another perspective I can honor easily in the future because I have this theory of mind for someone some someone would get upset about that you know that's something that could be harmful to people who are you know have this theory of mind so I think it's super valuable from that perspective and that's why I continue to use it great yeah I I really applaud that as well I I always read my teaching evals because they're Anonymous and yes I do wonder you know what grade the different uh people who gave different evals you know got I don't know that information I sometimes wonder do they attend the class or are they just angry they didn't do well on the exam but that really represents the small fraction of feedback that I'm um that I wonder about most of it um that's valuable to me is the hey you know liked the course but these parts really sucked Professor huberman or this part was completely unclear or completely hated the way you blank blank and blanked because that feedback is something I can really work with to improve so I think um course EV vals are are similar to what you're describing I think there's there if I were to just look at the the positive feedback and then ignore the negative feedback and write those people off then I don't think I could improve as a teacher actually I always encourage comments and feedback and suggestions in the YouTube comments for this podcast for that reason and I do read the comments I go through and I read and um a few of them sting um but you know the positive feedback is great too sometimes it's more of this please y or less of that please I think there there's information in that um so I think it sounds like you've been doing all of these things naturally I so so actually then uh since I've had my research group my my lab um we do an anonymous lab survey every it's supposed to be about every 18 months and then it's a whole long process of going through it and it's just evolved it's I think it's the fourth or fifth time we've done it and so it's now I think it's like 70 questions it's so many question we got maybe we should we should trim it down but it it ends up being hundreds of pages of of text you know short answer sometimes long answer feedback from anonymously from people in my lab my lab is pretty big so it's it's you know I'm not even trying to really guess who is saying it it's just feedback and it takes me months to go through with it and and get all the feedback and it is so useful I mean in a class the the the amount of contact that you have is it's it's restricted to this very specific time and space whereas when you're mentoring someone over the course of years there's a lot of different there's a lot of different points of of content and interaction and you know you're in the lab all 40 hours a week or whatever and you know going trips meeting here there's just a lot of different different ways to improve and ways we've never you know I haven't had any training in how to be a really great mentor and so I'm getting that training now I'm making my own course and my mentees are my teachers and um I really am grateful for the the tutelage that they provide for free in this Anonymous must survey sometimes it makes me cry but sometimes it makes me feel really good about something that I'm doing that's working and in any case it makes me feel that I have ground truth I guess I still don't know but when people say things that sting um it makes me feel like they're saying what they really think and they're not holding back it doesn't you know and um bad news feels like reality and so that is very something about that is rewarding um just to feel like I have reality rather than I'm getting something else you know the the model doesn't quite fit it's very unsatisfying with the model doesn't quite fit so I love the word ground truth there's something so beautiful to that and I I resonate with um what you're saying let's go back to social interaction something that your lab is doing um lots of work on nowadays and maybe we could shift to the sorts of social interaction that most of us are familiar with the um sitting across the table having a coffee with somebody that taking a walk with somebody maybe a phone call yeah um maybe a tough conversation um maybe a playful you know um you know unscripted conversation um maybe a meal at a holiday dinner you know there's a huge range there what what do we know about the value of social interaction at the level of sort of core biological needs at the level of neural circuits and maybe even hormones I mean you know most people have heard of oxytocin they think the love hormone but it's there's so much more there for people to understand and know about you know how important is this thing that we call social interaction and how bad do things get when we're not getting the right kinds of social interaction you know I think this is this is a great question and I'm glad that it's become something that has been recognized at a more Global and national scale just the importance of of having social support in our lives for heal for our well-being um but social isolation or even just perceived loneliness has immense Health consequences for all social species so um shortened lifespan increased mood disorders um increased actually morbidity and mortality for diseases like cancer or heart disease that you know um might not be what we would normally think and so I think understanding how each of those processes is happening those mechanisms are far from being worked out but the the correlational evidence is undeniable we're now taking this into the lab really for the first time and so something so simple as social isolation how come we don't know way more about it and um I'm someone who stumbled into the field of social isolation by accident prior to the pandemic and so I'll just say you know the whole story on why there's such a gaping hole in our knowledge as a neuroscience Community about social isolation really comes from Harry haro's work this original work of maternal separation that was undeniably cruel it it caused irreparable damage to these baby monkeys and they never recovered and sorry to interrupt I apologize I'm striving to not interrupt in my life but I but so that people are on on board um could you just briefly describe the harlo experiments yes so they're very famous experiments where they separated uh baby monkeys from their moms and then had either a wire sort of thing holding a bottle so okay what what do you miss most about the mom is it the wire is it the food or is it the the the comfort and then they had so they had a wire thing with with a milk bottle versus you know blankets and cuddly soft things and and the the baby monkeys would go to the cuddly soft thing but you know a blanket is not a replacement for a mother nobody's saying that it is and and through these experiments there's extended maternal separation and it's it it was deemed cruel um there was permanent irreparable damage when you when you rehouse these monkeys they never resocialized normally they had lots of different mental and physical health problems um and I think in humans we know that so you know solitary confinement is considered torture um you know social isolation is a difficult thing to study in in a lot of conditions and we stumbled onto it by complete accident through working with a postdoc a former postdoc in my lab Jillian Matthews who was a graduate student um doing an experiment on on it was just trying to figure out if these dopamine neurons um would also respond to cocaine the way VTA these sorry these vental tegmental area dopamine were known to respond to cocaine wanted to see if these other dopamine respond to cocaine so sort of a incremental study so when you do these cocaine studies you you inject the animal with cocaine or saline and then leave the naive animal in the cage and then you take brain slices record from the neurons and look at the synaptic strengths and so you know the expected outcome sort of was that these dopamine would would be similar to other dopamine erand that showed in you know long-lasting potentiation after a single dose of cocaine but what happened instead was that yes there was potentiation in the cocaine animals there's also potentiation in the saline animals relative to the naive group and this was a huge puzzle what was this and it turned out through many many different experiments um that it's actually because when you inject animals with cocaine you're separating them from the group because they act they act all crazy this is what the way people did the experiment so you inject them with saline you separate them the naive animals just stay there so with their other lit their other litter mates I see so the control group the saine control group is actually a social isolation condition so by accident this control group that didn't make sense was how we stumbled onto so then we tried is it novel cage it's not the novel cage it's the it's the social isolation and so um that is how we became a lab that studied social isolation it was complete accident we weren't sure what what we were looking at and then um we man we found these neurons and we manipulated these neurons and they produced um something very different than other dopamine neurons which normally if you stimulate dopamine neurons these vental tental area midbrain dops like 90% of the time when you you hear people talk about dopam NS they mean these ones and they're the ones where you press the lever stimulate the ner will press the lever thousands of times you know and they love to be stimulated yes if if you're a human and you do cocaine you you most people love cocaine they they want they're very pro-social when they're on cocaine and so that's what dopamine neurons were thought to be doing but these other dopamine neurons in the dorsal rap that I will also say is in the brain stem near to an aqueduct where you could detect signals from the body um but these other dopamine neurons in the raap they when you stimulate them animals don't like it they will not work for reward they actually will move away from a space that's where they're being stimulated you know condition place and real-time Place aversion I don't like the feeling of these neurons being activated please stop it and yet they would be pro-social and so for a long time this was super confusing we couldn't understand it and then just because at the same time we had a um a hunger study going on in the lab we just thought about it like I can eat food because it's delicious and I I want to eat this yummy treat or I can eat because I'm super hungry I feel shaky I'm just to eat this nasty fiber bar the bot of my backpack because I'm so desperate and I need like I need my my blood sugar is dangerously low you know and so there's two reasons that you can eat and one of them is uncomfortable hunger is not comfortable you don't it's not a good feeling to be hungry and so we thought about this and that's kind of how we circularly came around to thinking I think we've discovered the loneliness neurons essentially and so what is loneliness and loneliness is this unpleasant need state of wanting social contact that would have this pro-social effect as well and so um that's basically the very serendipitous loop-de-loop way that I came to be um uh studying how loneliness is represented in the brain amazing before we talk a bit more about these loneliness neurons and some of their inputs and outputs in the brain um how has the discovery of these neurons um perhaps changed the way that you organize your day and week in life right um if at all um for instance are you more aware of how much time you spend alone versus with others are you um more careful or Discerning about who you spend your time with um you know I I asked this um because you know there's so many examples for me in the Neuroscience literature where you know I learned something new about how the brain works and I think oh yeah you know it makes a lot of sense why my sleep isn't great you know it turns out that light exposure to the eyes at particular times of day really sets the whole body and brain into particular rhythms that you know explain why I was a little depressed when I was in graduate school staying up all night doing experiments and I'd sleep much of the day and feel like I was getting 8 nine hours I don't get 8 to nine hours now but um you know and when I wake up early for me personally there's a bit of an anti-depressant effect as long as I slept the night before seasonal effect disorder is real right so you know I think as new information comes online um at least for me it's it's changed the way that I organize my life to to s in subtle or or in not so subtle ways so the idea that there are neurons in the brain that encode loneliness the absence of social contact does that have you thinking you know after a few days of managing the lab uh with which as you point out you have a very large lab lots of social interaction but it's work context social interaction does that um has that led you to think hey you know we should go out to dinner as a lab or I should spend time with somebody who's not in science um or I should spend time by myself because I've had too much social interaction I'm not asking for strict protocols here I'm just wondering if you're willing to get um like play in the sandbox of this with me a bit um how this information perhaps has shaped some of your choices you personally and and be very clear I'm not asking you to dictate what other people do um has it changed your social life so it's really interesting that you ask this question and now that you you know now that you're asking it this way um I I mean of course when I learn new things I I I um take them and Implement them into my life but to be honest in in the cycle of of you know learning and studying and being curious and I actually think where I reside more is when something's going on with me my research program you know research is Mee search it becomes what the re it dictates what the research program evolves into and so for ex for example so I've just had started studying loneliness um a few years before the pandemic hit and then the pandemic hit and it was just a step function like change I went from I'm never alone unless you being in an Uber Alone um or being on a plane and and and just you know constantly people in my office even when I'm going to the bathroom someone's waiting for me outside like you know I'm not it's like I'm hurrying in the bathroom I'm never alone there's like four people in my bed kicking me in the face I'm just you know there's just so much Social contact and then boom you know there would be a day I wouldn't see another like you know just the a not zero but just extremely sudden drop of social contact when there's no more work and you know it was just that that period of time and it was it was very depressing it was just this huge I felt like I was in freef fall and it made me you know at first it was really disruptive and I was worried about myself you know and then at some point I adjusted to it and then I got used to working from home I got started a garden like I got all this you know I got you know I just started a different life pattern that involved a lot of alone time and you know some an alone time personal life AG grew where there wasn't any space for anything to grow before and then I became comfortable with it and so then I start thinking about that that's really where the idea of social homeostasis was born this idea that okay why is it with acute social isolation humans monkeys mice you know you acutely isolate the individual from the social group you reintroduce them to the social group rebound of pro-social interaction oh so happy to see you there's like all these affiliative interactions a Hu a burst of affiliative interactions whereas with chronic social isolation in humans monkeys mice even flies you reintroduce into the social group and you get territorial Behavior aggression avoidance antisocial behavior um or just you know sort of a very different negative veence response to the exposure to the group and so this maybe people brushed it off for a long time is just oh it's confusing this literature is inconsistent or maybe there's one model that makes it all make sense that is social home homeostasis where you know you're used to getting this at a certain point and so my affector system gets activated I I detect that I'm alone it's I want more the deficits detected then my affector systems gets activated this and then I start spinning all the systems that try to get me back into contact I'm calling my friends I'm texting my friend I'm I'm if I'm a mouse I'm making ultrasonic vocalizations I'm exploring outside of the burrow and then you know if my friends don't call me back they're like sorry we don't want to see anyone till end of covid bye whatever it is you know you it's it's not working my correction efforts are failing or maybe a certain amount of time we don't know then I give up I stop I stop calling I stop going out I just make a different life you know you the the the they don't you don't leave the burrow whatever it is and there's in in animals and humans at least behaviorally there's a near step function like drop off of attempts to you know you could see sort of dat oh then they just give up on dating after this one you know whatever happens there's some some straw that breaks the camels back and then this person doesn't want to date anymore or doesn't want to go out anymore whatever and and what is that so that adaptation then you're at a new Baseline you're You're Expecting now your new normal I'm I'm expecting to have a gardening day at home alone not see anyone and then and then a bunch of people come over it feels like a surplus so my previous Optimum you know reintroduction to the social group is now feeling like a surplus an overload overstimulated and that's I think something that a lot of people experience this Whiplash of going into the pandemic and coming out of it different people to different levels it depends on how much you you know isolated while you were on in the pandemic but I think thinking about um your social set point as being being flexible and dynamic Was A New Concept to me and then in my mind the question is what is the part of this process that is causing all these harmful Health consequences like shorten lifespan mood disorders Etc is it the initial detection that I'm missing something and affect your system activation because if that was the case maybe I want to Band-Aid that you know maybe I want to get get a pet get a get a get a zoom buddy I don't know what you know you would have different prescriptions and advice to give people if that were the case versus you would give almost opposite advice if the thing that's causing it is the the set point adaptation then you want to you want to save it off versus if you wanted to accelerate getting into the set point which is better you know is it the adaptation or is it you know kind of trying to fix it and so in one case you would want to ease off the the having the set point happen the set point transition happen in the other case rip it off like a bandaid cold turkey Just Adjust and then you'll be fine you know then you won't worry about it then you won't be lonely anymore because you'll just be comfortable being alone you know people talk about cognitive flexibility um and I think it's it's sort of like that but it's social flexibility I want to be able to be alone I also want to be able to be in a large group and be comfortable and so I think what I've done if anything to change my lifestyle um to accommodate these new insights I've had is is to consciously create Dynamic social experiences lots of social EXP expences yes but also protecting alone time which I never did before I just I just just just gave it all away and you know I realized that having that just made my social homeostatic system feel more elastic and flexible and resilient and less like a crisis if something you know I'm very comfortable being alone I'm super comfortable with my own skin now and it requires investing in that relationship I like how you framed uh earlier I think we were not not recording yet but the relationship with yourself as being a very important relationship and um when I think about brain States you know we don't know this yet but my working model would be that different individuals we represent their identities and whenever they're present it creates a unique Ensemble of that combination of people being present and being alone is also a unique state that cannot be achieved I have the brain state of being alone I cannot achieve it if anyone else is around and that's just what you know that's kind of the working model I have I think what you're saying is uh essential for people to hear because um it makes sense that loneliness would hurt um it makes sense that some people are more extroverted which I think is defined as getting energy from social interactions and resetting energy through social interactions as opposed to introverted which by the way folks introverts like myself do enjoy social interaction it's just that we reset through more um Solo or one-on-one time than we do in larger groups that's my understanding of the introversion extroversion literature we can revisit that but this notion of social homeostasis is I think so key uh important enough that I think we probably want to redefine it um as many times or restate it rather as many times as it's necessary because I believe what you're describing is the same thing that one would experience with food if we eat a lot we're consuming I know 3500 calories a day and then um suddenly we only have access to 1,800 calories a day there's it feels like a deficit because indeed it is whereas after some period of time at 1,800 calories a day 2200 calories a day feels like relative abundance relative abundance um when the pandemic hit I certainly um was unhappy about the State of Affairs in the world of course um but I recall feeling like oh my goodness I finally don't have to commute 90 minutes in each Direction ction to Stanford CU I lived in the East Bay at that time um I felt like I had time to do things I hadn't done in a long time and uh thanks to zoom I was able to get certain things done not others then after about six to eight months when I realized this is going to carry on for a while I remember feeling quite lonely and making some efforts to repair that I think social media not to harp on social media um could do either one of two things and I don't know which in the context of uh social homeostasis either going on Instagram and seeing a lot of familiar faces and comments and accounts could make me feel like I'm getting some social interaction such that then when I close that app and move to my work at my desk or something uh which these days is mostly done um solo um that I would feel like I had social interaction or perhaps it's the equivalent of um calories that um then makes me feel more isolated when I'm not in the app perhaps I find it to be distinctly different than like the experience I had last night of going to dinner with someone I know quite well sitting down and having a open-ended conversation and deciding to close out the night only when we realize you know we got to get up tomorrow for work so when our separate ways um there's something that felt very sading about it so I wonder in this context of social homeostasis whether or not the analogy of social interaction to C caloric intake we could is there another dimension to it where it's not just the total number of calories or the total amount of social interaction but the quality of social interaction the type of social interaction that actually feels like nourishment as opposed to just calories I love where you're going with this and and so um when we wrote this review the first time we you know we're we're conceptu this idea of of how your social set point can change based on if if you're acutely isolated or or chronically isolated and um the Y AIS is the quality SL quantity of detected social contact which is so fuzzy and you know there's it's it's again one of the most challenging frontiers of this field because how even if we measured every single component that the brain can detect of the social the social contact so much of it is about expectation you know like if I think I got a gesture if if I get a nod from the president I'm like oh my god did the president just nod at me that's so exciting versus if I get a nod from my partner I'm like oh my God are they mad at me what's going on why why did I just get a nod right it totally matters the gesture you need the identity there's many different cognitive systems that need to all plug in to this wheel um to make it spin so I think that uh that is one of the the I I think that's going to keep us busy for a while but in terms of your question about social media and when you switch from you know getting social media feedback and then doing work um I think I think it really depends I mean social media is such a large category you can have many different types of responses generally I think the bounds so you know when you say social media versus a real life interaction where you're with someone maybe you're touching maybe you're not touching but even if you're having conversation um you have interbrain synchrony you are um having a lot of interbrain security you're in the same place if but you can have interbrain Security even on the phone right just a voice call is actually a lot more interbrain synchrony than than messages I think I think text messages can bring a lot of anxiety and there's been a lot of commentary about that um and same thing with with with social media I think the the thing about social media that is perhaps um the most harmful or NE negative I think in terms of I when I'm thinking about social nourishment if I you know sort of making that term up on the Fly here but um it's it's almost a withdrawal when social media is posted it's not to you it's to everyone and you could be one of the people that receives this message but it's not even what to you I'm not even talking to you and I'm doing something that's without you otherwise you'd be in this picture and not reading on social media listening to whatever so it's like by almost exclusively you're you're posting about activities that you're being excluded from and someone's not even really talking to you unless they're D you know direct messaging you but then I I kind of consider that a different category if it's like a onetoone communication social media to me is is a blast right it's not it's just you know catching up with someone on social media I I don't really see the Merit of it because I'll just catch up with them when I catch up with them and their kids will just be like way older but you know I don't know I'll actually really catch up with them then just see pictures of you know I don't know I I feel mixed about it because it's not a real connection and it doesn't for me Sate my social appetite to catch up with to to look at someone else's profile on on social media um that doesn't actually do anything for the the connection I I don't know but I seriously doubt tons of oxytocin is released when I you know follow someone's feed about their vacation so I don't know I would I think that it definitely matters the quality and social media is is different than real life interactions for many reasons I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor insid tracker insid tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term Health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test now a major problem with a lot of blood tests out there however is that you get information back about metabolic factors lipids and hormones and so forth but you don't know what to do with that information with inside tracker they make it very easy because they have a personalized platform that allows you to see the levels of all those things metabolic factors lipids hormones Etc but it gives you specific directives that you can follow that relate to nutrition behavioral modifications supplements Etc that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you if you'd like to try inside tracker you can go to insidetracker docomo to get 20% off any of insid tracker's plans again that's insidetracker docomo I really appreciate your willingness to uh explore in this uh in this context I think your mention of the fact that um real life interaction involves interbrain synchron could be by text scaling up from that by phone um FaceTime or something akin to that video video chat um on social media there is comments back and forth um although that's timec consuming and it's difficult because there's anonymity people are in different places different time zones if you don't know someone it's different context um so I'm really thanks to what you're describing I'm really starting to think about social media as so different than in-person social interactions or by phone or video chat social interactions and how those would differentially impact social homeostasis and it's leading me at least to conclude that at least for me that most social media interactions would create more hunger as opposed to a um sading of of the need for social interaction it's um I have to be careful with the analogies here but since I can do this I I was almost going to make an analogy between um porn pornography uhuh in-person sexual intimacy I suppose there's something in between where people could talk by phone but we don't want to explore this in any kind of salacious way and then um sexual intimacy with with uh with emotion with positive emotion right those there's a scaling Factor there and I'm not P I'm not putting um judgment or veilance I'm I'm certainly not that's not my place as a good friend of mine says I'm not a cop you know I'm not telling people what to do they can't do but it's so interesting to think about these um these circuits within us that create these what you and I in our field call repetitive the desire for or aversive the desire to move away from type responses and how so much of our life aside from you because you're regulating your social media and your uh and your email intake but so much of Life Now is offering us the opportunity to um tickle these circuits or even hit them hard with a Sledgehammer but we're not thinking about these homeostatic mechanisms of whether or not they're creating more hunger for or more satisfaction from yeah and I I I cannot emphasize enough how critical this is and I think that's because you know I'm somebody who does spend a fair amount of time on social media a lot of my my work exists on social media YouTube Etc and I would hope that the work that we're putting into the world with this podcast is creating a assciation of the desire for information rather than a Hunger for More I do hope that but I recognize that educational material on social media represents the the a tiny tiny fraction of what's there so social homeostasis I think is a term that if people haven't already stamped into their mind they should be stamping into their mind and and Dr K Tai deserves credit for that I don't uh I will say that so you don't have to um I've heard you say before you wrote in a review something akin to social contact is either positive or negative when it's deficient or in excess which is I think what you're describing as is social homeostasis is that right when we talked about the quality and quantity um there's just in terms of contact just amount of contact there's such a thing as just the right amount there's some thing is too little there's such a thing as too much there's overcrowding right it doesn't matter who it can be your family it could just sometimes it's like a lot maybe your family depends you know do you know the famous rum dos quote no think you're enlightened go spend a weekend with your parents no no disrespect Mom and Dad I know right um but um I think with quality it matters so much like I was sort of saying before you know the same gesture from the president or my partner it's going to feel very different to me whether that was a slight or a you know it's just it's relative to what is appropriate for our rank for our prior history of relationships for you know the the environmental context and so I think with social media in general and I agree social media is great for a lot of things I mean I and I I I think that having a podcast like this that is accessible to the public makes research more sustainable so I have a lot of things to say about science communication that I'm very you know grateful for but in terms of social media think about the mutual investment when you are interacting with someone on soci social media what are they investing in this connection so if I put out a post about my vacation that is public I'm investing 000000000000 Z one% of my bandwidth to make contact with you you know what I mean and so it's it's it scales up from them if if you're making a voice call with someone you're giving them at least most of your attention for the time that you're on the call that's a lot right whereas you know so so just thinking about the investment is another component there's the realtime component and then there's the the investment component who is it coming from it matters if you're anonymous I really I cannot tell what this means you know a compliment from an or or a hate hate comment or a love comment from Anonymous person I don't know what to do with this you like I just literally don't know how to you know it doesn't really doesn't really do anything for me because I don't know how to interpret it it's almost you know uninterpretable without this other dimension that my brain is has evolved to look for I think so that's you know speculation but I think social media is is operating in a way that that is not ethological and not designed to make us feel better it's just designed to make us want to use it and I think a lot of this comes down to things that are relative you know there's the famous um there's the famous observations if if a monkey sees Another Monkey get a cucumber it's happy with the Cucumber but if a monkey sees the other monkey get grape monkey wants grape you know you want you want to keep up with the Joneses you want what if you see someone else having something suddenly it feels like a loss that you don't have it that you didn't even think that of this thing that you needed right and so I think social media is exposing you to a lot of things that you don't you know that it's it's like this this parameter space you didn't have there's all these things you didn't know you were missing that you didn't need to miss out on and so we have this whole project now we have two projects one that's looking at Social isolation and and following what happens with social isolation across the time course to try to understand is it the amount of time or is it the amount of effort that you put into correcting that deficit um that that makes you leads you to the giving up you know kind of state change and another project that um is about the quality of social contact specifically social exclusion so a different kind of deficit you're with your other animals but there's this this you you know it's four animals that have are um are cagemates and um three animals are on one side able to drink a chocolate milkshake and the other animals ex excluded and this one excluded animal will go up against the the divider and and you know look look frantic and you know ex exhibit lots of behaviors that we would associate in humans with fear of missing out trying to reunite with the group trying to get the attention of the group trying to get over there a lot of attending looks frantic and studying what we think is actually going on and so I think I think coming up with paradigms to try to probe social isolation and we don't even know what behaviors animals exhibit when they're lonely this is this is a challenging field because there's no number of lever presses you know there's no there's no script to follow and there's no trial structure and so for a neuroscientist neuroscientists were trained to be be rigorous about our statistics because of the stochastic nature of neural neural activity and you know how do we process things without a trial structure how do we be statistically rigorous when the animal is just free floating deciding whatever it wants to do and so that is kind of The Crucible that my lab is is working through right now to establish pipelines and techniques and ways to quantify social behaviors and off all the layers I love where your lab is headed which just means we're going to have to have you back on here again at some point in the future to get the answers to those questions that you're now addressing I've long thought that we really know how we feel about somebody when something good happens to them or for them and I never quite understood this at the level of mechanisms how could I it's not more my lab studies but you know I think that there's a natural sort of empathy if one is a healthy uh empathic person to seeing a member of our own species and hopefully uh also to observing the members of other species um you know experiencing some discomfort we don't like that nor should we so another human is in emotional pain right um you know the whale or the Cry of loss is like one that just I think for any person who's empathically tuned is just like G or an animal you hear an animal in pain like goodness I mean I'm not here to diagnose sociopathy but if if that doesn't evoke a at least some sort of response of like oh gosh like what I wouldn't do to remove that pain that their pain is your pain empathy um that seems like a very reflexive circuit or at least I would hope so um but when somebody experiences something positive I think it's normal and healthy to have a um a graded set of responses if it's somebody that we really love um we may not even know them we think yeah like you're you're just reflexively happy for them um somebody that we dislike I think there's a more natural tendency to be like oh you know right you know as as opposed to if that person were in pain I would like to think that even if one didn't like them that you would think like oh that that sucks I'm really sorry to hear that um so I feel like there's some asymmetry in these empathic interactions they're both empathy one has negative veilance pain the other one has positive veilance another member of our species or other species receiving reward and we can Delight in that I mean I I'm almost embarrassed to admit how many ferret and Otter and raccoon accounts I follow because I love seeing them eat I love seeing the little hands of the raccoons there's some great raccoon accounts by the way um and I Delight in it I like Delight in it I want to see the raccoons win I don't know why I just I love animals and so I suppose that's why um so do you think that there that we are asymmetrically wired for this empathic Attunement um can we observe that in other animals I realize this might not be squarely in the Wheelhouse of what your lab is focusing on but I think it it relates enough to the topics that we're covering today that just you know if you'd like to speculate um uh on what might be going on there yeah I I I can definitely speculate something that we think about a lot but again you know I there's some there's some level of this which is semantic um I think of empathy as being defined as being able to understand another animal's emotion and also taking it on so I think um something that's a little bit different than emotional contagion right I see a panic I'm going a group with pan it's not the same thing as uh as as empathy um empathy is often used in in sort of certain contexts like feeling sorry for someone and it's maybe different if for feeling happy for someone and this is something I was just talking about with one of my graduate students the other day why is there is is there an asymmetry in in empathy for positive and negative or is it just what we've studied it's easier to study this so there's a number of you know we don't know the answer but I guess another conceptual framework to put out there I'm not saying it's correct it's I think just a a good tool for debate but um it's not so much that there's good people and bad people and that good people are empathic and bad people aren't uh so you that's quite so simple I I guess the way I think about it is whether you view this other social agent as having aligned goals or agendas as you or are they adversarial so if they're if they're in in your alliance whatever that means broadly defined versus adversarial you would have a different feeling and you know it's it's you see this I guess I was just I was just watching this okay this is just sort of oversharing but this is a podcast not a primary research Journal so I can just say things right so I I watch some trash TV sometimes and you know these reality competition shows where it's like then you vote the two best friends into elimination and they have to they have to eliminate each other mildly sadistic but you know then they're best friends and they like like they you know and then it's basically mutually exclusive either you can care about your friend and feel bad not wanting to send them home or you you kick it you just you know you it's game time and you you you compete and so you can see different individuals wrestling with these two brain States and and how to like what to do but they are essentially you know my my my speculation is that viewing someone as a competitor and they're an adversary they are standing in the way of me getting what I want you empathy goes down it's like inversely correlated to empathy if you are viewed as a competitor so things that would contribute to you creating a model where an in a social agent it is an adversary as opposed to an a potential ally is really what it's going to come down to to the degree that you feel empathy you know like you the second someone you realize someone's out to get you no empathy no and no more empathy for this person who I just realized is out to get me or something like that or you know uh in the case of being isolated for a long period of time you've learned to exist on your own now maybe everyone's your competitor adversary you know and none of you guys are really helping me do my dat like I don't really need you guys for anything so so I'm eating this food or whatever you know I think it just becomes different um when you're part of an ecosystem and you realize that you know there's consequences and there's there's EV every action that you take you know every Act of altruism will be recognized and there you know there's there's there's a there's some score being kept in your when you're part of a society and um and then when you're when you're not there's no there's there's none of that and so I think the degree to which you're integrated in society um it's almost like the extracellular Matrix you know this is a really this is an out there analogy but you know when you think about synapses being made um connections between people there's also all the support material that facilitates certain patterns and certain connections from happening or not happening and and I think um that's it's it's stuff that we haven't Quantified yet but it doesn't you know I think those things should be studied years ago I worked with at risk kids and and a fair number of them had just arrived um from a region of the world that had undergone dramatic sociopolitical um Evolution um and change and it was remarkable because we would put out a tray of food to eat and then the the format was everyone would serve themselves and then um you could uh go get more food if if you if everyone finished um and a couple of these kidss that had come from these very deprived environments um would just take more than their their share it was clear that by taking that other kids weren't going to get any and um and I remember telling them listen we all have to eat more or less equal parts and then we can there is more we can get more and um I'll never forget this kid's response he just turned to me and he said you can't hit us and I said that's true I can't hit you and he and he said so I'm just going to take as much as I want and this took several weeks actually to work out right um because of course I would never hit him and um everyone's his adversary everyone's his adversary and it was remarkable to see the evolution of these kids across that it was about three and a half weeks um at which point they actually became incredibly um good at sharing um but it it took a lot of work it was almost as if even though they knew more trays of food could arrive yeah um not Limitless but there was there was an abundance of food yeah in the moment they were they were solving for that short Horizon moment yeah and it and here we're talking about human beings capable of speech and expression of emotion Etc and he understood the fundamental rule which was I couldn't hit him therefore he could basically do what he wanted without that consequence and which is the main consequence he just faced apparently exactly and um and I remember you know it was it was so striking I'll never forget that and Evolution to a different more um altruistic state was wonderful especially because of what I think what it did for him but but I'll never forget thinking this is a human being who's essentially functioning like an animal MH like an animal I mean I had a Bulldog Mastiff and he was kind to other dogs but if there were unattended to toys at the dog park he was going to pick them up and he put him right in front of himself and his this was down in San Diego and he'd sit with them right in front of him and I'm like C you're not going to play with all those toys but if another dog came and and he wouldn't he would just sit in front of them but another dog would come and try and take one of those toys and he would he had these giant mitts and he would just boom Stam it out and drag it back and so it seems that there are these very primitive circuits about uh resource allocation and protection of resources that in the absence of understanding that there's a much bigger landscape like Costello eventually figured out like tug's a fun game although most dogs couldn't play tug with him there were a few that could he was a 90b bulldog he was just a neck like this but you know to see this in a human being was just so striking I just as you're describing this it's like this adversary versus um neutral versus uh friend it is just so striking and it's got to be you know that that the brain as complex as it is I've often wondered and our colleague Marcus Meister once said that you know circuits in the brain um Can broadly divided into these sorts of circuits into yum yuck and me right Which is far too simplistic right but who am I to argue with the great Marcus Meister um and I'm not going to but it's sort of interesting we sort of Bin our responses into yes okay let let's cooperate or yes let's cooperate you're summarizing veence yeah or or no way no chance like mine yeah versus like me me and um you know as complex as I'd like to think the brain is and we are I mean maybe when it comes down to behaviors and how we interpret input and our decision-making um maybe it's really all about feelings of safety and feelings of um relatedness yeah I think it's also about the IR experiential statistics that you have been exposed to so this this boy who says you I'm gonna take all this food because you can't hit me I mean we don't know but the the picture that grows out of my imagination is this boy had a lot of experiences of people hitting them a lot of experiences of not enough food MH and not a lot of experiences of strangers being nice to them you know like not a lot of people that you could trust that's the that's the experiential statistics that would fit this model someone like like you who's coming in being like Oh no there's more I'm going to give you guys more food for free you know I'm going to give you even more food for it's you know it the experiential statistics are you've come from a world of abundance where people are you know generosity being you've learned being generous can make you have a lifelong friend and all these amazing opportunities that make your quality of life that food is you're never going to think about food again it's about the relationships because that's your experiential statistics and so I think this is such a profound concept about about neuroscience and the Brain about our social structures and how they form what makes a structure egalitarian or despotic right like how how can we as individuals take a structure that is is one format let's say despotic hierarchy and evolve it into something that's more egalitarian and um what are what are the the the levers and what are the parameter spaces that we can pull on and I think these are questions that I mean it's hard to think of what could be more important um but that perspective of thinking about from experiential statistics I think really supports you know the need of of of diversity having bringing in people to Academia whove had very different experiences experiential statistics different biases of what they're going to think is interesting to work on and study and obviously in every every sector of our society so I think um how can we get more diverse sets of experiences represented at each decision-making body that really matters yeah Amen to that and also to be able to understand that um differences in background experience um require that we we earlier you mentioned theory of mind this ability to get into the mindset of others and and sort of assume or presume certain mindsets in order to hopefully create a more benevolent environment for everybody um you know it requires um you know realizing that some people's social interactions are you know have been terrible or traumatic or um you know it requires a departure from self essentially it requires this empathy or something like empathy um in all directions right I mean in all directions it requires that everyone at least make some effort to try and understand that I do wonder and maybe someone would put on the comments on YouTube maybe maybe you're aware um K of um whether or not kids are being trained in that beautiful period of time of life where neuroplasticity is so robust um although it does continue to throughout the rights lifespan it is especially robust early in life to um to be in a healthy way empathically attuned to be able to have theory of mind more robust theory of mind yeah so I think it's it's really I mean I'm I'm so I'm a parent I have two kids kids that are in public school and I think their public school is rated you know it's fine but we won say it's all right and um but but at their school they definitely do get education about um more holistic health and emotional regulation I think and and considering others um that's been that's that's a big focus of the school and I think that's actually really important I I mean you know again I'm I'm super biased from from my upbringing but my kids are going to learn math whenever it's time to learn the math they'll learn it whenever they need it you know whenever they need it they're going to learn it in a couple I don't know a couple weeks and figure it out do the thing and most of the things that they learn they're going to forget them and then have to relearn them um so what are the things that you're going to really need to know no matter what you choose to do and I think regulating your your own emotions in and and engaging other individuals in a healthy sustainable way that you know and I mean sustainable in terms of the longevity of the relationships and I think those are the things that end up really mattering so I think um also this question about exposure to abundance and scarcity uh is really interesting too I mean I don't know if that's a direction we want to go into so please yeah well I think you know this whole you know sort of sounds sort of new Agy when I say you know abund the abundance mindset right um I mean you see this in people who are like uh recently divorced or newly single for whatever reason like is is the world a place where like finding um partnership is is relatively straightforward with some work involved um or is it like well there's only one person on the planet for you and they might be dead already right like um is there PL if someone else's business takes off maybe someone you went to college or high school with where their lab is doing really well you're seeing them you know tremendously successful that maybe they made a hundred million in a in a new in a company acquisition do you immediately feel like oh those are resources that I don't have um even though I'm not in that business um or do you see it as wow that there must be a lot of money out there that um that people could earn and and potentially make I really you know prescribe and believe in this abundance versus scarcity mindset framework um I think there's absolutes like the example we just talked about this the the kid that you know there's just not food there's scarce it of food fact you know of course there are individuals that experience scarcity of various different needs but many of us we reach a threshold of abundance and then it becomes relative we have everything we absolutely physiologically need if we're not comparing ourselves to anyone else but then once we work enter the social Arena comparison is essential why do we compare ourselves to others it's it's ingrain because social status is something that we need to tend to a large part of our our our brain is devoted to representing our relative social rank what's our place with a social network what's the dynamic how do we fit into the social landscape and comparison I think is just a way to do that that's that's been evolutionarily conserved perhaps for less of a good purpose at this point because so many of our basic survival needs are met for the large majority of of humans on the planet today not for everybody of course but so yet what is the percentage of humans who feel they have everything that they desire how many people feel like they don't want for anything and you know it's interesting because having things doesn't make you have an abundance mindset having abundance does not is not sufficient to give you the mindset of abundance that's such an important statement I mean just I don't think they could be restated enough um you've studied social rank uh people hear social Rank and hierarchy and I have to guess that at least some neurons in their amydala and other areas of the brain get buzzing because as soon as people hear social rank they I think naturally started thinking well where am I in this social Rank and um how do I feel about how that rank is you know established and and all sorts of interesting and important questions um some people get very angry that there are billionaires on this planet MH especially given that in most major cities you don't have to go very far to see people who have very limited uh resources so social rank is something that um I think exists in every little niche like you know at work and maybe even in the family there social rank um I have a sibling I remember um who got more of a of a piece of cake like even a slight difference in that what you know was something that my older sibling would point out um because she was more effective at getting the slightly larger piece of cake because I was until I was you know big enough to offend for myself um and my friends with larger sibling pools in their family it was especially competitive yeah I don't if you've ever gone to a meal with somebody who had a lot of siblings they eat fast they they different resource allocation methods than if they were an only child versus uh one sibling there there's variation here I'm generalizing but um but yeah let's talk about social rank what do we know about how social rank is organized in the brain how we perceive our own social ranking and um yeah like what's the what's the modern science on this stuff I find it fascinating um I'm not scared of any topic well most standing topic and I think this is one that that affects us all yeah I mean I'll first say that social rank is something very specific to a certain type of hierarchy that assumes a linear hierarchy which sometimes forms but oftentimes there's different types of hierarchies that are flatter or more Amorphis it's not really clear who's who's the alpha on the playground I don't know there's this click here there's you know it can be dynamic right right it's Dynamic it's not always organized as such but um if you get animals into a sort of small space um you will see in many species especially with in the males um forming a linear hierarchy and um we wanted to EXP explore this and so I think one of the biggest challenges with studying social Rank and this is something we've struggled with as well is how do you control for the individual identity versus the uh the actual rank so what I mean by this is let's say there's a study that says um that you know neurons in a certain brain region fire to animals of different ranks according to their rank fire most of the alpha less less less less down to the rank you know does that does that tell us that this brain region encod social rank maybe in a loose sense and I'm sure that when rank issues come up a lot of the brain lights up for different comp different reasons but for example let's say the amydala would respond more to the Alpha maybe because it encodes social rank but maybe also because whoever is the dominant is the one who's most likely to have consequences and so all of my interactions with the alpha are relatively High consequence and so I'm sort of stressed out whenever I'm talking about Alpha paying attention and you know you remember all the interactions you have with your boss more so than you know someone else there's an attention hierarchy subordinates attend more to dominance and so there's it's almost hard to make this comparison because it's not all flat like the the clean experiment which we are still trying to do it's it's difficult to do the perfect experiment would be if you take an individual and change the rank so for example um I like to use this example with Barack Obama so just indulge me I know that this is from a while ago but once upon a time I met Barack Obama for a very brief moment when he was president and and maybe there's some neurons that light up oh wow you know there's the Barack Obama president neurons but if they are identity neurons once he was no longer president if I was to be presented with Barack Obama then they would still fire if they were ranked Neons then maybe after he was no longer president it just these Nur fire to whoever is president now and so I think that experiment is very difficult to do and has not been done but we're working on it right now um in uh uh another experiment where we take animals and they're living in groups uh and we rank them all and then we rehouse them so everybody has a rank that they start with then we put all the alphas together put all the betas together Etc so that everybody forms a new rank then you have animals that went up a rank went down a rank or stayed the same for every group and so that's something that we're looking at right now so initially you take a pool of animals and then let's say you got your number one two 3 four just for sake of Simplicity let's say I take the number four lowest in that hierarchy but now I make them the top of a new hierarchy that's right that's right got it and so it's really preliminary and we'll see what happens but we're investigating it it seems that when you take Alphas intermediates or subordinates and put them together into new hierarchies it takes them different amounts of time and the Dynamics are very different in forming the new hierarch Archy and so in any kind of predictable way that you're willing to share or is it just too early I think it's too early but I'll just say I guess it seems like the um the intermediates might be taking the longest amount of time to form the hierarchy they don't know where they sit in the hierarchy they they were flexible or something whereas the dominance they're going to Duke it out and then you know we're gonna we're going to battle there'll be defeat it's quick the fight doesn't last that long subordinates you know I I I you know we have to still observe this is all still you know being we'll see if everything replicates but certainly the Dynamics are different what the exact readouts we you know we're working on what the features are what key features to to see but it's kind of uncanny because these are genetically inbred animals that are all housing these should be all everyone should be the same theoretically but this makes me think that during certain developmental periods rank is shaping your long- lasting development I think it's a simple similar phenomenon perhaps to the older child younger child phenomenon where you know if you're the oldest you go into the world and you have lots of different roles you might be the bottom you know you're going to play on sports teams and be in different classes and have all these job but the the the leadership desire slash potential skill seems to be correlated in a very non-scientific way you know the number of presidents that's often old oldest or only children this type of thing it's it's a loose correlation there's a lot of other reasons why it might not be behavioral but there's sort of you know fluffy fluffy correlations about that I think there's something to it though um when plasticity is happening you're this this becomes your most familiar state of assuming a certain role and that attractor state deepens with more time spent there I find that so fascinating I've also observed and I think I've seen a few papers on I don't know how rigorous these papers are that um youngest or let's just say not oldest siblings um here we're setting aside single children that don't have any siblings but that youngest siblings uh do tend to quote unquote break the mold more in terms of uh socio and cultural norms of the family they they Venture further in terms of um experiences and value systems they're often seen as um having had fewer constraints than the older sibling which may or may not be true um but that the youngest uh siblings often will um take on risk that older siblings won't y yeah and that's certainly been my observ non-conformists right I mean I'm a young younger brother of an older sister um but and then but then there was times in our childhood where she was out of the house and I was at home just with my mom so so that sort of changes things but and it's very Dynamic I realize we're playing here loose space but but I find Social rank stuff to be super interesting I grew up in a big pack of mostly boys um that's just kind of how it worked out in my neighborhood um at the time um and it was very interesting because it was very clear it was a dynamic hierarchy where if we were skateboarding certain kids were Alpha if we were playing soccer other kids were Alpha if we were doing anything artistic um if it was uh kind of geeky knowledge and and nerdy stuff um you know then you know might have been somebody else who had the knowledge um and had the information that people wanted so I think Dynamic hierarchies are really interesting and I think um get us out of that sort of more standard Alpha like kind of chest beating telling everyone what to do dictatorial model I mean and this is now fully out of any science land and into speculation opinion land but I think that type of structural structure where when you're doing different tasks different individuals become the alpha or the leader because it's based on compet is very healthy I think structures where you have locked down this is the this is the hierarchy where someone's the boss of you because of this one skill but there's all these other skills that they're not as they're they're not Superior you know they they they don't don't outrank you at and and so how do you work all of that out and so I think that's also something about keeping score like what is what is the rank right and so we did this experiment where we designed a task um animals are trained that a queue predicts reward delivery only one animal can get at a time it's just a very narrow place so if one animal's getting it you can't get it then um we would have four animals that are CAG mates four mice that are CAG mates and we would have two of them do get out at each point and they we know the ranks the ranks are stable they have a rank one two three four in the cage and everybody does a round robin ones versus twos ones versus threes twoos versus yeah they well they they do round robin in this reward competition task they're food deprived you know and we we present rewards what's the what happens and so subordinates do win some of the times even though dominants win more all you know they they consistently win more and we found that prefrontal cortical neurons you could represent very stably and decode which animal was dominant um flat regardless of the trial and then when you looked at whether we could decode competitive success meaning who is going to win that next trial so there's a new trial every 30 or 40 seconds and so but 30 seconds before which is as far as we can measure because then we're like kind of into the previous trial as soon as the last trial ends even before the next trial ends You can predict above chance significantly which animal is going to win the next trial just based on the firing pattern of prefrontal cortical so you can predict winners and losers you can predict and understand where they are in the hierarchy as well based on the ACT activation of neurons prior to the battle like recording from the um by analogy it's like recording from the prefrontal cortex of two let's say business competitors or um martial arts competitors and you can predict who's going to win based on the pattern of firing in their brains prior to the competition that's right and so um that suggests all sorts of things number one it doesn't mean these competitions are not independent there's something about the state of the animal and when we looked at is it just whoever won the previous trial that did not account for this and so um I thought this was really interesting but when you look at the decoding accuracy for dominance versus subordinates about uh who will win the next trial for dominance it stays pretty flat it just has to do with I think this is my speculation of our data um that you know they they either are engaged or they're not engaged the subordinates the decoding accuracy is it's above it's above chance but then it shoots up somewhere around closer to the queue presentation and so my speculation about that is that the subordinates are looking at the dominance they're looking the dominant doesn't look like they're it doesn't look like they're going to go for it okay yeah they there looks like they're turning away I'm gonna go I'm gonna go so it's it's not like they're both going out full every time it's it's a calculation which trials oh he's not paying attention you know it's like when you're driving in traffic and you're trying to find the the moment to cut over and you're waiting for the person who's like te texting and they're just there's a big space and then everybody's just getting in right here you know you can just see you're like looking for clues about the state of level you know of competition and then and then the dominants they are not looking at the subordinate they're just doing whatever they feel like doing it's like uh there's uh I think there's that one scene in Madmen where something happened in the work environment and um and it was clear someone's account didn't sell or something didn't work out for one person versus the other and I think one of the characters says to uh Don Draper who's clearly one of the alpha was in that work environment by virtue of yeah role and and um position um says you know you know I sometimes think about the way that you blank blank blank and blank and he goes on this brief tiate about how upset he was and um and Draper says well I don't think about you at all and then the elevator I believe closes and it really cemented his status in the office as somebody who's really not paying much attention to what other people are doing he's just making decisions according to what's going to be best for the firm in some cases for himself and in some cases both so I think that's essentially what you're talking about yeah I think it's um it's kind of the nature of the structure that's what makes you the alpha is you're you you have you have other things that are occupying your attention and your your Visionary status hopefully if you're you know a productive successful Alpha and for a sustainable you know group and then everyone else is they don't they don't need to have the big picture they don't they don't you know it it becomes the reinforcement schedule is different I'm just looking for validation am I am I playing my role okay it's a very different mindset I think you know as a scientist when you're a trainee sometimes you're a supporting member on a team where you're getting instruction someone's telling you what to do versus the moment where you get your own project and maybe you're working by yourself maybe there's no one to command but no one's telling you what to do that is to me one of the biggest thresholds to step over when you're becoming a scientist or an investigator is the first time where you just do something and like try and experiment no one told you to do and it feels super weird it feels like you're sneaking around or something and and then you know I think I think um in today's mentorship chain sometimes that that happens too late I think if we could have that experience happen earlier um I think that would only be good for for the future of research I agree I was very fortunate that my graduate adviser um told me look I'm going to help you but I'm going to have two kids while you're in the lab and I'm not going to be around a lot so you're going to have to figure it out don't burn the lab down don't kill yourself with any of the poisons in the lab and then my post talk adviser um the late and great Ben Baris um largely treated the postdocs as as Junior professors from an early stage and I remember thinking he can't control the experiments I'm going to do this is up to me and he and and a great number of us who were training with him at that time went on to have our own lab so I think um uh there's really something important to that model and of course we're discussing the research field but um this could be exported to any number of different fields because what those mentors were essentially training us to do was to um to assume the role that we would eventually have as opposed to be subordinates um do you watch chimp Empire so actually um just this week yet yesterday and the day before before this uh an postto interview who worked with the Chimp on chimp Empire visited and interviewed him in my lab and um talked about his work so I have not seen chimp Empire but it's at the very top of my to-do list oh God it's so good I don't want to spend the next 20 minutes talking about it but you see all sorts of interesting um Behavior very relevant human behavior hierarchies yes but also um altruistic behavior um allopathic grooming I mean in in chimp culture um as I've learned from the show assuming it's accurate um that who Grooms who is very important um and there's all sorts of interesting um Maneuvers that subordinates make and there's all sorts of interesting displays of vigor that the alpha makes to remind people that they are the alpha and then as they age or make mistakes Stakes of judgment the subordinates also will feain deference they'll be like oh yeah you're the alpha you're really tough and secretly they're plotting to replace the alpha um so whether or not we're talking about a scene from Mad Men or we're talking about chimp Empire we're talking about Research Laboratories or um or any other landscape kindergarten I think these circuits are active in all of us and the sooner that we uh acknowledge those and try and find um ones that generalize to the the goodness of as many uh members as possible um we're not doing our task but clearly you're doing the task so okay social rank is something that uh we need to acknowledge no doubt um which actually leads me to what might seem like a desperate topic but um one that I know we're both very interested in and that you're focusing on now which is psychedelics because one of the interesting things about psychedelics is their capacity to increase neuroplasticity um but also some of the psychedelics and I realize MDMA is not a classic psychedelic but they are classified as empathogens they increase empathy for self and others so uh what are you looking into with psychedelics which psychedelics and um yeah what brought you to the study of psychedelics and by the way I've done participated in clinical because people will wonder I have participated in clinical trials for uh psilocybin and MDMA I don't recommend people do psychedelics recreationally I do think they hold great promise for the treatment of depression and trauma but people need to be careful there are certain people who could not and should not take psychedelics because it would be genuinely unsafe for them um psychologically especially young people so there's my disclaimer and um but they are fascinating compounds so um I guess I've always been interested in psychedelics I think I wrote my undergraduate thesis about it's just about hallucinations produced by psychedelics psychotic breaks and REM sleep and schizophrenia just comparing what is the common thread when our brain creates a reality that is not objectively there and um psychedelics of course is a way that we can experience that and remember it and recall it in a way that's very difficult with REM sleep and and sometimes with psychotic breaks um obviously schizophrenia is not something that you can transiently give yourself and have that experience so I think having the ability to to move into other brain States is what makes it so attractive I think the other component is the the plasticity you can you can have an experience and perhaps the firsthand experience is you have an epiphany that you take with you it's life-changing and you know your life habits are completely different for a long lasting way after this singular experience is is kind of one of the things that makes it so different from all of the other um therapeutic treatments that we've got or most of the other ones I'd say um and so for me you know right now there's a lot of work going on exploring psychedelics as a therapy for various different conditions disease States um I think that's great I think it's really important work I'm glad a lot is being done on that I think my focus is is to turn over some rocks that might not have been turned over yet and just to get really down at a quantitative rigorous mathematical level of what is a hallucination for example um when I asked this question what is a hallucination I'm interested in the actual cellular mechanisms are we just you know we think about neurons having signal to noise and neurom modulation as changing that are we just changing the signal to noise ratio and then pattern completing all the noise and that's what a Hallucination is we just you know take that's we're just reinterpreting noise and and putting sort of existing Maps everything's fitting to existing mold or map that we've already got that then appears as some hallucination um or is and and and you know maybe it doesn't have to be hallucination there's also obviously some various different thresholds of the Psychedelic experience um but all these clinical statements this human self-reported um qualitative descriptions of the Psychedelic experience things like being having just more positive outlook being uh uniting one self and other like a sort of you know Clarity of the world um more labile in thoughts more flexible thoughts uh we are trying to just create actual ways to test them so for example this idea about what is what is going on in your mind when you when you're having a psychedelic experience all this of these different states might feel more labile um it maybe the transition probabilities between different brain states of like happy sad thinking nostalgic you know maybe it's just all looser and so you can access everything because the transition probabilities are just High another possibility is that and maybe it's dose dependent at a certain dose you go into another brain State and so previously we've done this in the same project I was just telling you about rank um we were recording for prefrontal cordal neurons and looking at all the behaviors and so the behaviors for representing social rank we don't know what they are so we Ed computer vision to extract a bunch of Behavioral motifs and then try to understand what's the best model that would predict you know what the animal's going to do next not just wins and losses but all the subtle gestures are we going to fight are we going to give it up are we going to back off and predict the behaviors from prefrontal cortical activity and the best model that we found was something called a hidden marvian model which essentially just means that there are hidden States you might think of them as moods um you might give them some other name but I'll I'll I'll use moods Loosely it's not perfect but um that's kind of one way that helps me think about hidden states where you have certain statistics of behaviors that you would produce if I'm sad there's certain things I'm going to do it's a different statistics than when I'm happy different probability of going surfing if I'm sad or happy or you know things like that so we basically found that there are a certain number of hidden States and so if you are on psychedelics would that change the number of states or just the transitions between them we also found in our prefrontal cortical representation that there's a certain distance of the representation of self and other in this you know dimensionality reduced activity space so for mumbo jumbo that just means there's a representation of self and other there's some quantifiable distance in in abstract you know terms in the brain and we can quantify if those representations get closer together and merge of self versus other of self versus other so that's something that we would want we would be looking for if you are putting psychedelics on these are these are questions that I'm interested in that are under construction so right now we're recording from um animals while we're giving them psilocybin using neuropixels recordings so we're recording from thousands of neurons um in preal cortex and other parts of Cortex cu the you know the shank goes to lots of places and looking at how um animals respond in a conflict task so there's there's trials where there's a CU that predicts reward a cue that predicts shock then there's some trials where both cues are presented and both outcomes are presented and the reason for this conflict trial is that actually if you give you know moderate to low doses of psilocybin or most drugs honestly animals can do this you know even on lots of different drugs most people can still eat food and avoid getting hit by this truck I mean there are exceptions of course but generally speaking you know there's a lot of different brain states where you can still do these these essential functions pretty robustly but it's about what happens in the more ambiguous Zone what happens when there's a conflict and and what do you do how do you when there when it's a little gray I think that's when you can see a shift in veilance assignment so that's something that we've been looking for and trying to see if um you know in clinical studies they're exploring set and setting um as maybe the factors that have in the past historically given very unpredictable outcomes for psychedelic therapies um it's possible that it's set in setting it's also possible that there's individual variability it's possible that there are biomarkers that can predict which individuals would be well suited for this type of therapy and so those are also things that we're interested in I find this so fascinating and I I just want to applaud you again for taking on these hard questions these are fairly high level questions um certainly there's a lot of uh clinical trials exploring psychedelics like psilocybin and their role in treating mental health um and there's at the same time um a real dir of studies exploring mechanistically how these compounds are working I mean um I do want to tip my hat to all the folks that have explored dendritic changes and you know so cellular changes in the level of neurons and and on and on but in terms of these like higher level states of um self ver versus other recognition um in psychedelics um you know that those are tough questions that need to be addressed mechanistically and it's clear you're doing that um I I think this um this notion that you're testing of whether or not psychedelics reveal more accessibility or lability as you described it of between different states like oh wow I can actually move from sad to happy there's a there's a route for that and you can erience that as opposed to just being told that hey when you're feeling sad feel your you know the field of psychology especially pop psychology is in a real crisis right now in my opinion because we're told to feel our feelings but then we're also told to not react to our feelings which sounds great but if those feelings get intense enough that's very hard for most people to do so it's feel your feelings but don't stay with you know what there's the cathartic model you know like feel your feelings and and get them out screaming and Etc and then there's the the no you know the more you engage a neural pathway the stronger that neural pathway gets and therefore you're just going to feel more anger there's a lot of conflict right now in terms of the popular psychology version of this whereas the the clinical Fields I think have a an understanding that hasn't been translated I think one other thing about psychedelics that is interesting is that the transitions into States is also more labile like if you start feeling a little sad you know there's the potential to feel very very sad and to go into a state of sadness of of an intensity you've never experienced before which by the way could be therapeutically beneficial um I think there's some evidence for that provided there's adequate support before during an after those sessions um but I think most people feel when they're not on psychedelics will feel emotions that are uncomfortable and we'll do all sorts of things to try and avoid those emotions so I I'm not speaking as a clinician here but I just again I think what the the uh the range and specificity of questions that you're asking about psychedelics I I find so exciting another uh uh reason I'll say that you we want to have you back to to discuss those findings when when they come out let's talk a little bit about you okay um I've known you for a while but to be honest I think this is the longest conversation we've ever had which is one of the reasons I love doing this podcast I get to sit down with colleagues and have intellectual slash other conversations of of substantial depth that I wouldn't have the opportunity to have elsewhere I know enough about you however to know that um you've been involved in various things um I'm not going to say peripheral to science but you have other interests as well um as I recall um you have been a yoga instructor or a or you've been involved in the uh kind of wellness fitness uh Community industry tell us about that and then I'm also curious about um how you structure your day your routines given that you're a parent of two young children you run a very large laboratory operating at the very highest level um and of course you value important things like relationships and relationship to self and health and all these sorts of things so um not to make it too open-ended but yeah like tell us of tell us of your interests and and of your relationship to Wellness and fitness and well-being yeah um I guess I think you know I everybody comes to their their calling in in some what feels like a path that you could have predict but when you look at outside I guess both of my parents are professors so it doesn't look super surprising that I'm a professor but that's not how it felt to me when I was in high school I was a total rebel I just threw parties at my house my parents weren't there sorry everybody who's listening it's not I don't recommend that but I just cared about I just cared about having fun and sports and um I think school wasn't maybe challenging enough for me at that time I didn't necessarily recognize that that was what it was but um I've always enjoyed being really active and that's what makes me feel good it's I I I definitely um agree with stuff youve said on your podcast about having exercise routines in the morning that really influence the rest of your day I I didn't always exercise in the morning I have different phases but um yeah after I was an undergrad I took some time to travel around Australia backpack around Australia live in some very remote places spend some time living in a tent then I was a yoga instructor um then I I went to grad school in the Bay Area I had a very active uh hobby of I was a semi-professional break dancer I was very into break dancing really really competitive break dancer in area yes we did um you know halftime shows or I guess technically third quarter timeout shows at Oracle Stadium for the Golden State Warriors I was the one girl who could do a windmill so they would use me though windmills someone's going to find footage of this yeah yeah there's some you know very mediocre footage of me break dancing um and I was just really into it but I think that's where my work life balance passion comes from I talk about it a lot I think about it a lot and people say to me all the time well you is this really true why do you why do you preach all this work life balance stuff when you know you must have been a workaholic at some point in your life and I think you know when I was younger I definitely didn't like the idea that you had to only be one thing I wanted to be so many things I couldn't decide it was a huge challenge I was going to be a writer I was going to be a yoga instructor I was going to be I never really thought I was going to be a professional dancer I just wasn't good enough and there's not careers to be made from dancing really it's very difficult but um you know had a lot of other interests and I wanted to prove I don't know who I wanted to prove it to I think myself at first and then eventually it made me maybe feel like I should maybe prove it to everyone that you can have a very whole life and not sacrifice everything you don't have to choose between family and career or personal life you can have them all you just have to decide that it's a priority and own that and make those choices on on a daily basis and comes down to time management and so it's been a very even though it looks like oh K just likes to have fun and have all these other Hobbies it it's it's important because I think that we need more role models in especially in academic science where people bring their whole selves to their job and even though your job is a very specific thing um because you have a role as a mentor and you know I suppose the mentor apprenticeship relationship has evolved then there's I've you know lots of comments about that too um in Academia I still think ultimately when when I was working in someone else's lab and I definitely looked up to them they were the role model obviously I'm looking at yes they's science but I'm looking at how they make this all work how you how are you doing this how how do they live their lives and how do they approach balancing it all and so I guess I just wanted to put some more data points on the on the scoreboard where people are having lots of hobbies and other nonwork activities while still making meaningful contributions and it doesn't make you less of a hum less of a scientist or less less of a person because you're a whole human if anything perhaps it makes people better scientists yeah did your exploration of of yoga Andor break dancing inform anything about your your research or was it really about resetting uh your mind and body in healthy ways so that you could return to the lab feeling excited about returning to the lab I think I've always been of the mindset where sometimes things don't go well in a certain Arena and it's it doesn't feel good to have all your eggs in that basket stuff goes wrong sometimes experiment doesn't work sometimes you find something out you lose the whole data set it's you know bad news happens in the lab and um I think just want to diversify your portfolio so that your happiness portfolio is not entirely based on your accomplishments at work um I think we just want to have more elements and the same thing goes for you know at one point when I was really into dancing I got a very serious injury and it took this huge part of my life away from me I was so glad I had work thank God I have work you know I have something I can do else and I just think having a lot of different parts of your life make you more flexible more creative more awake more engaged and you know when I don't I definitely have been a workaholic when I was a postto and assistant professor period definitely did not make enough time for myself to have a a richer a rich personal life at certain points and very quickly I just wither away into a shell of a human a shell an empty shell of a the person I used to be and it's noticeable everybody can feel it you can't pretend you know everyone that works with you feels it eventually and so I think that's a big thing and so as I've taken feedback from my Anonymous lab surveys and other other forms of feedback and just reflecting it's clear I you know taking your lifestyle in to and having agency over designing your lifestyle to be ideal for you is super important so a typical day for me uh might look like um okay the last work day let's say I woke up actually so it was early high tide so I got to wake up in the dark pack up my bags go surfing and then get home before surf see my friends in the water and I think surfing is a lot of things it's exercise it's a cold plunge it's photons some of your favorite things maybe a little bit meditative maybe some social Community then and I you know go every time at the same day so there's the same group of people then I go home make the kids their snacks breakfast drop them off at school then I go to a lab and then run lab meeting um and have meetings most of my day when I'm at work is spent meeting with people drawing on a whiteboard mostly meeting with my trainees um is what I like to spend most of my time on of course there's other stuff that gets in the mix like administrative whatever and then come home at a pretty early hour pick up my kids make dinner and then go to sleep kind of early kind of boring these days that's my typical day sounds exciting to me sounds exciting to me um I think uh if one were to stay up late then one feel sleep deprived if they wake up early if you wake up late you're missing out on the early morning Sunrise the surf all of that I've never surfed actually once I paddled out once when I was in college and uh there was no surf so I would paddle back in but um I keep hearing about this surfing thing and um people seem to love it that's one of my concerns is that if you fall in love with it you're going to spend a lot of time out in the ocean but clearly it's all serving you well and um uh must be wonderful to be a child in your home I can imagine how much fun it is and how interesting it is um you mentioned several times uh mentorship and trainees and it's clear that uh reshaping um the landscape of science for the Next Generation coming up is something that's of real passion to you um I take great uh pleasure in asking this because um you know it wasn't long ago that you and I were graduate students in postdocs and more or less the same vintage right and as is the case people retire people die this is the reality of life and people move up up the ranks uh as you have um so what are some of the things that you're most passionate about in terms of shaping the future of science um in particular research science but maybe more broadly and um what are you doing about it I think that um science academic culture has evolved and and I guess I should start by just saying first I as I was driving over here was just beautiful drive and I'm just thinking it is so tool that we get to do this for a living isn't it amazing that studying whatever I find interesting to me is something that I can you know have a secure job for and then just thinking about cool ideas and directions and talking about it stuff that I would do for free is is really my job and I I just am so grateful to have that and um I think there are a lot of beautiful sides of Academia that sometimes don't get the air time that they deserve and of course there's a lot of Doom and Gloom there always has been when I was a grad student there's lots of Doom and Gloom in The Ether there's plenty now um I think perhaps it has become a little bit more dire um the plight of Academia right now uh there's been a nationwide drop of posts in general there's a just a mass exitus away from Academia to Industry and I think that reflects the changing in environment and so um I guess when I was a graduate student I had this book in my desk drawer called advice for young investigator written by ramonica Hall which is a great book it's thin it's a quick read it's got some winds Whimsical anecdotes and some some some important insights I think um also a lot of misogyny very much glamorizing work workaholic Tendencies and you know there was definitely a picture of a scientist this was the way to succeed other options not really offered and and I really struggled with that I had a lot of impostor syndrome coming up through I mean I someone asked me when when did I when did I stop having imposter syndrome I think maybe 2021 you know very recently I think I spent 20 years of my career having impostor syndrome wondering if I was good enough if I was going to make it am I gonna do I have what it takes and constantly doubting and questioning it um and I think that it would have been nice to to not feel so alone at that period of of my career um so I think some of the things that were described in this original book um were really important for academic research to be born as a thing like how do we make this be a thing that you can get paid for you know how do we make this be a job that people get to have and then at this point I think most people would agree we need science science is important we want to we want to we benefit from science um and I think at this point it's not so clear that we need elitism as much as we did before it's not um we're we're looking at a crumbling academic culture where where we're struggling to retain people and you know that's it's not it's not a great sustainable Dynamic I think trainees are not getting compensated well enough or treated treated well enough that it's an attractive choice and so I think we need to sort of make a change and nothing wrong necessarily about about the intentions that were set hundreds of years ago but things change and we where we are now and things are changing very quickly so um I I guess I get to make one of my childhood dreams which is to to write a book come true um in uh I get in in one of the benefits of social media I did have a tweet kind of you know just sort of spontaneously ranting about about how this book is problematic and it's very misogynistic and maybe we need another book for other types of people um and that makes people feel more included um and so and and this tweet went around and it s I didn't expect you know I didn't expect anything to come of this I'm just you know living my daily life and then my DM suddenly had literary agents and a book deal and then okay I'm now I'm writing this book and so I'm about halfway through but I think the the goal of the book I I don't really have time for this project to be honest but it's such an important project to me um I think that I I want to see Academia be uh one of the healthiest places why is it second only to the military in the pervasiveness of sexual misconduct and you know things like right yeah y did you know that actually you know factoid is Academia is the military is worse in terms of sexual misconduct retaliation issues that occur but Academia second and I and it makes you wonder what are the parameters that make this type of abuse so rampant I think one of the obvious ones is the clear ranks how stable the ranks are how the power structure um of of Academia and the military very fixed not super debatable not difficult to move these the ranks are you know they're there and the power structure is very skewed and those are the ingredients that facilitate abuse and so I think in the military I could see a very good argument for why that hierarch that strict rigid hierarchical structure is necessary there's not time for making mistakes get it but with Academia there's there's time there's where what are we we're not you know it's not a war we're we're just studying stuff that we think is cool why is uh such a rigid hierarchy with such devastating consequences necessary I would argue maybe it's not and um I think I've been spending a lot of time thinking about this for myself I've been um I I found this professional leadership coach I I love and just think about sustainability how do we make an a sustainable ecosystem and um it's not something you've find in a lot of leadership management uh literature that I that I've been exposed to so I'll take I'll take a note from from the the podcast and say if anyone knows of literature that talks about developing sustainable um ecosystems within leadership and management I would love to hear about that in the comments but um I think that's a big hole um people think about making things stable the power structure should be stable but actually being flexible and dynamic is what gives systems resilience and and flexibility um to to survive and right now all the cracks in in the towers of Academia are showing and it's time to to see if this is are we going to adapt and survive or are we going to crumble there's a lot to pack there and um grateful that you're drilling into all of that with I'm sure the same rigor and um attention to asking the really critical questions that you have in your lab um certainly I observe the landscape changing very rapidly um I think there's also a lot to be learned and to explore that um exports to other professions I certainly um believe that the more um firsttime opportunities to experience the beauty of doing research and biology in particular because that's what I'm familiar with um the more likely that we are as a field of research and science to make more fundamental discoveries in other words the more people that get the experience of trying science doing exploratory research science the more likely we are to pull from that pool and within that pool there will be people of competence uh talent and also gifted like we just you know sort of like increase the the size of the n y um and the net of course is netting something very specific which is you and I both know that um while training certainly matters knowledge is important um that ultimately you know love of craft and passion um and just being tickled by that research bug once that neuron that you know gets tickled that lets us see something for the first time or know something um down the microscope or in a in a data applaud or something there's there's really no going back so I I you know I want to be very clear that I loudly applaud your efforts to extend the experience of research to people and earlier you were telling me that you're doing this that many of the people in your lab are firsttime researchers they didn't come through the pedigree of research yeah I know we do a lot of Outreach about 25% of my lab this summer was first time research experiences and so um we've been really privileged to have the bandwidth just support that um I will say though I mean on the same tip I think what you've done with this podcast is incredible you've made millions of people who didn't have access to science or Neuroscience be fascinated with neuroscience and now imagine what if every person that listened to this podcast and thought this is such a great podcast I wish I could do some Neuroscience could do it with some you know not full-time what if they could contribute in any just whatever level that they wanted to that's so much more contribution that we're currently missing out on because there's so many barriers to be able to contribute to science and I think um removing the ones that are really there as well as the ones that are just perceived to be there is so powerful but I mean the podcast is a a you know proof the proof is in the pudding the proof is in this podcast how many people could fall in love with science if they were given a chance to well thank you for that it is indeed a labor of love for me and and um and there are opportunities maybe we'll provide a link to a couple of them um where uh certain projects in Neuroscience are crowdsourcing data analysis it's actually quite fun there's the connectone project where you can trace neurons it's actually very very pleasing you can do it while listening to podcast or a book kids can do it you're you're tracing these neurons basically filling in lines it's like a coloring book and you're contributing to the parcelation of understanding the structure of of the brain yeah including the human brain and without that crowdsourcing um it's just not going to happen I mean there efforts to make machine learning do it and to do it through AI but that there's a lot to be gained from having actual humans do this that those Technologies don't quite yet approximate so we'll provide a link to to some of those projects but Len K Dr Tai of course um I want to thank you so much first of all for coming here today and sharing so much knowledge and also being willing to go into some places that were um by virtue of my questions a little speculative and and and really think about those and and and address those through the lens of of deep mechanistic understanding of how these circuits work and to make it clear to people um your enthusiasm for science is infectious in the most positive sense of the word and I know that so many people are going to benefit from from your knowledge and also from the work that you've been doing in your laboratory you know I've seen your star rise and it's um still going going going and it's just remarkable and extraordinary but I must say not at all surprising so um that and your advocacy work and for all you do and that you're doing um I just on behalf of myself and everyone listening I just want to extend a genuine and really heartfelt thanks thank you thank you so much and it's been such an honor to be on the hubin Lab podcast it's legendary so thank you so much for having me absolutely we'll do it again thank you for joining me for today's discussion

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, is an Ask Me Anything episode, or AMA. This is part of our Premium subscriber channel. Our Premium subscriber channel was started in order to provide support for the Standard Huberman Lab podcast, which comes out every Monday and is available at zero cost to everybody on all Standard feeds-- YouTube, Apple, Spotify, and elsewhere. We also started the Premium channel as a way to generate support for exciting research being done at Stanford and elsewhere-- research on human beings that leads to important discoveries that assist mental health, physical health, and performance. I'm also pleased to inform you that for every dollar the Huberman Lab Premium channel generates for research studies, the Tiny Foundation has agreed to match that amount. So now we are able to double the total amount of funding given to studies of mental health, physical health, and human performance. If you'd like to subscribe to the Huberman Lab Podcast Premium Channel, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. It is $10 a month to subscribe, or you can pay $100 all at once to get an entire 12-month subscription for a year. We also have a lifetime subscription model. That is a one-time payment. And again, you can find that option at hubermanlab.com/premium. For those of you that are already subscribers to the Premium channel, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium and download the Premium subscription feed. And for those of you that are not Huberman Lab Podcast Premium subscribers, you can still hear the first 20 minutes of today's episode and determine whether or not becoming a Premium subscriber is for you. So without further ado, let's get to answering your questions. The first question is about fluoride. And the specific question is, why is fluoride in our water, and how much is it harming us? OK, well, that might seem like a short question, but there's actually a lot to that question. And I want to be very clear, by posing the question, how much is it harming us, it implies that fluoride is harming us. And I'd want to be very clear. The degree to which fluoride can harm you or not harm you depends on how much of it happens to be in the water or toothpaste or some other thing that you're consuming, OK? So this is very important. I don't want the question to seem like a leading question to imply that fluoride is necessarily harming us, because as I'm about to tell you, there are clear benefits of fluoride for tooth strength and for warding off cavities. But if you get too much fluoride into your system, it is dangerous. It is a poison at certain levels. So as you've probably heard before, the dose makes the poison. So let's take this seemingly simple question and dissect it in two. The first part of the question was, why is fluoride in our water? And believe it or not, even that is hard to answer directly because here's what's happening right now in 2024. There is a major lawsuit in the state of California to try and get fluoride removed from the drinking water. The outcome of that case is still yet to be determined. But the case was filed by a group of individuals who strongly believe that fluoride at any concentration in the drinking water is bad. Why would they say that? And what is their evidence? And how strong is that evidence? Well, there is some evidence that if levels of fluoride in drinking water exceed a certain threshold, it can cause problems with thyroid hormone function and perhaps even certain aspects of brain function. Again, if the levels exceed a certain threshold. So in the state of California, there is a major lawsuit to try and get fluoride removed from the drinking water. Now, at the same time, meaning right now, there is also a major lawsuit in the United States-- this one taking place in Buffalo, New York-- whereby citizens are suing the city because they insist that there is not enough fluoride in the water. And they are suing for damages based on the dental health needs of their children that did not, in their opinion, get enough fluoride in the drinking water. So I'm telling you about all of this because the question, again, was why is fluoride in our drinking water? And believe it or not, there are certain states in the United States, certain areas of the United States, where the fluoride levels in the drinking water are low, are zero, perhaps. That's what the lawsuit in Buffalo is about. And by the way, the city of Buffalo may have now corrected the amount of fluoride in the water, taking it from zero to something. Whether or not it was actually zero is still debatable. But I think you're starting to get the point, that there is a wide, wide divergence in terms of how safe people feel about having fluoride in drinking water. Some people want it and are suing cities because they feel there wasn't enough of it in their drinking water. And others don't want any fluoride in their drinking water, and they're suing cities because of that. So this is a really barbed-wire topic, as I like to say. It's one that no matter how close you get to it, whatever angle you look at it, you're likely to get stuck a little bit. It's going to be a little bit painful. OK, why is fluoride in some drinking water at all? Let's set aside the levels and just answer that question. Well, in an upcoming episode of the Huberman Lab podcast about oral health. I'll get into this in a lot more detail. But fluoride is a really interesting compound with respect to oral health. And here's why. Your teeth, believe it or not, are always in a state of either demineralization or remineralization. Those are tricky words to say, go ahead and try and say it. Demineralization, remineralization. So I'm going to refer to them as "demin" for "demineralization" and "remin" for "remineralization. OK, your teeth are always in one state or the other, or one state predominates versus the other. Now, a cavity in your mouth occurs when bacteria-- in particular, streptococcus mutans, sometimes called strep mutans-- feeds on sugars in your mouth and then, as a byproduct of that feeding, creates acids that then erode the enamel and deeper layers of your teeth. In other words, it demineralizes the tooth. Now, I just told you that your teeth can be in a state of demin or remin at any moment. The way that your teeth remin, the way they remineralize and can potentially fill in little cavities that have not yet made it to the deeper layers of your teeth, is through a process that involves the construction of crystals from minerals-- that's why it's called remineralization-- and get this. This really wild. These minerals actually stack together in very organized little sequences, kind of like LEGO blocks. And the critical element within those blocks is something called hydroxyapatite. I love that it has the word "appetite" in it because we're talking about oral health. That's the normal process. Fluoride was discovered, not because it's a vitamin, not because it's an essential nutrient. In fact, at high concentrations, it's actually a poison. I'll tell you a story about that in a moment, where I was actually poisoned by fluoride at the dentist when I was a kid, in large part due to my own error. Fluoride, it was discovered, can actually get inside of those LEGO chain-like crystals, the building of those, and form bonds between them that are actually stronger than the hydroxyapatite bonds that would normally form. In other words, if you consume fluoridated water or use toothpaste with fluoride, especially if you do this when you're a kid, what ends up happening is that the crystals and the mineralization structure of the teeth becomes ultrastrong, meaning supraphysiologically strong, which then limits the ability for that strep mutans and the acid strep mutans produces when it eats sugar to erode the enamel of your teeth causing what we refer to as cavities. OK, so I went and asked several dentists and a periodontist about, why is fluoride in drinking water? Why is fluoride in toothpaste? And they, of course, gave me the explanation that I just gave you, which is a chemical mechanical explanation or rationale. However, most of the things for our health, such as the foods we eat, the amount of exercise that we do, are not naturally put into our environment, right? But tap water, which goes out to everyone who consumes it from the tap, is basically a government or local government-supplied resource. And basically, the rationale was-- and I believe this took place first in the 1950s-- was, OK, given the potential for fluoride to make supraphysiologically strong teeth, what can we do to reduce the cavities and tooth decay that would occur in children and adult populations? Let's put fluoride in the drinking water. So that's what they did. They did not do this, I was told, because it was necessarily the best way to take care of teeth and avoid cavities. It turns out there are a bunch of other things that you can do, even if you consume no fluoridated water or toothpaste. There are things that you can do to enhance the mineralization state of your teeth, even fill in cavities, provided those cavities haven't made it into the deeper so-called dentine layers of the teeth. I'll get into all of this in that future episode. But what the US and other governments decided-- this, of course, varies across the world, to the extent to which there's fluoride in the drinking water or not-- was that by putting fluoride in the drinking water, they could prevent a large amount of tooth decay and cavities that would otherwise occur. It was, and remains, a fairly low-cost approach for these cities to introduce fluoride to the drinking water. And that's why fluoride is in drinking water. It is to try and create supraphysiologically strong teeth. And, indeed, every single dentist I spoke to, including functional dentists. I spoke to periodontists. I spoke to several dentists, ranging from, let's call them, more "traditionally trained" dentists to more, let's call them, "alternative dentists." All of them agree that at a chemical mechanical level, fluoride creates stronger teeth. However, every single one of them also acknowledged that the bonds that are created in those mineralization chains, as I'm referring to-- I realize that's not the technical term-- is not the normal hydroxyapatite bonds that would form. They are stronger than the bonds that would normally form. They are structurally different. If you look at them down what's called an electron microscope, you'll see that they're structurally different. And some, not all of the dentists, I spoke to said, yeah, it would be best to remineralize the teeth to fill in any cavities that initially have formed-- again, not down to the deep layers, but they could still be filled in naturally through the building up of those hydroxyapatite natural bonds. But they acknowledged that many people, perhaps most people, don't take adequate care of their mouths and their teeth. So they understood the rationale of putting fluoride into drinking water. And of course, that's also why fluoride is in many, not all toothpastes. OK, so I'm hoping that clearly answers for you the question of why there is fluoride in our drinking water at all. At least in most American cities, there is fluoride in the drinking water, although this lawsuit in Buffalo, I guess soon to be determined, will probably tell us whether or not, indeed, there was a total lack or a partial lack of fluoride in the drinking water there. I'm presuming that the accusation is true. But I don't actually know that to be true. I just know that there's a lawsuit that exists. If you Google that, you can see some YouTube videos about it. There's information about this happening. There are a bunch of angry parents. And I'm sure there are angry parents on the other side. And I don't know what the kids are saying, but hopefully no matter what, they're saying them through healthy teeth. OK, now, the second half of the question was, how much is the fluoride in drinking water harming us? I'm going to answer this question very specifically. The person asks, how much is the fluoride in our drinking water harming us? Well, I already told you ways in which it is helping the strength of your teeth. That's not debated. Again, there might be some dentists that say, oh, the bonds that are formed by fluoride are different than the ones that are naturally created with no fluoride, and so there might be some debate about that. But all of them acknowledge that those bonds and the mineralization of the teeth is stronger with fluoride. They understand and agree with the rationale, even if they don't necessarily agree with the practice as the best practice. How much is fluoride in drinking water harming you? Well, there are two things you need to ask. One is, how much fluoride are you actually drinking? Because it turns out there's a tremendous range of fluoride concentrations in tap water, depending on what city you live in. Now, I did an entire episode of the Huberman Lab podcast about water. We talked about distilled water versus spring water. We talked about hydrogenated water. We talked about alkaline water. We talked about all of those things. And we did talk about fluoride. And one of the key takeaways when you're thinking about fluoride in drinking water is to know that if fluoride concentrations in drinking water are too high or-- and this is a very important "or"-- you're consuming a lot of a particular water that contains even low levels of fluoride, well, there's the potential-- and, again, I want to highlight the word "potential" here. I don't want to cause alarm. That the fluoride is causing disruptions to thyroid hormone output or on the receptor end, in other words disruptions to thyroid hormone metabolism and usage in the body. OK, I want to be really clear here. I don't want people to think, oh, fluoride destroys your thyroid hormone. It's the dose that makes the poison. It depends on how much. Now, the Center for Disease Control have set a recommended level of 0.7mg/l of fluoride in drinking water as the level-- and here I'm paraphrasing-- that can help prevent tooth decay and promote good oral health and that they have deemed safe. But if you want to know how much fluoride is in your drinking water, whether or not it is above, at, or below that value, you need to get your tap water tested. Now, fortunately, there are websites that can tell you how much fluoride is in your drinking water. And if you trust the data on those websites, you can simply put the city you live in into one of those websites, and you'll get the information back. I'll provide a few links to those different websites in the Show Note captions for this episode. We also provided those links in the Show Note captions for the episode on Water. And then you can see. Are you adjusting the level of fluoride in your drinking water that's deemed safe, less than that value, or more than that value? But keep in mind that if you drink a little bit, a moderate amount, or a lot of fluoridated drinking water, you're going to be consuming either more or less fluoride. Just because there's a concentration that's been deemed safe by the Center for Disease Control does not actually tell you whether or not, OK, if you're drinking half a gallon of tap water a day versus a gallon versus just a couple of cups, whether or not you are in that safe zone. And of course, this is going to vary by body weight. If you're a small child, those lower levels of fluoride are going to equate to a larger total amount of fluoride as seen by the volume of the body. If you think about this, everything's by body weight volume. And this is why drug dosages are most typically calculated as a function of pounds or kilograms of body weight. Not everybody gets the same dose of every drug. And if you're a very large person, maybe you can tolerate more fluoride. As I mentioned before, high levels of fluoride have been shown to disrupt thyroid metabolism. It has also been hypothesized-- again, this is still highly debated-- hypothesized to be neurotoxic under certain conditions. That is, toxic to neurons. It can kill neurons at certain concentrations, not necessarily the concentrations present in your drinking water. A lot of the evidence that fluoride is neurotoxic is from so-called in vitro studies. So studies done effectively in a dish, although there is some in vivo evidence that it can cause a neurotoxicity, a.k.a. neurodegeneration. So I think when it comes to the topic of fluoride, people tend to bin out into not concerned and simply want fluoride to strengthen their teeth; mildly concern, kind of keeping an eye on this stuff-- you know, OK, fluoride doesn't sound great for me, but as long as the concentrations aren't too high, some people will say, I've been drinking tap water my whole life and I feel great, my teeth are strong, and my brain works, and my thyroid seems fine-- and then people who are very, very concerned about fluoride at any concentration in their drinking water. Hence, the lawsuit in California and other lawsuits around the country. So I believe that when we're talking about fluoride, you really need to think about the dosages. And you need to ask yourself which one of those three categories you fall into. Now, if you are concerned about fluoride, it does not necessarily mean that you can't drink tap water. The suggestion simply would be to filter that tap water. And during the episode I did on water, I talked about a number of different filtration approaches. Many of those filters will filter out fluoride, and you can simply look up water filters that eliminate or reduce fluoride. And then some people have enough disposable income and/or are concerned enough about fluoride in their drinking water that they will purchase or create very extensive, very thorough filtration systems to completely eliminate fluoride from their drinking water. So you'll find different ranges of concern. Again, aside from the data of high fluoride levels being disruptive to thyroid hormone pathways and possibly neurotoxic, I personally am somebody who filters the drinking water I consume out of the tap, unless that is I'm going to boil water with it for making things like loose leaf yerba mate which is one of my favorite drinks, although lately I drink this cold brew Mateina yerba mate, which by the way, is made with purified water, no fluoride. And so on and so forth. But if I'm making rice or I'm making pasta or I'm making oatmeal and I need to use tap water, I don't worry about removing the fluoride from that water. However, if I'm going to drink water, if I'm going to mix an element electrolyte pack in or just drink a glass of water or go out on a hike and take some water with me, I do use a water filter, either a filter that fills from the top and then seeps down, the ones you put in the refrigerator. Or I recently purchased a whole house filter for the drinking water taps in my house so that it does remove all the fluoride and removes some other contaminants as well. So it's going to depend on your level of concern, and it's going to depend on your disposable income and any number of other things. And I must say that every once in a while, I'll drink a little bit of tap water out of the tap without any concern about filtering the fluoride. I'm not somebody who gets hyper concerned about these things. But I do understand why some people do get hyper concerned about these things, especially people who've read up on fluoride and some of the health concerns of consuming too much fluoride, because I also find it very logical and understandable that as people learn more about how a particular substance might be harming their brain or bodily health that they will become more concerned about consuming that substance. It just stands to reason. So what am I suggesting? I suggest that you figure out how much fluoride is in your tap water. I suggest that you, then, make a decision as to whether or not to filter that water or not before drinking it. And then, of course, you have to make a decision about what sort of financial investment you're willing to make to filter that water. You can find a list of different price ranges of water filters in the Show Note captions in the Water episode. You may also want to watch that episode and go to that timestamp. And there's an enormous range there. I want to be very clear. I don't have a financial relationship to any of those filtration mechanisms. Again, some people have $0 to devote to that process of taking the fluoride out of their water and other contaminants. Some people have many, many tens of thousands of dollars. So it really just depends on your disposable income and your level of concern. But if you were to ask me, I would say, yeah, I think given that the cost of most of the filters that can remove most of the fluoride is low, and given that there is some health concern of consuming too much fluoride, why not just remove fluoride from the drinking water? And then if you say, well, won't that weaken my teeth, then I would say, well, watch the episode that's soon to come out on oral health because it's going to explain a lot of approaches, including fluoride-containing toothpaste but some other nonfluoride-containing toothpaste and other things that one can do that the community of professionally-trained dentists all agree can really help improve the mineralization state of your teeth and, indeed, can fill in cavities that have begun to form but haven't yet made it to the deeper layers of your teeth, and on and on. Now, I do have a brief story about fluoride that I'd be remiss if I didn't tell you, which essentially shows that fluoride is designed to strengthen teeth but is also indeed a poison. So when I was a kid, I had a lot of dental issues. I didn't consume much sugar. My mother, fortunately, was good about not letting us consume too much sugar. But for whatever reason, my mouth was kind of a mess. I'd brush. I'd floss. I would do all these things, but I actually had my adult teeth come in behind my baby teeth, so it didn't push out my baby teeth. So not only did I not collect from the tooth fairy, which I only recently discovered isn't real. But how would I know? Because the tooth fairy never showed up because all of my adult teeth came in behind my baby teeth. So I had to have all of my baby teeth pulled on the top. So I did not have a good relationship to the dentist as a location or a person. In fact, they had to tell me not to bite the dentist. By the way, I haven't bitten a dentist in a long time. So hopefully, my dentist, if watching this, is not too concerned. I do get twice a year cleanings. I think every dentist agrees that's a good thing to do. Some people may need less. Some people may need more. But how do you know? You need to go to a dentist to find out. Back to the story about fluoride. I started going to the dentist quite a bit because of all these dental issues that I had as a kid. And what they used to do-- I don't know if they do this anymore-- but what they used to do is they give you these little trays, which are kind of like mouth guards that you would use for boxing or hockey so your teeth don't get knocked out. And they would fill those trays with this jelly-like stuff that contained fluoride, and they put it on the top and on the bottom. And the stuff just-- oh, little bits of it would seep onto your tongue and your throat. And it was so sour. It was so awful. And they'd seat me in this little wicker chair in front of a television and turn on cartoons, as if that was supposed to make me forget how awful the whole experience was. If anything, it probably just created a Pavlovian conditioned response to hate cartoons, which I suppose did not work, because I liked cartoons then. I don't watch them now. Truly, I don't watch them now. So I sit down on this wicker chair. I've got the fluoride in my teeth with these two trays. And I'm just hating this whole process. I think I must have been about five or six years old. So I decide, in my infinite wisdom, to just swallow all the fluoride paste. So I start sucking it down through these mouth guards. I can feel it going back into my throat, and it's sour, and it's stinging. It's awful, but I'm thinking, OK, I'm just going to do this. And I'm going to sit there. I'm basically going to beat the test. And so I drink all this fluoride paste. And then, of course, I got immensely sick within about three minutes. I stood up. I turned around and puked all over the wicker chair. I think that was deliberate. Actually, looking back, it was deliberate. And puke all over the wicker chair. My mom comes running in. What happened? What did you do to him? She was very protective of me. Thanks, Mom. What did you do to him? And then I said I just swallowed the stuff. They wanted to do it again, and I stopped doing the fluoride treatment at that point. Why did I vomit? Well, I vomited because fluoride is, indeed, a poison at high concentrations. Now, do I tell you that story to make you afraid of giving your kids fluoridated toothpaste or fluoridated water? No, by all means, do what you think is best for you and for your children. For me, however, I've made some effort to avoid fluoride toothpaste. I do go to the dentist, as I mentioned, about once a year. I confess, during the pandemic, it was probably less, as they were busy, and it was hard to schedule, et cetera. I've had very, very few cavities in my adult life, hardly any. And my gum health is very strong, et cetera, et cetera, largely through taking on protocols that I'm going to describe in the Oral Health episode and that were recommended to me by friends who are both dentists and other friends who are periodontists. Because, again, there are a lot of things that we can do to strengthen our teeth in natural ways, by building up those hydroxyapatite bonds, which are the natural bonds that teeth form. And yes, believe it or not, being able to reverse some early-formed cavities, as long as they haven't made it deep into the tooth. Also things like using a soft toothbrush, because if you brush too hard, if you take that approach and you're going to brush your teeth really hard, get them really, really clean, yes, you'll scrape off all the biofilm, you'll avoid tartar build up, but you can really cause some tenting of the gum tissue above the teeth and those little recesses back in there where bacteria get in. And there's now a lot of really strong evidence showing that some of that bacteria can translate into cardiac disease, can translate into metabolic disease, and maybe even into some neurologic disease. So it's serious stuff. Oral health is one of the most important areas of health. And it's one of the most overlooked areas of oral health. And I think people generally fall into two categories. And I'll use these two categories to frame up the episode on oral health that's coming. One category of person seems really bullish on their oral health. They're like, keep my teeth white and clean, and they floss and brush twice a day, every day. And they use tooth whiteners and mouthwash and all those things. And the other category is kind of blasé about it. Yeah, I brush my teeth in the morning so that my breath doesn't kill every person I get into an interaction with, and so on and so forth. But in reality, both the group of people that are doing an immense number of things to try and keep their teeth white and their breath fresh are, yes, doing things that are good for their oral health, but also, no doubt, damaging their oral health, in particular the oral microbiome, which is absolutely critical. And then of course, the other category of people that are neglecting their oral hygiene and are not taking mouthwashes and things like that are also damaging their oral health but in different ways. So during the episode on oral health, I'll spell out all the things that you can do, most of which, by the way are completely zero cost, many of them actually will save you money, both in the short and long term, and can really help you improve your oral microbiome, the strength of your teeth, and reduce the number of cavities, maybe even reverse cavities that have begun to form and are not too deep into the tooth yet, and in a really nice way, all of that independent of your stance on fluoride. Thank you for joining for the beginning of this Ask Me Anything episode. To hear the full episode, and to hear future episodes of these Ask Me Anything sessions, plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman Lab podcast Standard channel and Premium tools not released anywhere else, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman Lab podcast Premium channel, it's really twofold. First of all, it's to raise support for the Standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast. And to fund research, in particular research done on human beings, so not animal models but on human beings, which I think we all agree is a species that we are most interested in. And we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those protocols will be distributed through all channels, not just the premium channel but through all channels, Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now, an especially exciting feature of the Premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do dollar-for-dollar match on all funds raised for research through the Premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the Premium channel to further support research for science and science-related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Huberman Lab Premium channel, again, there's a cost of $10 per month, or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMAs. You can ask questions and get answers to your questions. And you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the AMAs and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab podcast episodes not found elsewhere. And again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the Premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium. Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium. And as always, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]

Title: Tools to Enhance Working Memory & Attention
Published: 2024-01-29 13:00:08 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I discuss working memory, which is critical for learning and productivity, strategy setting, goal seeking, and navigating new environments. I explain the key role of dopamine and the biological mechanisms underlying working memory and how working memory differs from both short- and long-term memory.

I also describe science-supported tools to enhance working memory and attention—including zero- or low-cost behavioral, supplemental and pharmacologic approaches. I include how to assess your working memory and how to use memory tasks to determine your baseline dopamine levels in certain brain circuits.

This episode provides listeners with highly actionable tools to assess and improve their attention to specific tasks and task-switching capacity and to enhance their overall productivity.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today we are discussing working memory working memory is a special category of memory in which we are able to hold small amounts of information in our mind for short periods of time working memory is also very closely related to attention so for any of you that are interested in how to develop better focus and attention understanding what working memory is and some of the things that you can do to improve your working memory can be very beneficial today I'm going to talk about what working memory is including some of the underlying biology although I promise irrespective of whether or not you know any biology or you are an expert in biology I'll make the conversation accessible to you in addition I will talk about tools to improve working memory and I'll also compare working memory to other forms of memory memory like long-term memory and short-term memory and through that understanding I'm confident that you'll be able to develop better focus as well as be able to commit certain forms of information to your short and long-term memory stores before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is matina matina makes loose leaf and ready to drink ybba mate I often discuss ybba mate's benefits such as regulating blood sugar it's high antioxidant content the ways that it can improve digestion and possible neuroprotective effects I also drink yamate because I love the taste while there are a lot of different choices of yerbamate drinks out there I love matina because again they have the no sugar variety as well as the fact that both their loose leaf and their canned varieties are of the the absolute best quality so much so that I decided to become a partial owner in the company although I must say even if they hadn't allowed me to do that I would be drinking matina is the cleanest tasting and best yerbamate you can find I love the taste of brooded loose leaf matina yerbamate and I particularly love the taste of maa's new canned cold brew zero sugar yerbamate which I personally help them develop if you'd like to try matina

carried out online now I've been going to therapy for well over 30 years initially I didn't have a choice it was a condition of being allowed to stay in school but pretty soon I realized that therapy is extremely valuable in fact I consider doing regular therapy just as important as getting regular exercise including cardiovascular exercise and resistance training which of course I also do every week the reason I know therapy is so valuable is that if you can find a therapist with whom you can develop a really good rapport you not only get terrific support for some of the challenges in your life but you also can derive tremendous insights from that therapy insights that can allow you to better not just your emotional life and your relationship life but of of course also the relationship to yourself and to your professional life to all sorts of career goals in fact I see therapy is one of the key components for meshing together all aspects of one's life and being able to really direct one's focus and attention toward what really matters if you'd like to try betterhelp go to betterhelp.com huberman to get 10% off your first month again that's betterhelp.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by Helix sleep helix IC sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are of the absolute highest quality I've spoken many times before on this and other podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is to make sure that your mattress matches your sleep requirements the Helix website has a brief two-minute quiz that if you go to it will ask you questions such as do you sleep on your back your side or your stomach do you tend to run hot or cold during the middle of the night as well as some other questions that allow you to determine the optimal mattress for you when I took the quiz I personally matched to their dusk mattress D which has allowed me to significantly improve my sleep so if you're interested in significantly improving your sleep go to helixsleep.com huberman take their brief two-minute quiz and they'll match you to a customized

okay let's talk about working memory and let's start off this discussion by comparing working memory to other forms of memory that most people are more familiar with or at least when most people hear the word memory they typically are thinking about long-term memory like one's ability to remember the capitals of states or countries the different continents directions from one location to another even one's name all of those things are examples of long-term memory now I want to emphasize that long-term memory really has two components there are what we call declarative long-term memories so these are the things that we can declare things like facts about ourselves or the world or others and then there are procedural long-term memories procedural long-term memories as the name suggests are aspects of our memory that allow us to perform certain procedures they are literally action steps that we take to for instance ride a bicycle or drive a car which by the way we might not be conscious of ourselves doing after we learn that is after we pass information into our procedural long-term memory but even once those things become reflexive they are stored in our long-term memory now a discussion of long-term memory is not the focus today but me being a neuroscientist and I like to think you all generally being interested in the underlying biology I'll just mention that there's a key structure within the brain that is part of a larger neural network that is a collection of structures which is absolutely essential for the formation and storage of long-term memories and that's the hippocampus which in Latin means seahorse and it does look a little bit like a seahorse but you actually have one on each side of your brain so we say hippocampi plural and so what we know is that if people have damage to their hippocampus of any kind that people have trouble accessing or forming long-term memory sometimes both and there's a lot more that we could say about long-term memory indeed I did an entire episode of The hubman Lab podcast about the formation and storage of long-term memories including some tools to improve long-term memories we'll touch on a few of those tools later today but you can access that episode if you go to hubman lab.com and just put memory into the search function and you'll find it there in the meantime if we want to understand working memory we not only have to understand how it's different from long-term memory but also how it's different from short-term memories short-term memory is a capacity that we all have that as the name suggests represents a short-term memory bank for information that may or may not get passed into long-term memory so for instance if you've learned anything and of course you have if you can understand what I'm saying you've learned English language if you can write you've learned how to write Etc well in order to learn those things and to commit them to long-term memory the information required to do those things and to have that knowledge needed to be held in short-term memory and short-term memories are the sorts of memories that we maintain for somewhere between a few minutes and potentially a few hours maybe a little bit longer but only a certain percentage of that is passed into our long-term memory so for instance if you listen to this podcast or you go to a course lecture uh whether or not that lecture is about cognitive material or whether or not it's about learning a new physical skill regardless of what you learn you're only going to learn a certain amount of that information but were we to examine how much of the information you just heard or that you're hearing now you remember immediately after this podcast episode as compared to say a week later we know based on gosh millions of scientific papers and studies that you are going to have more information in your short-term memory stores shortly after being exposed to new information then you will later in other words only a small percentage of what we perceive what we see what we hear Etc gets passed into short-term memory and then only a fraction of that gets passed into long-term memory now the neural circuits for short-term memory and the passage of short-term memories into long-term memory involve a lot of different brain structures but here again we can implicate the hip hi campus Because the actual passage of short-term memories into long-term memories occurs in part within the hippocampus and then a lot of people don't know this some of the memories that we think of as long-term memories are actually distributed into the neocortex which is the outer portion of the brain now the point here is less to fill your mind with different names of things and nomenclature but rather to get you thinking about what's involved in creating short and long-term memories and equally important that even though the hippocampus is critically involved in the formation of short and long-term memories that the formation of short and long-term memories is really a network phenomenon in fact among the more important themes that comes up again and again on this podcast anytime that we're talking about Neuroscience or actually biology in any case is that rarely if ever is there one location in the brain where something happens typically it's a network phenomenon meaning it's the collaboration of a bunch of different brain areas passing information from one location to the next and storing it in a kind of distributed way way now another key thing to understand about working memory and how it is different from short and long-term memory is that the formation of short and long-term memories almost always involves neuroplasticity neuroplasticity is the nervous system's ability to change in response to experience now there are different types of neuroplasticity so often when we hear about neuroplasticity in the popular sphere people don't emphasize that there are different types of neuroplasticity and it's worth paying a little bit of attention to what those different typ are there is for instance what we call long-term potentiation long-term potentiation or ltp as the acronym goes is the strengthening of connections between neurons as a consequence of their repeated firing very closely together in time okay there's a lot more to it but if you've ever heard the phrase fire together wire together sometimes that is misattributed to Donald Hebb who did talk about neuroplasticity by the way Donald Hebb was a psychologist up in Canada who talked about neuroplasticity in the context of lots of different forms of learning but that fire together wire together phrase was not actually stated by Donald Hebb it was stated by Carla shatz my colleague at Stanford and she was referring to ltp but other forms of neuroplasticity that occur mainly in development when neurons fire very closely in time and thereby strengthen those connections which can include ltp okay so for now think of ltp as anytime that some small group of neurons could be two neurons could be 2,000 neurons are very active closely together in time and they have access to one another physically and the consequence is often not always but it's often ltp that is the strengthening of those connections such that after that barrage of activity subsides those neurons can speak to each other they can communicate through electrical activity and chemical activity much more easily their communication is more robust it's like removing a wall between a a conversation such that the conversation can take place more fluidly now there are other forms of neuroplasticity including LTD longterm depression which unfortunately the name often calls to mind ideas about depression as a psychiatric or a psychological symptom but has nothing to do with that long-term depression is simply the inverse of ltp it's actually the weakening or the removal of connections that we call synapses between neurons I want to emphasize that both ltp and LTD are both critically involved in lots of different kinds of learning and both of them tend to be involved in the formation of both short-term memories and long-term memories and this is very important in the removal of short-term memories and long-term memories literally forgetting of certain things because as we all know there are many things that we will never forget and there are also things that we almost always forget now there's a third form of neuroplasticity that's involved in the formation of short and long-term memories that's important for us to discuss just briefly but I do want to emphasize that there are not just three forms of neuroplasticity there are many other forms dozens if not more things like Spike timing dependent plasticy paired pulse facilitation and on and on but the third type of neuroplasticity that I'd like to mention now is neurogenesis neurogenesis is the formation of new neurons now neurogenesis is robust in the developing nervous system we know this it's robust in the developing nervous system of animals and humans however neurogenesis the literal formation of new neurons in the brain is a very exciting idea and it does occur and it's very exciting in a way that has motivated lots of popular press Outlets to talk about or to discuss papers that have discovered neurogenesis in the adult brain because let's be honest what's more exciting than the idea that your brain can add new brain cells later in life and indeed that has been shown even in people well into their 80s and 90s however it's very important to know that the total amount of neurogenesis that occurs in the adult human brain is infantes small as a mechanism for neuroplasticity and learning as compared to the other forms of neuroplasticity that we discussed such as long-term potentiation and long-term depression so I don't want to you know throw cold water on the topic of neurogenesis it's an incredibly interesting and important topic but all too often they tend to eclipse the much more common mechanism for the formation of short and long-term memories which are those other forms we just talked about ltp LTD Etc so the point here is that yes indeed there are new neurons that can be added in the adult brain maybe even in the adult human brain and there is some evidence that some of those new neurons are added to the hippocampus in fact a particular region of the hippocampus called the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and there's been a lot of controversy about how much neurogenesis occurs or doesn't occur and whether or not it occurs after puberty or not there's a whole field of people battling over this now for several decades ades but one thing is very clear neurogenesis while it's very exciting and intriguing is not the main mechanism by which the formation of short and long-term memories occurs when you learn new information as you are right now the storage of that information in your short-term memory networks which is then passed on to your long-term memory networks and that can be recalled that allows you to State certain facts about for instance the existence of this thing called a hippocampus hopefully you will remember that going forward or your ability to perform any kind of motor movement that you learned now or way back in childhood most of that is the consequence of the strengthening of particular connections and the weakening of other types of connections those are the two major forms of neuroplasticity okay so I don't want you to get the impression that there's something wrong with my memory and that I forgot that this episode is not about short or long-term memory but it's about working memory and indeed I have not forgotten so now is where I tell you why I've been talking about short and long-term memory and the mechanisms of those because I want them to provide a stark contrast for what we call working memory working memory as far as we know does not involve neuroplasticity or at least if it does it's not a particularly robust aspect of working memory rather working memory is the reflection of a particular neural circuit running an algorithm over and over and over for different types of information but the information isn't stored it is actually intentionally discarded now what sorts of daily activities and life activities would require working memory the answer to that is basically everything that you need to do but that you don't want to remember now what types of things would those be well let's think about it most all of us learned at some point in our life to tie our own shoes presumably you know how to tie your own shoes if you don't perhaps you should learn or wear velcro or slippers I don't know but assuming you can tie your own shoes that's something that you know how to do and you can do it as a procedural long-term memory you can do that action you don't have to think about it too much working memory would come into play when say you wake up in the morning and you know that you need to head out for a jog but you also need to make a cup of coffee first and you need to remember where the coffee is where your shoes are and perhaps you're making a phone call or you're having a conversation while you need to tie your shoes and so on and so forth working memory is basically the taking in of information that's critical for you to sequence your actions over a short period of time and then forget that sequence for instance I'm willing to bet that you put your shoes on to go running before you go running that's sort of a duh and if you're like me you drink your water your coffee your yante before you go running the point here is that if you wake up in the morning and you like caffeine before you go for a run there are certain series of action steps that you need to carry out to hydrate make that cup of coffee or tea drink it put on your shoes head out the door you need to sequence things properly but you don't want to to commit your long-term or even your short-term memory stores to carrying out that sequence you simply want to be able to carry out that sequence and then discard that information about the sequence and focus your attention on for instance what trajectory you're going to run through the park or around your neighborhood then you want to discard that information and you want to lean into the next portion of your day and so on and so on in fact working memory is involved in essentially every activity both cognitive and motor from the point wake up in the morning until the time you go to sleep at night for every single day of your life and we know this because there are indeed people who have diminished working memory or even lack working memory entirely although the latter is somewhat rare it has happened and as you can imagine they have a complete failure of ability to sequence activities and their lives are extremely difficult they need a ton of assistance from other people even more assistants than do people who have minimal or no long-term memory okay so this is really highlighting just how important working memory is working memory is basically the way that you navigate any immediate environment and as I mentioned earlier it's very closely tied to attention because in order to know what to do now and then what to do subsequently and then subsequent to that you need to be able to hold your attention to the things you need to do so working memory and attention collaborate literally at a neural circuit level and at a neurochemical level in order to allow you to move through your day in an Adaptive functional way and people who have challenges with attention or Focus or working memory and sometimes it can be hard to dissociate which one they're having challenges with really have a hard time moving through life as compared to people whose attention and working memory is more robust now the good news is today we're going to talk about working memory some of the neural circuits involved and some of the neurochemicals involved that can augment or improve working memory and we're also going to talk about what one can do to directly increase the amount of neurotransmission of those particular chemicals within the circuits that control working memory in other words to improve your working memory now I can talk about working memory and the mechanisms Etc all day long but as is often the case sometimes it's better to not just learn about Concepts but actually to experience them in real time so what we're going to do now is I'm actually going to give you a working memory test this is the sort of working memory test that you would take if you were to go into a psychology laboratory or a neuroscience Laboratory and they were studying working memory in humans now there's another advantage to us doing this in real time right here as you're listening or as you're listening and watching and that's because you're going to get data you're going to get information about what your Baseline working memory capacity is and you're going to want to keep those data in your short-term memory stores maybe even your long-term memory stores but certainly your short-term memory stores because shortly later in this episode I'm going to talk about different ways to improve your working memory depending on where your Baseline working memory starts which by the way turns out to be a pretty good proxy for the levels of a neuromodulator called dopamine within the neural circuits that control working memory so right now let's take a working memory task we're going to do this purely through audio form because I realize some people are watching and listening to this on YouTube and others are just listening to this episode so there are not going to be any visual cues or slides that I present and that's perhaps what distinguishes what we're to do most from what would happen in a laboratory typically in a laboratory there would be some visual presentation of what I'm about to say but here because of the format that most of you are consuming this information by we're going to do this purely by Audio so the first test of your working memory is very simple I'm going to read off a series of letters and your task is to remember as many of those letters as you can the first string of letters is J K k z p i okay just to make this really easy I'm going to say it twice although typically in a working memory task it would just be said once but I'm going to make this extra easy j k z p i okay now you in your own head can try and recite back those letters if you like okay second string of letters r r o m k l e I'm going to make this extra simple and do it again not typical for a working memory task but there are some working memory tasks where that happens r o m k l e okay now a third string of letters this one's going to be a little bit longer so queue up that working memory and attention w a c q v d n I'll repeat that again w a c q v d n how many of the letters I just read can you remember okay so depending on how many letters you can remember perhaps you have a low moderate or high degree of working memory keep in mind that some of you are perhaps doing other things you're attending to driving or other tasks within your home or your office and so perhaps you weren't able to pay full attention so there'll be some variation there but nonetheless after reading each of those strings of letters you were asked to recall those letters in your mind and if you wrote them down and you're rereading them yes that's cheating but how about this what if I were to ask you now about the simplest first string of letters the one that consisted of only five letters how many of you can remember any of those five letters now okay I can't hear you if you're shouting them out uh I can't see you if you're raising your hand but chances are most of you have forgotten the first series of letters even though it was quite short and you could remember it early on that ability to remember that string of letters when you first heard them and indeed I read them twice so I'd be very surprised if any of you couldn't remember that string of letters after hearing them twice but I also read you some other letters in the interim okay so that now just a couple minutes later I'm asking you to remember that first string of five letters and assuming that you didn't write it down you're not cheating chances are you remember anywhere from two to zero of those letters in that first word which is a perfect example of your working memory nothing got committed to short-term much less long-term memory rather your working memory was able to work with that information hold it in mind for just as long as you thought you needed to know that information but then thank goodness that information was discarded you didn't know that I was going to ask you for that first string of letters again after reading you the longer string of letters but I did that deliberately to show you how your working memory works so in some sense the working memory task is a bit unusual in that it's a test of yes memory in the very very short term but also a test of your ability to forget to discard information that's not critical and that gets us back to the original definition of working memory which is our ability to attend to specific small batches of information remember it for just as long as we think we need to and then to discard that information and by the way if you want to know what those first five letters were they were j k z p i I'd like to take a brief moment and thank one of our sponsors and that's ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens I started taking ag1 way back in 2012 the reason I started taking it and the reason I still take it every day is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas for vitamins and minerals and it ensures that I get enough Prebiotic and probiotic to support support gut health now gut health is something that over the last 10 years we realized is not just important for the health of our gut but also for our immune system and for the production of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators things like dopamine and serotonin in other words gut health is critical for proper brain functioning now of course I strive to consume healthy Whole Foods for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day but there are a number of things in ag1 including specific micronutrients that are hard to get from Whole Foods or at least in efficient quantities so ag1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals that I need probiotics prebiotics the adaptogens and critical micronutrients so anytime somebody asks me if they were to take Just One supplement what that supplement should be I tell them ag1 because ag1 supports so many different systems within the body that are involved in mental health physical health and performance to try ag1 go to drink a1.com huberman and you'll get a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 and five free travel packs of of ag1 again that's drink a1.com huberman so now is where we talk a little bit about the neural circuitry and the neurochemistry of working memory now it's important that we do this because in a few minutes you're also going to learn that people generally fall into two broad bins of having a high or low Baseline of a certain neurochemical in the brain that affords them either high or low working memory capacity now in reality it's a distribution in fact it's what we call a normal distribution so it really isn't two bins but during today's discussion and in fact in a lot of laboratory studies we can actually bin people into these two groups the neural circuitry underlying working memory involves a lot of different brain locations that is a lot of different neural networks collaborating to create this thing we call working memory however there are a couple of key hubs that is locations within the brain that are especially important for working memory the ones that I'd like to focus focus on today involve the prefrontal cortex so this is neural real estate that resides just behind the forehead and the neurons in the brain stem so further back in the brain that manufacture dopamine and that send their little wires that we call axons up to the prefrontal cortex to release dopamine dopamine is a neuromodulator many people are familiar with dopamine and familiar with it in the context of motivation and drive sometimes people mistakenly think it's only involved in pleasure but dopamine is involved in motivation and drive when dopamine systems go Ary that is if their levels get too high that can create manic States it can create addictive States when dopamine levels are too low you can get movement challenges such as in Parkinson's which is a deficit or a literal destruction of the neurons that manufacture dopamine there are a bunch of different areas of the brain that those dopamine neurons in the brain stem project to but for right now we're going to focus almost entirely on the dopamine projections from the brain stem to the prefrontal cortex which is called the misoc cortical circuitry I'm not going to get into the origins or the meaning of the misoc cortical versus other dopamine projection systems I did that in a couple of episodes about ADHD and attention and dopamine in particular and you can find those at huberman lab.com just put dopamine and circuits into the search function and it will take you to those particular time stamps where I describe that but since we want to keep things fairly top Contour at the level of neural circuit here just know that there are a bunch of neurons that manufacture dopamine back in the brain stem that send their axons those little wires up to the prefrontal cortex and that the amount of dopamine released per unit time so in a certain amount of time strongly dictates the extent to which working memory capacity is going to be high medium or low now I want to be very clear because I'm going to come back to this a little bit later again and again it is the case that when dopamine levels are lower that is either there are fewer neurons that have the potential to release dopamine in the frontal cortex or for whatever reason less is being released in the frontal cortex that working memory performance tends to be lower as compared to conditions where dopamine release or the availability of dopamine is higher however it is not the case that more dopamine is always going to equate to improved working memory this is so important that I'm going to say it again it is not always the case that increasing the amount of dopamine Transmission in the frontal cortex leads to improvements in working memory there is a specific criteria that allows us to predict whether or not it will improve or maintain or actually degrade working memory performance so before you head to the end of the podcast to try and figure out ways to increase dopamine to improve working memory please keep that fact in mind don't just commit it to your working memory commit it to your short and long-term memory because that's very important if your goal is to improve your working memory with that said I do want to describe just a little little bit of research showing the relationship between having a low working memory span as it's called the ability to only remember a few letters or numbers or short batches of information as compared to a high working memory span meaning longer strings of letters longer strings of numbers which of course in the real world translates to being able to carry out shorter versus longer action sequences as described earlier in the scenario where you're getting up in the morning and you're making coffee and you're heading out for run etc etc people do differ in terms of their working memory capacity and there's a classic study done by kols and desposito and colleagues this was published in 2008 where they had a way to label the amount of dopamine that is available for release in the frontal cortex in human subjects they did this by the injection of a specific Dy that Dy gets taken up specifically by the neurons in the brain that manufacture dopamine then they were able to image the brains of those people while those people were Wide Awake using something called positron emission tomorrow graphy again the specific tool isn't necessarily important but since some of you like to know and what they found is that for people that had a high working memory span that is could remember long strings of numbers or letters or other information they tended to be the people that had more dopamine available for release in the frontal cortex either because they had more of the dopamine neurons themselves or similar number of neurons but those neurons had more dopamine to release okay and they also found the converse individuals that had a low working memory span and ability had less dopamine available for release so that establishes a correlation but it's not causal a different study which is also a classic was carried out by brazowy Brown roswold and Goldman and this is a really important study because in this study they were able to introduce small amounts of dopamine directly into the cortex and evaluate working memory capacity now anytime working memory test is done the same pattern always emerges this is regardless of any dopamine being infused into the brain which is people and animals for that matter are very good at remembering short spans of numbers letters or other types of information so if you tell them one thing like the letter a and then you ask them do you remember the letter almost everybody remembers that but if you give them a string of 10 letters they remember fewer of those 10 letters that's sort of obvious but it's an important point to emphasize nonetheless and so there's a kind of a dropping off curve of performance as one progresses from fewer to Greater number of items to be remembered in this study when dopamine was introduced to the frontal cortex the number of things that individuals could remember simply increased it was a very straightforward result more dopamine introduced allowed longer letter number and information strings to be remembered and of course forgotten because that's what working memory involves remembering and then discarding of information shortly thereafter now the findings I just described complement what I said before which is the naturally occurring experiment bring people into the lab measure their working memory span look at how much dopamine they make higher dopamine better working memory lower dopamine lower working memory the experiment I just described was one in which dopamine is introduced showing that dopamine is very likely the rate limiting or the capacity limiting it's probably the better way to put it the capacity limiting neurom modulator for improving working memory that's a fancy nerd speaker way of saying more dopamine allows for better working memory but a critical feature of this experiment is that they did a number of experiments where they didn't introduce dopamine but instead they introduced other neuromodulators to the prefrontal cortex such as norepinephrine or serotonin and the interesting finding is that the addition of norepinephrine or serotonin which of course are other neuromodulators that can change the firing patterns of neurons in the prefrontal cortex but elsewhere as well it's just that in this case they were added to the prefrontal cortex had no effect on working memory it neither improved nor degraded working memory when those neuromodulators were introduced in other words dopamine and perhaps only dopamine seems to be the dominant neuromodulator for regulating the degree that is whether or not you have small medium or large amounts of working memory capacity in the prefrontal cortex and of course there have been a bunch of other experiments that are worth mentioning briefly in this context such as taking people that have a high working memory capacity and indeed have their brains imaged and one sees that they have high levels of Baseline dopamine especially the dopamine projecting to the prefrontal cortex and then they're given a drug that depletes dopamine within the prefrontal cortex and their performance drops and so what's so nice about the literature around working memory is that while I'm not covering all of that literature exhaustively it all tends to Jive it all points in a direction whereby the levels of of dopamine being released in the prefrontal cortex during working memory tasks correlates very strongly with capacity to perform working memory tasks lower dopamine lower working memory span as it's called higher dopamine higher working memory span okay so next we're going to do another working memory task different than the one we did earlier and we're going to do that with a specific purpose in mind which is for you to be able to determine what your working memory capacity is and by extension your Baseline levels of dopamine or at least the levels of dopamine that are likely being released into your prefrontal cortex while you do these working memory tasks in other words we're going to try and figure out whether or not you are of the low medium or high working memory capacity and of course we're doing that in part to try and establish whether or not you likely have low medium or high amounts of dopamine available for release in the prefrontal cortex of course we're not putting you into a positron Omission tomography scanning device we aren't able to do that for obvious reasons but keep in mind that what we about to do is very similar and in some cases identical to laboratory studies where the researchers were trying to determine what people's levels of dopamine within these particular neural networks we've been discussing the misoc cortical pathway are likely to be in other words performance on The Working memory task that we are about to do is a decent indication of what the dopamine levels that are available for release in your prefrontal cortex perhaps might be now I say perhaps might be because I don't want to cause any unnecessary alarm if for instance you fall into the low working memory span group in fact if you fall into the low working memory span group there are actually some terrific tools that you can use to improve dopamine Transmission in those Pathways and improve your working memory I also don't want people to get the impression that somehow performance on this working memory task is reflective of some larger dopamine issue in the brain and certainly it is not I repeat it is not diagnostic of Parkinson's or any kind of neurod deener generative condition although I will say that deficits in working memory are common in patients with Parkinson for obvious reasons those patients have deficits in dopamine neurons not only production but the number of dopamine neurons it's one of the Hallmark features of Parkinson's but also in things like traumatic brain injury Etc but the working memory task that you're about to take when given to a general population or a group of undergraduates or you know so-called normals or typical control subjects which all of you are okay so unless you're dealing with with a traumatic brain injury or you know you have Parkinson's we know that the data that you're going to get back right now is very similar to the data that people get back when they do these sorts of studies in a laboratory that is it's typical for some people to have a short working memory span some people to have a medium working memory span and some people that have a high working memory span and today we're actually just going to divide into two bins short working memory span and high working memory span and we can have some degree of confidence that correlates with the amount of dopamine available for release in the front Al cortex but and this is a very important Point as we progress along this discussion of working memory the neural circuits dopamine Etc I want to make clear something that I said earlier which is that it is not the case that increasing the amount of dopamine that's available always increases working memory spin in fact there's a common circumstance whereby people with a relatively High degree of working memory capacity increase their dopamine levels even further using pharmacology or other methods that we'll discuss and their per performance actually can degrade okay so if any of that is confusing now we'll make it all very simple going forward so that if you decide to implement any of the protocols discussed in this episode that you are aware of what you can expect and whether or not you in the category of people that should or perhap should not incorporate those protocols okay let's test your working memory again this time the working memory task is going to be a little bit different than the one you did previously this working memory task involves me reading six different sentences to you and your job is to pay attention to these six sentences because you're going to be asked some information about these sentences in a few moments the first sentence is real estate costs are going up the second sentence is the Atlantic Ocean is warm in summer the third sentence is there's a lot of interest now in electric cars the fourth sentence is some reptiles eat only one once a year the fifth sentence is kids nowadays look at screens more than 60% of their Waking Life and the sixth and final sentence is football can mean different sports depending on the country okay so I read you six sentences they were moderately long I confess your job for the working memory task is now to recall as many of the final words of each of those sentences as you can I'll give you a few moments to do that now before I tell you what the final word of each of those sentences actually is I want to remind everybody that working memory capacity follows a normal distribution so some of you will be able to remember the final word of perhaps five or even six of those sentences although I must say that is exceedingly rare some of you are going to be able to remember three to four of the final words of those sentences and that's more typical that actually represents the average or the mean as we call it and then fewer people although still many of you will only be able to remember one or two of the final words of those sentences okay so now I'm assuming that most of you have tried to call to memory the final word of as many of those six sentences as you can and maybe you've written them down or you've typed them into your phone or you have some record of what you recall those six final words of those sentences are now I'm going to tell you the actual final word of each of those sentences the final word of the first sentence was up because as you may recall the sentence was real estate costs are going up the final word of the second sentence was summer because the sentence was the Atlantic Ocean is warm in summer the final word of the third sentence was Cars because the sentence was there is a lot of interest in electric cars the final word of the fourth sentence was year because the sentence was some reptiles eat only once a year the final word of the fifth sentence was life because the sentence was kids nowadays look at screens more than 60% of their Waking Life and the final word of the sixth sentence was country because the sentence was football can mean different sports depending on the country okay so be honest with yourself and tell yourself and you don't have to tell anyone else if you don't want to how many of the final words of those six sentences you could remember correctly it's important that you remember them correctly again the number of words that you can recall that is your working memory span is going to vary from person to person but we can take the normal distribution of those scores and sort of draw a line down the middle and say that if you could remember three to six of the final words of those sentences correctly you're going to fall into the high working memory span group whereas if you could only remember one or two or maybe zero of the final words of those six sent then you're going to be in the low working memory span group again I don't want to alarm anybody this doesn't mean that you have any Global memory deficits or dopamine deficits but it is important especially if you plan to apply any of the protocols to improve working memory that you Faithfully that is you accurately report your working memory performance at least to yourself now as you recall whether or not you have low or high and here we are just binning into low and high there's no medium we've divided right at that line we're saying if you can remember 3 to six we're calling that high working memory span at least for this discussion and if you can remember fewer than three even down to zero of the final words of those sentences that's low working memory span we're dividing it in two we divided you into two groups and we do know when this has been done in large numbers of human subjects and some in some cases all of those subjects have their brains imaged for the amount of dopamine available for release in their prefrontal cortex that short workking memory span correlates with lower amounts of dopamine whereas higher working memory span or longer working memory span whatever you want to call it correlates with more dopamine available for release in the prefrontal cortex now this is where things get really interesting and frankly really exciting for everybody especially the folks in the low working memory span group work from martus bazito and colleagues at UC Berkeley as well as other Laboratories have explored the consequences of increasing dopamine levels in the brain of typical populations of individuals so these are not people with Parkinson's or TBI but undergraduate students which we do realize is not completely representative of the quote unquote normal population outside the university but also people from the community so people who are not University students and so on and the ways that they've increased dopamine in those individuals had tended to rely on pharmacology so these are prescription drugs that most often have been developed for theat treat M of Parkinson's in order to increase dopamine levels but for some other purposes as well drugs like bromocryptine which we know are so-called dopamine agonis and agonis is a drug that has the consequence of increasing the amount of a given neurochemical in this case dopamine whereas an antagonist is a drug that either blocks or prevents or somehow lowers the total available amount of a certain chemical such as dopamine or serotonin Etc so bromocryptine is a drug that increases dopamine so when human subjects came into a laboratory didn't take any drug no bromocryptine yet and of course they were being evaluated for whether or not they were taking any meds for ADHD their caffeine consumption Etc there were certain rule-in and Rule outs for that study but certainly people that were taking any kind of prescription medication for ADHD were not included in the study or were eliminated from the study because those drugs can indeed increase dopamine as well as some other neuromodulators such as norepinephrine and epinephrine I covered all that in two ADHD episodes that I did which again you can find at hubman lab.com just go to the search function put in ADHD in any event in these studies they took people that had not taken any drugs to increase dopamine had their working memory measured very similarly to the way that you measured your working memory a few minutes ago with the six sentence business that we did and then they took bromocryptine and they either took a low a moderate or high dose of bromocryptine and 90 minutes later they took a working memory task and what was observed was very interesting you can probably predict what it is based on everything I've set up until now individuals that initially had low Baseline levels of dopamine and therefore shorter working memory span so they only remembered zero to about three of the final words of that six sentence series their performance significantly improved they were able to remember four and in some cases up to six the final words of those sentences now that is in complete agreement with everything we set up until now simply says that dopamine is important for working memory if you start off with lower dopamine stores or dopamine availability for releasing the prefrontal cortex lower working memory performance increase dopamine through ingestion of bromocryptine which is this dopamine Agonist all of the circuit changes that we want and would expect to improve working memory occur and indeed working memory improves okay very straightforward that's interesting but the even more interesting part of the study is that individuals that already had high working memory span when they took bromocryptine at a low or a moderate dose their working memory did not increase further now if somebody was already getting six of the final words of those six sentences well then of course they couldn't improve their performance anymore but many of the people in the high working memory span group of course only remembered four in some cases three typically it'll be four five or six of the final words of those sentences when they took bromocryptine at low or moderate doses their working memory did not improve significantly there was either no change or a very modest change and here's where things get really interesting when individuals who already had a high working memory span took the highest dose of bromocryptine and by the way studies verified that the amount of dopamine available indeed increased so that was important to do and they did that well their working memory performance actually decreased such that now they had a short or a low working memory span so what this tells us is that the relationship between dopamine and working memory follows an inverted u-shaped function so imagine a u and then just flip it over meaning if you have low dopamine availability in the prefrontal cortex working memory span is short as you increase that amount working memory becomes greater but if you increase the amount of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex too much working memory span actually drops significantly below the Baseline that you started with now this is important for a number of reasons not the least of which is the known relationship between working memory and attention now this is very important to understand in the context of ADHD but also for people who don't have ADHD and are struggling to maintain focus and attention and carry out working memory tasks throughout their normal everyday life not in the laboratory but just moving through life because these days we hear a lot a lot a lot about people struggling with focus and attention perhaps we don't know perhaps in part due to overuse of smartphone social media Etc although there's not yet a direct causal relationship that's been established the data that are emerging suggests that indeed overuse of those things can cause problems but regardless of the source there does seem to be more ADHD both in kids and in adults and subclinical challenges in focus and attention and here's where things get really interesting as it relates to the neural circuitry work from desposito and colleagues and other Laboratories as well have shown using the similar Paradigm that I described before giving people drugs to increase their Baseline levels of dopamine above their initial starting point of short or long-term memory span capacity and then had people can perform different types of working memory tasks that tap into two different aspects of attention in working memory up until now we've been talking about working memory it's kind of just one thing but working memory actually involves two things or at least two things the first is that in order to carry out a working memory task into to attend to something to really focus we need the ability to rule out distractors we need to be able to not pay attention to things that would otherwise distract Us in addition to that we need to be able to switch from one context to the next right making the cup of coffee to putting on one shoes and heading out the door and in some cases layering different contexts together talking on the phone while tying one shoes and so on and so forth what this work shows us is that the ability to task switch and context switch that is to shift around what it is that we're paying attention to and interleave different things that we're paying attention to something that's so critical for moving through our daily lives is largely dependent on the dopamine projections to a structure in the brain called the basil ganglia which is a structure I've talked about before on this podcast but if you didn't hear about it we can just broadly Define this structure as being involved in movement generation and stopping movement generation in fact it's often discussed as the neural circuitry that generates go as in do commands and noo don't do commands so the basil ganglia are involved in task switching and they involved in task switching in part by sending certain commands to go do certain things and no go to not do other things okay task switching stop doing this start doing that start doing that stop doing this and sometimes to varying extents right I mean we could take any real world scenario of tying one shoes while talking on the phone and we could micro analyze it in the context of this but I think uh if you think about it just a little bit you understand that in order to perform daily task we need to be able to task switch and that's not always a start one task end start a new task end often times we're interleaving different tasks to varying degrees now the other aspect of working memory and attention is to eliminate distractions to not pay attention to the irrelevant stuff in one's environment or even the irrelevant stuff on your own body like you can't get distracted by you know a button that you know might be only partially buttoned or maybe some little something on your sleeve if you're trying to do something else at that moment okay and people with ADHD and people who have subclin clinical challenges and focus really have a hard time with this right you know the the sort of stereotype is you know the oh look a squirrel that whole thing but really this typically exists as a more subtle and challenging phenomenon for people where they either can't remember what they were doing or they're simply drawn down different trajectories different thought trajectories or action trajectories and then they have a hard time making it back to the original thing that they were trying to focus on and we know based on these studies of dopamine and neuroimaging that eliminating distractors is largely the consequence of dopamine neurons projecting to the prefrontal cortex okay now why am I telling you all this neural circuitry stuff well yes there are a bunch of studies showing that if you selectively activate the neurons that send dopamine into the basil ganglia you improve Tas switching ability without an improved ability to rule out distractors or if you selectively increase the amount of dopamine from neurons projecting the prefrontal cortex that you're able to selectively improve the elimination of dist tractors without improving task switching ability for practical purposes in this discussion we want to pay careful attention to whether or not the data tell us that those particular protocols those particular approaches are globally increasing dopamine that is increasing the activity of dopamine neurons projecting to the basil ganglia and the prefrontal cortex or selectively to the basil ganglia or selectively to the prefrontal cortex and what I can tell you now is that fortunately there are several prot some of which are behavioral some of which involve specific over-the-counter supplements and some of which involve prescription pharmacology that can tap into each of these systems independently as well as globally increased dopamine to improve focus and working memory at large I'd like to take a quick break to acknowledge our sponsor element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means zero sugar and the appropriate ratios of the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium and that correct ratio of electrolytes is extremely important because every cell in your body but especially your nerve cells your neurons relies on electrolytes in order to function properly so when you're well hydrated and you have the appropriate amount of electrolytes in your system your mental functioning and your physical functioning is improved I drink one packet of element dissolved in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning as well as while I exercise and if I've sweat a lot during that exercise I often will drink a third element packet dissolved in about 32 ounces of water after I exercise element comes in a variety of different flavors all of which I find really tasty I like the Citrus I like the watermelon I like the raspberry frankly I can't pick just one it also comes in chocolate and chocolate mint which I find tastes best if they are put into water dissolved and then heated up I tend to do that in the winter months because of course you don't just need hydration on hot days and in the summer and spring months but also in the winter when the temperatures are cold and the environment tends to be dry if if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element spelled lm.com huberman to try a free sample pack again that's drink element.com huberman okay so let's talk about protocols to improve working memory specifically by way of changing levels of dopamine in the brain now I've discussed dopamine many times before in this podcast in fact we have entire episodes devoted to optimizing and regulating dopamine and of course dopamine comes up within the context of the ADHD episodes and episodes as well and again if you have specific questions about dopamine or any other topic for that matter if you go to huberman lab.com that website has been engineered so that you can put one word such as dopamine but also multiple keywords so perhaps dopamine exercise or dopamine cold plunge Etc into the search function and it will take you to the specific timestamps of multiple episodes where those topics were discussed as well as newsletters where some of that information has been condensed into short PDF form Etc so we certainly are going going to cover some material about improving dopamine for sake of improving working memory now but if you're generally interested in the science and pharmacology of dopamine and protocols to modulate dopamine levels all of that can be found at huberman lab.com okay so let's say you have a short working memory span or a moderate working memory span and you want to experiment with increasing levels of dopamine for sake of improving working memory now there are a lot of different ways that one could imagine doing that let's start with the behavioral tools known to increase dopamine stores that is shown in peer-reviewed studies to increase dopamine stores within certain circuits of the brain that are relevant for working memory performance and the protocol that immediately leaps to mind is the use of certain non-sleep deep rest protocols now non-sleep deep rest or nsdr is actually a term that I coined because there is a practice that's been established for many hundreds of years called Yoga Nidra which actually means yoga sleep whereby individuals potentially you if you decide to do them lie down listen to to a script that is listen to an audio script which generally instructs you to do long exhale breathing to deliberately relax your musculature of your face and of your body and Yoga Nidra typically also involves doing certain intentions and the instruction always given at the beginning of Yoga Nidra is that you should try to not fall asleep now some people sometimes fall asleep some people don't fall asleep but the idea and there are data to support that Yoga Nidra puts people into kind of a shallow pattern of sleep um certainly not deep sleep s and not rapid eye movement sleep but it's a very interesting and unusual brain state for which we're starting to understand more and actually I have some plans in the not too distant future to collaborate with Matthew Walker the author of the book why we sleep and some other colleagues to try and figure out what exact patterns of neural activity are taking place in the brain and rest of nervous system during Yoga Nidra and this similar protocol which I call nonsleep deep rest the difference between Yoga Nidra and non-sleep deep rest is that nonsleep deep rest doesn't include any of the intentions and removes a lot of the kind of opaque or sometimes called mystical language from the protocol now a great thing is that yoga needra scripts or protocols as well as nsdr scripts or Protocols are available totally zero cost you can find them certainly on apps like waking up but also on YouTube for instance if you put nsdr and my last name there's a 10-minute nsdr script there there are a lot of yoga NRA scripts if you prefer a female voice there are a lot of different excellent female voices out there one in particular particular that I like very much is Kelly boy first name Kelly last name b y s she has both yoga NRA and ndr scripts of various durations of anywhere from 8 minutes all the way out to I believe 45 minutes why am I telling you all this well there have been several studies but in particular one and I do realize we're talking about only one study but the results are really intriguing as it relates to what we're talking about today in this study they had individuals do effectively an nsdr protocol they call it yoganidra and the protocol they used was essentially a yoga Nedra script they had people lie down and listen to a yoga Nedra script and to perform yoga Nedra and they evaluated the amount of dopamine available within the brain both prior to and after performing this yoga NRA script and what they discovered was that after performing a Yoga Nidra protocol the Baseline levels of dopamine that is the amount of dopamine available in the basil ganglia and a few other structures of the human brain of course these are humans was increased by as much as 60% as compared to individuals that did a different protocol not yoganidra not nsdr now did that study evaluate lots of different durations of yoga Nedra AKA nstr no they looked at fairly long hour plus Yoga Nidra sessions however there's some other data that have explored Yoga Nidra AKA nstr in the context of cognitive performance and a few other circumstances all of which point to the fact that cognitive performance and in particular cognitive performance tasks that have a working memory element to them so they weren't the exact working memory task that you did earlier but they have a working memory element to them that is subjects had to keep certain small batches of information in mind and then discard that information in order to be able to perform the task well all of those show significant improvements in task performance so while something like nsdr or Yoga Nidra might sound kind of mystical or kind of you know wishy-washy or I guess as the kids say weak sauce uh to some of you it is anything but weak sauce it is really powerful stuff and it's powerful stuff as it relates to the very neurochemicals and neuros circuits that are involved in working memory so if I were to take a step back and just say okay what are some zeroc cost very low if any risk protocols that one could perform in order to improve dopamine levels without having to ingest anything take anything and really do much of anything at all except lie there do this progressive muscle relaxation there are a few other things involved in nsdr as well which you'll learn if you decide to try them and improve or increase the levels of dopamine availability in the brain significantly well then nsdr and Yoga Nidra really are the first line tools if one wants to do that I think it's reasonable to say that and as I mentioned before there's no reason to think that there's any risk of doing nstr yoga NRA you know provide that you're lying down in a safe place as opposed to like in the middle of the road or something but assuming you do it in a safe location I would encourage you to try it for really for 20 to 30 minutes when you first explore it perhaps you do longer although I personally have a hard time doing long yoga needer scripts regularly a full hour is a big commitment I don't generally have that much time I often will do a 10-minute nsdr have there been brain Imaging experiments done for each and all of these yoga needra scripts to determine the amount or if there's any dopamine increase within the brain no but I think that we can safely extrapolate from that wonderful study out of Scandinavia that showed that when human subjects do this yoga NRA protocol that there's a significant increase in Baseline dopamine levels within key neural structures that relate to working memory now many of you have perhaps heard that getting in a cold plunge or taking a cold shower or provided you can do it safely getting into a cold ocean or a cold lake can significantly maybe even double or even triple your circulating dopamine levels and indeed that is true it has been shown that when people get into cold water typically up to their neck and that cold water by the way can range in temperature anywhere from low 40s to low 60s depending on how long you stay in that there is a significant increase in the so-called circulating catac colomines what are the catac colomines the catamin are dopamine norepinephrine and epinephrine now the evidence for the catac colomine increase in response to cold water mainly stems from two studies and in particular one and in that particular study they had people get into I wouldn't say super cold water it was in the low 60° and by the way I'm speaking in Fahrenheit here and they had those human subjects submerged in water up to their neck I think they actually had them sitting in lawn chairs on the bottom of a pool uh but again their heads were above water so they could breathe and they stayed in for quite a long while you know 45 minutes or longer and it was observed that there was a big big statistically significant increase in epinephrine norepinephrine in dopamine that lasted several hours or more this is one of the reasons why if you've ever done deliberate cold exposure as it's called it often is uncomfortable when you get in but then when you get out you feel different you feel really good in most cases provided if you're me you take a warm shower afterwards yes I like to do that I realize if you want to increase your metabolism perhaps it's better to not warm up afterwards I like a nice warm shower or to get in the sauna afterwards that's just me but nonetheless deliberate cold exposure clearly induces a state shift of mind and body that most people provided they do it correctly and they don't go into water that's far too cold for them for too long they report as pleasant and I think it's reasonable to assume that some of that is the consequence of these increases in catac colomines which is why many people opt for a cold shower which if you're me cold shower followed by a warmer or hot shower or a cold Plunge in the morning or maybe even just once or twice a week many people like them typically people like getting out of them and the feeling that they have after they do them although some of you sickos really like the feeling of getting in and being it but not me the point here is that if we were to take a look at the landscape of zeroc cost behavioral Tools in fact behavioral tools that could potentially save you money meaning reduce your heating bill that are known to increase the very neurochemicals AKA dopamine that are involved and improving working memory I think it's reasonable to assume that a cold shower about 30 to 60 minutes prior to doing any kind of working memory task or any kind of activity that would require increased Focus could be okay we don't know this specific Studies have not been done but could be in theory it makes sense mechanistically it's logically sound could be done after deliberate cold exposure and indeed many people report not just feeling a bit of you know mild Euphoria or feeling good after deliberate cold exposure but also an increased capacity to focus in fact so much so that a lot of people who do deliberate cold exposure say that they don't require as much caffeine in order to maintain their alertness and energy which shouldn't be surprising to us at all right I mean it's increasing cacola means we know this so that's another protocol that you could explore as well is there an important difference or not between deliberate cold exposure done by cold shower or deliberate cold exposure in a cold plunge or the ocean frankly there haven't been a lot of studies comparing those but I think it stands to reason that if you have access to a cold plunge or a cold body of water that you can safely get into up to your neck for 30 seconds to a minute if it's 50° or less right if you get in colder water we know for instance if you get into say 45 Dee water and you only get in for 30 seconds you're going to get a big increase in the catacol amines perhaps as big as the catacol amine increase that you would get from being in 60° water for 45 minutes most people don't have 45 minutes to sit around in water up to their neck so most people opt for 30 seconds to as much as 3 minutes deliberate cold exposure in a shower or cold plunge or other body of water again only do this if you can do it safely never ever please for the love of God please never ever do any kind of hyperventilation breathing or breath holding while doing deliberate cold exposure because you can pass out you can die don't combine breath work and deliberate cold exposure just don't separate those two things completely okay but deliberate coal exposure we know is a very reliable way to increase the catacol amines which includes dopamine so if you want to explore deliberate cold exposure protocols get into the Nuance of temperature and duration Etc you can find that completely zero cost go to hubman lab.com go to the menu tab scroll down to newsletter and go to the cold exposure news letter where it details all of that in short PDF form now some of you are probably asking hey what if I was in the high or long working memory span group I ought to have high Baseline levels of dopamine should I not do Yoga Nidra or nsdr should I not do deliberate cold exposure well there you're just going to have to experiment again there's essentially zero risk to doing yoganidra nsdr as I mentioned before deliberate cold exposure there's always some risk getting into water cold water people always want to know how cold well the newsletter gets to this but I'll just tell you right now as well the ideal temperature is the temperature that you can safely get into and stay in for a duration of 30 seconds to 3 minutes before getting out some people op to go longer but I think 30 seconds to 3 minutes is a good duration to work with for most people especially if you're going to do it frequently so the temperature should be safe for you to stay in for that duration but uncomfortable enough that there's some impulse to want to get out that you have to of work to stay in there that you have to kind of overcome that adrenaline release and the impulse to get out okay so for some people that's going to be 45° for some people be 40° depends on how cold adapted you are depends on how rested you are there is no specific temperature you have to really gauge for yourself and so airor on the side of caution and you can experiment provided you experiment within the margins of safety so if you found during the working memory task that you took today that you have a very good working memory I don't think there's any reason to avoid yoganidra nsdr and deliberate cold exposure in fact there may be reasons to increase your dopamine and other catacol amines by way of nsdr Yoga Nidra deliberate cold exposure perhaps for working memory performance maybe it could increase further perhaps it would decrease performance in which case there you got your answer you don't have to do those protocols again and you certainly wouldn't want to do them before anything that involves a lot of working memory and attention but of course those protocols have other benefits as well so there's no reason to avoid them entirely just perhaps avoid them within the context of trying to improve working memory however if you're somebody that has challenges with working memory challenges with attention challenges with Focus well then I think that the protocols I've been talking about up until now would be an excellent first foray into the sorts of things that you could do to increase dopamine and of course those other catacol amines as a way to see whether or not it augments your focus and attention and working memory capacity now some of you are probably shouting shouting shouting what about exercise does an exercise increase dopamine it does yes there are other things that increase dopamine it's not just exercise there are activities that increase dopamine some people are saying wait doesn't playing video games increase dopamine sex increases dopamine chocolate increases dopamine yes yes indeed those things can increase dopamine what's interesting and important about the protocols I've been talking about however nsdr yoga Nedra deliberate cold exposure is not just that they increase dopamine but the duration over which they increase dopamine okay this is very important if you want to understand more about the relationship between dopamine spikes as they're called and dopamine Baseline and why I'm emphasizing these tools that cause large longlasting increases in Baseline dopamine check out the episodes I did on optimizing dopamine we've got a link to them in the show note captions now before I talk about other ways to increase dopamine for sake of improving working memory things like over-the-counter supplements like El tyrosine makuna pururin things like that I do briefly want to mention and I promise briefly I know sometimes I say briefly and then I spend 20 minutes telling you about something but very briefly I just want to spend two minutes telling you about protocols that we do not yet know whether or not they increase dopamine levels but we do know that they improve working memory because after all this episode is about working memory not just about dopamine in working memory it has been shown that the use of binaural beats okay binaural beats being the presentation or the listening to sounds of different frequencies in the two ears typically by headphones I think that's been shown to work best and there's a subtraction between the two frequencies such that the brain tends to entrain or start to follow a particular frequency within not the entire brain but certain neural circuits so if you've heard of say 15 Hertz binaural beats or 40 Herz binural beats that doesn't mean that you listen to a 15 Hertz sound or a 40 HZ sound you listen to two different frequencies of sound right Hertz is just a measurement of sound frequency in each of the two ears and then the difference between them is 40 Herz or 15 Hertz and there are several studies that show not enormous okay I want to be clear small to moderate improvements in working memory performance but in some cases significant Improvement and I'll provide a link to these two papers in the show note captions but I'll just briefly describe them by way of their title and their major conclusions the first is a study entitled the effects of binaural and monoral beat stimulation on cognitive functioning in subjects with different levels of emotionality a really interesting study published in 2019 it was a relatively small number of subjects only 24 participants 16 males eight males between 19 and 31 years old listen to these 40 Herz binaural beats and by the way it's very easy easy to find apps and other sources of 40 HZ binaural beats at zero cost or nominal cost out there um you would simply look for 40 HZ binormal beats and looked at performance on working memory tasks as well as some other cognitive tasks and found in some cases a small to moderate but significant Improvement in cognitive performance on working memory tasks the aspect of the study looking at emotionality did not find a significant effect so it doesn't seem that emotionality uh impacts things there but nonetheless that study plus the other one entitled the effect of binaural beats on visual spatial working memory and cortical connectivity this was a study published in 2016 found generally something similar in this case they were using 15 Herz binaural beats and here I'm I'm paraphrasing produced network activity characteristic of high information transfer with consistent connection strengths what they're really talking about is changes in neural activity patterns within the brain that led to or at least were correlated with with improvements on visual spatial working memory visual spatial working memory tasks are different than the working memory tasks that you performed earlier visual spatial working memory tasks involve the cognitive generation that is within your head of the so-called Visos spatial sketch pad so it's this idea that you see something and then you got of sketch it out in your mind you have to know the relationships between things in space pay attention to what they are keep those in mind again because it's working memory just as long as it's necessary to perform a task that's what viso spatial working memory is as you can imagine it translates to an enormous number of everyday activities required for focus and attention and learning and performance and indeed 15 Herz binaural beats was able to produce a small but significant Improvement in that sort of working memory task so I want to emphasize again we don't know the relationship between binaural beats and dopamine at least not from these studies but I felt I'd be remiss if I didn't mention these two studies that show that 40 Herz binaural beats 15 Herz binaural beats can indeed improve working memory performance and in these sorts of scenarios individuals are listening to the binaural beats while they are doing the working memory task and in some cases before they are doing the working memory task either seems to work it depends on the study there a bunch of other studies but I thought I'd mention binaural beats because I know a number of people are interested in them again non-pharmacologic zero cost because you can find tools for bormal Beat Generation zero cost out there approaches to improving working memory okay what about over-the-counter compounds that are known to increase circulating dopamine that can potentially improve working memory and that indeed have been shown in peer-reviewed studies to improve working memory by way of increasing circulating presumably brain levels of dopamine well I can think of two specific categories of supplements that is over-the-counter compounds that at least at this point in time are legal in the United States that can increase dopamine levels those two are El tyrosine which is an amino acid precursor to dopamine and Muna purines which is a believe it or not it's the uh a velvety Bean or the outer component of this velvety Bean that contains or is equivalent to 99% lopa L Doopa is a key component in the biochemical Cascade leading to the production of dopamine in fact lopa is often prescribed for Parkinson patients as a means to increase their dopamine levels there are at least three studies that I am aware of of the use of Muna purines to increase dopamine for the treatment of Parkinson's in other words Muna purines increases dopamine levels and yes it has been shown to improve some of those symptoms of Parkinson's patients we're not talking about treatment of Parkinson's today I want to caution people against any sort of use of supplements to treat Parkinson's or other conditions without consulting your doctor all right that's very very critical to point out if we're talking about ways to increase dopamine for sake of improving working memory by way of supplementation I think we should start with El tyos because El tyrosine unlike Muna Pines is a bit further up actually it's way further up the biochemical Cascade leading to dopamine production however it has been shown in several studies that El tyrosine supplementation can indeed increase dopamine and moreover and here I'm quoting the title of a study published in 1999 which I realized is a few years back but of course there's some excellent studies from a few years back or more tyrosine improves working memory in a multitasking environment now this particular study from Thomas at all has some interesting aspects and some aspects that made me go a little bit wide-eyed but not necessarily wide-eyed because the results are so dramatic in fact when one looks at all of the data in this paper what you find is that supplementing with El tyrosine as they did in this study did indeed lead to improvements in working memory under multitask conditions as the title suggests those improvements were significant but they weren't enormous okay they were statistically significant but they were not enormous increases now what was enormous and the reason I got wide-eyed and still get wide-eyed is that the dosages of of tyrosine used in the study are really big they had subjects take 150 milligrams per kilogram of el crystalline tyrosine I had them take it in applesauce for whatever reason or Placebo and they did a number of different control conditions to make sure that whatever effects of el tyrosine they observed were in fact due to El tyrosine supplementation why am I going wide-eyed When I See This 150 milligrams per Kil of tyrosine well I weigh 220 lb that's about 100 kg so if I weigh 100 kilg and it's 150 milligram for every kilogram that means that if I were a subject in the study that they would give me 15,000 milligram that is 15 gram of el tyrosine prior to doing these cognitive tasks now 15 grams of tyrosine to me seems like a very very high dose and I frankly can't in good conscience recommend that why well maybe I'm just hypers sensitive to El tyroine but I've taken 1,000 or500 milligrams of el tyrosine and I've definitely experienced an increase in alertness from taking 1.5 gram not 15 1.5 grams of el tyrosine and in fact at a subjective level I can feel a meaningful increase in alertness and focus from 500 milligrams of el tyrosine so I can't in good conscience suest that people replicate the exact do protocols within the study nonetheless the study as the title suggests shows that supplementing with El tyrosine can indeed increase working memory capacity especially in a multitasking environment which in many ways carries over to the sorts of requirements for working memory and attention capacity to get through life in a very focused for lack of a better word way in a very regimented do this do that task switch multiple things inter Lea that's what moving through one's day or at least work day or anything that requires cognition and focus entails so first of all I'll just say what I always say when discussing any kind of compound or prescription drug never add or remove any supplement from your supplement regimen if you have one without consulting with your health provider first to make sure that you are safe to take that particular supplement now many Physicians MDS are not familiar with most supplements so you'll probably need to bring some literature um to the phone call or to the visit but of course there are many Healthcare Providers including some MDS that are open to supplementation especially these days um as supplements have become uh I would say generally more accepted I mean there are certain ones like vitamin D3 that and fish oils and things like that that are more common than El tyrosine but there are many Physicians who are open to discussions about supplements such as El tyrosine if you know that you can supplement with El tyrosine safely and you opt to do so what dosages would you potentially take well here we have to look at the dosages used in these studies I think it's only fair it's only safe that we acknowledge that these dose just are really really high and I think the logical the safe thing to do would be to start with the minimal effective dose so if you weigh 50 kilograms rather than start right off with you know the equivalent dosage to this study maybe you start with 250 milligrams of el tyrosine if you weigh a bit more like me or 100 kgrs or 75 kilg maybe you take 500 milligrams of el tyrosine and see whether or not you experience a significant effect on working memory attention and performance so the idea here is to establish the minimal effective dose I should also point out that some people not all but some people experience a bit of a crash after El tyrosine supplementation such that they feel more alert more focused better ability to perform working memory tasks move about their day but then three or four hours later experience kind of a drop so you need to be mindful of that in fact you need to be mindful of any kind of pharmacology where you're increasing dopamine this is one of the reasons why I like the behavioral protocols that we talked about earlier because they're known to create big but long lasting and slowly tapering off increases in dopamine and other catacol amines now for those who are curious about and perhaps even want to try Muna purines please absolutely talk to your doctor first Muna perin is essentially the equivalent of lopa lopa is a prescription drug as I mentioned before and Muna perin potently increases dopamine what dosages of Muna Pines can increase dopamine well typically in studies of Parkinson's patients but also studies exploring typical people who don't have Parkinson's in tasks or in sports performance have explored anywhere from 1 to 5 gr of Muna purins Muna purin again is a very potent way to increase dopamine and here if your healthc care provider approves it and you decide to try it I would suggest starting with a very very low dose again to to find the minimal effective dose so maybe even just 500 milligrams not even going to the one gram dose maybe even 250 milligrams and really evaluating how much Muna pance can produce a meaningful impact on working memory and attention for you so Muna pan is kind of a bridge between over-the-counter supplements and prescription drugs I say it's a bridge because it is Oho similar to that prescription drug L Doopa and of course there is a long list of prescription drugs that are known to be dopamine Agonist several of which many of which in fact have been shown to improve working memory you already learned about one of those before which is bromocryptine now you need a prescription from a physician to get bromocryptine but bromocryptine we know based on that work from desposito colleagues that I talked about earlier increases dopamine it does so in about 90 minutes it achieves Peak levels of dopamine about 90 minutes and improves working memory in individuals that start off with a low working memory span and we know from neuroimaging those are the individuals with lower Baseline levels of dopamine so should you run out and ask your doctor for bromocryptine maybe most doctors won't prescribe bromocryptine for that reason I should mention that work from desposito lab and other Laboratories has shown that one of the Hallmark features of traumatic brain injury especially frontal lobe injury as well as certain neurod degenerative conditions like Parkinson's but other forms of dementia as well as ADHD involve deficits in working memory and attention which makes sense given what we know about the symptoms of those conditions and that bromocryptine has been prescribed off Lael for the treatment of those conditions to some degree of success however those are off Lael circumstances right now as far as I know bromocryptine is not prescribed specifically for those conditions at a kind of whole population level it's not one of the drugs on the lookup table for ADHD or TBI but certain well-informed neurologists and Physicians do prescribe it for that reason there are other dopamine agonists that are relevant in this context the ones that I think most of you will be familiar with are the drugs that increase dopamine and norepinephrine for the treatment of ADHD and I did an entire episode of The hubman Lab podcast about those compounds things like adderal things like rellin which by by the way is quite different than Aderall in terms of how much dopamine relative to norepinephrine it causes the increase of I cover all that in those episodes again you can simply go to hubman lab.com put ADHD Aderall or ADHD riddlin and I talk about other things as well I also took a little bit about modafanil which is a entirely different category of drug known to improve cognitive performance in some cases in ADHD but in everybody so there are a lot of different drugs that can improve working memory most of those do so by increasing transmission of dopamine or availability of dopamine somehow changing dopamine levels in the brain by increasing them so if you're somebody that has challenges with working memory focus and attention please see those episodes and please talk to your doctor about potentially using pharmacology to increase dopamine however and this is very important many people who have challenges with Focus attention and working memory and fall under the category of subclinical levels of ADHD and even some individuals with 88 she young and old manage their symptoms and in some cases improve their focus through the use of Behavioral tools nutritional tools supplement based Tools in ways that either allow them to reduce their total prescription drug dosages and in some cases come off them entirely now I am definitely not saying that people should come off those drugs entirely and in fact I want to take a really firm stand here because I know this is a bit controversial but I'm just going to tell you having evaluated the whole literature several times over now I do think I personally believe that there is a strong case for certain children and adults to take these compounds that increase dopamine and epinephrine yes those compounds are different forms of amphetamine but those compounds we know can increase neuroplasticity the rewiring ltp LTD Etc within the neural circuits that control Focus attention and working memory and so they do have their place for certain individuals we don't want to rule those out are they over prescribed my feeling is that yes they are probably overprescribed however there are a number of individuals that strongly benefit from them as well so if you are going to explore the use of those compounds for sake of improving working memory certainly if you're going to explore them for sake of improving working memory and focus in young kids please please please talk to your physician because they're prescription drugs you would need to talk to a physician anyway but regardless of whether or not you're trying to improve focus and working memory in a child in an adult someone with TBI someone with Parkinson's I think it stands to reason that you would arrive to that conversation with some knowledge of not just the prescription drugs that are potentially available but also some of the supplement based tools some of the behavioral tools because as we know and as a good friend of mine who's an excellent physician says Better Living Through Chemistry still requires Better Living meaning yes prescription drugs can have a positive impact on these aspects of brain function in a way that can really improve lives but that behavioral tools also work in fact they can collaborate in a very synergistic way to increase the amount of neuroplasticity in the relevant circuits so I'm of the mind and I think more and more people out there I like to think are of the mind that behaviors nutrition supplement based tools and prescription drugs all can have their place to varying degrees depending on the circumstances and the individual okay so today we talked about working memory this incredible capacity of our brain in fact a specific set of brain circuits designed for us to absorb absorb information that is perceived in our environment use the relevant parts and then Chuck it just get rid of it forget it so very different than short and long-term memory which we also discussed and we talked about a few of the mechanisms as well I think you'll agree that working memory is one of the more incredible aspects to brain function I mean if you think about this is a set of neural circuits that engage the same algorithm over and over in different context in order for us to be able to navigate new environments familiar environments to interleave different activities these different strategies to task switch to rule out distractors it's oh so critical to every aspect of our Waking Life and fortunately there are also zeroc cost and lowcost behavioral supplement based and prescription drug approaches to improving this incredible thing we call working memory so it was a pleasure to share some of those with you today as well if you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast please subscribe to our

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today marks the second episode in our Journal Club series with myself and Dr Peter AA Dr Peter AA as many of you know is a medical doctor who is a world expert in all things Health span and lifespan he is the author of the bestselling book outlive as well as the host of his own terrific podcast the drive for today's episode Peter and I each select a different paper to share with you we selected these papers because we feel they are both extremely interesting and extremely actionable first I present a paper that is about how light exposure during the morning and daytime as well as dark exposure at night each have independent and positive effects on Mental Health as well as the ability to reduce the symptoms of many different mental health disorders now I've talked before on this podcast and elsewhere about the key importance of seeing morning sunlight as well as trying to be in dim light at night however the data presented in the paper today really expands on that by identifying the key importance of not just morning sunlight but getting bright light in one's eyes as much as is safely possible throughout the entire day and a separate additive effect of being in as much Darkness at night as POS possible I describe the data in a lot of detail although you do not need a background in biology in order to understand that discussion and there's a key takeaway which is that if you can't get enough light in your eyes during the daytime you would be well advised to get as much Darkness exposure at night in other words light and dark have independent and additive effects on mental health and during today's discussion you'll learn exactly how to apply light exposure and dark exposure in order to get those benefits then then Peter presents a paper about novel treatments for cancer I must say it's an extremely important conversation that everybody regardless of whether or not you may have had cancer or know somebody who's had cancer ought to listen to he highlights the current technology of cancer treatments as well as the future technology of cancer treatments and the key role that the immune system and the autoimmune system play in treatments for cancer I assure you that by the end of today's Journal Club episode you will have learned a ton of new information about light and dark and mental health as well as cancer and the immune system and treatments for curing cancer before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity I've spoken many times before in this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance now a key component of getting a great night's sleep is that in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3° one of the best ways to make sure that those temperature changes occur at the appropriate times at the beginning and throughout and at the end of your night when you wake up is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's what eight sleep allows you to do it allows you to program the temperature of your mattress and sleeping environment such that you fall and stay deeply asleep easily and wake up each morning feeling incredibly refreshed and energized I've been sleeping on an eights Sleep mattress cover for almost 3 years now and it has dramatically improved the quality of my sleep so much so that when I travel and I'm at a hotel or an Airbnb and I don't have access to my eight sleep I very much look forward to getting home because my sleep is always better when I sleep on my eight Sleep mattress cover if you'd like to try eightsleep you can go to 8sleep.com huberman to get $150 off their pod three mattress cover eight sleep currently ships in the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by better help better help offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out online now I've been going to therapy for well over 30 years initially I didn't have a choice it was a condition of being allowed to stay in school but pretty soon I realized that therapy is extremely valuable in fact I consider doing regular therapy just as important as getting regular exercise including cardiovascular exercise and resistance training which of course I also do every week the reason I know therapy is so valuable is that if you can find a therapist with whom you can develop a really good report you not only get terrific support for some of the challenges in your life but you also can drive tremendous insights from that therapy insights that can allow you to better not just your emotional life and your relationship life but of course also the relationship to yourself and to your professional life to all sorts of career goals in fact IC therapy is one of the key components for meshing together all aspects of one's life and being able to really direct one's focus and attention toward what really matters if you'd like to try better help go to betterhelp.com huberman to get 10% off your first month again that's betterhelp.com uberman today's episode is also brought To Us by ju ju makes medical grade red light therapy devices now if there's one thing I've consistantly emphasized on this podcast is the incredible role that light can have on our biology and of course I'm always telling people that they should get sunlight in their eyes as soon as possible after waking on as many days of their life as possible for sake of setting circadian rhythm daytime mood focus and alertness and improve sleep now in addition to sunlight red light and near infrared light has been shown to have positive effect effects on improving numerous aspects of Cellar and organ Health including faster Muscle Recovery improved skin health and wound healing even improvements in acne or that is removal of acne reducing pain and inflammation improving mitochondrial function and even improving Vision itself what sets juv apart and why it's my preferred red light therapy device is that it has clinically proven wavelengths meaning it uses specific wavelengths of red light and near infrared light in combination that trigger the optimal seller adaptations personally I use the handheld ju every day the handheld ju is about the size of a thick piece of toast and I also own a ju panel that allows for full body exposure and I use that one approximately five times per week for about 10 to 15 minutes per session if you'd like to try ju you can go to juv spelled jv.com huberman again that's jv.com huberman for this month only January 2024 juv is offering exclusive discounts to Huber lab listeners with up to $500 off select ju products again that's ju spelled jv.com huberman to get up to $500 off select ju products and now for my discussion with Dr Peter Atia Andrew great to have you here for Journal Club number two I'm already confident this is going to become a regular for us I'm excited I really enjoy this because I get to pick papers I'm really excited about I get to hear papers that you're excited about and we get to um sharpen our skills at reading and sharing data and people listening can do that as well so last time I went first so uh I think I'm going to put you on the hot seat first and have uh have you go first and I'll follow you okay well I'm really excited about this paper um for a number of reasons first of all it at least by my read is a very powerful paper in the sense that it examined light exposure Behavior as well as dark exposure behavior and that's going to be an important point in more than 85,000 people as part of this um cohort in the UK um I'll just mention a couple of things to give people background and I'll keep this relatively brief first of all there's a longstanding interest in the relationship between light and mental health and physical health and we can throw up some very well agreed upon bullet points first of all there is such a thing as seasonal effect itive disorder it doesn't just impact people living at really Northern locations but basically there's a correlation between day length and mood and mental health such that for many people not all but for many people when days are longer in the spring and summer they feel better they report fewer depressive symptoms and conversely when days are shorter significantly more people report feeling lower mood and affect Okay so there's a long-standing treatment for Seasonal effective disorder which is to give people exposure to very bright light especially in the morning the way that that's normally accomplished is with these sad lamps Seasonal effective disorder lamps and those lamps are basically bright meaning more than 10,000 Lux lights that they place on their kitchen counter or at their table in the morning or in their office so they're getting a lot of bright light that is proven to be fairly effective for the treatment of Seasonal effective disorder what's less understood is how light exposure in the middle of the night can negatively impact mood and health and so where we are headed with this is that there seems to be based on the conclusions of this new study a powerful and independent role of both daytime light exposure and nighttime dark exposure for mental health now a couple of other key points the biological mechanisms for all this are really well established there's a set of cells in the neural retina which aligns the back of your eye they're sometimes called intrinsically photosensitive retinal gangan cells they're sometimes called melanopsin retinal gangion cells we'll talk about those in a bit of detail in a moment it's well known that those cells are the ones that respond to two different types of light input not one but two different types of light input and send information to the hypothalamus where your master circadian clock resides and then your master circadian clock sends out secretory signals so peptides hormones but also neural signals to the brain and body and say hey now it's daytime now it's nighttime be awake be asleep but it goes way beyond that these melanops and intrinsically photosensitive retinal gangling cells we know also project areas of the brain like the habenula which can trigger negative affect negative mood they can trigger the release of dopamine or the suppression of dopamine the release of serot in the suppression of do of Serotonin and so they're not just cells for setting your circadian clock they also have a direct line literally one synapse away into the structures of the brain that we know powerfully control mood so so the mechanistic basis for all this is there so there's just a couple of other key points to understand for people to really be able to digest the data in this paper fully there are basically two types of stimula that these cells respond to one is very bright light as we just talked about that's why getting a lot of daytime sunlight is correlated with elevated mood that's why looking at a 10,000 Lux artificial lamp can offset Seasonal effective disorder by the way just a couple questions on that um how many Lux does the sun provide on a sunny day at noon okay great question so if you're out in the sun with no cloud cover or minimal cloud cover in the middle of the day at noon chances are it's over 100,000 luck on a really bright day could be 300,000 Lux okay most indoor environments even though they might seem very bright I like to think of your you're kind of like uh department store with the bright lights believe it or not that's probably only closer to 6,000 Lux maximum and probably more like 4,000 Lux most brightly lit indoor environments are not that bright when it comes down to Total Photon energy now here's the interesting thing on a cloudy day when you're outside it can be as bright as or an average of a 100,000 Lux but it won't seem that bright because you don't quote unquote see the Sun but it's also because when there's cloud cover a lot of those long wavelength of light such as orange and red light aren't coming through however and this is so important the circadian clock the supermatic nucleus it sums photons it's a photon summing system so basically if you're outside in 8,000 Lux very overcast UK winter day and you're walking around hopefully without sunglasses because sunglasses are going to filter a lot of those photons out your circadian clock is summing the photons so it's an integration mechanism it's not triggered in a moment and actually the the experiments of recording from these cells first done by David buron at Brown were you know historic in the field of visual Neuroscience when shown bro bright light on these intrinsically photosensitive cells you could crank up the intensity of the light and the neurons would ramp up their membrane potential and then start spiking firing action potential long trains of action potentials that have been shown to go on for hours and so that's this signal that's propagating into the whole brain and body okay so the the important thing to understand is this is not a quick switch that's why I suggest on non cloudy days we'll call them that people get 10 minutes or so of sunlight in their eyes in the early part of the day another 10 minimum in the later part of the day as much sunlight in their eyes as they safely can throughout the day but since you're a physician I should just um and you had a guest on talking about this recently when the sun is low in the Sky low solar angle sunlight that's really the key time for we'll talk about in a moment and when the sun is low in the sky you run very very little risk of inducing cataract by looking in the general direction of the sun you should still blink as needed to protect the eyes it's when the sun is overhead and there's all those photons coming in quickly in one in a short period of time that you do have to be concerned about cataract and um macular degeneration if you're getting too much daytime sunlight so the idea is sunglasses in the middle of the day are fine but you really should avoid using them in the early and later part of the day unless you're driving into the Sun and you need you know for safety reasons another question Andrew if if a person is indoors but they have large windows so they're they're getting tons of sunlight into their space they don't even need ambient indoor light how much of the photons are making it through the glass and how does that compare to this effect yeah in general unless the light is coming directly through the window most of the relevant wavelengths are filtered out in other words if you can't see the sun through the window even if sufficient light is being provided that's insufficient to trigger this phenomenon that's right however if you have um you know windows on your roof which some people do skylights that makes the situation much much better in fact the neurons that in the eye that signal to the circadian clock and these mood centers in the brain reside mainly in the bottom twoth thirs of the neural retina and are responsible for looking up basically they're Gathering light from above these cells are also very low resolution so think of them as big pixels uh they're not interested in patterns and edges and movement they're interested in how much ambient light there happens to be now keep in mind that this mechanism is perhaps the most well-conserved mechanism in cellular organisms so there and I'll use that as a way to frame up the four types of light that one needs to see every 24 hours for Optimal Health and and when I say Optimal Health I really mean mental health and physical health but we're going to talk about mental health mainly today in this paper there's an absolutely beautiful evolutionary story whereby single cell organisms all the way to humans dogs rabbits and everything in between have at least two cone opson one that responds to short wavelength light AKA blue light and another one that responds to longer wavelength light orange and red so your dogs have this we have this and it's a comparison mechanism in these cells of the eye these neurons of the eye they compare contrast between blues and orange or sometimes blues and reds and pinks which are also all long wavelength light there are two times of day when the sky is enriched with Blues oranges pinks and reds and that's low solar angle sunlight at Sunrise and in the evening these cells are uniquely available to trigger the ex existence of those wavelengths of light early in the day and in the evening not in the middle of the day so these cells have these two cone photo pigments and they say how much blue light is there how much red light is there or orange light and the subtraction between those two triggers the signal for them to fire the signal off to the circadian clock of the brain and that's why I say look at low solar angle sunlight early in the day what that does is it what call it as phase advances the clock this can get a little Technical and we don't want to get too technical here but think about pushing your kid on a swing the period of That Swing the duration of That Swing is a little bit longer than 12 hours okay so when you stand closer to the kid so your kid swings back and you give it a push you're shortening the period right you're not allowing the swing to come all the way up that's what happens when you look at morning sunlight you're advancing your circadian clock translate to English or non- nerd speake you're making it such that you will want to go to bed a little bit earlier and wake up a little bit earlier the next day in the evening when you view low solar angle sunlight so in the a the afternoon Setting Sun or evening Setting Sun you do the exact opposite you're phase delaying in the clock it's the equivalent of your kid being at the very top of the of the Ark and so it's gone you know maybe 12 and a half hour uh 12 let's say 12 and a half hours is the duration of that swing and you run up and you push them from behind and give them a little more push that's the equivalent of making yourself stay up a little later and wake up a little later these two signals average so that your clock stays stable You Don't Drift meaning you're not waking up earlier every single day or going to sleep later every single day this is why it's important to view low solar angle sunlight in the morning and again in the evening as often as possible and it's done by that readout of those two photo pigments now midday sun which contains its bright light but you see it as white light contains all of those wavelengths at equal intensity so the middle of the day is the so-called circadian Dead Zone in the middle of the day bright light triggers the activation of the of the other opson the melanopsin which increases mood increases feelings of well-being has some other consequences but you can't shift your circadian clock by viewing the sun in the middle of the day because it's in the Circadian Dead Zone it's the equivalent of pushing your kid on the swing when they're at the bottom of the Arc you can get a little bit more but not much and in biological terms you get nothing so this is why looking at sunlight in the middle of the day is great but it's not going to help anchor your sleep wake cycle and if you think about this is incredible right every organism from single cells to us has this mechanism to know when the sun is rising and when the Sun is setting and it's a color comparison mechanism which tells us that actually color vision Evolved first not for pattern Vision not for seeing beautiful sunsets and recognizing that's beautiful or paintings or things of that sort but rather for setting the circadian clock now what if you only do one of these Enders so what if you've got constant exposure to low Morning Light but your job prevents you from doing the same in the evening or vice versa yeah a great question better to get the Morning Light because if if you have to pick between low solar angle light earlier later in the day and keep in mind if you miss a day no big deal it's a slow integrative mechanism average ing across the previous two or 3 days but if you miss a day you'll want to get twice as much light in your eyes that next morning the reason it's better to do in the morning as opposed to the evening although both would be to do uh best would be to do both excuse me is that most people are getting some artificial light exposure in the evening anyway and here's the Diabolical thing your retina is very insensitive to light early in the day you need a lot of photons to trigger this mechanism early in the day as the day goes on retinal sensitivity increases and it takes very little light to shift your circadian clock late in the day keep in mind also that if you do see afternoon and evening sunlight there's a beautiful study published in science science reports yes science reports two years ago showing that that can partially offset the negative effects of artificial light exposure at night I think of this as your Netflix inoculation and the amount of melatonin suppression from Nighttime light exposure is haved by viewing even Setting Sun now keep in mind you don't need to see The Sun Cross The Horizon it can just be when it's low solar angle so you're looking for those yellow blue or blue pink blue red contrast and on cloudy days believe it or not they're still there just you don't perceive as much of it coming through so there really so that's three things that we should all strive to do view low solar angle sunlight early in the day view solar angle sunlight later in the day and get as much bright light in our eyes as we safely can ideally from sunlight throughout the day and if you can't do that get perhaps invest in one of these uh sad lights although they can be a bit expensive U there are a couple companies that are starting to design Sunrise simulators and evening simulators that are actually good that actually work um but right now my read is that aside from one company out there which by the way I have no relationship to it's called the 20 light tuo and that light bulb was developed by the biologist at the University of Washington who basically discover covered these color opponent mechanisms um those lights are not particularly expensive but they're um they do seem to work in fact they they're the study that is emerging again unpublished data seems to indicate that if you look at it for more than five or six minutes it can induce a mild Euphoria that's how powerful this contrast is and what they did there in that light I'll just tell you the mechanism is they figured out that when most people look at low solar angle sunlight in the morning they're getting 19 reversals of blue orange per second so when you look at this light it looks like a a barely flashing white light but it's reversals of orange and blue orange and um and you know red and blue and it's happening so what what does the person looking at it perceive um well I've used one of these um it just looks like a a flickering light and of course there's the always the potential of a placebo effect but well that's what I was going to say is there a way to control for that by having something that looks the same to the user but of course is not producing the same photo effect yeah well they've done that with the 10,000 Lux sad lamps and you and which most people use to try and IND do Sunrise simulation in their home but keep in in mind that Sunrise is gives you this comparison of short and long wavelength light just a bright 10,000 Lux light triggers one of the options that that but it won't set your circadian clock so most of the sad lamps that are out there are activating only one of the mechanisms in these cells that's relevant and not the one that's most relevant so I'm excited about what 20 is doing I think that um and again I have no relation to them except I know the biologists who did the work that that provide the mechanistic logic for the that engineering I still think um we're in the like the really like early days of this stuff what should be done is to have this stuff built into your laptop right it should be built into your phone and hopefully it will be now I mentioned this color contrast thing in sunrise and sunset I mentioned the bright light throughout the day but there's a fourth light stimulus that turns out to be really important and this will provide the segue into the paper turns out that dark exposure at night independent of light exposure during the day is important for mental health outcomes now most people think dark exposure how do I think about that well it is dark absence of light it's the absence of light but what this paper really drives home is that people who make it a point to get dark exposure at night aka the absence of light at night actually benefit even if they're not getting enough sunlight during the day and this is especially true for people with certain mental health issues so I don't think we can overstate the value of PR of accurately timed light exposure to the eyes in the context of mental health I think you know there's so much data by now I will say however that some people seem more resilient to these light effects than others meaning some people you know also don't suffer from jet lag too much some people can stay up late get a lot of bright light exposure in the middle of the night and during the day they got their sunglasses on all day and they're in a great mood all the time other people are more susceptible these sorts of things and we don't know whether or not gen polymorphisms underly that I personally am very sensitive to sunlight in the sense that if I don't get enough sunlight I don't feel well after a couple of days um but I'm less sensitive to light exposure at night for instance but I think it is perhaps this is a big statement but is perhaps the most fundamental environmental stimulus for levels of arousal and alertness which correlate with all sorts of you know neuromodulator and hormone outputs and um so none of this should come as any surprise I will mention one last thing there was a study published gosh over 10 years ago now from Chuck iser Lab at Harvard Medical School is a phenomenal lab exploring circadian human health behavior he's just considered a no pun a luminary in the field but there wasn't a study that was in error where they had published in Science magazine that light shown behind the knee could shift circadian rhythms and that paper was retracted um and a lot of people don't know that it was retracted light exposure to the eyes is what's relevant here and as far as we know the color of one's eyes like Darkness or lightness of one's eyes Bears no relevance on their sensitivity to these types of mechanisms and on and on so so one question one comment the question again is going back to the morning evening light and I spend a lot of time looking at those types of skies for example just because of the nature of my hobbies great right because I'm always doing archery in the morning and rucking in the afternoon so it's not uncommon that I'm seeing both of those how relevant is it that the Sun be above the Horizon so for example um it begins to get light about in 30 minutes before sunrise and then you know right at so if sunrises at 7:30 first light is is 7 and then you know sort of 7:15 to 7 uh 30 is actually quite bright I mean you can see anything and everything and the same as true at Sunset so does does that 30 minutes pre or when sun is Beneath The Horizon constitute part of that 10 minutes it does I mean in an ideal circumstance you'd get outside and see the sunrise every day and you'd see the sunset every day even on cloudy days some people like myself wake up before the sun comes up in which and I get this question all the time well in the absence of powers to make the sunrise faster which I'm not aware anyone has certainly not me I think the best thing to do is simply to turn on as many Bright Lights as you can indoors to trigger that melanopsin mechanism if you want to be awake if you want to stay asleep or sleepy then keep them dim and then get outside once the sun is starting to come out some people wake up after the sun has risen right in which case get what you can and some people wake up 10 a.m. or noon in which case you can still get the bright light exposure but but you won't shift your circadian clock now in the evening especially in the winter months it's important to look West and try and get some sunlight in your eyes in the evening if you've ever gone into the clinic for instance at 2 o'clock in the afternoon after lunch you know and then in the winter and then come out and it's dark when you're walk into your car it's a kind of eerie feeling that sort of eerie feeling May correlate with the fact that you missed a signal your your brain is trying to orient your brain and body in time and that's what all of this is right it's trying to orient in time and again some people are more susceptible to that than others some people might like that um feeling of oh I went in when it was bright and I come out when it's dark but the vast majority of people feel better when they're getting this morning and evening sunlight exposure and this is especially important in kids all right this is one of the things that you know this paper points out and their good data that people are spending approximately 90% of their time indoors nowadays daytime time time indoors and those indoor environments are simply not bright enough you think oh there's all these bright lights and some people are putting blue blockers on in the middle of the day which is the worst thing you could possibly do if you're going to wear blue blockers and I don't think they're necessary but if you're going to wear them you'd want to wear them at night and in the evening you don't need to wear blue blockers you just simply should dim the lights and ideally have lights that are set a little bit lower in your environment which the Scandinavians have been doing for a long time so you know kill the overhead lights and don't obsess about bright light exposure in the middle of the night in fact for a long time I and some other people were saying oh you know even just a brief flash of light in the middle of the night can you quash your melatonin that's true but the other time in which you're in the quote unquote circadian dead zone is in the middle of the night you can't shift your circadian clock in the middle of the night but you know all of this gets down to inter weaving rhythms of light sensitivity temperature hormone output cortisol it I mean there's a whole landscape of circadian biology this paper um which was published in a new Journal I'm really excited about called nature mental health this journal was just launched recently uh is entitled day and night light exposure are associated with psychiatric disorders and objective light study in more than 85,000 people now I have to say that I think the title of this paper is terrible sorry folks at nature mental health because if one just read the title it sounds like day and night light exposure associated with psychiatric disorders right if this were If This Were a newspaper headline You' be like oh my goodness well what are you supposed to do right but that's not the conclusion the conclusion is that getting a lot of sunlight exposure during the day and getting a lot of dark exposure at night is immensely beneficial for psychiatric health and in a number of ways now I'm not one to bring up another paper unannounced but I will say that this paper built off a previous study entitled time spent in outdoor light is associated with mood sleep and circadian rhythm related outcomes and that was a cross-sectional longitudinal study in 400,000 biobank participants so this UK biobank is an incredibly valuable resource and there are now multiple studies establishing that one's pattern of light exposure is extremely important now the previous study in 400,000 participants basically nailed home the idea that the more time you spend Outdoors the better your is your mood the better is your sleep the better is the rhythmicity of your sleep wake cycles and on and on something that I think even though people will say we've known that for thousands of years needed scientific substantiation this new study essentially looked at the relative contributions of daytime light exposure and nighttime dark exposure and they did that on a background of it looking in particular at people who had major depressive disorder generalized anxiety PT SD bipolar disorder he here's the the basic takeaway and I'll I'll quote them here and then I'll I'll tell you my interpretation that here I'm quoting avoiding night at light and seeking light during the day I love that word seeking may be a simple and effective non-pharmacologic means for broadly improving mental health so that's a pretty bold statement right and I love that they say seeking because it implies that people aren't reflexively getting the light exposure that they need that this needs to be a practice ice much like Zone 2 cardio or resistance training okay so so what did they do in this study so basically they gathered up 100,000 people or so it eventually was paired down to about 86,000 participants because some just didn't qualify or didn't report their data back they equipped them with accelerometers on their wrist and those wrist devices also could measure ambient light now that's not a perfect tool because what you'd love to do is measure ambient light at the level the Eyes by the way will somebody design an eyeglass frame that changes color when you've gotten sufficient light from sunlight during the day and then and then at night is a different color and then if you're getting too much light exposure will go to a different color frame this has to be possible so that you don't have to wonder if you got enough light during the day and of course if it's at the level of the eyes then you know that's what's landing at the eyes yeah and it's l i mean that's what I was going to ask you about that do these wrist based devices potentially get covered by clothing and some like turned you have your sleeves down I have my sleeves up they had it on the outside of the sleeve but they asked that people just keep it on their dominant hand it's not perfect but in some ways it's kind of nice that it's not perfect we could turn that disadvantage into an advantage by thinking you know when the person is out and about they're not often looking right at the sun you know if you're talking to a colleague under an overhang for instance so it's it's not perfect directionally it's directionally right okay and then they had two hypotheses two primary hypotheses one that greater light exposure in the day is associated with lower risk for psychiatric disorders and two second hypotheses greater light exposure at night is associated with higher risk for psychiatric disorders and poorer mood this is oh so relevant for the way we live now people on screens and tablets in the middle of the night okay then they collected information about how much light exposure people were getting as well as their sleep and their activity and so on I should mention this was done in males and females it was a slightly older cohort than one is used to seeing people in their 50s and 60s they had psychiatric diagnosis information and then they divided people into essentially two groups but they had a lower so a q1 and a Q2 a lower cortile that meant people that were getting less daytime light as opposed to the third and fourth quartile more daytime light they also had a nighttime light exposure evaluation and they had people were in the low q1 and Q2 so these people are getting less nighttime life light versus Q3 Q4 more nighttime light nicely they also looked at sleep duration and they looked at photo period meaning how long the days were for those individuals how active they were what 10 hours a day 14 hours a day because the more active you are the more opportunity for light exposure you have during the day or night for instance okay so it they had I would say fairly complete data sets then and I'm just going to kind hit the top Contour of what they did in each and sorry sleep duration sleep efficiency Etc was determined off the accelerometer that's right as well as self-report yeah not not ideal right you'd love for people to be wearing a woop bander or or a ring or something of that sort but this was initiated some time ago so um they either didn't have access to that technology or for whatever reason didn't select it I'd like to take a brief moment and thank one of our sponsors and that's ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens I started taking ag1 way back in 2012 the reason I started taking it and the reason I still take it every day is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas for vitamins and minerals and it ensures that I get enough Prebiotic and probiotic to support gut health now gut health is something that over the last 10 years we realized is not just important for the health of our gut but also for our immune system and for the production of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin in other words gut health is critical for proper brain functioning now of course I strive to consume healthy Whole Foods for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day but there are a number of things in ag1 including specific micronutrients that are hard to get from Whole Foods or at least in sufficient quantities so ag1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals that I need probiotics prebiotics the adaptogens and critical micronutrients so anytime somebody asks me if they were to take Just One supplement what that supplement should be I tell them ag1 because ag1 supports so many different systems within the body that are involved in mental health physical health and performance to try ag1 go to drink a1.com huberman and you'll get a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 and five free travel packs of ag1 again that's drink a1.com huberman then what they did is they got they have information on who has major depressive disorder who has PTSD generalized bipolar psychosis Etc and then they ran three models and you can tell me what you think about the power of these models but you know as somebody who thinks about the mechanistic aspect of all of this a lot but not somebody who's ever run this type of study I'd be really curious model one examined the unadjusted association between day and nighttime light exposure and psychiatric outcome so just basically asking is there a relationship between how much light you get it during during the day and how much light you get at night and how bad your or your depression is or anxiety is ETC looking at you know just a standard ratio of the probability that you have a certain symptom or set of symptoms versus you don't given a certain amount of light exposure model two adjusted for the age of the person their sex and ethnicity and photo period so they looked at you know how long the days were in that given person's region of the world and then model three these people were all in the UK or were they around the world they were all in the UK as far as I know and then model three adjusted for employment so employed versus unemployed which if you think about it is pretty important like you say well an unemployed person has a lot more time to control these variables but an employed person who's doing shift work does not right and they they Incorporated information about employed versus unemployed physical activity which turns out to be very important and then things like shift work etc and so these what what we can say very safely is that the outcomes with each of these models the results were very similar so we don't want to discard the differences between those models entirely but in my read is in every figure of the paper it doesn't seem like model one two or three differ from one another in terms of total outcome yeah that's an unusual aspect of this paper so so these adjustments are very standard right so that's this is a a classic uh tool that's used in most epidemiology um because you don't have randomization so once randomization is out the window you know you you're like so for example the paper I'm going to present is based on an RCT there will be no models it's just he the data right yeah here they're asking people what what do you do report back to us we're going to measure your light exposure but no one was assigned to any groups they swapped there the the whatever quote unquote controls are there they're really not there it's just comparisons between groups so what is interesting to me uh is that as it's exactly as you said and we'll make all these figures available in addition to the papers but um I mean there it's very unusual that there's no difference between the unadjusted and the adjusted models and as you say there's probably two places out of you know 30 when you look at all the different quartile comparisons where you might Creep from you know statistically significant just out of it or just into it but yeah you could simplify this figure two completely by just showing one of the models and you would be you know getting 95% of the information which is you know I mean I think in one way that suggests that there's less dependency on those variables of course it still doesn't address probably the greatest question question I have here which I'm sure we'll get to at some point as as you continue yeah so I'm very curious what that question is but I'll I'll I'll suppress my curiosity for the moment you know so if we look at figure two of this paper and I realize a lot of people are listening and and they're not able to look at this although we have posted the figures on the YouTube versions of this uh just want to make clear what's going on just for those that are listening essentially what they're looking at is what they call the odds ratio which is the probability of something happening in one group vers divided by the probability of something happening in another group I guess would it by way of example be you know if you're going to look at the odds ratio of you know the probability of somebody getting lung cancer if they smoke versus probability somebody getting lung cancer if they don't smoke so odds ratios and Hazard ratios are often confused they're very similar and odds ratios generally refer to a lifetime exposure whereas a hazard ratio is um defined over a specific period of time but the MTH is still effectively the same and uh using the example you gave if you took the odds ratio of um you know death so let's talk all cause mortality for a smoker versus a nonsmoker and the answer were 1.78 I'm making that up but that's directionally correct 1.78 as an odds ratio means there's a 78% chance greater of the outcome of interest in this case death by any cause in the affected Group which would be the smokers so odds ratio of two is 100% and odds ratio of three is 200% so the math is take the number subtract one and that's the percent you know figure two of this paper is one of the key take-homes they essentially look at the odds ratio of people who are in the let's say that let's just look at the nighttime light exposure and just remind me Andrew CU and and everybody else watching the every one of these is showing second third fourth as your x-axis meaning they're all being compared to the first quartile that's right and the first quartile is lowest light exposure or highest light exposure low well or well we have to um differentiate between day and night that's right okay so restate it sure so uh if we look at you know what is your risk of a psychiatric challenge broadly speaking well panel a is is major depressive disorder if you are in the second quartile third quartile or fourth quartile of nighttime light exposure so second being the least amount of nighttime light exposure third being more nighttime light exposure and fourth the most nighttime light exposure relative to the first quartile this is just a stupid thing like if I were doing this figure if you were doing this in a lecture you know what you would do to make it so easy you would draw arrows on it that say increasing light exposure at night decreasing light exposure in the day it's the same information it just makes it easier for the reader to understand absolutely but and maybe the teaching point I think is is for people when they review articles like don't be afraid to do that and just kind of like oh I've got all over this exactly so it's like I I draw the arrow that's increasing light that's decreasing light and that's how I can pay attention to what's actually happening right and I'm actually in touch with the editorial staff at nature at nature mental health although they don't know that I'm covering this paper until after this comes out you know I think one thing that scientific journals really really need to do is start making the readability of the Articles better for nonex experts I mean chances are if you can't understand a graph and this is true for everybody chances are there's a problem with the way it's presented yeah put it on them but then of course try and parse it because um you know rarely if ever is it all spelled out clearly but anyway that's what we're trying to do here so yeah the way I would have done is say second quartiles low amounts of nighttime light exposure and Define what that is you know third quartile is more light exposure and then fourth maximum amount of light exposure at night and basically what you see is that the probability of having worse major depressive symptoms linearly increases as you go from the second to third to Fourth quartile so more nighttime light exposure worse for you and there's a dose response if you will of the effect now we can March through or describe figure two pretty quickly by saying the same thing is true now just talking about nighttime light exposure for generalized anxiety disorder so that's panel C bipolar disorder although the difference between the second and the third quartile in bipolar disorder isn't as traumatic once you get up to the fourth quartile bipolar symptoms get much worse when people are getting nighttime light exposure I really want to emphasize that point because they go on in the discussion of this paper to reemphasize that point several times in fact they say that while light EXP exposure during the day of course we will go into the data is beneficial for mental health for people with bipolar disorder it seems that light exposure at night is especially problematic independent of how much sunlight they're getting during the day so your bipolar um in the person with bipolar disorder who's struggling with either a manic or a depressive episode who's making a point to get sunlight during the day who's also getting light exposure at night is making their symptoms worse and keep in mind they they couldn't completely control this but is largely independent of things like sleep duration so that doesn't necessarily mean that the person's sleeping less although in a in a manic episode presumably they are it's independent of exercise it's independent of a bunch of other things because any any logical person will hear this and say okay well they're they G more light at night because they're doing a bunch of other things but it's largely independent of those other things likewise the symptomology of PTSD gets far worse with increasing light exposure at night self harm really takes a a leap from being fairly I don't want to say minimal at the second and third quartile so low and let's say medium I'm using some I'm taking some Liberties here but low in medium amounts of of artificial light exposure at night than for people who get quite a lot of nighttime light exposure self harm goes up and probability of Psych psychotic episodes goes up or psychotic symptoms now what's nice is that the what's nice about the data is that the exact inverse is basically true for daytime light exposure although not across the board we can generally say that for major depressive disorder generalized anxiety bipolar symptoms there it's a little more scattered PTSD and self harm the more daytime light exposure ideally from sunlight because that's actually what's being measured in most cases we could talk about how we know that is going to approximately linearly drop the probability or the severity of these symptoms and we could just explain again that the odds ratios now seem to be going down so an odds ratio of 7 now refers to a 30% reduction in the variable of interest here exactly now the The psychosis panel F which uh focuses on psychosis I think is also worth mentioning in in a bit more detail there's a fairly dramatic reduction in psychotic symptoms as one gets more daytime light exposure independent of nighttime light exposure there's a well-known phenomenon called ICU psychosis which is that people come into the hospital for a broken leg or a car accident maybe they were getting surgery from from Peter back when for something totally independent they're they're housed in the hospital and as anyone who's ever been in a hospital as a patient or visitor knows the light in the lighting environment of the hospital is absolutely dreadful for health just Dreadful I mean people often complain about the food in the cafeteria as being unhealthy that's often not always true not always true but the lighting environments in hospitals is absolutely counter especially especially in the Intensive Care Unit yeah right I think the the Intensive Care Unit at Hopkins the main one the the main sucku didn't have Windows people who who go into the hospital with with a brain injury or or with a stroke or something I get contacted all the time even though I'm not a clinician what should I do for my kid my parent my I say get them near a window and start to the best of your abilities controlling their sleep wake cycle now often times there's there you know nurses coming in and taking blood tests and measuring pulses in the middle of the night that's disruptive there there's bright light not just blue light that's disruptive it's noisy that's disruptive ICU psychosis is when non psychotic individuals start having psychotic episodes in the hospital because of nighttime light exposure and in some cases lack of daytime sunlight we can can say that with some degree of confidence because when those people go home even though sometimes their symptoms for what brought them to the hospital in the first place get worse their psychosis goes away now and it's independent of medication so let's just be really direct there is a possibility that we are all socially jetlagged that we are all disrupting these mood regulation symptoms systems excuse me by not getting enough daytime light and by getting too much nighttime light if we want to look at just some of the bullet points of the takeaways and then Peter thank you you highlighted a few of these but can we just go back to this figure two for a second there's a handful of things that really was going to want to want to dig in the DAT just um and and again I normally wouldn't make so much hay out of this except for the fact that they're so tight um but the there are a few that really stand out um and again I love this figure um I would have labeled it a little differently to make it completely userfriendly but nevertheless the increasing light at night and the impact on depression let let me be really technical in what I say and the relationship or correlation to depression is very strong um the relationship to light and self harm in the upper cortile so when you take those 25% of people with the most nighttime light that relationship to self harm is interesting and completely uncoupled from the other 75% that's interesting but uncoupled you mean that at the lower levels of light exposure at night you're not seeing an increase in self harm not what and then once you get to that fourth quartile it's a big step it's like a 30% greater risk of self yeah so it's totally flat the first second third quartile no different and then fourth big jump um and then the the the inverse relationship right as light increases during the daytime you see this reduction in self harm interesting the PTSD relationship based on nighttime light and The psychosis relationship based on daytime light those are the ones that really jumped out to me uh I think anxiety relatively the you know less impressive here and and bipolar disorder didn't seem as strong right as well so I think those those are the big ones that that jumped out to me yeah I agree there's AIT there's a bit more scatter on generalized anxiety and and the degree of the sign the degree of significant change is not is not as robust in other words getting a lot of daytime light ideally from sunlight is not necessarily going to reduce your levels of anxiety getting a lot of nighttime light exposure is not increasing nighttime anxiety that much although 20% you know is is not nothing um for nighttime light exposure but yeah where the psychosis major major depression and self harm are really you know they leap out actually we maybe we even just drill a little bit deeper on major depression basically when you go from the second to third quartile of nighttime light exposure so more than nighttime light exposure you basically go from no significant increase to almost almost a 20% increase and then as you get up to the fourth quartile so the most nighttime light exposure you're at about 25% increase in major depressive symptoms not that's no joke um and you know and I think that I think that we you know if we were to uh know we don't have the data right here but if we were to look at like standard SSRI treatment for major depression you know um people debate this pretty actively but um light is is a very potent stimulus and the timing of light is critical because on the the inverse is also true as you get to the fourth quartile of daytime light exposure you get about a 20% reduction in major depressive disorder what I like about a study like this is that it puts the error bars so easy to see on the data and why is that interesting well um there's there's um there's a there's a belief that bigger is always better in sample size and we often talk about that through the lens of power analysis right so how many subjects do we need to um to to reach a conclusion that is powered to you know this level and that's that's true but what I don't think gets discussed as often is the opposite of that which is what if you overpower a study in other words what if the power analysis says to be uh to have a level of power at 90% you need a th000 subjects and you Sayre we're going to do 10,000 subjects well you're clearly powered for it but you might be overpowered and people might say well why would that be a bad thing it could be a bad thing because it means you are very likely to reach statistical significance in things that might not be actually significant and so one thing about this study that is just a quick back like kind of a quick and dirty way to tell that it's probably not overpowered is that you have varying lengths of error bars and what that tells me is that and again this is not like a formal statistical analysis it's just kind of like a back of the envelope statistical analysis if you look for example at self harm in the top quartile you actually have pretty big error bars in fact all the self harm have sort of slightly bigger error bars and yet when you look at for example the depression even though the a bars aren't all the same size they're tighter in fact when you look at the relationship between depression and daytime light the air bars are really really small so that just gives me confidence that there is variability in this which paradoxically you kind of want to see because it tells me that this wasn't just done you know there was I think you said 8,000 subjects were in this and I realized 8 more than 86,000 86,000 sorry yeah you realize that it wasn't that oh this should have been done with a tenth of that or a half of that and we're picking up um signal that is statistically relevant but clinically irrelevant yeah thanks for for that point that I didn't pay attention to that um I mean I paid attention to the air bars but I didn't know that um so thank you I'm learning too and I I suppose for people that are listening we can just give them a sense of what the error bar ranges are for self harm you know they're running you know as much as 20% either side of the the mean the average and for major depression it looks like it's more like let's say 8 to 10% if if that if that maybe like five right so um yeah I see what you're saying so when you get a a a very large sample size you're going to have some outliers in there and you can mask those outliers just by having so many data points right yeah because these error bars directly tell you whether or not your statistically significant so what's really nice about this type of graph and you see these in there's going to be a graph in my paper where you see the same analysis um they're always drawing the 95% confidence interval on the on the data point and if the 95% confidence interval does not touch the the line of unity which in this case is the the the the hods ratio of 1.0 or the x-axis then you know it's statistically significant to the confidence interval they've defined which is almost assuredly 95% sometimes they'll make it tighter at 99 and so that's why you can just look right at these and go oh look you know in depression the second quartile didn't reach statistical significance because the error bars are touching the line just as the case for the second and third quartile for self harm but when you look at the fourth quartile you can see that the lower tip of the error bars isn't anywhere near Unity and so we know without having to look up the P value that it's uh smaller than either 05 or 0.1 however they've defined it and it's really amazing when you see these you know overpowered studies which are easier to do epidemiologically where you know the P value ends up being microscopic you know they can they can drive their P values down to anything low because sample size can be infinite but you know you can see that it's just like the the error bar is just skimming above the uh the the unity line but it's so so so tight I'd like to take a quick break to acknowledge our sponsor element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means zero sugar and the appropriate ratios of the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium and that correct ratio of electrolytes is extremely important because every cell in your body but especially your nerve cells your neurons relies on electrolytes in order to function properly so when you're well hydrated and you have the appropriate amount of electrolytes in your system your mental functioning and your physical functioning is improved I drink one packet of element dissolved in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning as well as while I exercise and and if I've sweat a lot during that exercise I often will drink a third element packet dissolved in about 32 ounces of water after I exercise element comes in a variety of different flavors all of which I find really tasty I like the Citrus I like the watermelon I like the raspberry frankly I can't pick just one it also comes in chocolate and chocolate mint which I find tastes best if they are put into water dissolved and then heated up I tend to do that in the winter months because of course you don't just need hydration on hot days and in the summer and spring months but also in the winter when the temperatures are cold and the environment tends to be dry if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element spelled lm.com huberman to try a free sample pack again that's drink element.com huberman one thing that I hope people are taking away from this study is that imagine you're somebody who has a very sensitive circadian mood system well that would mean you need less daytime light exposure to feel good or less bad but it also means that you might need very little light at night in order to negatively impact your mood systems and in fact they make this argument in the discussion as an interesting point that I think is worth mentioning what because here what I again what I like about the study is that they've separated day and nighttime light exposure turns out that many of the drugs that are used to treat bipolar disorder reduce the Sens are are effective perhaps in part because they reduce the sensitivity of the light sensing circadian apparati now that's interesting right if if you think about this okay so these are drugs that can ameliorate some of the symptoms of bipolar perhaps in part by reducing the extent to which nighttime light exposure can relieve bipolar symptoms can excuse me can exacerbate bipolar symptoms conversely there's evidence that people who take take certain anti-depressants May suppress the ability for daytime light to positively impact the mood systems of the brain now of course we don't want people halting their medication on the basis of that statement alone please don't you know talk to your psychiatrist but if we know one thing for sure it's that if you want a significant outcome and a paper as a scientist give a drug any drug and look at the amount of rapid eye movement sleep or the Circadian cycle pretty much any drug Alters the Circadian rhythm for better or worse but if we start to think about which medications might adjust our overall sensitivity to light sometimes this could be a good thing you think less sensitivity to light well for people who have bipolar disorder the amount of daytime light exposure isn't that important for their overall mood regulation but the amount of nighttime light exposure really is in other words Darkness for eight hours every night should be viewed in my opinion as a treatment for bipolar disorder not the only treatment but it's also clear that we should all be avoiding really bright extensive really bright nighttime light exposure I mean if if anything you know my take away from this study is that Darkness at night is the fourth key light stimulus now a couple of things very bright Moonlight very bright candle light is probably only like gosh three to 50 lucks what when you go outside on a brightly lit full moon night I encourage people to download this free app I have no relationship to it called light meter and it gives you a pretty good read of what the lucks are in that environment by the way a lot of people don't realize this they think you just tap the button and then it tells you how many lucks you hold it down it's kind of fun you can scan around the room and see how many lucks are on average coming from that location or outside go out on a really bright moonl night I mean we we should have a full moon tonight yeah let's do it you're not going to get above a 100 Lux that's incredible you're sitting at a candlelight dinner with your spouse or with friends and it's clearly bright enough to see them put that lux meter right up not too close to the flame 50 to 200 Lux i i 4 interesting experience a couple of months ago on an elk hunt where it was a full moon which actually makes the hunting not so great but it was the first time I've ever noticed my shadow in relation to the Moon uh that's how bright it seemed the light was this is Halloween appropriate since we're coming out we we're recording this close to Halloween it's remarkable super interesting to think it could be that dim campfire you know and Fire Light you think okay gathering around a campfire then okay you know everyone circadian rhythm must have been disrupted for ages before the development of of electric electricity no no that th those campfires are extremely bright but they're they're they're not they're not that bright compared to a very densely overcast day and what is is your phone if you don't use any sort of uh light mitigating uh Tech on it well distance matters um at the distance we're holding it yeah with so with all the the wavelengths cranked up so no uh there is a nice feature intrinsic to the phone where you can eliminate the blues at night or you know this kind of thing but if you crank it up to maximum light intensity probably something like you know 500 to 1,000 Lux now keep in mind though it's additive right so it's over time so Lux is a measure of I think I think it relates back to Candelas it's the amount of light um shown at I think it's like the the one meter away and there's a squaring and a falling off of distance we can look it up um these are old measurement old school measurements converted to Lux but keep in mind that if you're looking at your phone or tablet at 800 Lux or 500 Lux in the evening you do that for 2 hours well you're summing quite a lot of photons now it is true and I I I I do want to be fair to the biology uh and it'd be dishonest to say anything different you know we we've hammered on people about not shifting their circadian rhythm with light at night but we know that the middle of the day and the middle of the night are circadian dead zones you can't shift your circadian rhythm that well in the middle of the day and the middle of the night but you can provide a wakeup signal for for your body and brain it's really that sunrise and sunset that are critical that's why I said there are four things see sunrise or sunrising you don't need to see across the Horizon Sunset bright light during the day minimize light exposure at night and you don't need Pitch Black in fact pitch black probably just increases the frequency of injury you know I get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom probably once I think it's normal I go back to sleep you know if it were pitch black I'd probably injure myself so just just dim it down some people use red lights you know our friend Rick Ruben yeah Rick ruin is uh can we tell a funny story about Rick yeah of course of course you know this story but just I just in casee Rick's listening he'll appreciate this you know when Rick was uh here staying last summer um he's up in our guest house and he came down after the first night and he was like unacceptable you know what I'm talking about unacceptable accommodations what did he do he removed all the lighting that existed in that room and replaced it with red light bulbs which I later used when I stayed here and then later stole when I left the teenage me I took them I took him that's why Derek when he stayed here lane or anyone else when he stayed here Cony or anyone else didn't have those I took them I love them so funny Jill is like you know Rick changed every light in the guest house to Red I'm like yeah no I didn't know that but I'm not surprised yeah well in his place he has mostly either no lighting or red lighting so during the day he just goes by ambient light um and then red light in the evening and or candle light and it's great and you know people hear red lights and they think they have to buy these expensive red light units that's not what we're talking about that you can literally buy red party lights or just a red bulb some people say well can I just use a red film or can I put a t-shirt over the lamp I worry about people putting t-shirts over lamp because of the fire hazard um but I'll be honest I dim the lights in my home at night um when I travel sometimes I will bring one of the the stolen from Rick Rubin red lights the red the Rick rubben stash here's something where I've I've sort of softened my tune so I used to be kind of a hard liner no blue light in the evening guy um you know had the you know everything was red light at night as far as my phone using flux on the computer you know whatever it was um I suspect that that matters somewhat but I think what matters more is the stimulation that may come from those things and what I've come to realize at least in me which means it probably is true in others as well and at least some others is that what I'm doing on my phone matters more than how how bright my phone is in other words if I've got the best blue light filter in the world on my phone but I'm doom scrolling social media and getting lit up on email that's way worse for me than if I've got my phone on maximum light and I'm like watching YouTube videos of F1 cars and driving around having fun like it's a totally different experience so so so the context matters and um I think I think for that reason I I I would want people to be mindful of the whole picture um you know going to bed under a period of you know intense duress brought on by something you know that's an equally dangerous component to all of this that's that's distinct from what we're talking about but but you know you just want i' like I want people to be able to think of this in the context of everything yeah I it's a really important point you know one thing I'll say is that if you're going to stay up past your normal bedtime if you're going to get a lot of light in your eyes I would hope that it would be for fun reasons and for reasons you enjoy you should definitely spend some nights out you should definitely do some all nighters studying if you really you know if you if it's going to help you get the grade that's permanent right I'd certainly have done all nighter studying and grant writing for years um you know there are going to be the inevitable allnighters due to God forbid a Hos trip to the hospital or you heard something on the news that really amped you up or you just simply can't sleep that stuff is going to happen so I think the goal should be to minimize light exposure at night and I think what you just said is especially true because we don't know for instance people talk about the negative impact of social media is it the fact that people are looking at this little box for so many hours per day is it all the things they're not doing is it what they're looking at per se all of those things interact and are really important I we know based on studies from the Stanford sleep lab that if you wake up in the middle of the night looking at what time it is can be very disruptive to your ability to fall back asleep and to your sense the next day it's just a placebo effect but it's a powerful one of how tired you are the next day they've done this where they wake people up in the middle of the night and then they say it's you know 4:00 a.m. versus 2: a.m. versus 6:00 a.m. and people's perceived levels of energy during the day in some ways correlate with what they think how much sleep they think they got likewise and this is one of the concerns potential concerns with sleep trackers yep Ali Crum talked about this when she came on our podcast you know if people see a poor sleep score they often feel worse than if they see a good sleep score now of course physiology matters you can't lie to yourself and say you you know got a great night of sleep simply by virtue of a sleep score but I worry more about the the false well I if it's a false negative that we don't want to put veilance on this seeing a bad sleep score and then deciding that you're going to have a terrible day you know I think a bad sleep score is an indication that you might need to dial some things in a bit better getting a great sleep score is an indication that you might be doing a number of things right and start looking at these things as averaging wouldn't would you agree yeah completely I I I I don't think it's that different from CGM right like I think that CGM is an amazing tool to provide insight and you pretty much know the insights after a relatively short period of time 30 days maybe at the outside 90 for for a really per for a person with a very complicated life um and you know all you need to know about how the inputs affect the output thereafter if you choose to use it it's a behavioral tool in other words you're using this to build in a Hawthorn effect I think the same is largely true with sleep trackers um most people have this profound sense of learning when they first encounter one of these things and and it's again you've heard it all 100 times oh my God I can't believe what alcohol does to my sleep right or caloric trackers exactly like I think a lane Norton's app carbon I have no Financial relationship to it I use it or and it's taught me wow like I consume a lot of calories in the form of certain things at certain times of day and there's just a lot of good learning in that but it's the Act of tracking that helps you manage it and similarly I think it's the act of knowing you're going to be looking at that score that gamifies it that kind of helps people do the right things oh you know what I'm not going to have that drink tonight or I'm not going to eat that snack before bed because I've now been conditioned to see how that impact score that said I think that um you know recovery scores and things like that are just notoriously poor at predicting performance and I think there's a reason that serious athletes would never use things like that um they would tend to rely on the more tried and true methods of predicting Behavior such as heart rate uh maybe heart rate variability but morning resting heart rate probably more predictive than anything else and then you know inw workout things such as heart rate heart rate recovery lactate threshold things like that so yeah I agree I think we have to and I say this as a guy who's generally perceived to be the most Pro device guy in the world people would be surprised how sparingly I use things like that I mean I do some Tracking not as much as you uh I love things that seem to work the first time and every time in terms of our natural biology based on a couple of criteria there's an established mechanism um it's been explored in the context of pathology like mental health disorders as well as pro- health in healthy individuals um that it make really good sense at the level of kind of um uh Wellness uh uh and let's just say ancient Health you know when you're talking about getting a lot of sunlight during the day like a lot of people say well of course get outside and play not getting too much light at night of course this is just good old quote unquote good oldfashioned advice people spend 90% of their time indoors now their daytime environments are too dim their nighttime environments are too bright and this kind of misleading aspect of artificial light that when you see a bright bulb you think I'm getting a a lot of photons is part of the problem and the fact that when you're out on a overcast day and it you know you think there Sun quote unquote isn't out well it's hidden by cloud cover but just think about how well you can navigate that environment without a flashlight yeah versus at night where you would require a flashlight we evolved under this tramatic difference in day night availability of photons independent of whether or not you can quote see the sun and it's just very clear that our the all the mechanisms in our brain and body that regulate mood are just powerfully regulated by this stuff so I've made it a point to really reduce the amount of nighttime light that I'm getting but I am less concerned about flipping on the light switch to use the bathroom as I used to be I used to think oh I'm like quashing all my melatonin this is terrible I know I can't shift my circadian clock then I know that that light yes while it's bright if it's brief I'm not going to worry about it too much would it be better to have a you you know a dim light on as opposed to a bright light sure but I'm not going to stress it in a hotel bathroom or something I'm not going to walk around you know shielding my eyes people sometimes ask me by the way is it different to look at the phone directly versus if you tilt the phone away well it absolutely is I mean think about a flashl shown on the ground in front of you very few photons getting in your eyes versus shown directly into your eyes think about the ambient light from the Sun going everywhere versus looking in the general direction of the Sun so East in the morning West in the afternoon of course the directionality of the light matters so I'm not saying it you know that you need to like peek at your phone as if you're looking you know over the edge of a bowl or something into it but my friend Samar hataru is head of the chronobiology unit at the National Institutes of mental health we used to room together at meetings we stopped because he's a terrible snorer so I just could I there were a few times when I considered suffocating him in the middle of the night since he was already suffocating himself now we just we don't stay in the same rooms anymore we're no longer postt talk but I caught him looking at his phone in the middle of the night and he would tilt it like away like he's holding a platter for those are just listening and and kind of like looking over at the screen there I'm like what are you doing this is ridiculous he said I'm trying not to get so much light in my eyes that's a little extreme but I think it illustrates the point which is how much direct light exposure you get at night matters how much direct sunlight exposure you get especially early in late early morning late afternoon and throughout the day it really matters now remind me Andrew what is the wavelength of sunlight great so sunlight is going to include all visible visible which runs from how many yeah so well let's let's we can answer two questions there this wrist sensor detected 470 degree 70 nanometer to 650 nanometer light so that's going to be blue and UltraViolet ultraviolet is kind of kind of like blue to Orange yeah blue blue to Orange that's what this was measuring so red light is going to be more like 680 um far red is getting out to 7 720 and up upwards of that blue light is going to fall somewhere in the you know low fours ultraviolet is getting down into the high 3es and and lower um and so these these Spectra of light so during the day you know midday light you're get what looks like white light you'll see oh the sky is blue in the Sun is bright white light it's not even yellow to your eye and of course don't stare at it especially in the middle of the day you're getting all visible Spectra so you're getting everything from UV all the way out to Red Light it's just coming in at equ intensities so is that a potential limitation of this study in that it didn't have a sensor that could pick up the full spectrum of light potentially especially since they're you know we don't think of humans as UV uh capable like we can't perceive UV light um like a a ground squirrel for instance can has UV sensors in its eyes turns out you know why they use this it's crazy they actually you know when the ground squirrels sit up on their hunches they're actually signaling one another they rub urine on their belly and it reflects UV um the the New York Times for some reason has been running a series of papers uh or articles rather about uh naturally occurring fluoresence at night in all sorts of scorpions and uh monotes like the Platypus no one really knows the reason for these odd odd wavelength of light emissions for for all these animals but you know we view things in the blue violet and up to red and you know we're not pit vipers we can't see far red but we can see lower than 470 nimet and we can see higher than uh 7 650 is there a technology reason why they had such a narrow band in these sensors is it not possible that they could have used a wrist sensor that was wider this study was initiated in 2013 the tech was probably far worse than it is now again I would love for somebody to design an eyeglass where it's measuring how many photons you're getting across the day I'm not a big fan of having everything be app IED so I would love it if the frame would just shift color across the morning like you go outside on a cloudy day you know you wear these glasses and um and by the way it's fine to where eyeglasses or contacts for sunlight viewing for setting your circadian rhythm um people always say well why is it that okay and a window is not well corrective lenses are actually focusing the light onto your retina the windows and and windshields are scattering the light and filtering and how much are sunglasses filtering this out way too much we can safely say way too much probably causing it tfold decrement in the total Lux count that's landing on your retina but of course I you know sunglasses are important driving into into sun and um and some people have very sensitive eyes I can't sit at a cafe with a bright brightly reflective table in the afternoon I just I just squint like crazy I can't do it my dad who's you know darker eyed you know he's South South American descent he um you know he can just sit there just fine my mom who's got light eyes like me and you know we're like oh it's really tough just have a terrible time um you know people differ in their light sensitivity so there's one other macro question I have here and it's not answerable because without randomization we can't know it but it's the question of how much reverse causality can exist in these observations so again these observations um demonstrate very tight correlations very strong associations especially in the five areas that we highlighted um but it's possible that part of what we're seeing um is reverse causality brought on by both the treatments which you've already kind of alluded to and also the condition itself do you want to explain reverse causality for people and maybe could you mention um for those that missed uh the Hawthorne effect just yeah yeah the the Hawthorne effect uh is is is an effect that is named after you know an observation of what took place in a factory where they were actually studying worker productivity with light of all things um but what refers to is the idea that people will change their behavior when they are observed so if um if I said well I really want to know what a day in the life is like for Andrew huberman I'm going to follow him around for a day it's very unlikely that his behavior that day will be exactly as it was if I wasn't there re why you probably will never see a day in the life of Andrew huberman although it's pretty it's pretty scripted unless I'm traveling it's a it's a you know it's morning sunlight hydration and you know some cardio or weight training and then a lot of time reading papers it'd be the most boring video in the world because mostly me reading and underlining things but it's why um gamifying things can be beneficial right it's why a CGM can can be beneficial because it's sort of like somebody's watching you and you're going to modify what you eat in response to it or why tracking can really be an effective way to reduce input because you there's a sense of being monitored by doing that especially if someone literally monitors it in other words you can set up an accountability partner where your health coach or someone is actually seeing the data so that's what it is now as far as reverse causality when you look at variables so um let's just pick u a common one that's unrelated to this so there there's an association that more diet soda consumption is associated with greater obesity it's a bit paradoxical right um is that true it is yeah it's it's been demonstrated in many series that the the the greater the consumption of diet soda the greater the prevalence of obesity and that has been postulated by some to suggest that non-nutritive sweeteners such as aspartame or sucrose or things like that are actually part of what's causing obesity um and while while there are probably some arguments you could make around the impact that those things might have on the gut microbiome and maybe there's some way and that's happening it's also equally likely if not probably more likely that there's reverse causality there that a person who is obese is therefore contemplating how much they're eating or thinking hey what's an easy way that I can reduce calories how about instead of drinking a Coke I drink a Diet Coke and so there the causality which you would impute to mean the drink is causing the Obesity it might be no the Obesity is causing the choice of drink so here the question is um how much of the effect we're seeing is a result of the condition that's being studied right how much of the disruption in both day and night ex uh light exposure is the result of the depression it's disregulated the sleep maybe they sleeping more during the day and more awake at night because of depression again these are you can't know this this is where epidemiology never allows us to determine this and sadly these questions can only be answered through either direct randomization or mandelian randomization which by the way I was going to also ask you do you know if anyone has examined this from a mandelian standpoint that would be that would be very interesting because I have to believe well it would be interesting I don't know enough about the biology to know what Snips would be studi but that would be interesting what Peter is saying is you know if you knew something about the genomes of these people um you would be in a great position to perhaps even link up light susceptibility genes or light light sensitivity genes with genes for you know Pathways involved in major depression bipolar I mean get getting to this issue of reverse causality I mean I think it's very straightforward to imagine that the person who's experiencing a manic episode is going to be up for two weeks at a time um sadly and getting a lot of nighttime light exposure you know now dark nighttime dark exposure as a treatment for bipolar is something that people are starting to talk about so making sure that even those people are awake that they're at least blue blocking at night um reducing their online activities but people with severe manic episodes have a hard time regulating their own behavior of course and it's not one or the other like I don't want the question to come across to the listener that it has to be one or the other it's only a can cause b or B can cause a no it's actually a lot of times these things feed off each other going back to the soda example I actually think there's a bit of both right I I actually think there's a real clear um body habitus dictates beverage choice but I also am starting to think that um ins susceptible individuals non-nutritive sweeteners will alter the gut biome and that alters metabolism what about just hunger I I remember Lane telling me and I I've seen at least at least one of the studies that you know water is probably better for us than diet soda but that for some people diet soda is a great tool for reducing caloric intake I also know some individuals not me who drink diet soda I I drink diet soda from time to time mainly Stevia sweeten sodas but but what I'm referring to here are people besides myself who drink diet soda and it seems to stimulate their appetite there's something about the the the perception of sweet as driving hunger whereas not eating uh or drinking anything with calor with any sweetness doesn't seem to this is one of the things I I wonder um if it impacts why some people like intermittent fasting because for some people you know just even the the perception I wonder if the perception of sweetness or this even just the smell of food we know can stimulate appetite so you can imagine the perception of Sweetness in the mouth even if there's no calories there um I don't think it necessarily makes people hypo glycemic but perhaps it makes them think about M like sweet means food for instance for years I love the combination of a Diet Coke and a slice of pizza whenever I was in New York ideally two slices of pizza so now every time I have a Diet Coke which isn't that often but I like Diet Coke especially with a little bit of lemon in it I just think about a slice of cheese or mushroom or pepperoni pizza it's like I want it I crave it more so there's a parot Association there that I think is real and we know based on Dana Small's Lab at Yale that there's this paired association between the uh sweetness from sucralose and there's an insulin response they actually had to Cease the study in kids because they were they were becoming pre-diabetic you know which unfortunately meant the study was never published have you talked to Dana on this podcast no we we wrote a premium newsletter on this um several months ago it it's got to be like I don't know 10 to 20,000 words on all things related to sugar substitutes I'll read that so yeah folks who are interested in this topic um I would refer them to the premium newsletter on sugar substitutes I think it was our September Edition um the short of it is the data are a little bit noisy um but but there is indeed some some sweeteners in some studies do do result in that phenomenon you described the calic insulin response um and I came away from the research that went into that which was Herculean effort um on the part of the team uh a little bit more confused than when I went in but um being even more cautious around artificial sweeteners than I was going in and not for the reasons that I don't necessarily I don't I didn't find any evidence that these things are cancer-causing right so that's the headline stuff people worry about oh as like like 10 gr crazy I came away more confident that from a from a long-term safety perspective in terms of met in terms of you know cancer and catastrophic outcomes like that that wasn't the issue but I came away much more cautious around these things can really be mucking around with both your brain chemistry and your gut chemistry which can pertain to your metabolism and therefore my takeaway was buy or beware use limited amounts only the one by the way that still emerged to me is a reasonable one it's the only one that I use and I've talked about it a lot is Xylitol xylitol is the pardon me I shouldn't say that Xylitol for chewing so for gum um and allulose as an additive so those were the safer you're saying yes those are those are basically the only two I will consume yeah I'll I'll drink a Diet Coke every now and again if I'm on a plane or something you know this law that got passed a few years ago you couldn't bring liquids in of your own into the airport and onto the plane like what a great few years ago what a great scheme what a great scheme to get people to buy over overpriced fluids in the airport like I mean there are more important issues in the world but like this one really gets me um but yeah I I use a little bit I drink things with a little bit of stevia in it the occasional um Diet Coke um and I I generally avoid sucrose I don't like the way it tastes monk fruit is too sweet but yeah we could we maybe we'll do a a podcast on that in the future okay so I think we can wrap this paper because I really well but tell me what you think about that point Andrew like how I mean you know you you know more about this stuff than I do but if if you had to just lay on your judgment right so so if it were if it were 100 to zero you would say the light is 100% causal in the effects we're seeing if it were zero to 100 you'd say nope the behavior is 100% causal of the exposure to light where do you again you can't know it but what does your intuition tell you okay there's my intuition and then there's my recognition of my own bias um because you know I started working on these circadian Pathways origin in the eye back in year in 98 as a graduate student at Berkeley the the cells these melanops and intrinsically sensive retinal gangling cells were discovered in the early 2000s by a guy named Iggy provencio Dave Bon Sam hatar sain panta and others but and it was like one of the most important discoveries in all of biology clearly um so I've been very excited about systems but if I set that aside so um bias disclosure made I think 65 to 75% of the effects are likely due to light directly now it's impossible to tease those apart as you mentioned but to play Devil's Advocate against myself you know you could imagine that the depressed individual is laying around indoors with the curtains drawn they didn't sleep well the night before which gives you a photo sensitivity that isn't Pleasant like it sucks to have bright light in your eyes first thing in the morning if you especially if especially if you didn't sleep well and then they're you know making their coffee in a dimly lit what they think is brightly lit environment and then they're you know looking at their phone and the the state of the world sucks and their state of their internal landscape is rough and they're maybe they're dealing with a pain or or you know injury or something and their likelihood of getting outside is is low and when they do get outside they're going to shuffle and not you know so I could see how the behaviors could really limit the amount of of light exposure and then evening rolls around they've been tired all day and a common symptom of depression you fall asleep and then 2 or three in the morning they're wide awake what are you going to do at two or three when you're Wide Awake sit in the dark no you're going to get online you're going to listen to things you might have I'm not recommending this but a alcoholic drink in order to try and fall asleep I mean this is the pattern and so you know shaking up that pattern is really what what what so much of my public health work these days is about and trying to get people onto a more natural daylight night uh night dark Rhythm uh but yeah it's impossible to tease apart we do know this and this is uh really serious we know that in almost every instance EV almost every Psychopathology report of suicide in the weeks but especially in the days preceding suicide that person's circadian rhythms looked almost inverted from the normal patterns and that's true of nonbipolar individuals as well you know circadian disruption and disruption in psychiatric Health are inextricable conversely positive mood and affect and and circadian Behavior seem very correlated I mean I think um it's clear that if you want to become an early riser get light in your eyes and get activity in your body early in the day you you built that you entrained to those rhythms so that you start to anticipate that morning workout you start to anticipate the morning sunlight just one um more scientific point we know that when you view bright bright sunlight in the morning or just sunlight that's illuminating your environment as you said you don't even have to see the sun itself that there's a 55 z% increase in the amplitude of the morning cortisol Spike which is a good thing right that's when you want it because it's inversely the amplitude of the morning cortisol spike is inversely related to the amplitude of the evening cortisol Spike and high evening cour is law is associated with middle of the night waking and on and on so um you know I'm very bullish on these mechanisms I also love that they're so deeply woven into our evolutionary history you know that we share with single cell organisms it's so wild um but of course there's going to be a bidirectionality there and it's it's impossible to see where one thing starts and the other one stops I mean here's my take Andrew first of all I I actually with far less Authority than you um agree with your assessment and might even be a little bit more bullish might even put it at 8020 and and here I'll I'll give you my explanations which uh stem more from my fastidious battles with epidemiology in general right like because so much of the world that I live in still has to rely on epidemiologic data and so how do you make sense of it and the truth of it is most of it is really pretty bad um but I I tend to find myself looking at the Austin Bradford Hill criteria all the time and for folks who don't know um he was a statistician who basically proposed a set of criteria U believe there are eight of them and I can't believe I don't know every one of them off by heart I certainly used to um but the more of these criteria that are met within your correlations the more likelihood uh you will find causality so when I think of your data here the data in this paper I'll tell you what makes these correlations seem to have causality within them in the direction that's being proposed um look at the dose effect so dose effect matters and this is done in quartiles and that's a very elegant thing if they just did it as on off it would be harder high low that's right but the fact that they done in quartiles allows you to see that every example in figure two I don't believe there is an exception to this no and I think also in the in the other there's only one exception to what I'm about to say sorry two out of like God knows how many they're all monotonically increasing and decreasing in other words the dose effect is always present another thing is biologic plausibility you've spoken at length about that today so in other words sometimes you have to look at epidemiology and ask is there a biologic explanation and here there is you've added another one which is evolutionary conservation to the biologic plausibility then you can talk about animal models or experiments in humans over short durations that generally support these findings and and so those are just a couple of the the Bradford Hill criteria that that lead to um you know my belief that yeah there's reverse causality here but um it's not the full explanation and that more of the explanation is probably the direction that's being proposed um and if that's true because then at the end of the day like what's the purpose of the discussion the purpose of the discussion is if you are under the influence of any of these psychiatric conditions in addition to the treatments you're doing now what else can you do and to me the takeaway is follow these light behaviors I mean it's it's it's a that's a relatively low lift when you consider some of the other things like I'm over here asking people to do Zone 2 for three hours a week and VO2 max workouts and all this other stuff and like I think all those things matter for mental health as much as physical health but this strikes me as on the spectrum of low asks if it shows if it's only even 30% causality 70% reverse causality like I'll take those I I would still instate that yeah and it's you know it's taking your coffee on the balcony it's and people will often say well how do you do this with kids the kids should be doing it too right you know it means popping your sunglasses off it means getting out for just a few minutes and the fact that it's additive that these you know these Photon uh mechanis Photon counting mechanisms they some is great and look this paper also says and I should have stated this earlier if you missed your daytime light ration get your nighttime dark ration they are independent and additive so that's I mean that's a really something um but of course ideally you get both but I appreciate your take on it and um you know and thanks for for your uh expertise in parsing epidemiology I look at fewer studies of that of that sort but I learned from you and um that's one of the reasons I love doing these Journal clubs as I learn so along those lines uh tell us about the paper you selected I'm really eager to learn more well I I wanted to pick a paper that was you know kind of interesting as a paper and and this this paper I think is um interesting in that it is kind of the landmark study of a class of drugs but in the same way that you kind of picked a paper that I think has a much broader overarching um importance the reason I picked this paper which is um from the New England Journal of Medicine it's about 10 years old no correction 13 years old is because it is kind of the landmark study in a class of drugs that I believe are the most relevant class of drugs we've seen so far in cancer therapy and even though the net effect of these drugs has only served to reduce mortality by maybe 8 to 10 per which is not a huge amount um it's the manner in which they've done it that gives me great hope for the future even if it's through other means so um I'll take a step back before we go into the paper for again just the context and background um so the human immune system is kind of a remarkable thing uh it it's it's hard when you're sort of trying to imagine what's the most amazing part of the human system and maybe it's my bias as well because just as you spent you know your time in the in the light system and the in the photos sensing system I spent my time in the Immunology world but it is remarkable to me how our immune systems evolved and they have this really brutal task which is how can they be tuned to detect any foreign pathogen that is harmful without knowing a priority what that could be while at the same so in other words how can you tune a system to be so aggressive that it can eradicate any virus or bacteria billions of years into the future without knowing what it's going to be but at the same time it has to be so forgiving of the self that it doesn't turn around and attack the self it's remarkable and of course we can always think of the Exceptions there are things called autoimmune conditions so clearly the system fails fails and the immune system turns around and attacks the self if you see a person with Vitiligo I have a little bit of V Vitiligo on my back a couple of spots clearly the immune system is attacking something there and destroying some of the pigment I didn't realize viigo was autoimmune yeah um if you know so there are lots of you know more serious autoimmune conditions of course you know somebody that has lupus or you know where the immune system can be attacking the kidney the immune system can be attacking any autoimmune conditions can be deadly but fortunately they are very rare R and for the most part this immune system works remarkably well so how does it work and why is it that cancer seems to evade it virtually all of the time this is the question now let's first of all talk about how it works and then when I tell you how it works you'll say that sounds amazing clearly it should be able to destroy cancer um I'm going to simplify it by only talking about one system which is how te- cells recognize and get activated how te- cells recognize antigens so we have something called uh an antigen so an antigen is an antibody generating peptide so it's a it's a it's a protein almost always a protein they can be carbohydrates but they're almost always proteins and they're very very small peptides like we're talking as little as nine amino acids maybe up to 20 amino acids so teeny tiny little peptid but it's amazing that in such a short peptide the body can recognize if that's Andrew or not Andrew I mean me again think think about like we talk about proteins in Kil adans right we're talking about proteins in terms of thousands of amino acids that make up every protein in your body and yet if it samples a protein and sees that hey this little 9 10 15 peptide amino acid is not part of you I know it's and therefore I'm going to generate an immune response to it so we have what are called antigen presenting cells you have cells that go around sampling peptides and they will on these things called MHC class receptors bring the peptide up to the surface and serve it up to the t- cell there are two types of these there's MHC class one and MHC Class 2 I only this is Major histo compatibility comple that's correct and um we refer to them that way because they DET because of the context in which they were discovered which was for organ rejection so not surprisingly when you need to put a kidney into another person if that kidney is deemed foreign it will not last long in the early days of organ transplantation were Rife with immediate rejections and by not not I mean the immediates are the incompatibilities but you know the the sort of next layer of incompatibility was MHC incompatibility which would lead to you know within within weeks the organ is gone as opposed to within hours so you have these two classes of MHC you have class one and class two class one is what we call endogenous so this is basically what happens when a protein or an antigen is coming from inside the cell so let's consider the flu so if you get the flu the influen a virus infects the respiratory epithelium of your uh you know your larynx and that virus as you know folks listening might remember from our days of talking about covid viruses can't replicate on their own what they do is they hijack the replication um Machinery of the host and they use that either to insert their RNA or DNA to replicate and in the process proteins are being made well those proteins are the proteins of the virus not of us so some of those peptides get launched onto these MH class MHC class one uh glove basically the glove comes up to the surface and a te- cell comes along and in the case of MHC class one it's a cd8 t- cell these are what are called the killer te- cells right and so this cell comes along and with its t- cell receptor the te- cell receptor meets the MHC class one receptor with the antigen in it and if that's a lock it realizes that's my Target and it begins to replicate and proliferate and Target those and that creates the immune response and by the way that's how it works when you vaccinate somebody you're basically pre-building that thing up so would this fall under the Adaptive immune response or the innate immune response though this is adaptive yep innate is just the pure antibody response in the on the B cell side I won't get into that for for for the purpose of this discussion the other example is MHC class two and that's also part of the Adaptive system or the innate system which uh is more what we call the um exogenous form so these are peptides that are usually coming from outside the cell so we're going to focus more on the MHC class one because this is peptides that come from inside the cell okay so just keep in the back of your mind if a foreign protein gets presented from inside a cell to outside a cell the te- cells recognize that and they will mount a foreign response and by the way that's why we basically can beat any virus like if you consider how many viruses are around us the fact that we almost never die from a viral infection is a remarkable achievement of how well this immune system works we're constantly combating these viruses constantly and by the way we don't really have very effective antiviral agents it's not like antibiotics like we have antibiotics up to Wazoo I mean we're way better at fighting viruses than bacteria can I just one question I've always wondered about this to what is our ability to ward off viruses on a day-to basis as an adult reliant on us having been exposed to that virus during development like like as I walk around today maybe I'll be exposed to 100, different viruses would you say that half of those I've already got antibodies too because I I was exposed to them at some prior portion of my life yeah hard quantify and the other ones I'm just building up antibodies like I was on I was on a plane last night someone was coughing so I was hiding I had Co a little while ago so I wasn't too worried about that and I feel great today but you know I just assume that on that plane I'm in a swamp of viruses no matter what and that most of them I've already been exposed to since I was a little kid so I've got all the antibodies and they're just fighting it back binding up those viruses and and and destroying them yeah I think it's part that and I also think it's part of them that our body can destroy without mounting much of an immune response so therefore your immune system is doing work and it's yet it's not mounting a systemic inflammatory response that you're not sensing so is it also a physical trapping in you know in my nasal epithelium it's a virus yeah so so yeah let like there you have huge barriers right so the skin you know the hairs in your nose all of these things are huge barriers but assuming that still a bunch of them are getting in at least the respiratory ones that's the other thing to keep in mind right there are certain viruses that are totally useless floating around the air right there are certain viruses you know the viruses that most people are really afraid of you know Hep C hepb HIV well you know if they're sitting on a table or floating around the air they're of no threat to you they have to be you know sort of transmitted through the barrier um but again some of these viruses you're going to defeat without an enormous response and then some of them you know like why is influenza quote unquote such a bad virus whereas the common respiratory cold kind of Sidelines you for a day it's the immune response that you're feeling the worse the bigger the immune response to the virus the more you're feeling that you feel your immune system going crazy right you know the in lucans that are spiking the third spacing that occurs to get more and more of the immune cells there the spike of your temperature as your body basically tries to cook the virus all of that stuff is your body yeah yeah you're being drained and all this happening so um one more point I'll mention just but just to close the loop on the autoimmunity um how is it that we learn not to attack ourselves that's something called thymic selection that occurs in infancy so you and I have a no good for nothing tiny little thymus that would be it's almost impossible to see these things you know when we used to operate on people you know the thymus is barely visible in an adult in a healthy adult outside of thymic tumors but as a CH in a child the thymus is quite large and the purpose of the thymus is to educate te- cells and basically show the te- cells what self is and any te- cell that doesn't immediately recognize it gets killed so it's it's a really clever system where we basically teach you to recognize self at a very early age and if you can't do that you're weeded out and then the thymus involutes thereafter because it's sort of served its purpose okay now let's talk about cancer so what do we know about cancer so we know that again you know cancer is a genetic disease in the sense that every Cancer has genetic mutations um most of those mutations are sematic which means most of those mutations are mutations that occur during the course of our life they're not germline mutations the germline being the uh eggs and sperm right so it's all other cells and I love that you pointed out that you know there can be gen that cancer can be genetic but isn't necessarily inherited right people genetic and they think inherited right but inherited is always genetic to some extent but um genetic isn't always inherited yeah so there are a handful of cancers that are uh derived from inherited mutations so Lynch syndrome is an example of that uh hereditary polyposis is an example of that where you have a gene that gets passed through the germ line and that Gene codes for a protein like all genes do and it's either you have too much of a gene or too little of of a gene so it's either a gene that promotes cancer or and you have too much of that or it's a gene that prevents cancer and you have too little of it or a dysfunctional version of it right so braa is an example of that braa is hereditary braa codes for a protein and the the women and men but mostly the women that we think about who have a braa mutation that all in some cases almost guarantees breast cancer it's because of a defective copy so it's like they don't get the protein that they need to protect them from breast cancer so what do we know well we know that and this is probably one of the most remarkable things I've ever learned and it still blows my mind every time um well actually before I get to that point I want to make I want to make another Point okay so so you might think so cancer we we you know our cells become cancerous but they're clearly hijacked because they have these mutations and as a result of these mutations they make protein prots that allow cancers to behave differently and Cancers behave differently from non-cancer in two very critical ways the first way is that they do not respond to cell cycle signaling so if you cut your skin it heals but how does it know to heal just right and not to keep growing and growing and growing and growing and growing well it knows that because there are cell cycle signals that tell it time to grow time to stop if believe it or not this is an extreme example if you donated to me half of your liver which I know you would absolutely i' give you more than half my you give if it meant that we could keep doing these dral clubs right um within months you would regenerate a full liver that's so isn't that amazing that's so wow it's like a salamander you cut off a salamander Limb and please don't do that experiment because other people are doing it anyway and it grows back and it knows how much to grow back it's so wild so so when a cell is perfectly functioning it knows how much to grow and and it's well cancer loses that ability that is one of the Hallmarks of cancer it just keeps growing it doesn't grow faster by the way that's a misnomer people think cancers grow faster than non-cancer there's no real evidence that that's the case they just don't stop growing the second property of cancer is the capacity to leave the site of origin go someplace else and take up residence so that's metastasis that's the metastasis component so if you think about it for a minute a cell that never stops replicating and has the capacity to up and leave and move and take up residence is clearly different from the cell itself right so if I have a cell of colonic epithelium the cell that lines the inside of my colon it's clearly got a set of proteins in it but if all of a sudden that thing can grow grow grow grow grow not stop not stop not not listen to the signal and then somehow wind its way into the liver and just keep growing and growing and growing it must have different proteins so the question question then becomes why does cancer even exist how has our immune system not figured out a way to just silence this and eradicate it the way it does to virtually every virus you encounter and to me this is one of the most interesting questions in all of biology and it really comes down to how clever cancer is unfortunately how evolutionarily clever it is it basically does a lot of things to trick the immune system so it has its own secretory factors that Tamp down the immune system it grows in an environment because of its nature so one of the things that's long understood about cancer is it's heavily glycolytic and when something is heavily glycolytic it's going glucose to pyruvate to lactate nonstop there are lots of reasons for that um I think there's more than one the what does that afford it ises that a does that afford it a migratory potential no so it's super interesting so so that's the effect what I just described is called the warberg effect and when warberg proposed this uh which God was probably in the 1920s it was before World War I before World War II um he proposed it be he thought the mitochondria of cancer cells were defective so he proposed that the you know cancer cells mitochondria don't work hence they have to undergo glycolysis they can't undergo uh aerobic um uh metabolism um we now know that that's not the case so we now know that the the the warberg effect or the varberg effect if I'll refer to him correctly by his name um almost assuredly does not have to do with defective mitochondria others have proposed several mechanisms I think there's probably more than one thing going on so so so a paper that came out in 2009 very influential paper um by a guy named Matt vanderheiden and um Craig Thompson and uh Luke kley proposed that the reason that cancer cells do the warberg effect is that they're not optimizing for energy they're optimizing for cellular building blocks and if you do the mass balance it completely makes sense like dividing cells need building blocks more than energy and glycolysis while very inefficient for generating ATP is much more efficient at generating substrate to make more cells but another proposed mechanism is exactly at this one glycolysis lowers the surrounding pH because of lactate lactate attracts hydrogen pH goes down and guess what that does to the immune system detracts the immune system so it's also a way to hide from the immune system so there's a like a pH cloaking use leveraging pH to cloak the the signal that the immune system would otherwise see yep and then when you layer on top of that that it knows how to secrete things like il10 TGF beta all of these other secretory factors that also inhibit the immune system basically it's figured out a way to kind of hide itself from the immune system the way you describe it can sounds like a virus yes I mean it sounds a lot like a virus and that leads me to ask are there any examples of contagious cancers I recall seeing some studies about these little critters down in uh uh Australia Tasmanian devils that like they would uh they scratch each other in fight as Tasmanian devils do they're actually quite cute um and they would get cancers and tumors growing on their faces yes so so it and so it was it was like it was like a literal physical interaction that could transmit cancer from one animal to the next so it's less that there are viruses that cause cancer so in that sense you could argue yes there are contagious cancers well HPV sure yeah HPV hepb uh hepc uh but but there are even cancers like cutaneous cancers that arise from viruses but um I don't know if that's quite the same as what you're saying like no no it's they're both it what you're saying is an important point I mean uh we don't want to go down the the round a whole of of HPV but right that's increasing susceptibility to cervical cancer um now there's a vaccine against HPV right there wasn't when we were in college as we all knew um there was no vaccine but the um okay so but yeah direct transmission of cancers from one one organism to the next more rare yes okay so now here a moment ago I said there's this really incredible thing about cancer that blows my mind and about our immune system which is that at least 80% of solid organ tumors and we're going to mostly talk about solid organ tumors because that's where the field of oncology has made very little progress so if you go back 50 years where has oncology made huge progress it's made great progress in uh blood tumors leukemias and some kinds of lymphomas in fact there's two kinds of lymphomas where the progress has been remarkable one has been in uh Hodgkins lymphoma and the other has also been in immunotherapy has been in a type of B cell lymphoma um where that B cell demonstrates uh or presents something called a cd19 receptor so in in in B cell lymphomas with cd19 imuno there's a very unique Niche immunotherapy we won't talk about that today called car therapy that has got rid of those guys and then leukemias have also been pretty good but in solid organ tumors there have been only two real breakthroughs in the last 50 years one has been the therapy for a certain type of IC cancer um and it's really just a chemotherapy cocktail that has been found to work really well and the other has been in this really rare kind of gastric cancer called The Gist stromal tumor which happens to result from one mutation in a kise pathway and there's one drug that can now Target that and it works it's kind of amazing cures that cancer cures that what I'm talking about are the cancers that kill virtually everybody else this is what when you sort of line up what are the big causes of cancer death let's start at the top it's lung it's then breast and prostate in men and women it's coloral it's pancreas those are the big five they kill more than 50% of Americans it cancer- wise not sorry let me restate that more than 50% of cancer deaths in Americans come from those five these are what we call the solid epithelial tumors and you can March down the list and most cancers that most people are thinking of are those cancers well here's the thing more than 80% of those cancers have antigens that are recognized by the host's immune system I will state it again because it is so profound 80% at least of those cancers actually generate an antigen meaning a little peptide in that cell gets presented to the te- cell and it is recognizable and now the question is why is that not sufficient to induce remission and the short answer is there are not enough te- cells that are able to act and or they are being sufficiently inhibited from acting which gets me to the point of this paper one of the ways in which the body inhibits the immune system which we should remind ourselves is an important thing right is something called the checkpoint inhibitor okay so go back to that idea that I talked about before you have an antigen presenting cell it brings up an MHC receptor with a peptide on it and there is a t- cell that is coming and I actually brought a diagram which we're going to I'm going to link to this CU I I don't want to make this too complicated but I really think that this figure is helpful to understand how these papers uh how these drugs work so the MHC receptor with the peptide is sitting there and it binds to the T t- Cell receptor on the t- cell but there is another receptor on the t- cell a ctla4 receptor and that binds to a receptor that I won't bother naming now because it's the the the names don't matter but there's another receptor on the antigen presenting cell that binds to that and that acts as the breaks in the reaction so ctla4 which is on the t- cell binds to another CD receptor on the antigen presenting cell and it says Tamp down the response and the reason for that is we want to keep our immune system in check this basically is a way of asking the immune system because remember when the immune system sees that antigen it wants to go nuts it wants to start replicating and killing that this is a cd8 cell it is a targeted killer t- cell the checkpoint says let's double check that let's be sure let's Tamp down the response and as a result of that a thought experiment emerged which was what if we block ctla4 what if we block the checkpoint could we unleash the immune system a little bit more and I will say this at the time it was proposed it seemed a bit far-fetched um because of the complexity of the immune system it seemed a little far-fetched that simply blocking the checkpoint would have any effect it's also worth noting that prior to this one immunotherapy had found some efficacy which was trying the exact opposite strategy rather than blocking the inhibitor it was throwing more accelerant at the fire which was giving something called inter Lucin 2 so interlukin 2 is for lack of a better word candy and fuel for te- cells so the idea was if we have te- cells that innately recognize a cancer antigen can we just give high doses of interlukin 2 and have them undergo proliferation and response and the answer turned out to be yes but only in two cancers melanoma and kidney cancer and only at very small levels about 10% of the population would respond to these things now look that's 10% of people who were going to be dead within 6 months because these are devastating Cancers and once they spread there are no treatments that have any efficacy whatsoever in fact I think media and survival for metast melanom at the time was probably 4 months so this was a very Grim death sentence um but the idea now was what about doing the exact opposite approach instead of trying to throw more uh fire at the t- cell what if we can take its breaks down less gas pardon me instead of giving more gas let's give less breaks and um there were some phase two some phase one studies that demonstrated efficacy phase two and the paper I'm going to talk about today is the is the phase three uh uh U study that compared um the first version of these so so the the drug we're going to talk about today is an anti-la 4 drug called um iolab um there is another drug out there that came came along shortly thereafter that is um an anti- pd1 drug so pd1 uh turns out to be another one of these checkpoints on te- cells and the Nobel Prize by the way I think it was 2018 or 2019 in medicine or physiology was actually awarded to The two scientists who discovered ctla4 and pd1 so you know this I believe this is the only Nobel Prize in medicine for immunotherapy it's a very big deal so this study um sought to compare the effect of antict 4 to a placebo and the placebo in this case was not a real Placebo it was a peptide vaccine called GP100 um to ask the question in patients with metastatic melanoma what would be the impact on median survival and overall survival so um let's talk a little bit about the paper so again one of the funny things about this is um I used to read these papers a lot Andrew these these used to be these used to be my bread and butter papers so I I mean you know be you know reading these like I'm you know it's my hobby and and I don't read them that much anymore so it was kind of amazing how long it took me to remind myself of stuff I used to remember but you do have to kind of go back and read the methods and figure out who were the patients in this what was the eligibility criteria why did they do it this way and of course it all kind of came back to me but um it it took a minute so so so the first thing is these are all patients who um had progressed through every standard therapy so these are patients for whom there were no other options um these patients either had very Advanced stage three melanoma which means it was local Regional melanoma but it couldn't be reected so an example of that would be um a cancer that was you know completely engulfing like where let's say the primary site was the cheek and it had completely grown into all of the surrounding soft tissue it hadn't spread anywhere but it was you know all the lymph nodes of the neck um and and I've seen patients like this and it's you know it's just completely disfiguring um and they'd already been through the standard chemotherapy and nothing was working and the thing was growing and then it was mostly made up of patients with stage four cancer now melanoma has a very funny staging system so in cancer we typically talk about something called the tnm staging system it is the standard way that cancers are staged T refers to the tumor size n refers to the lymph node status and M refers to the presence or absence of metastases and for most cancers it is a very simple system it is you know T is typically a number one two sometimes up to three and four n is typically 0 1 or two and M is z or 1 either there's no Mets or there are Mets so for example in coloral cancer um the T staging determines the depth in the colon wall that it went n is did it go to Mets and I think in Colon I'm a little rusty on this I think colon has n01 or two depending on how many lymph nodes and then m0 did it go to anything beyond that like to the liver lung Etc or not melanoma is a bit more complicated it has m0 meaning no Mets but it also has M1 a m1b m1c C and m1d and within each of those it has a threshold for high and low lactate dehydrogenase or LDH so it's both a staging based on Imaging and biochemical and the reason for that is LDH level is such a strong prognostic indicator of survival in addition to M staging uh higher LDH levels tend to reflect more acidity which we talked about why that's problematic tends to reflect faster growing tumors higher turnover higher metabolic activity M1A let me see if I can remember this m1as are Cancers that have metastasized to um surrounding soft tissue or soft tissue anywhere in the body so anywhere else on the skin and you might think well that's kind of crazy like how does that happen and it's really bizarre you can have a patient who had a melanoma that showed up in one part of their body and then they have metastases on other parts of their skin m1b B is uh and I always get B and C confused I think B is the lung so m1b is to the lung m1c is to any internal organ so liver Etc and m1d is to the CNS and as those numbers increase as those letters increase the prognosis gets lower and lower and lower so one of the first things I always look at when I look at a paper like this is tell me about the patient population like what what was the um you know what was the breakdown of patients and in table one so that's again in clinical papers like this table one is always always always Baseline characteristics um oh I should mention one other thing Andrew this was done as a 3: one: one randomization so again in the simplest form a study would have two groups right you would have um we're going to just have a treatment group and a placebo group but in this arm you had three groups with one of them being the place Placebo the placebo got just GP 100 which is just a cancer vaccine by the way this is a cancer vaccine that never showed any efficacy so it was a cancer vaccine that had been tested both with interlukin 2 directly and um as an adant for patients who had metastatic melanoma or had sorry not metastatic melanoma who had melanoma reected who were tumor free and then given the vaccine as adant to see did that have an effect on outcomes and it didn't so it's kind of a known Placebo so you had that group then you had the antict 4 group and then you had antict 4 plus GP 100 yeah what's the rationale for the 3:1: one it's basically it increases statistical power right so you know this total study was a little under 700 people they put 400 in the anti-la 4 plus gp1 100 group and then you you know little over 130 in each of the other two groups so you're always going to be able to make these two comparisons right what you can check by doing this is is there any effective GP 100 in this setting which had never been done before so again GP 100 is a known protein expressed by melanoma and all of these people were haplotyped to make sure that their immune system would recognize it and the question was would giving people anti C4 I.E taking the breaks off their immune system with or without gp00 make a difference so kind of going through this you can see it sort of skews about 60% to 40% male to female they talk about something called the ecog performance status that refers to how healthy a patient is coming in so ecog zero is no limitations whatsoever which is kind of amazing when you really consider something I think this speaks to just how devastating this disease is um these are patients who all have like 6 months to live right you know a year Max and yet look at this 58 to 60% of them have no limitation on their quality of life at this very moment that's going to change dramatically um you know absent a cure here and then ecog 1 has some limitation and you can see that EOG 1 plus ecog 0 is basically 98% of the population you can see the staging there so again very very few of these patients are the m0 category zeros are people who have stage three disease that is so aggressive it can't be reected that's about 1% but the majority of these people are the m1as M1 BS M1 C's so these are people with very aggressive cancers you can also see that about 10 to 15% of these people also have CNS metastases again the poorest prognosis of the poor and then you can see the uh about 40% of them have the LDH level above above cut off all of this is to say we're talking about a group of patients who have um you know a very high likelihood of not surviving more than you know a year it would be very you know unlikely that that many of these patients would survive more than a year so so basically More than 70% of these people have visceral metastasis uh a third have high LDH and 10 more than 10% have brain Mets they've also all progressed through standard therapy so um radiation chemo yeah and the chemo for for for melanoma can be you know kind of a toxic chemo that that really just doesn't really do anything so is it common place to use a treatment that failed in clinical trials as a placebo in these sorts of studies yeah it's interesting I I think you're referring obviously to the GP 100 and I think the thing thinking was okay it hasn't been effective in other treatments for example when combined with I2 or as an adant but never before has it been tried with a checkpoint inhibitor which is the technical term for this type of drug um I think there was also some belief that it would be easier to enroll patients I don't think they stated this but that's often the case it would be easier to enroll patients if they would know that even in the placebo arm they're still getting an active agent got it and I suppose there's always the possibility that the combination of the uh failed drug with a new drug would work and then so you're increasing the probability for novel Discovery for sure and again if you go back to the randomization of 3 to one: one it's really only 1 or 20% of the participants that would get just the GP 100 so in other words you're basically telling people when they come into this study there's an 80% chance you're going to get antict 4 that's a much better set of odds than you know your typical study where you're going to be 50% likely to get the uh agent of Interest right and people who are literally dying of cancer that they W they don't want to be in the control group right that's right so the primary outcome for this study actually changed in the study now they have to get permission to do that um but the so the original primary end point was the best overall response rate so I have to explain how response rates are measured this is this is a bit complicated remember all of these patients by definition have measurable visible cancer by visible either on the surface of their body but more likely on an MRI or CT scan so all of these patients had to be scanned head totoe within 12 weeks of enrollment um again there's another thing I should point out here which I know you understand but it's always worth finding people when a study like this takes place it usually takes place over many years and so it's not the case that all 700 of these patients were enrolled on the same day and finished you know we finished observing them on the same day no no no this took place for a very long period of time this took place across tens of centers uh I can't remember if this was just globally or across the world it might have been across the world um and so every Center really needs to adhere to a very strict protocol and you have a central organiz ation that is running this so you have a drug company I think this is brist Bristol Meers squib that makes the drug they provide the drug and then you have a cro a clinical research organization that that is basically managing the trial and the trial is being done at Cancer Centers all over the world or all over the country and you know enrollment I think began in 2008 for this no no I think it completed in 2008 it probably started in about 2004 2005 and and therefore you had to kind of have real clear protocols around this so a complete response is the easier of these to understand a complete response is everything vanishes completely that's very rare in cancer therapy so instead what we kind of look for is a partial response a partial response and there is really different ways to Define this there are different criteria but this is the most common way you define a partial response a partial response is at least a 50% reduction by diameter because remember in this type Imaging you're looking at 2D versus 3D so if you're looking at a lung lesion and it's this big it you know if it's 2 centimeters long it has to go to at least 1 centimeter in diameter so it's a 50% reduction at least of every single lesion with no new lesions appearing and no lesions growing so it's very strict criteria right again CR means everything vanishes PR means at least a 50% by diameter which by the way is a much bigger diameter much bigger reduction in terms of tumor volume when you consider the linear versus the third power relationship of length and volume of every single lesion with nothing new appearing regardless of how small and no lesion growing so that's a PR so you basically have no response progression we talk about those together and then partial response and complete response so initially the the authors of this study were going to the primary end point of this was going to be the best overall response rate so what was the proportion of patients that hit PR what was the proportion that hit a CR um that's very common in this type of paper where the outcomes are typically so dire um however uh oh I think I said I think I said that the study was um I I don't remember when the study ended but the amendment was made to change the primary endpoint to overall survival um at some point during the study so and by the way that tends to be the metric everybody cares most about so the overall survival for metastatic melanoma is zero um with the exception of people who respond to interlukin 2 high do interlukin 2 and that will boost the overall survival rate to somewhere between 8 and 10% very very low these patients many of whom had already taken and progressed through interlukin 2 Let me refresh my memory on what percentage of those patients about a quarter of these patients had already taken high dose interlukin 2 and by definition the fact that they're in this study means they had already progressed through that that treatment had failed just reiterate um just kind of the state these patients are in so now let's look at figure one so again I'll describe it because I realize many people are just listening to us all of this will be available both in the video and then we'll link to the paper so figure one is a a figure that probably looks really familiar to people who look at you know any data that deal with survival it's called a Kaplan Meyer survival curve so on the xaxis for this curve is time and time here is shown in months and on the Y AIS is the overall survival at the very top 100% at the bottom 0% and it has three graphs or three curves that are superimposed on one another for each of the three groups again the control group which is the GP 100 the um anti-la 4 Group by itself and the ntla 4 plus GP 100 and one of the characteristics of a Kaplan Meyer curve is by definition they have to be decreasing in a monotonic fashion because it's cumulative overall survival that just means it can't like come down and go back up nobody comes back to life so once a person dies they are censored from the study and the curve drops and drops and drops and you can see that they kind of highlight and I actually think it makes the graph a little harder to read when they when they put some of those marks on there but what really becomes clear when you look at this is is that there's a key there's a clear distinction between the curve for the placebo group the gp00 group and the other two the two treatment groups now you'll note at the very end that the two treatment groups appear to separate a little bit I'll talk about that in a second so when I look at these Andrew I the first thing I always turned my attention to I can't resist I have to look at the right hand side of the graph cuz what is that really telling me right that the tale of this is showing me the true overall survival and I want to sort of figure out what is going on so in the GP 100 Group which is the placebo group it is kind of amazing to think that there is still one person who is alive at 44 months it's it's amazing I mean it's both sobering and amazing that like one person made it to 44 months um the next thing I ask myself is well how long did half of the people make it that's called median survival and to do that you go up to the Y AIS and you draw a little line from the 50 over and then you bring that down and and that's you know that's that's that's awfully low that's about yeah in fact the table will tell us exactly what that is because I think it's really hard to eyeball that stuff so let's go to so there's always a table that will accompany these things and let's pull up that table I've got this paper spread out over so many things let's Adverse Events where's our survival table here figure two subgroup analysis of overall survival it would probably be helpful if I stapled these things together because it would be EAS well this is always a trade-off actually for since this is a journal Club episode I I will say that stapling helps but it also prevents one from separating things out writing in the margin I like these little mini clips no Financial relationship to the mini clips either um just have to state that cuz I always get if you don't say that people go oh you must have a steak in these mini clips I like these little mini clips in fact I'm such a nerd I always have one of these uh pilot V5 v7s in my Pock on my pocket of my hip and then my pockets are always filled with um with these little mini clips and um but then again I have a friend who's a musician he's and he's always reigning guitar picks so you know it's an as far as occupational hazards go of being a nerd I'm a big fan of the mini clip as well but I I went without it today all right so thank you yes table two all right so so let's look at table two while looking at the Kaplan Meer curve because now this allows us to see a couple things by the way remember how I said there's like that one person who kind of is still alive in the treatment group well you can tell that he's not a complete responder he or she is not a complete responder because um under evaluation of therapy in table two it says best overall response and it says complete responders zero so there was Zero complete responders in the placebo there were two partial responders again a partial responder is um some lesions got smaller some got bigger stable disease is it didn't really change that much and Progressive disease is obviously it went beyond not when you say partial response like lesions got smaller are they literally just tracing the the circumference of one of these you know skin lesions and saying okay got bigger smaller you literally we' had rulers iny yep yep feels this feels so crude in terms of like like I mean it makes total sense but like in terms of like modern medicine oh like your lesion Grew From like 3 millimeters to 6 millim and that we literally like drawing little boundaries around little blotches on the skin yeah you're you're putting a little measuring tape on them now again most of these are happening in the Radiology Suite because most of the disease for these patients is inside the body body remember More than 70% of these patients had visceral metastases so liver soft tissue uh lung brain you know these are in fact if you include lung liver brain and viscera it's it's all the pretty much all the patients so most of this is looking at a CT scan or an MRI for the brain got it um okay so that's that's kind of the first thing that comes up the median response rate should should be shown pretty prominently here so I'm looking through through this and where is median response maybe it's shown in a different table uh let's see not Disease Control rate time to [Music] progression I remember it's about 10 months but maybe that's just in the text yeah here it is so I thought this would be in a table but it's uh it's on page 75 of the paper it just reports it so and I'm sorry I misspoke um the 10 months was for the antict 4 plus gp00 and 6.4 months for the GP100 alone that's the control and then 10.1 for the ntla 4 alone okay so again I always and again I'm just always doing this I'm kind of going back to the paper to be like does that make sense and yeah you kind of called it right you said median survival was about eight well it turns out it's actually like six and change because cuz it has that little ding in it and it's out to a little past 10 on the two others so the net takeaway here is again just to put that in English because it's so profound 50% of the patients in the control group were dead in 6 months 50% of the patients in the treatment group both treatment groups were dead in 10 months so what that means in cancer speak is these drugs extended median Survival by four months now that's a that's an important concept you know when we think about how has cancer therapy changed over the past 50 years median survival for metastatic cancer has increased across the board so a person today with metastatic coloral cancer or woman today with metastatic breast cancer or a person with metastatic lung cancer these people will live longer with those diseases today thanks mostly to treatments this is not an early detection lead time bias issue this is treatments are allowing people to live longer and that's an important part of the story but it's only half of the story yet it often gets touted as the story the other half of the story and frankly the story that I think is more important is what is overall survival doing and if you go back to those answers the answer is zero so overall survival hasn't changed for solid epithelial tumors it is it was 0% in 1970 and it's 0% today everyone dies everyone dies from metastatic solid organ tumors now again there's those there's those Niche examples I gave you testicular cancer is now an exception um gomal tumors would be an exception and I'm not including leukemia and lymph FAS where now there are exceptions okay within not to try and be overly optimistic but if I look at the graph in figure one and I look out at the tail of the graph that's right um and for those that are just listening what I see and and I'm far less far less familiar with this type of work and this analyzing these type of data but what I see is that people in the placebo group They're All Dead except that one Yep they're basically all dead at 44 months y but when I look at the number how long it takes for everyone to be dead in the true treatment groups it's like 50 looks like 53 54 months or so well and they're and they're not dead that's the point they're hanging in there right so because you know an extra somebody who um lost both of my uh scientific advisers two of the three the other one to Suicide we've talked about this before but the other uh two to different cancer both had the bracka 2 mutation by the way um you know an extra 8 to 10 months with your kids or with your spouse or to quote unquote get your Affairs in order is is a big deal I mean it's still depressing in the sense that nobody survives long term but um you know an extra 10 months as long as one is not miserable in that time completely miserable um I mean that's e extra 10 months of living right well and and what's interesting here is you know the observation period stops and some of these patients are still going so what you're highlighting is kind of the point I want to make which is overall survival is the most important metric and it's the highest bar make no mistake about it and it's certainly not the bar any drug company is ever going to want to talk about for a cancer drug but why not because because they don't none of them work right like we don't have you know like drug they only want to talk about cures they don't want to talk they only want to talk about media and survival they want they only want to talk about extending media in survival and you know there are you know lots of people out there that are on this on this platform I don't need to get on to it but who will say like look it's a real racket in in oncology today where drugs that are extending median Survival by four weeks are being put on the market at a tune of you know $50 to $100,000 per treatment that's not uncommon in oncology uh there was one drug that was approved for pancreatic cancer I believe it extended median Survival by days and it cost $40,000 and it's being advertised as significant extens because it was that was a statistical significant Improvement in media and survival I'm just yeah so it's look it's really understandable why people are very skeptical of the Pharma industry and and I think you know a much more nuanced view is necessary clearly I don't think Pharma is all bad um but I really understand why people lose faith in Pharma when when you know these types of products somehow make regulatory approval does insurance cover these kinds of drugs uh it can in fact it often does it depends on the FDA approval of course and the indication um but a lot of times they do right so yeah there's a societal cost to these things um but but there's also a patient cost right so a lot of times insurance doesn't fully cover it and a patient has to Bear the the cost difference and on top of that you alluded to this a second ago which is what if your quality of life is dramatically compromised as a result of this treatment and yes statistically you're going to live 9 days longer or 3 weeks longer but at what cost to your health in those final remaining days and by the way you're potentially straddling your loved ones with enormous debt uh in your absence so it's it's a super complicated topic yeah there's a dignity component too I mean I've seen this in people dying you know at some point they become such a a diminished version of their former selves that they don't want to be seen by people that way so what is exciting about this drug although it's this paper is not the one that shows it the reason I chose this paper Andrew is because it was the first approval a second drug came along that is an anti- pd1 drug that drug is called Kuda that drug turned out to be even better and had has even a greater response rate both in terms of median survival and overall survival but this was the landmark paper I also have slight bias here and I'll disclose in a moment why um but I but I think it just talks about very interesting biology so let's talk about a couple things that stuck stuck out to me in this paper um the first thing that stuck out to me and the authors didn't comment on it unless they did and I missed it is look at figure two so figure two is the um subgroup analyses where you're sort of showing a similar graph to the one you showed earlier right where you you show the response rate or the change in response between the groups and then you put the error bars on it and this is where we talk about how well it's a 95% confidence interval so does it touch the unity line so these are called like tornado plots typically and um what you'll notice is that in the top you're looking at um um sort of uh it's it's comparing the antict 4 with GP100 versus the gp1 100 and in the bottom you're looking at the anti ca4 versus the GP 100 so at a glance you can see GP 100 is not doing anything I mean that's the that's the first takeaway of comparing A to B um what I find most interesting is look at the subgroup analysis of females notice that in females while there's a trend towards risk reduction and this is risk reduction for overall mortality so again I just want to restate that the primary outcome of this trial was changed to overall survival which I think is the better outcome by the way and overall for all patients in when you compare antict 4 plus Placebo versus placebo there was a 31% risk reduction in overall mortality that's what that's that's the mathematical interpretation of what you're seeing at the tail end of that Kaplan Meyer curve longer living longer and it's a it sounds like a big difference and in some some sense it is a big difference it is for those people because you're really looking at basically 0% surviving in the placebo group versus 20% of people are still alive at 56 months in the treatment group but look that means 80% have died right um but notice that and and and and sori when you just look at the antict a 4 plus GP 100 in the subgroup B that Hazard ratio is even showing more compression it's a 36% reduction in risk of death um but notice that the females did not reach significance so in the in the first group they barely do and you can see that because the confidence interval runs from 0.55 to 0.92 and notice the error bar almost touches the line and in the second one it does not reach significance at all so I actually went and kind of did a little reading on this after and I said hey you know how much did this study was this an outlier study and it turned out it wasn't um and that about half the studies of antict 4 did indeed find that the drug was less effective in women than men which I found interesting now I couldn't find any great explanation for it but the most plausible explanations fit into two categories the first are maybe there are differences in the immune response to the drug if you're a man or a woman the second uh comes down to dosing I should have said this at the outset but of course these drugs are not like a pill where it's like everybody gets you know 50 milligrams of this they're all dosed based on weight so this study is dosed I believe at 3 milligrams per kilogram and because most men are heavier than women men are getting a higher dose than women and weight and body surface area an immune system like these things are not all perfectly linear so I I I kind of wonder if this difference is simply explained by men on average getting a higher dose than women interesting last thing I want to talk about here is in table three so Table Three always an important table to look at in any paper is what are the adverse outcomes right what are the adverse effects of the drug yeah I spent some I spent a little bit of time with this and I I confess it it you know I definitely don't want cancer to the extent that I can avoid it but this table made me wonder whether or not I would also want to just avoid cancer treatment given the life extension provided I mean these Adverse Events are pretty uncomfortable they sound just to put just to put in perspective um and you always have to kind of you know be mindful of how many of these adverse events are occurring in people just because their disease is progressing so the first thing I always want to look at is total Adverse Events in all three groups not just grade so grade three and grade four are real toxicities right grade four toxicity is life-threatening toxicity by the way uh grade three is pretty significant toxicity grade one and two we typically just you know that's not that severe right the little rash put some cortico steroids on it it went away kind of thing okay so in the uh treatment plus GP 100 group 98 8.4% of people reported some event so all but 1.6% in the ntct 4 group alone it was 96.7% so only 3.1% did not but in the placebo group it's 97% so it's important to keep in mind like you know everybody's having some adverse effect okay well what if you say well let's just limit it to the most severe events well let's just talk about grade four toxicities there were 6.1% of those in the placebo group 8.4% in the anti ca4 group and 6.8% in the combined group so not a huge difference in grade four toxicity meaning that whatever adverse events are occurring may not be related to they may not be related to the treatment the again these are if you if you think about it and it's a very awful sad morbid thought to imagine these are you're looking at the adverse responses of people more than 80% of whom died during the course of a very very short study and so you know it's very difficult to disentangle what effects or what side effects a person is having just from that process uh as they are from the actual treatment but if there is an area where there's a really clear difference it's down in the autoimmune category so if you look at any immune related events you can see that in the anti C4 plus gp1 100 group it's about 60% in both of those treatment groups versus 30% and if you look at the grade three and four toxicities it's 10% in the uh antict 4 15% in the um antict 4 alone group and only 3% in the treatment so that's a real difference well it makes sense that people getting this drug plus Placebo or just the drug would have autoimmune issues because this is an immunotherapy it's an immunomodulator in fact what is it doing it is taking the breakes off the immune system but then again the things that they list out puitis is that a irritation of the skin yeah irritation of the skin I'm not a physician but I know that any itis is going to be like an inflammation and unfortunately likely a cancer or cell replication look at the difference in viigo I mean um wow yeah so very or sorry sorry look at the gastro intestinal differences yeah and the Vitiligo right so 3.7% 2.3% 8% the GI stuff is the most common stuff you're going to see there those are those are the really big ones now and of course there's diarrhea and there's diarrhea oh like there's traveler diarrhea there's overly spicy large me4 diarrhea and then there's like can't really do anything besides make trips back and forth to the bathroom di well there's there's there's put it this way there's you know colitis here is diarrhea so significant these patients require ire IV fluids now what what you don't see here is how many of these patients actually required corticosteroids to reverse the autoimmunity so a lot of times what will happen here in these studies or with these drugs is the autoimmunity becomes so significant that you have to stop the drug and give cortico steroids do the exact opposite you now have to shut the immune system down so you just took the brakes off it with the drug and now you need to shut it down with corticosteroids um when I was was I in med school no when I was in my uh Fellowship um I wrote a paper about um autoimmunity correlating with response rate in ncta 4 uh early on this was during the phase two work so you so the NCI was a very early um uh uh adopter of U participating in these trials and um you know it was observed that or at least hypothesize this is what the paper basically wrote about which was is there any correlation between autoimmunity and response um and it turned out the answer was yes there was a very strong correlation so there was no difference in autoimmunity between the doses and the so the paper we wrote was two dosing schedules so it was basically the full dose the three milligrams per kilogram versus a low dose 1 milligram per kilogram this is a phase two trial those are your two arms they're turned out to no difference in autoimmunity between them but there was a big difference between um uh the response rate that tied to autoimmunity in other words autoimmunity predicted response now I think over time these U investigators the doctors who administer these treatments are getting better and better at catching these things earlier because these autoimmune conditions uh can actually be devastating so on a very personal note when k truda uh came out I want to say it was around 200 11 no no no gosh it must have been 2013 2014 thereabouts um again it was for treatment of metastatic melanoma I want to come back and explain why melanoma gets all of the attention in autoimmune condition in in um um immunotherapy conditions I'll state that but um but anyway a friend of mine got pancreatic cancer and he got um the bad type of pancreatic cancer so this is uh an like the um um adenocarcinoma in the pancreas right so this this is a a non-survivable type of cancer furthermore his was unresectable so can you explain what that is yeah so the only so about 20% of people who have pancreatic cancer technically have it in a way where you could still take out the head of the pancreas right the Whipple procedure the Whipple procedure um now tragically most of those patients will still recur my understanding it is that pancreatic cancer progresses from anterior to posterior in the pancreas and that the Whipple is a removal of the front end the anterior that's the Whipple procedure so if the cancer has progressed far enough coddle into the posterior uh pancreas then there's nothing left to cut out basically um can we survive without a pancreas for any amount of time oh yeah absolutely so why don't they just remove the whole pancreas oh that's my point it's already microm metastized so it's not the the surgical procedure is not the challenge anymore it used to be so you know at John's Hopkins which is one of the hospitals where this was pioneered like the the 30-day mortality for a Whipple procedure was I don't know 80% and the reason was to figure out how to suture a pancreas to the bowel without the so so the pancreas is such an awful organ to operate on because its enzyme are designed to digest anything and everything so imagine now you have to cut the pancreas in half take out the head of the pancreas with the duodenum and then somehow sew that open half of a raw pancreas to the end of the junam and not let it digest itself someone at Hopkins figure this out um now the first one was actually done by AO Whipple but yes at Hopkins is where they figured out the way to put drains in the surgical technique how to do it in two layers what type of stitches to use like all of the nuances of this were worked out in a few places but I would say Hopkins more than any place else and are there Physicians who like try this on non-human primates or something or is this always just done on patients and you well nowadays I mean put it this way even 25 years ago at a at a at a major Center like Hopkins the the mortality of that procedure was less than 1% amazing yeah have been some vict well yes but here's my point it that that's no longer the bottleneck right taking out the pancreas safely as complicated and challenging as that is and if you need a whip procedure you only want to have it done by someone who just does that night and day because it's you don't want Weekend Warriors doing it um that's not why people are living or dying they're dying because the pan the cancer just comes back it was already spread to the liver by the time you did it you just didn't realize it yet so whether you took out the whole pancreas or the head of the pancreas or the tail of the pancreas the location of the tumor is predictive of survival only in the extent that it basically is a window into how soon did symptoms occur so pancreatic cancers in the tail tend to be more fatal even though they're way easier surgically to take out because by the time you develop symptoms of a tail pancreas cancer it's it's a big cancer so I was going to ask this question lat later but I'll just ask it now given the link between the immune system and these cancers is there an idea in mind that people who are let's say 40 and older or 50 and older who don't yet they're not diagnosed with any cancer would periodically just stimulate their immune system to wipe out whatever early cancers might be cropping up you know just take a drug to just ramp up the immune system even to the point where you're start having a little diarrhea maybe a few skin rashes and then come off the drug you know just basically to to fight back whatever little cell growths are starting to take place in skin or liver you know maybe for you know three weeks out of each year I mean why not yeah that's an interesting question um I've never thought of it through that lens I suppose the question is what can we do to keep our immune systems as healthy as possible as we age because stay on a normal circadian schedule there's evidence for that sure no there's evidence that certainly if it promotes sleep anything that promotes better rest is going to promote immune Health um because if you ask the macro question which is like why does the prevalence of cancer increase so dramatically with age um there are certain diseases where it's really obvious why the prevalence of the disease increases with age yeah like mac like uh age related macular degeneration sure or cardiovascular disease is by far the most obvious because it's an area under the curve exposure problem the more exposure to lipoproteins and the more the endothelium gets damaged the more likely you are to accumulate plaque and again it totally makes sense why 10year olds don't have heart attacks and 80y olds do but when you sort of acknowledge that well hey you know can't you know anybody's Accu accumulating genetic mutations we're always surrounded and being bombarded by things that are altering the Genome of our cell is it simply a stochastic process where the longer you live the more of these mutations are going to occur until at some point one of them just wins I I I think that's got to be a big part of it but I think another part of it and I clearly I'm not alone in thinking this is that our immune system is getting weaker and weaker as we age right I mean you know we you know people become more susceptible to infections as they get older uh and I think that that's equally playing a role in our susceptibility to cancer so yeah I think the question is how do you modulate immunity um as you age and to me that's one of the most interesting things about rapy potentially is that when taken the right way it seems to enhance um cellular immunity which again that that's potentially a really big deal again at least in in short-term human experiments in response to vaccination it's enhancing vaccine response so the question is would that translate into cancer nobody knows could that be one of the reasons why animals treated with rap ayin live longer and get less cancer don't know you know it could also be that it's it's at a fundamental level that's targeting nutrient sensing um where I was going with that story was that and maybe I'll back up for a moment why melanoma so we didn't really know this like 30 40 years ago in the early days of immunotherapy but what we know now is that most cancers probably have about 40 mutations in them that's like ballpark 4050 mutations is standard fair for a cancer but melanoma happens to be one of the cancers that has many many more mutations and the more mutations a cancer has the more likelihood that it will produce an antigen that's recognized as non-self and that's why in the early days of immunotherapy the only things that worked were I2 against metastatic melanoma and kidney cancer because kidney cancer turned out to also be one of those cancers that for reasons that are not clear produced hundreds of mutations and so it's no surprise that the early studies of checkpoint Inhibitors were also done in metastatic melanoma where you basically have more shots on goal again if I'm going to take the breaks off my immune system I might as well do it in an environment where there are more chances for my tea cells to find something to go nuts against so it's 2013 2014 and this friend of mine who has something called Lynch syndrome um which is a one of those few hereditary or germline mutations that results in a huge increase in the risk of cancer he had already had colon cancer at about the age of 40 um and had survived that it was a stage three cancer but he had survived it well now five years later had developed uh pancreatic cancer and when he went to see the surgeon um they said said yeah we there's nothing we can do like it's too advanced so that's you know to put that in perspective that is a death sentence and that's not uh that that's a that's a six-month survival and at around that time there was a study that had come out in the New England Journal of Medicine that had talked about how patients with Lynch syndrome had lots of mutations and so we you know talked with his doctors about the possibility of enrolling him in one of the Kuda trials there was one going on I think at Stanford and you know the thinking being well you know you would want to Target a checkpoint inhibitor against somebody who has a lot of mutations and even though typically we don't see that in pancreatic cancer his is a unique variant of it because it's based on this and so sure enough he was tested for these mismatch repair genes he had them enrolled in the trial and amazingly had not only a complete regression of his cancer and he's still alive in cancer free today 10 years later but this the the the treatment worked so well at activating his immune system that his immune system completely destroyed his pancreas so now he is effectively had a pancreatectomy based on his immune system so now he actually has Type 1 diabetes he has no pancreas he injects insulin to deal with that or no he no no he has to use insulin just like someone with type di he had to pick being alive with type one diabetes yeah of course no comparison but it's just an interesting example of how you know remarkable this treatment was able to work when you were you know you could completely unleash the immune system of a person and you eradicate the cancer and the rest of the cells around it and and you know there are many organs we could live without um you know there are certain organs you can't live without you can't live without your heart lungs liver kidneys um but but many things that kill people arise from organs the breast you could live without all breast tissue prostate prostate you could live without all prostate tiue would choose to do to live without these but right but I'm saying if you if if you had metastatic cancer and you had a bullet that could selectively Target a tissue you would take it and right now the only tissue we can do that against is a cd19 B cell and that's what those car T cells are so right now these are not tissue specific treatments but they're mutation specific what the last thing I'll say about this paper that I found interesting and I I was looking for it and I was surprised they didn't at all comment on if there was any correlation between autoimmunity and response um so they obviously acknowledge the autoimmunity in in table three but I would have loved to have seen a statistical analysis that said hey is there any correlation between response rate and autoimmunity but um they they didn't comment to that effect so we're left kind of wondering what the current state of that is and I guess in summary I'll say that the reason I thought this was an interesting paper to present is that I still believe that immuno theapy is probably the most important hope we have for treating cancer and well I think we're still only scratching the surface of it so collectively the overall survival increase for patients with metastatic solid organ tumors is about 8% better than it was 50 years ago and virtu all of that has come from some form of immunotherapy um I think is promising and I think the Holy Grail is the meaning the next step if you go back to where we started the discussion is coming up with ways to engineer te- cells to be even better recognizers of antigens and there's many ways to do that one is to directly engineer them another is to find te- cells that have already migrated into tumors those are called tumor infiltrating lymphocytes or till and expanding those and Engineering them to be better and younger is it possible to engineer our own te- cells to be more pH variant tolerant meaning um since this you know cloaking of the of a local area by changing the pH can could we you know pull some te- cells I'm I'm always thinking about the inoculation stuff like pull some te- cells as part of our standard exam when we're 30 and um you know and grow some up in an environment that the pH is is slightly more acidic than um than normal and then reintroduce them to the body I mean after all they are our tea cells um in other words give them a little opportunity to evolve the the conditions they can thrive in right or even just keep them in the freezer in case we need them yes so so the interesting thing is I don't know that if you just got them to be comfortable in a lower p pH it would be sufficient because there are still so many other things that the uh cancer is doing as far as using other secreting factors um it seems that by far the most potent thing comes down to expanding the number of te- cells that recognize the antigen and making sure that you can get that number big enough without aging them too much so in some senses it has become a long longevity problem of te- cells the way to think about it is you want an army of soldiers who are wise enough to recognize the bad guys which comes with age but young enough to go and kill and right now both extremes seem to be unhelpful right when you go and find tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in a tumor they're very wise they know which one they've demonstrated that they can do everything they can outmaneuver the cancer but they're too old to do anything about it and when you take them out to try to expand them by three logs which is typically what you need to do expand them by a thousandfold they can't do anything got it and what about avoiding melanoma altogether I mean obviously avoiding sunburn you know I somehow I got couched as anti-s sunscreen and that is absolutely not true I I said some sunscreens contain things that are clearly immune disrupt uh endocrine excuse me disruptors and we're going to do a whole episode on sunscreen maybe we could do some Journal I'm actually planning something on that as well I want and some dermatologists reached out um some very very skilled dermatologists reached out and said that indeed some sunscreens are are downright dangerous but of course melanoma is super dangerous um physical barrier no one disputes physical barriers for sunscreen like everyone everyone agrees that that is unlikely to have endrine disruption um so physical barriers are Undisputed but aside from limiting U sunlight exposure to the skin um what are some other risks for melanoma I mean I think that's the biggest one I do not believe that smoking poses a risk for melanoma and if it does it's going to be very small um there are hereditary cases so one needs to be pretty mindful when taking a family history and by the way there are really weird genetic um conditions that link melanoma to other cancers such as pancreatic cancer by the way so whenever I'm taking somebody's family history and I hear about somebody that had melanoma and someone that had pancreatic cancer I'm there's a couple genetics genetic tests we'll look at to to see if that's a person that's particularly sensitive just and a from a genetic predisposition um but I do think that first and foremost it's and by the way I think with melanoma the although it's not completely agreed upon I think it's less about sun exposure and more about sunburn right so so and again I'm sure there's somebody listening to this who will chime in and apply a more nuanced response to that um but but I think there's a there's a fundamental difference between I'm out in the sun getting Sun making some vitamin D versus I'm getting scorched and un you know undergoing significant UV damage there might also be something to be said for the time in one's life and i' I've certainly seen things that suggest that early you know early repeated sunburns would be more of a risk um so look I I think that's not a controversial point in the sense that like who wants to be sunburned right so it's like whatever one needs to do to be sunburned whether it's you know you know being mindful of what the UV index is wearing the appropriate cover wearing the appropriate sunscreen um I also find the whole uh kind of anti-s sunscreen establishment to be a little bit odd well the anti sunscreen establishment is odd you know I'm trying to open the door for a Nuance discussion about you know the fact that some sunscreens really do contain things like oxy benzines and things that are real and you're spraying them on kids you just look at the straight you know the good oldfashioned mineral sunscreens um perfectly safe yeah yeah as far as we know I mean I I also uh dare we uh cross the seed oil debate into this some of the folks who are really anti- seed oil also claim that seed oils increase risk for sunscreen uh Peter and I are smiling because we we have teed up uh a debate soon with some you know anti-ed oil and less anti-ed oil um experts so that that's forthcoming that's going to be a fun one we'll be doing all of that with our shirts on I really appreciate you um walking us through this paper Peter I've never looked at a paper on cancer um and certainly not one like this um I learned a lot and um it's such an interesting field obviously because of the importance of getting people with cancer to survive longer and Lead better lives but also um because of the the interaction with the immune system so we learned some really important immun ol yeah and this was this was great I uh I I feel much more confident now in the uh belief that the the exposure to light early and late in the day can actually have have benefits and I and as I said I think that there's I think there's there's some causality here and I think it shouldn't be ignored cool well this was our second Journal Club I look forward to our third next time you'll go first we'll just keep alternating and we've also switched venues but um we both wore the the correct shirt uh and um I hope uh people are learning um and not just learning the information but learning how to parse and

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Shawn Mackey Dr Shawn Mackey is a medical doctor that is he treats patients as well as a PhD meaning he runs a laboratory he is the chief of the division of pain medicine and a professor of both anesthesiology and neurology at Stanford University School of Medicine today we discuss what is pain most of us are familiar with the notion of pain from having a physical injury or some sort of chronic pain or a headache today Dr Macky makes clear what the origins of pain are both in the nervous system and outside the nervous system that is the interactions between the brain and the body that give rise to this thing that we call pain indeed we discussed the critical link between physical pain and emotional pain and how altering one's perception of emotional or physical pain can often change the other we also discuss some of the changes in the nervous system that occur when we experience pain and how that can give rise to chronic pain we also of course cover different methods to reduce pain safely and those methods include behavioral tools psychological tools nutrition supplementation and of course prescription drugs we discussed the intimate relationship between temperature that is heat and cold and pain pain and Pain Relief so if you're interested in the use of heat or cold to modulate pain that conversation ought to be of interest as well we also touch on some highly controversial topics such as opioids opioids are a substance that your body naturally makes but of course many people are familiar with exogenous opioids that is opioids that are available as drugs and the so-called opioid crisis Dr Mai makes very clear which specific clinical circumstances weren't the use of exogenous opioids with of course a warning about their potent addictive potential and we get into a bit of discussion about where the opioid crisis and the use of opioid drugs to control pain is and is going before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Aeropress Aeropress is similar to a French press for making coffee but is in fact a much better way to make coffee the Aero press was developed by Allan Adler who's an engineer at Stanford I knew of Allen because I used to see him in my hometown of paloalto test flying the so-called aobi frisbee so he was sort of famous around my town as This brilliant engineer that would create these unusual products so when I heard about the AO press I got it I tried it and I absolutely loved it because it does indeed create the best tasting cup of coffee or loose leaf tea with arero press you can brew an incredible tasting coffee or tea and clean up the whole process in less than 2 minutes the key thing to know about the Arrow Press is that it's not just some trivial variation on the French press that shortened Brewing time that the Aero press uses really changes the flavor of your cup of coffee or tea it makes it exceptionally smooth if you'd like to try Aero press you can go to Aero press.com huberman that's a r o p r s.com / huberman to get 20% off any Aeropress coffee maker Aeropress ships anywhere in the USA Canada and over 60 other countries around the world again that's Aeropress docomond to get 20% off today's episode is also brought To Us by levels levels is a program that lets you see how different foods and activities impacts your blood glucose levels using a continuous glucose monitor one of the most important factors impacting your energy levels as well as your immediate and long-term Health are your blood glucose levels sometimes referred to as your blood sugar levels to maintain mental and physical energy and focus you want your blood glucose levels to be relatively stable throughout the day levels makes it extremely easy to determine how specific foods and food combinations meal timing exercise and sleep work alone and in combination to impact your blood glucose levels I started using levels about two years ago and find it to be immensely beneficial it's helping me better arrange what I eat when I eat when to exercise and my sleep pattern so if you're interested in learning more about levels and trying a CGM yourself go to levels. l/ huberman levels has launched a new CGM sensor that is smaller and has even better tracking than the previous versions right now they are also offering an additional two free months of membership again that's levels. linkl nk/ huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by betterhelp betterhelp offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out online I've been going to therapy for well over 30 years initially I didn't have a choice it was a condition of being allowed to stay in school but pretty soon I realize that therapy is extremely valuable in fact I consider doing regular therapy just as important as getting regular exercise including cardiovascular exercise and resistance training which of course I also do every week the reason I know therapy is so valuable is that if you can find a therapist with whom you can develop a really good rapport you not only get terrific support for some of the challenges in your life but you also can derive tremendous insights from that therapy insights that can allow you to better not just your emotional life and your relationship life but of of course also the relationship to yourself and to your professional life to all sorts of career goals in fact IC therapy is one of the key components for meshing together all aspects of one's life and being able to really direct one's focus and attention toward what really matters with better help they make it extremely easy to find a therapist that's ideal for your needs your life circumstances and that can match to to your schedule in a very convenient way if you'd like to try betterhelp go to betterhelp.com huberman to get 10%

colleagues at Stanford and I'm familiar with your work but today we're going to take a pretty Broad and deep survey of this thing called pain so I'll just start off very simply and ask what is pain pain is this complex and subjective experience that serves a crucial role for all of us to keep us away from injury or harm it is both a sensory and an emotional experience and I think that gets lost on people that includes this emotional component to it and it is incredibly individual and we'll get more into that hopefully as time goes by that you know your pain is different from my pain and is different from everybody else's it takes an incredible toll on society when it goes chronic when it becomes persistent to the tune of about a 100 million Americans and at last count about a half a trillion dollars a year in medical expenses uh so an astounding problem we're facing in society and one that's only getting worse and I'm hoping during the course of this discussion that we can kind of break down a little bit of the foundation of pain and kind of build it back up because unfortunately uh in society there's a lot of misunderstanding about what pain is and I think uh hopefully we can build that foundation and then layer on some some useful treatments and useful options for people I'm glad you pointed out this link between the sensory and the emotional experience every once in a while I'll pull something I'll have like you know like a kink in my neck or my back and fortunately for me it resolves pretty quickly but I notice that when I'm experiencing that kind of pain that I become slightly more irritable perhaps much more irritable depending on who you ask and that everything becomes more challenging thinking is harder sleeping is harder concentrating on anything besides pain it's it's a um it's as if something's nagging from the inside and so that raises the the next question that I have which is is pain something that's in our brain in our body or both it's clearly in our brain and can I take a moment to kind of lay a little foundation for some of that to help clear up some of the mystery of pain we know that pain most pain all starts with some stimulus whether it be that kink in your neck or your shoulder from working out or turning the wrong way and what's going on there uh in your body is not pain what's going on is that uh there are sensors in our skin our soft tissue our deep tissues called noors and these noors are sensing elements and they sense different types of stimuli they can sense temperature uh heat cold they sense pressure they can sense pH changes due to for instance inflammation that may occur from uh any something going on in your neck or your shoulder those sens signals up nerve fiber types and the two that we we refer to are a Delta and C fibers one transmits very fast it's responsible that you know sharp jolt of pain that goes to your brain when we uh you know step on a tack or put our hand on a hot stove and there's another fiber called a c fiber which is much slower and responsible for that dull achy pain now these signals they go to the spinal cord lie up and down our uh from our head down to our our back and they're they're shaped they're changed a little bit they then are sent up to the brain and it's once they hit the brain and they converge with this Magical Mystery set of nerves in the brain that it becomes the experience of pain and if there's one key message I'd like to get to the audience is that what goes on out here what goes on in your shoulder in your neck is not pain that's no susception those are electrical signals electrochemical impulses being transmitted and that is to be distinguished from what becomes the subjective experience of pain that you have and why it's critical is that our brain serves so many functions of emotions cognitions uh memory action all of that shapes those signals coming in from our body to create your unique experience of pain that's different from everybody else's and I think that's important to note because we are frequently left with this notion of this onetoone concordance between the stimulus and the experience of pain you know Renee Dart that French uh philosopher I think 17th century um was the one who first postulated this idea of this direct linkage between the body and our actions and the stimulus and the response and it's wrong and unfortunately even in medical care we have this biomedical model that still is perpetuating this idea of a onetoone relationship and that's a critically important point to get across in large part because frequently as humans we tend to project onto others our own experiences of pain and when we see somebody who's got an injury or something else going on we immediately put that on them and that has also been a problem uh with many people suffering in chronic pain which is often viewed as the invisible disease so when you say we put that on them you mean when somebody reports being in pain we have a hard time understanding what they're are experiencing because it's going to be very different than the way that we experience pain conversely if somebody's in pain they tend to assume that people are experiencing pain the way that they are do I have that right you have it perfectly right and it actually if I can build on that gets worse because sometimes you have conditions like fibromyalgia that maybe we'll get into where outwardly visibly you don't see anything wrong we're used to thinking of pain as a fractured you know bone as a swollen ankle we see that and then we like okay well you've got pain you got legitimate pain whereas this invisible disease of chronic pain frequently you don't have something out ly that you're seeing but we bring in our own history of pain and we put that on other people I have a question that's somewhat mechanistic but we'll keep it accessible to anybody regardless of their background so you mentioned the NOS acceptors are in the body and everywhere in the body and on the surface of the body to be able to detect certain kinds of stimula and then those signals are sent up into the brain and the Brain creates this subjective experience that we call pain is there a dedicated set of areas in the brain that are something akin to like a pain pathway and the reason I ask this is that for you know for vision for hearing for touch we probably all experience those somewhat differently your perception of red is probably a little different than my perception of red we don't know for sure but experiments support that idea but there's a major difference between people experiencing the same thing differently according to like a mysterious mechanism in the brain as opposed to like an in the brain then we can look and say like hey like like that's where pain is uh represented that's where all these these inputs from the body are put together to create this thing that we call pain um like is there an area of the the thalamus a structure in the middle of the brain that takes incoming sensory information that we could say oh that's the pain pathway is there a part of our neocortex the outer shell of the the brain more or less um beneath the skull but nonetheless on the outer portion of the human brain that we could say oh that's where pain exists or is it a distributed phenomenon yeah that's a great question and you know cuz we'd all love if there was a pain center in the brain that we could just go knock out but it's not that simple and in part because pain is such a conserved phenomenon it it is there it is so wonderful because it is so terrible unless it goes wrong but when you knock out one pathway going to the brain there's others there that will carry that system forward and you'll still EXP experience pain and it's there to keep us all alive now to get to your point no there's not one pain brain area it is thought to be more of a distributed network of different brain systems we at one point in time called it the pain Matrix which represented areas such as uh the insular cortex the singulate cortex the amydala a number of these brain regions that all subserve different functions we're moving away from that because it seems like every year or so we pick up another region of the brain that's contributing to this network that subserves some additional function some nuanced layer to it that said we have been able to identify some common signatures common brain networks that seem to represent the experience of pain and this is where the development of brain-based biomarkers has come in and this is some of the work that I done starting gosh well over a dozen years ago and uh others have been building on and what we're finding is that there does seem to be this this conserved region set of uh distributed regions that do represent the experience of pain so when somebody takes a so-called painkiller let let's take a uh typical over-the-counter painkiller like a ibuprofen or camenen to uh lessen pain of some kind yeah where is is that drug or drugs acting is it in the body or is it at the level of the brain or both yeah and this is where some of the challenges we get into with language because technically nids non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen like Naperson they're actually not analgesics they're not technically pain killers so an analgesic is the descriptor for a quote unquote painkiller yeah there that would be more correct like an opioid would be would fit into that category the N heads are anti-inflammatory drugs they're also there's another this is a technical term they're anti-hyperalgesic drugs and so one of the things that happens after an injury is that we get sensitization of the area that's injured and it's a beautiful thing because it sends a message to us to protect it um what the ends heads do is they reduce some of that sensitization out in the periphery and then back in the spinal cord and in the brain but they don't actually so for instance I was going to say try this at home but probably not you can um in a normal situation you know hit your hand with a fork measure the amount of pain I'll go take an NSAID like ibuprofen if you hit your hand with that same Fork there'll be no difference folks please don't do that do that at home please yeah or any or anywhere for that matter or anywhere for that matter but you're just describing pain and the local inflammation response and the hyper Alesia the increase in pain in that general area as something very adaptive very important so it raises the question what is the threshold for saying that somebody should treat their pain reduce their pain I mean you know anytime I've done um you know surgeries on animals which I don't do anymore in the laboratory but we used to you know you would give them painkillers post-operatively I've had surgeries before or had painkillers postoperatively although I don't like taking them I don't like the way they make my brain feel and so uh but we of course know that if you increase the dose of any pain medication too much then that animal or a human can potentially injure themselves worse or not protect that injured area so it raises a whole set of sort of medical ethical but also just purely biological questions how do you set the threshold for yes blunt pain versus no allow the pain to be there as an adapt way of protecting yourself in healing presumably the inflammation is part of the healing process too and as you mentioned before pain is so subjective and it's different between all of us I mean how do we decide uh whether or not it's a good or bad idea to blunt that pain yeah I think the the the threshold is when it's impacting your quality of life and your ability to take care of activities of daily living engage with family friends go to work and that that serves kind of a your your threshold for you know whether it's reasonable to to take a medication or not it's a lot of controversy in the space right now it used to be we all recommended just Neds for any type of acute injury I is non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs could could we maybe list off a few of those so I mentioned ibuprofen aceto Menin so sometimes referred to as you know the classic Advil Tylenol we won't throw out name brands there but what are some others nioxin nioxin is another one toor doll or keto rollac is another one the two over-the-counter nids the prototypical over-the-counter ones are ibuprofen and naisin those are the ones you can buy overthe counter without a prescription uh Tylenol actually has a slightly different mechanism of injury but you know still fits in that same general class it tends to be more centrally acting IBU uh Tylenol or acetam menen but taking we say centrally you mean Brain Brain Brain thank you thank you and uh is aspirin considered an insat I don't believe as would fit into that category of basically a Cox cyc oxygenase inhibitor this is one of the the chemical mediators that gets released during injury and that chemical uh substance has a tendency to wind up or amplify the no acceptors so that after an injury you note that you're more sensitive there after a sunburn you end up having more sensitization that is what we refer to as peripheral sens ization because it's out in the periphery we're winding up or amplifying the response uh aspirin Neds in general will reduce that inflammation they're anti- um hyperalgesic and uh pardon again the jargony terms that we use but hope along as we go but but you know to your point you don't want to for instance let's imagine you have a fractured ankle you don't want to be reaching for a very potent opioid just so that you can continue walking on a fractured ankle that you haven't gotten evaluated by a clinician and perhaps casted that wouldn't be safe those are rather extreme examples you know we get into those debates right in professional sports where you know they they send the person back out on the field with a broken bone you know having given them an ejection or something I'm I'm hoping that does doesn't go on anymore but uh I'm sure it goes on okay yeah well there's all sorts of other things I get contacted all the time professional teams and athletes asking how they can get back in quicker nowadays the big thing are these uh peptides that can certainly accelerate healing people are traveling out of country get stem cell injections all with all with uh very few randomized control trials but I assure you that um Courtside and in the locker room mainly in the locker room their corticosteroid injections their painkiller injections I mean it's it's not play at any expense but it's not far from that okay yeah yeah well you know when you're you're making millions of dollars a year and I I get the being back on the field but for the rest of us mere mortals um I think that's where we would want to draw a line get medical attention if you've got an acute injury going a little bit deeper into mechanism because I think it's going to serve us well now and going forward you mentioned the IDS and um this uh Cox Cox is one of it's a is it in the family of prostagland can we talk about prostaglandins because I think there are a lot of people nowadays we hear about inflammation yeah you know inflammation's bad inflammation's bad but you know one of the things that we talk about a lot on this podcast is the fact that you know cortisol isn't bad inflammation isn't bad these things serve an important biological role so the prostaglandins seem to be one of the main ways that our immune system uh responds to a physical or chemical injury and and creates inflammation and that as you said that inflammation sensitizes an area makes it literally more sensitive and then we introduce these drugs that um to restore normal functioning and living could we establish like what normal functioning is I mean for instance if we make this really concrete could we say well if you can sleep fall asleep at night and stay asleep or perhaps go back to sleep after you've woken up in the middle of the night then will you heal during sleep and so you know take as little painkiller as possible but enough that still lets you sleep well at night is that it's sort of normal functioning because when I have a kink in my neck I don't want to do much of anything I try but it's really frustrating so what is I mean as a physician how and as a patient how do we determine normal functioning yeah and you're getting into the Nuance the complexity of this problem because we've been talking about Neds the IU preference and naisin and as I said early on we used to just give these out all the time but then the research comes out and shows that by blocking inflammation by blocking that we may be blocking the normal healing process and so we've seen delays in fracture repair we've been seeing delays in tissue repair and so now you've got on one hand a medication that may help with pain help you improve function you've got on the other hand something you're taking that may delay the process where do you draw the line as a physician my Approach is really basically what you said it's balancing the fact that if you're not sleeping at night you're not going to heal and you're not going to be able to do what you need to do the next day and if taking an inset helps you sleep and helps you uh engage with what you need to do take it at the lowest dose that you can get away with I've heard before that NAD should be taken no more than once every six hours people will alternate different types of inss 3 hours that's usually to try and reduce fever another situation where an Adaptive response fever you know people go out of their way to block it right to prevent the brain from cooking but again opens up the same set of issues and so I'm wondering if somebody has some pain that makes you know moving about frustrating and it's and it's difficult but you know they can sleep at night reasonably well maybe not as well as they normally do would your suggestion to that person if their goal is to heal as quickly as possible to just not take anything yeah so we've got a lot more data on the benefits of nids this class of medication reducing pain than we have data uh showing the bad consequences of it and so we're still needing more data on the whole healing message I think that a lot of the orthopedic surgeons out there prefer people not to be on nids after for instance a total hip replacement a total knee replacement because I think that's pretty clear but that's not what we're talking about right now so one of the other interesting things about n heads like we mentioned ibuprofen and aprin huge individual variability around those so personally ibuprofen is not very effective for me napasin is for others it may be just exactly the opposite so there's value in rotating them and finding out which works best for your particular situation you mentioned the timing of it ibuprofen is typically given no more than three times a day it's got a short halflife Naperson twice a day what's critical I need to give this message is in both situations make sure that you have food in your stomach make sure you're not taking it on an empty stomach make sure you're drinking plenty of fluids and if you've got any um GI issues if you've got any bleeding issues if you've got kidney issues if you've got heart issues talk to your doc talk to your clinician before you embark on this because these medications do have side effects and adverse consequences in vulnerable people and what about aspirin I've heard that aspirin can benefit heart health so I take a baby aspirin every day and if I have a pain that is just too intense for normal functioning as we're defining it then I'll increase that um dose of aspirin and I just assume aspirin is the healthiest and sad for me because well it's also good for heart health and it's killing pain in those instances as opposed to taking anything else is my logic flawed and if it is feel free to tell me no for for you your logic is perfect and that's where it gets to the individual person and for a lot of people that model would work as well so baby aspirin 81 milligrams a day acts as an antiplatelet agent it helps you know here even though we're getting controversy over the role of baby aspirin if you dive into the current literature even baby aspirin is controversial even baby aspirin these days and now what they're doing with with the data is defining age ranges when they say baby aspirin yes baby aspirin no and so so you know we're learning a lot more about that I still take a baby aspirin every day yeah I take a baby aspirin you get to the higher doses say four times as much up around 325 milligrams or so it's now an anti-inflammatory it's now acting more like the ibuprofen and the naason so um different mechanisms of action at different doses I'd like to take a brief moment and thank one of our sponsors and that's ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens I started taking ag1 way back in 2012 the reason I started taking it and the reason I still take it every day is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas for vitamins and minerals and it ensures that I get enough Prebiotic and probiotic to support gut health now gut health is something that over the last 10 years we realized is not just important for the health of our gut but also for our immune system and for the production of neurotransmitters and neurom modulators things like dop and serotonin in other words gut health is critical for proper brain functioning now of course I strive to consume healthy Whole Foods for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day but there are a number of things in ag1 including specific micronutrients that are hard to get from Whole Foods or at least in sufficient quantities so ag1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals that I need probiotics prebiotics the adaptogens and critical micronutrients so anytime somebody asks me if they were to take Just One supplement what that supplement should be I tell them ag1 because ag1 supports so many different systems within the body that are involved in mental health physical health and performance to try ag1 go to drink a1.com huberman and you'll get a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 and five free travel packs of ag1 again that's drink a1.com huberman I promise we won't go into every medication in such detail but but these are the most commonly used over-the-counter treatments for pain as far as I know um are there any um issues with you know people who drink caffeine who then are taking these drugs are like what are some of the uh the uh interactions that these things can have as far as I know caffeine actually touches into the prostag glandon pathway doesn't it yes and that's where you know caffeine can be used effectively for headaches for migraines and uh it can help potentiate the analgesic response uh some people get uh stomach irritation though with caffeine so just again mind that you take an end said with uh a lot of coffee uh have some food in your stomach you know you brought up earlier acetam menen or Tylenol Tylenol doesn't have the same side effect or adverse event profile that the Nets do so Tylenol is safe on the stomach um where you need to be careful about Tylenol is not to exceed 4,000 milligrams or four gram per day in divided doses so two extra strength Tylenol done four times a day for many people is safe some say 2 gram some say four Gams the key here is around your liver so if you've got good liver function if you're not abusing alcohol that's a general rule of thumb that you can use for Tylenol um but it's not going to upset your stomach there are versions of the NSAIDs that we refer to as Cox 2 Inhibitors they're very selective like celic coxib that is uh less irritating on the stomach that's by prescription only though but you can think of it as working very much the same as the napasin and the ibuprofen so talk with your clinician you know to to try to tease those apart if you have problems in your stomach with the NSAIDs and they're really effective for you you can be given other types of medications that help block or red the GI issues associated with the insets very useful information thank you here we're talking about chemical interventions to the pain process what about mechanical interventions so I was taught in my basic Neuroscience about I think it's melzack and walls gate theory of pain do I have this right where uh you know we all have this instinctual response animals have it too right if they uh you bump your knee or your toe that you grab it and you rub it and that that rubbing response is actually contributing to the activation of a neural pathway that does indeed reduce the pain through a legitimate neural inhibition and tell me if this is still considered correct and then I'll let you um uh elaborate on it but I think that is an opportunity for us to also talk more generally or for you to educate us more generally on the the mechanistic interventions for pain like um maybe massage above or below the sight of pain maybe acupuncture um so again there will be chemical consequences of any mechanical intervention right as we know because that's the language of the nervous system electricity and chemicals but as opposed to taking a drug you could imagine using manual um stimulation or rubbing around it or or perhaps we can also talk about heat and cold so could we explore that space a bit absolutely and first you're right so uh in your first part uh p uh Patrick Wall Ron mzac luminaries in the field of pain back in the 60s uh defined the gate control theory of pain and one of the things to build on the story that we talked about with no receptors going to the spinal C signals going to the spinal cord heading up to the brain where the perception of pain occurs that's not where the story ends it turns out there are Pathways that come down from the brain down from the brain to the spinal cord that act in an inhibitory role and we'll build on those also from the periphery we've got also fibers called touch fibers these are the ones where they get activated with light touch stroking they refer to is a beta fibers they're fast conducting they head back to the spinal cord and they make some connections with those no susceptive fibers so with that grounding imagine what you said you're you hit your thumb with a hammer you um uh you B bang something on an extremity um what is the first thing you do when you hit your thumb with a hammer uh some people rub it I yell some people swear and it turns out there are studies that show that swearing works really swearing reduces pain better than uh than using non-explicit every time they're in pain well they can but they'll have to bear the consequences on an individual basis we're not we're we're absolving ourselves of any responsibility right so uh rubbing uh shaking is another one which basically is activating those touch fibers oh it is put I do that yeah everybody does that everybody does that running it underwater which you know it doesn't matter whether you know in this case it's hot or it's cold water it's the running of the water underneath it and what is it doing we we all think it's reducing the stimulus out here and it is not at in the periphery in the periphery what's magical about that I think which is so cool is you're actually changing the signals in your spinal cord way back here in the neck this is the cheapest free version of what we refer to as neuromodulation that's ever been discovered um you're actually by doing that you're changing things the connections back in your spinal cord and it's reducing the no susceptive signals coming in here that's why we do it and it works it works beautifully that's why when a kid gets their boo boo you know parents come and rub it it works what about the kiss the kids sometimes they want to kiss you know or a romantic partner will sometimes like injure themselves I guess it depends on the nature of the relationship and they'll say like can you kiss it of course you know then you kiss it and then like they feel better is that purely psychological well okay I think an important point to to ground here when it comes to the experience of pain is that everything when we say psychological means Neuroscience I know you know that no no forgive me I I I I have to be careful with with the the wording that I use that's my fault but but it's it's accurate still it is psychological but it is neuroscience-based I mean they're really becoming one and the same but to answer your question yes by kissing it you're activating touch fibers we can also agree that there's a positive emotional salience that's associated with that and that positive emotional salience is reducing pain too what interesting up wall and melac sometime later uh there was the introduction of a device to take advantage of this called the tens device and tens is an acronym transcutaneous electrical neuros stimulation and what the tenens device is doing and there's many versions of it now but there are those black electrodes you put over over the area and they're hooked up to wires and when you turn it on it causes a buzzing sensation and that buzzing sensation is activating those touch fibers the a beta fibers and so it's causing that neuromodulation back in the spinal cord amazing it's cool stuff it's very cool and I and I love that you emphasize that when we're rubbing the periphery or shaking our hand the periphery again being the body surface away from the brain that the real mechanism of action is taking place back in the spinal cord because it really speaks to the the body wide and the the circuit wide the nervous systemwide nature of this thing that we call pain right it's it's happening out quote unquote out here in the periphery but it's being modulated in the neck level of the spinal cord approximately and then it's you know being interpreted at the level of the brain what explains different pain thresholds I could imagine it could be any or all of the locations that we've been discussing and it could be the context as well right if you're um you know I've heard before and I don't know if this is true that if you have a lot of adrenaline epinephrine in your system that your threshold for pain goes way way up there's probably a chemical basis for that and maybe it's all you know um anecdote but um certainly people have different thresholds for pain I for instance do not have a high pain threshold but I've noticed I have a very quick pain response so if I stub my toe it feels like the most painful thing I could possibly experience but then it's gone very quickly so it's like a quick inflection and then down other people I know uh we've never done the experiment I think I see them stub their toe and they're like ah and then you know 10 minutes later they're still feeling the ache so whose pain threshold is higher that's a it depends on how you define pain threshold so how do we Define pain threshold what determines pain threshold and I guess the $6 million question are there different pain thresholds between men and women as it relates to the whole story about childbirth being very painful and that Women quote unquote have higher pain thresholds I just I just sent you about 10 questions so forgive me yeah um so what is pain threshold yeah no it it's a it's a great place to start and maybe I don't know if you want to Circle back around at some point to the heat and cold to finish up the mechanical but no no no you're let me answer your get to your pain threshold so the pain threshold is uh that stimulus intensity that results in the onset of the experience of pain the first onset of the experience of pain so you know when you turn up the heat it's it's not when it's warm it's not when it's just hot it's when the heat becomes the perception of pain like when it becomes painfully hot at that point in time the same works for cold you mentioned some of the distinction between your experiences of pain to a stimulus and your buddies and that's normal that first onset of pain again those are those fast fibers those ad Delta fibers boom right to your brain those are the protective ones that when we put our hand on a hot stove we immediately Jerk it back we don't even have a consci perception yet that we did that and then it's a moment later when the sea fibers are getting up to the brain and the other a Delta fibers are converging into conscious areas of brain that we're like oh wow that stove is really hot and the ca fibers in particular are converging on more emotional regions in the brain that are conveying an unpleasantness to that experience you don't like it you and you don't want it to happen again which is why it encodes memories so you only had to do that once as a child now getting into the the pain thresholds you asked one of the other questions is do men and women have different pain um thresholds uh the answer the short answer is yes this has been established and I want to be careful here with saying a couple things one is in general uh men have uh higher pain thresholds to things like heat stimulus than women and what what people have to also though understand as scientists we make a big deal out of small differences right you know what we do is we take a group of people in this case men and women and we apply the same uh thermal stimulus to them and we draw averages the average man has this stimulus the average woman has this stimulus and we say well women have a little bit more sense sensitivity to that heat stimulus and so we then go into the press and we say uh men are tougher than women that's a terrible statement right because the tough part is a subjective label right I mean it it it gets to a whole bunch of different issues around the Adaptive role of pain right I mean I mean one could argue that if your threshold for pain is lower that your it serves a more adaptive function right fewer injuries Etc I mean I guess it gets into the implications of what we mean by quote unquote tougher it does but it also misses I think the big point which is people are not averages so what I mean by that is um while the average for a woman may be somewhat less than a man if you look at the distribution of the curves they highly overlap meaning the individual variability within men and within women is much greater than the difference between men and women but there's plenty of women on that curve that have much greater heat uh thresholds than men Doh but when you pull things you end up with that difference unfortunately when things are picked up and you want a quick sound bite out of it that's what it gets distill down to so so it's not unlike height for that matter there're a lot of women that are taller than men that's exactly it but on average men are taller than women on average and I would say within this area of uh pain threshold differences it's even closer it's even tighter you know it would be I'm making this up the equivalent I think the average height of a woman is 53 5'4 the average height of a man 5'9 510 this is Imagining the average height being you know 5'6 for a woman and 5'8 for a man you know it's not a huge difference there's a lot of things that play into changes and pain thresholds how much and this is where the brain comes in because you know much of the no susception much of the signals that we're um transducing we're transmitting you know in many of us it's very much the same it's when it gets to the brain now it's shaped and it's shaped by things such as um your beliefs about that stimulus your expectations around it how much anxiety you're having at the moment does increased anxiety increase one's perceived pain yes okay yeah it does um your early life experiences with this so have you had traumatic experiences in the past that alters brain circuits can I interject a question yeah if one was told just suck it up a lot or if one whimpered or cursed when they uh hurt themselves if they were told um you know don't be a wuss don't be a wimp do we know whether or not that increases or decreases the subjective feeling of pain later I could imagine it going either way I could imagine the kid that was told don't be a wuss when they cried as a consequence of expressing pain or an experience of pain secretly feeling more pain because they aren't able to express the emotionality around the pain but that if we just look from the outside we'd say wow they like pretty tough adult right because they're not um crying out in pain so do we have any are there any experiments that have explored that I don't know you're getting in this is a good point getting into um uh pediatric pain and you know if there's been experiments in that space I stay mainly in the adult area and my experience with raising a child is an N of one with one son um he's done great I happen to know him very well he's a he's he's what you call a great example of Highly successful reproduction so you know it's say what do they say it's better to be lucky than good uh so I'm sure I'm sure there was a lot involved so don't don't discount don't uh don't discard any credit thank you thank you um you know my Approach with Ian was not to say just you know necessarily suck it up but I would uh you know make light of it i' I'd have fun with it and uh I would kind of laugh and I'm like way to go buddy uh and I would find he would often laugh you know so I think a lot of it is the ACC they're taking off the parents you know and again this is this is just my oneof end parent is if they see you freaking out kids going to freak out too um but does there get to be a point where you're ignoring your child or your loved ones painful issue yeah now you're getting into some maladaptive some bad space where I think it's sending that person the wrong message and they may very well have problems later on I will tell just a very brief anecdote when I was growing up I observed a total of zero children and friends who you know cried out in pain or complained of pain who were told you know um that was an inappropriate response um sometimes I might have heard parents say you know come on just suck it up or like or rub it you'll be okay that kind of thing but once and only once we had some friends I won't tell you what what country they were from but they they lived not far from um where both Ian and I grew up since we grew up near one another and I'll never forget that the younger brother of a friend of mine ran over to the father he had cut his thumb on the band saw and it wasn't particularly deep but he was crying in pain and the father wrapped it picked up his chin and smacked him across the face and said don't ever do that again and so what I think he was doing was compounding the the lesson about the saw yeah but clearly had no regard for the pain that the that the injury probably caused now I haven't followed up with that kid yeah um I think we can all agree that by today's standards that would be considered um abusive parenting uh or perhaps um you know one could say that was you know on the far extreme of a response but I'll never forget that and I went home and I I told my mom yeah and she said oh yeah when I was growing up that was actually a more frequent response to kids hurting them themselves especially boys yeah and so things have really changed in terms of how we react to children in pain but the reason I find this interesting is that ultimately what we're talking about is how should we interpret our own pain yeah can I can I make a commentary about that scenario and I want to bring in another Neuroscience concept that that Dad may have been doing inadvertently and that's something called conditioned pain modulation so there's another cool phenomenon and in pain that pain inhibits pain so what I mean by that is when you were you know this guy this kid but or yourself growing up did you ever walk up to your buddy and say you know my my arm really hurts you know I injured it the other day and what did what did your buddy do they'd stomp on your foot and you'd say why the heck did you do that you and I must have grown up with the same friend oh yeah yeah and and they'd say well now doesn't doesn't your arm feel better and i' be like well yeah it does and yeah I did grow up with those friends I tell this story to some people and I sometimes just get the wide eyes like they did what yeah we are not making recommendations here we're not making recommendations but it's a real phenomenon it was described by Laars late 70s 78 or something like that in rodent models initially and what happens is that when you engage a no susceptive stimulus or a painful stimulus in a sight distal different from where the primary pain is it engages a brain stem circuit that has descending Pathways to the spinal cord and inhibits pain amazing pain inhibits pain it works it also is thought to have some contributions from higher brain centers we call this whole phenomenon lears called this phenomenon diffuse noxious inhibitory control or denck the human version of this is called conditioned pain modulation why I bring this up not only to help explain that father's actions somehow I don't think that he was thinking oh my kid's got a painful uh you know hand or finger he cut himself I'm going to slap him off the side of the head he'll feel better I don't think that's what was going through his head he wanted to make him feel worse so he didn't go near the band saw without being more cautious but it probably did reduce the pain a little bit to some extent now where it's key is oh maybe we'll get into it later with chronic pain is in some chronic painful conditions the CPM or the denck doesn't work like fibrom algia being one um so pain inhibits pain uh is another Neuroscience concept related to pain that's rather cool well and I'm sorry I missed your question to could you repeat no you answer the question and and uh expanded on it in a in a completely surprising and far more interesting way than I ever anticipated so thank you I I'm betting that 98% of people listening to this including myself have never heard that pain inhibits pain incredible let's go back to heat and cold we briefly touched on heat but let's talk about the use of uh quote unquote therapeutic heat or therapeutic cold a cold pack for a you know a you know a bruise that really aches or maybe even a break or a sprain or heat you know the in the world of sport physio cold is now heavily debated localized cold is heavily debated you know you get people saying things I don't know if this is true that you know it creates a sludging of the of the fluids trying to head in and out of the injury so cold is not as good as heat heat allows for um the uh inclusion and removal of waste products and you know there are all sorts of Just So Stories that people make up some of which might be true I don't know but what do we know about heat and cold as physiological stimula in terms of their ability to ameliorate to help pain because of course if you get things hot enough or you get them cold enough you can create pain with heat or cold but let's assume we're not getting to that level of heat or cold and one is in pain um you know when I was a kid we had a hot water bottle that for times when we were sick with something but sometimes you know if I felt an ache on the side I'd put some hot water in the hot water bottle lie on that thing watch some cartoons I definitely felt better sure sure well putting aside the Contemporary controversies over the mechanisms you describe which are I think very real and need to be sorted out traditionally historically we tend to think of applying cold for the first 48 hours or so after an acute injury and then heat thereafter cold has some really cool effects cold uh reduces inflammation so it reduces some of the release of those inflammatory chemicals we talked about prostaglandins cyto kindes histamines um other chemo kinds all these fancy terms for substances that sensitize the primary Noor and it reduces the release of those and it reduces inflammation another cool thing often not appreciated is nerves don't fire as fast when they're cold and so if you've got no receptors that are firing and you put cold it's slowing the number of signals coming up and by definition it's reducing the the the ultimately the pain you're experiencing now Heat heat has an obvious effect of increasing blood flow it's going to help uh relax muscles and get blood into those muscles and that's probably why you were putting that hot water bottle on um and it just darn feels good and so what what do I tell people you know in part I tell people use whichever works best for them um I find there's huge individual variability in whether people like heat or like cold and within reason uh they're safe what do I mean within reason don't go putting an ice pack on an extremity for two hours you know you'll get a frostbite so you know take care with that how cold should one make the point on their body that's in pain assuming of course that they're not going to give themselves frostbite meaning do you want to numb the area you know get past that point where it's a little bit painful and then that you know basically you're shutting down some neural Pathways and you don't feel anything there it's numb and then you let the blood flow return When you remove the cold pack is that I mean that's a reasonable suggestion okay yeah all right well people I think will appreciate the the um the specifics of that because um you know and of course listeners of this podcast often are interested in whole body deliberate cold immersion you know cold showers ice baths Etc most people experience those as somewhat painful as they get into them and then can experience some numbness when they get out is it possible to raise one's pain threshold through the regular exposure to pain in ways that are safe such as deliberate cold exposure assuming that one doesn't stay in too long and it's not too cold um and or through you know we were talking about sports earlier but just in general like can we raise our pain threshold so that life is less painful the short answer to your last question is yes um the answer to your other question about uh extreme cold and cold exposure which I know you have a lot of expertise and you can teach me a lot I'm going to stay in my wheelhouse at cuz I I'm not up on the literature in that space even in its intersection with pain um it's an intriguing concept uh I have to imagine that it makes sense you would get some habituation uh with that repeated exposure I think one of the the questions that would come up with for instance the cold exposure and I don't know the answer to this but it's I'm sure maybe somebody out there does is is there cross modality um changes in pain thresholds I mean if you expose yourself a lot to cold does it change your heat threshold I don't I would surprise be surprised if it did yeah would or your pressure those are separate parallel Pathways right yeah yeah you know there uh and you know as an aside I hate the cold but I do really well with the heat you know and so does Ian uh you know I think there's something genetic there uh so you know I mentioned earlier around men and women and heat uh thresholds and I chose that specifically but each of these are different depending on the stimulus modality can you change ultimately your thresholds yeah where that involves is a lot of cognitive control it's a lot of cognitive training uh around that space and you know there's there's clearly approaches to that people have learned that there's different manipulations around that so one experiment this wasn't intended at least I don't believe so they were measuring uh heat thresholds uh on college students and and we we experiment a lot on students as as we all know we pay them well um and what they found is that when they're studying guys studying dudes when there was an attractive woman who was delivering the St stimulus the thresholds were higher because the guys did not want to look like a wuss in front of this attractive young woman and that's been pretty well established so the experimenter their gender uh plays a big role in that has the reverse experiment also been done I don't I don't know I don't know interesting um but getting back to your point yes um I think through a number of uh you know cognitive manipulations you can ultimately um over time change those thresholds another one area is ex is movement exercise you know clearly changes uh those thresholds over time you are probably building up um some increased inhibitory tone through that process I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor inside tracker insid tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals now I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term Health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test a major problem with a lot of blood tests out there however is that you get information back about metabolic factors lipids and hormones and so forth but you don't know what to do with that information with inside tracker they make it very easy because they have a personalized platform that allows you to see the levels of all those things metabolic factors lipids hormones Etc but it gives you specific directives that you can follow that relate to nutrition behavioral modifications supplements Etc that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you if you'd like to try insid tracker you can go to insid tracker.com huberman to get 20% off any of insid tracker plans again that's insid tracker.com huberman one thing I'm fascinated by in the whole mindfulness space yeah uh is this idea of whether or not under conditions of stress or in this case pain whether or not the most adaptive mindset assuming it's not a tissue damaging level of pain would be to think about something else distract oneself from the pain or conversely whether or not one should quote unquote go into the pain so for people who have chronic pain maybe it's in a a small area of the body that experiences chronic pain pain quite often AK chronic pain or maybe it's whole body pain I don't think it really matters for the question I'm asking and people are trying to develop some cognitive ways so what we call as neuroscientists you and I top down mechanisms for thing like okay I'm going to distract myself from the pain I'm going to focus on other things I really enjoy or rather I'm going to really go into the pain meet the pain and realize I don't know some that it's not as bad like somehow there's a and again this becomes very opaque right we don't really know what we're talking about when we when we do these sorts of protocols but those sorts of things are out there in the mindfulness space and I think um I certainly take mindfulness seriously as as an intervention but what always bothers me about those sorts of interventions is that they lack the specificity and the granularity and there's no kind of mechanistic logic to explain them so what what are your thoughts on on meeting the pain versus distracting oneself from the pain let's break that down because there's two concepts there as you alluded to and they're both effective and they both work differently so one is attentional distraction where you are distracting yourself from the thing that is causing pain clearly works in a lot of people and that's why one of the strategies that we recommend for patients for people living with pain is to engage in distracting activities read a book um uh go for a walk um spend time with friends and family in particular in the community and work to get your mind off of pain what we've learned is that attentional distraction engages specific brain networks they tend to be some of the outer layer of brain networks in your prefrontal cortex some in your singulate cortex um and other regions which are clearly involved with distraction it's not necessarily that distraction is going to completely eliminate one's pain but it can reduce it uh significantly and this is why the biggest problem with distraction from a time of the day is at night it's when people are trying to sleep because during the daytime you can read that book you can spend time with friends and family but people with chronic pain that have it 247 you can't distract yourself at night when you're trying to get into a relaxed State and fall asleep and that's why sleep is such a big issue for people with chronic pain so attentional distraction it it works distraction works now what you said I mean the second piece you said kind of let's meet the pain if you will and there's different approaches to meeting the pain one approach that you invoked with mindfulness is addressing the pain from a non-judgmental accepting manner I'm aware the pain is there I am not going to judge it I'm not going to put a value on it's bad it's good or anything I'm just going to note its presence and that has been shown to work as well in fact actually when John kabat Zin originally developed mindfulness-based stress reduction people with low back pain Plenty Of Studies have shown that it works I've completed just some recent studies in mbsr uh as well and we're diving deeply into the data so it's this non-judgmental acceptance of you will of the pain sorry mbsr is the acronym for mindfulness based stress reduction mbsr everybody should do mbsr let me be CLE I have no Financial relationship with any of this by the way but mindfulness-based stress reduction has been shown effective for anxiety for depression for pain just about everything I think they should put it into all the schools uh it's it's a great skill to learn no side effects takes a little bit of time to learn it and uh it can be in some people effective and helpful for pain and that's the key that we're going to keep coming back to is some of these things work for some of the people some of the time there's a third aspect of meeting the p pain and that is more of a direct cognitive reframing about the meaning of the pain now you're coming at the pain and you have um an approach you're making effort on what you're thinking of the pain is that pain damaging threatening harmful or do you view it as yeah it hurts but it's not harming me that is a critical critical aspect of pain management and that is serves as a foundation for something called cognitive behavioral therapy the the cool thing about a number of these is that there's actually different neural circuits engaged with these different approaches and um I think the key that we have to f figure out and this is where research is going is which approach works for which person under which circumstance so interesting uh something you said about understanding the pain but not um overinterpreting or catastrophizing the pain seems important knowing the difference between being hurt or feeling hurt versus being injured has been something that's been important to me I've been involved in sports uh where clearly pain was involved it's like I'm hurt but am I injured that's the first question you know like I've rolled an ankle like oh you know like I'm limping this hurts am I injured meaning am I going to be back at it in an hour tomorrow versus I broken bones and it's you know you know great empathy for anybody that does like when you're injured you feel the snap and you know you're out for a while in some cases um so I think knowing the difference between being hurt and being injured is something that's kind of that key moment and for me it's always been experien as a moment of anxiety after feeling pain especially in a sports here like uh oh like am I am I going to have to take two weeks off or is this just pain so I think for people to be able to recognize when pain is reporting an injury versus when pain is just reporting a temporary sensation is really important and perhaps also for psychological hurt versus psychological injury I mean that gets to some larger context themes these days of somebody says something it upsets us are we hurt or are we injured right you know I think it gets very murky so how does one determine if they are hurt versus injured and then maybe we could even stretch into the psychological realm neither of us are psychologists but it sounds like so much of what you do represents the the bridge from the body into the mind and so it'd be remiss if we didn't talk about emotional pain as well yeah so what you just said your spot your spot on Andrew and that one of the key messages the key you know macky's tips for pain management is to understand the distinction between hurt versus harm versus harm MH critical absolutely critical let me allow me to illustrate with um patient I saw won't name names some time ago guy's in his 40s a master's level tennis player tennis is his life he's works as some executive somewhere but he lives for tennis comes hobbling in on crutches sits down and he's got pain in his foot and he was told not to put pressure on his foot because he's got this injury and it's going to be worse and this has been going on now for months and he's now depressed because he can't play tennis tennis is his life this guy's life is tennis so I examine this guy and it turns out what he has is something called a Morton's neuroma and a Morton's neuroma is a fibrous thickening of tissue around the nerves that go to your toes and it gets to be like this bundle tissue nerves and it's really painful um it's very painful but it's not causing harm there's no harm there it's really painful so I explain this to the guy and he looks at me with like this light bulb goes off and he's like you mean I can play tennis and I'm like yeah guy you can go play all the tennis you want it's just going to hurt he got up he left the crutches in the exam office and he walked away now that's an extreme example I don't want people please to think that that kind of thing occurs all the time it doesn't um chronic pain conditions are often incredibly complicated and need much more than you know a 45 minute or 60-minute education session and you know back to the tennis court he still had pain in his foot by the way but he could play but that gives that example of addressing that fear and the anxiety around that that issue and I think that's what we first have to learn is does that pain that we're experiencing represent something that is harming us that something that we either need to seek a medical attention now or sometime soon and whether does continued activity worsen the tissue injury or not in my world where I'm caring mostly for people with chronic pain we've moved beyond the tissue healing by definition by one of the definitions for chronic pain is that the pain persists beyond the time of tissue healing so in many of our sessions our times we're educating people hurt versus harm it's back pain we we evaluate the spine we make sure is the spine stable is there anything Sinister causing damage in most of the cases it's not and we help people understand that distinction critical critical for people and yet at the same time you don't want to just ignore something that is a real medical issue that's getting worse person needs medical attention and that's where the complexity of all this comes in did I answer your question yeah beautifully I think this distinction between hurt versus harmed is so important for people to hear um perhaps you're willing to expand a little bit in terms of the psychological hurt versus harmed I mean I'm not asking you to comment on um societal or generational shifts but you know we'd be avoiding the obvious if we didn't say that in the last um really 10 to 15 years there's been a pretty dramatic shift in terms of how Society at large interprets emotional pain right people hearing things or seeing things and the idea that emotional pain could be related to physical pain or at least similar enough to it that people's emotional pain is valid right and if anything I'm here to validate the fact that emotional pain is valid like any other pain except it is different because it becomes very hard to point to a specific kind of threshold we're using that word a lot today but I think it's appropriate here threshold between hurt and harmed whereas if I tell you that my left foot hurts which it did a lot in high school and then you took an x-ray of my foot in high school you'd say your foot's broken because it was broken a lot in high school and that's harmed I mean to continue to do what I was doing to break it in the first place I was harm clearly going to harm myself worse so I had to had to heal up but when it comes to psychological pain you know psych has all these thresholds for normal functioning versus abnormal functioning are you sleeping well normal relationship and on and on we don't want to go there because that's not our place but how do you when you see patients how do you take into account the level or the thresholds for their emotional pain because that's part of your job so I'm asking you this from the perspective of a somebody who treats pain how do you gauge somebody's psychological pain is it by how intensely they vocalize their pain or does it always go back to how well or poorly their life is being managed at the level of sleep nutrition relationships and so forth yeah great great set of questions there's a lot in there let me first start off with something very simple I don't try to distinguish between this notion of psychological pain physical pain it's pain end of end of I think once I get into or you get into this trying to distinguish is this psychological pain or psychogenic pain which was a terrible term or physical pain you end up putting value judgments on people and I don't think it serves us well when we're caring for the person in front of us if they're in pain I'm addressing the pain the thing to note is at least in people that come into our at Stanford Pain Management Center and other pain centers is that remember pain is a sensory and emotional experience it's all wrapped up and so we want to treat the whole person sometimes we get we get easy we get easy ones and we just go do a nerve block and pain goes away and that's simple but usually it's much more complex where we're seeing the interaction of uh an expression of pain that includes a significant amount of anxiety y of depression you mentioned this term catastrophizing which we can break down if you'd like and that's probably one of the biggest predictors factors in uh in amplification of pain and worsening pain in poor treatment response is catastrophizing um I try to treat the whole person and not really partial out all this I do at Stanford I you I I built a digital health system that captur measures a lot of data around a patient's experience across physical psychological and social functioning and we use that data to Target therapies to understand um how much their depressive symptoms are anxiety anger anger big issue in pain huge in pain does it make it worse or better invariably it makes it worse yeah and you know you can break anger down in a couple different categories John Burns and others has broken it into like anger in versus anger out I don't know if that term is familiar with you um anger out that's my father um loud loud angry boisterous banging you know would quickly turn anything into an angry tiate anger out expressive yelling at the at the news yes yelling at somebody who cuts you off in traffic usually yelling at the man uh because he hated his job um anger in boiling simmering you know self-contained seething that's anger in data seems to support anger and is is worse it's bad so it's not necessarily whether or not it's directed at someone external in both cases anger in and anger out can be directed at someone external it's a question of whether or not it's expressed outwardly or contained inside beautifully stated beautifully stated so we C you know anger depression anxiety iety uh we capture fatigue sleep and so what we try to do is again look at the whole person because they're not just a back if that's where they're having pain or not just a neck or a shoulder in your case it's impacting the whole person and we just got done talking earlier about how all of these circuits interact with each other and so sometimes we can't just eliminate the no subception in the periphery sometimes we can reduce it but what we have to do is Target everything and we have to try to Target all these circuits up here and in many cases what we're doing is through education through pain psychology um through physical therapy and re rehabilitative approaches on top of it and yes the medications we have now you know we touched Bas on a few earlier but we have over 200 medications available for pain um very few of them FDA approved uh we tend to steal from all the other fields so you're talking about more than 200 medications that can be yes prescribed for pain but as off label treatments perfectly stated yeah there's only a few medications that are actually FDA approved specifically for pain so what we what we do is we borrow or steal from the psychiatrists some of their uh their anti-depressants uh which will frequently work very effectively for pain and work on those pain related circuits in the brain we uh take from the neurologist some of the anti-seizure medications because those medications um while reducing separately seizures for people who don't have seizures they work on ION channels um they work on other neuromodulators that also are involved in pain circuitry we can take from the cardiologist medications that work on the heart anti- arhythmia or heart rhythm drugs they are potent sodium channel blockers and the sodium channels as you know are responsible for the action potential that generates the nerve impulse signal and so they're like an oral local anesthetic that you take and so we we we take from everybody in our field in the medications getting back to to what you said so just summarizing one I I don't really distinguish uh psychological vers versus physical pain in my world I I find it better just to treat it as pain and look at the person holistically and go after all the components at once I find that's where we get the best results and it is typically bringing a lot of tools to Bear speaking of tools to Bear What role if any does nutrition play in local or whole body pain I critical and I think we're learning more and more and more about uh the role of good nutrition of healthy eating anti-inflammatory diets uh avoidance of foods that are triggers um and an incredibly underappreciated area um you know I've had my experiences with chronic pain um I developed uh an abdominal chronic pain problem uh shortly after I turned 50 I was throwing a happy hour for our pain psychologists of all people went to a Mexican restaurant I won't name which one got food poisoning That's why I'm not naming it good Mexican food bad food poisoning and ever since that event I can't eat anything in the onion family what um I'm familiar with onions but what else is in the onion family I'm sure you've researched this now pretty thoroughly considering what you're describing classic and the what we refer to as fod Maps you know it's one of the fod maps and I have now some issues with the others and um manifested by just severe severe up abdominal pain and um not many other symptoms but you know it put me on this journey where uh severe abdominal pain didn't know why couldn't sleep couldn't sleep went like I'd go months without having a restful night's sleep I thought I was getting early Alzheimer's because I felt like I was getting stupid and um what actually benefited me was of all things the pandemic why because what did we all do we isolated and we started eating the same foods and I started noticing I was feeling better when I was eating certain foods my abdominal pain went away and I'd start doing as a scientist experiments and I finally was able to isolate and determine what the problem was so now I have complete avoidance on that I'm I'm a little difficult to go out to a restaurant and have dinner but you so no onions no onions and what else shallots chives scallions leaks anything in the onion family you know not alium I'm fine with garlic and you know by healthy eating by identifying something by triggers changed my life and returned to degree of normaly I think the key for people is you know if you have any kind of similar issues identify those triggers sometimes uh isolation of you know Foods or restrictions and using a journal and then as you learn from that slowly build Foods back into your diet I think it's so important for people to hear this and thanks for sharing your personal story around this because I think that nutrition while every physician seems to appreciate that quality of nutrition matters defining what quality nutrition is is really difficult there's still you know Avid even we could call them ranous debates about this you know vegan versus omnivore versus this and you know but it sounds like this is a case where it can become very individualized but I could imagine somebody going to their physician and that physan not being you and saying yeah you know I notice that when I eat certain foods I'm in a lot of pain and the physician simply saying well don't eat those foods but unless that person is a trained scientist like not knowing how to go about doing the sorts of experiments that you did would be difficult impossible I'm sorry I know I interrupt you I just want to build on that if I if I can one of the key things I simplified my story but the key thing is is if I if I eat onions or anything in onion family it's pain for two weeks wow it is so the thing is is if you get repeated exposures it never stops and it gets very very hard to figure out what it was so it's not like you eat something you get pain it goes away where you know we can all do that pattern recognition here you have to be able to think back what happened two weeks ago that may have influenced it so it's not easy well this may be a case for elimination diets which are uh provide they're done safely where people restrict the number of foods they eat to a very limited number of foods make sure they still get enough calories and macronutrients uh that they need protein fats and carbohydrates or what what have you but that by limiting the total number of foods that they eat to like eight or 10 basic things then you can build things in and then explore what triggers the pain or what removes the pain I don't really see any other way I am intrigued by The Onion example even though it's a it's a it's your case in particular and we don't want to extrapolate too broadly is there something about onions that's triggering a particular neurochemical or immune pathway or do we have any knowledge of like why onions would create that kind of gut pain this has been a journey I've been on now for a few years to answer this um uh one of our GI pain docs that we have come in the CL Lyn newwin sent me a paper from I know seller nature that showed that after a gut infection it can change the genetic expression related to sensitizing you to food antigens I know I throw out a lot of jargon there basically the short answer is you get an infection and you're gut no longer responds properly to a normal food item and so one explanation maybe I got this infection I was at a Mexican restaurant a lot of onions and I got sensitized through that infection now subsequently to onions you know I saw a Stanford uh allergist Hannah Watford who's awesome by the way and uh after I had this I think figured out and I went in and I'm like well you know Dr Watford is there anything I can do for this and she laughed and she's like no you're doing everything it's all just avoidance and I thinking I was rather unique and special about this thing I said you know do you ever see this and she said oh yeah I see this all the time every day I see this all the time and I said like this isn't unusual she like no I see this thing all the time and this thing meaning sensitivity sensitivity to certain no to certain to different these different food groups and this this thing that occurs later in life something an event that happens to somebody that triggers and I said well gosh that sounds like a public health problem and she's like that's what we're debating right now in the allergy Community is whether this is representing more of a public health issue and is because I'm seeing I Dr Watford I'm seeing increasing amounts of this uh as we go forward how interesting well um this is not a time to PL the philanthropic arm of our premium podcast but uh I'm very involved in science philanthropy this sounds like an area to De devote some funding to to explore how foods are impacting the local and systemic pain response yeah I I got in you know so I'm running a large biomarker study to characterize people deeply and one of the things that I wanted to put in there is microbiome characterization now to be clear that's out of my wheelhouse but the beauty of being at Stanford and other major institutions is you can go make friends yeah Justin sonenberg who's been a guest on this podcast is one of the world experts on the gut microbiome we have a few others too so there you go he's a friendly guy I'm sure he'll collaborate we go we go make friends and people who understand the microbiome we collect the samples and that's where team science is magical and once again the idea looking at the whole person as long as we're talking about the gut um let's talk about pain inside the body because we talked about NOS acceptors on the surface of the body and the pain that most people uh immediately think of when you have a discussion about pain is you know pain on the surface or a broken bone or maybe hip pain or knee pain or back pain but what about pain that resides deeper in the viscera you know a gut pain um irritable bowel syndrome these things are I'm learning are far more uh common than um than I knew I'm fortunate that um if I have a stomach ache or a headache it means something's wrong I rarely get those I sometimes been called that you don't have a stomach of Steel not because it's hard from the outside um but because I can eat pretty much anything although I eat pretty cleanly a lot of people write to me and ask questions on social media about irritable bowel syndrome and other forms of gut pain and viscera pain like pain that they feel is really deep within their system typically how is that sort of pain dealt with at a clinical level absolutely visceral pain is a different thing than what we've been describing uh a lot of which is sematic Pain by the way I'll say as an aside I used to have a gut of Steel also I could Chomp down anything anytime anywhere and so you know there was a lot of grief and loss associated with not being able to eat certain foods and uh that's also something people have to come to grips with um but getting back to visceral pain so the thing about somatic pain that's another term now somatic meaning the so the the the extremity that you were alluding to is the no acceptors there uh very precisely localize where the stimulus the painful stimulus is coming from when you hit your thumb with a hammer you know exactly where that pain occurred with the visceral pain what you have are very defuse what we refer to as receptive Fields think about you last time you had a stomach ache it's not that you put your thumb right here what you said is kind of hurts like this your whole stomach whole stomach it's because those receptive fields are very large they're broad they're not as well localized and in part the reason for that type of broad receptive field is you're not trying to get away from localized danger so when people get stomach AIDS it's often a very broad area when you get pelvic pain it's the same type of thing now there's some fascinating stuff that occurs with visceral pain because those fibers that extend from the viscera meaning the the lungs the abdomen the pelvis they all head into the spinal cord too and it just so happens that they make kind of indirect direct connections with the same level that represents the body so let's think about pelvic pain for instance you frequently will find people that said that have pelvic pain that will describe having lower back pain too and it's because of this visceral somatic convergence in the spinal cord it's not that there's something going on in their back it's that these signals that are being driven heavily from the pelvis are coming in and connecting with the same regions from the back and the convergence of that is now being perceived as pain in both and we we're seeing that more and more in the research this viscerosomatic convergence people have pain in their pelvis and then also over their abdomen um classic one that uh we're aware of we see this in the TV the movies and unfortunately real life are heart attacks so the the visceral fibers that subserve the heart typically the first through the fourth thoracic region well those converge um in the spinal cord in similar regions that subserve sensation under the arm and appear That's why people often say they've got pain with a heart attack radiating down into their arm the left arm typically the left arm the heart is on the left side exactly um after people get abdominal surgery Sometimes some blood can leak out and it'll slip underneath the diaphragm the diaphragm is subserved by some of those neck regions three four and five of the cervical which happens to also cover your shoulder and so you'll get people after abdominal surgery they said man my shoulder's really hurting me Doc and what we do is we first check to see you know could something have happened during an you know during placement just make sure there's nothing wrong but frequently it's due to irritation that's again one of the magical Mysteries that's so fascinating about pain it seems like a good point to bring up referenced pain um or is what you're describing an example of referenced pain so my understanding of referenced pain is that you know like for instance I I've got a slight bulge at I think like my lumbar 34 disc or something I had a whole body scan recently just a um an exploration scan because I had the opportunity not not anything serious fortunately and there's a slightly bulg disc there and every once in a while if I do certain movements um in the gym I'll get pain down in my right hip and sometimes going down my leg and I used to think it was sciatica because you assume anything on the right backside okay must be wallet induced SC sciatica back pocket wallet induced sciatica um but what I eventually realized is that well it's this dis buul it just so happens that the nerves that emit from that that region um they Branch out to a bunch of different areas and so you think the pain is in your leg but the the issue is someplace else or um and occasionally indeed I feel the pain elsewhere in my body as well it's sort of like a like a matching of regions for pain that seem unrelated is that a way to think about reference pain perfectly the the the examples also I referred to of a heart attack causing referred pain or also the pelvic region associated with back pain as a way of um referred pain um what you're describing is the fact that pain doesn't have to start with an injury or a stimulus in the periphery you could damage the nerves anywhere along the way and that will be perceived as pain we refer to that as neuropathic pain pain so that's another distinction you brought up uh nicely good good segue into there's thought to be um several different types or categories of pain we have been talking through much of this time about somatic pain you know injury out here we talked about visceral pain and when you have damage to a peripheral nerve damage injury to a peripheral nerve or the central nervous system we refer to that as neuropathic pain it frequently has different qualities different characteristics people will refer to it as shooting stabbing shock likee burning it can frequently uh when there's a damage to a nerve or damage to certain regions of the brain be incredibly challenging to treat by the way the good news is with that uh light disc bulge is the vast majority of time the discs reabsorb yeah I have to be careful to not do too much um spinal uh flexion like sit-ups and stuff I thought that that would help but that actually doesn't strengthen the back it was actually a asymmetry between the abdominal muscles and the lower back muscles so provided I do a lot of back extension type training then that bulge more or less stays in I just have to be a little little cautious not too cautious fortunately as long as we're talking about referenced pain somatic visceral and all the rest what about associative or referenced pain where it's psychological and I don't want to get tooo abstract here but more and more these days I hear from people who say you know I was in this job and the job sucked or I was in this relationship and the relationship sucked and I had terrible back pain like really acute localized back pain or chronic headaches or migraines yeah and then they go on vacation or they change their circumstances and lo and behold the pain goes away does that surprise you as an expert in pain not at all not at all what you're you know simp simplistically referring to is you know there's people are undergoing stress and we have we clearly know that the brain is not a passive recipient of information coming in from the body it's a two-way street the brain is causing Downstream consequences in the body the brain uh controls our sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system the sympathetic being the fight andlight response it controls the tone of uh cortisol that's being released and we all know that in acute situations rapid increases of cortisol and um noradrenaline is keeps us away from the Lions and the Tigers and the bears oh my but in a chronic situation and uh Robert spolski as you know it's Stanford has built a career around chronic stress at least in part and very bad for us and so these chronic stressors impact the end organ the tissue and it's real pain it doesn't mean that we need to go get back surgery it means that probably we need to identify the stressors that are contributing to that and address those and we'll often find that in the scenarios you outline that the pain gets better um some of those targets are interesting um there's a lot of memory associated with pain this is where early life events occur and those early life events and injuries can sensitize us to Future vulnerability so I was in a car act bad car accident when I was 16 uh fortunate to walk away from it got bad Whiplash if I get stressed a lot of my pain manifests in my neck for me as a pain doc it's a signal to me that's like go work out go for a walk in the forest you know uh and take some time away from the computer again that's a simplistic message and my experience doesn't translate into everybody else but I'm just validating everything that you you said let's consider the opposite scenario which is positive emotions uh you've done some very nice studies exploring how being in positive relationships being in love in fact can change our perception that is our experience of pain and probably does so at real physiological levels as you mentioned earlier psychological is physiological and vice versa it's hard to separate the two but could you share with us uh you did in that study and what you found because I find it really interesting and it also points to the incredible power of love in uh how we experience life yeah yeah I think there's several cool things about that study that I love to share one is how it all came about so um you know us Neuroscience Geeks often go to the society for Neuroscience as an annual meeting and I was hanging out in a sharing a room with art Aaron who studies passionate love and he and his wife study passionate love and we were having a glass or two of wine and I'm asking art have you ever you know have you ever studied pain he's like no I study love and he's like have you ever studied love no I study pain has anybody ever studied the intersection another glass of wine no let's do it so we came back to Stanford and there was a young postto Jared younger who's now a professor at University of Alabama and I said Jared we're either going to fall flat in her face or we're going to this is going to be a cool study and Jared took this on great job so what we did is we advertised on campus for couples in an early phase of a romantic relationship because there's a reason for choosing that in an early phase of a romantic relationship you are deeply focused on your beloved they're on your mind all the time you feel great when you're with them you feel terrible when you're not with them doesn't that just sound like an addiction I mean it's that yearning uh I don't know that's it's can be a pleasant experience but addictions you know for the people who are using the substance can find it you know in that early phase very pleasant but it it turns out that the early phase of a romantic relationship engages the same neural circuitries as addiction interesting same reward circuitry all that so we chose that and so he said come to us and bring pictures of your beloved and bring pictures of an equally attractive acquaintance clothed this isn't sex that we're studying uh clothed and we caus them pain in the scanner and and and we paid them afterwards um we needed a control condition for this because thinking about your beloved is very uh attentionally demanding remember we talked about attentional distraction earlier so we gave people what's called a word generation task very simply um can you think about every sport that doesn't involve a ball okay uh frisbee hockey boxing boxing okay that's attentionally demanding think about every vegetable that's not green and you know so you're running that through your head and we're causing you pain it's an intentional distraction task so we flash people pick pictures of their beloved cause pain flash people of their acquaintance cause pain and then distraction okay what did we find love works great love works great it was a wonderful analgesic it significantly reduced people's pain and it turned out the more in love you were the more pain relief you got when viewing the photo of the person you love yes when viewing the photo of the person you love now how did we know how much in love they were it turns out the psychologists have got scales for everything and one of them is a passionate love scale which asks how what percentage of the day are you preoccupied thinking about your beloved oh goodness you just sent people now off to give their Partners the passionate love scale to figure out how much time they're spending thinking about them yeah we we had Stanford students some of them thinking about their beloved 80% of the day uh I wanted to use this as a screening tool for our resident applicants because uh I I I want them focusing on patience not their beloved and that is by the way a joke that bad joke but but probably is real world we're not just talking about Stanford I mean but when somebody's writing you a script or a prescription that is or giving you advice um yeah you might want to know if they are in a new romantic relationship yeah so the the the other I thought the other uh cool thing about this study was attention worked also but attention and love worked on different C so attentional distraction they worked equally well attention again worked on some of these prefrontal regions these outer cortical areas love worked on more of what we classically think of as these reward-based circuits the nucleus accumbens uh the amydala um one of the the descending uh brain stem regions called the substantia which is coming down from the brain through that area to the spinal cord to inhibit pain so classic addiction Pathways classic and so the key again message for people is um different what we would think of as psychological approaches engaging different brain circuits to reduce pain I'll leave you with one last uh side note that we didn't publish on and that is uh Jered went back a year later and we assessed the student strength of their relationship if assuming it was still ongoing and he found that there was a rather High correlation between the love induced analgesia and brain activity in the kodate nucleus and in the insular with the strength of their relationship a year later it was so we had a brain scan that was a predictor of future um strength of a relationship could you tell us the direction of those results so if a new romantic partner ship is uh creating high levels of activity in these two brain areas you just mentioned then it is a very good predictor that the relationship will yes survive over time well in this limited sample it meant that it it was going to be very strong a year later um understand and you know Andrew we always have to put these caveats unpublished non-peer reviewed it was a fun post ha data analysis that I'm not sure if anybody's ever you know run with those kind of things no but we can explore it in a in a playful way now and people can do with it what they will it does sort of speak to something important though um assuming that result would hold up if the same experiment were done and you know many hundreds or thousands of people sort of speaks to the idea that the activation of these addiction-like circuits in the early phase of a passionate love relationship set in motion a certain number of things that create cre stability in that relationship which on the face of it um makes sense but we've also all heard it the opposite way of well as well which is you know um Fools Rush In or that uh things that start fast end fast or things like that but here you're talking about um the early phase of passion serving this interesting role in terms of analgesia uh alleviating pain but also predicting some stability of the relationship over time it's kind of interesting it's fascinating to talk about uh you know I feel like I have to put that cavy that not generalized but a fun thing to talk about and it's where I think cool scientific ideas can come from for future exploration that I think that's also what's pretty neat um I find the um you know again the different circuits for different approaches to reducing pain fascinating again that gets to the question you asked me earlier is there one circuit and the answer is no what we have to do is figure out what is the best circuit for a particular person or set of circuits if you're willing I'd like to talk about opioids first if you could educate us on endogenous opioids the opioids that we make inside of our body that we don't that meaning nobody takes as a drug and then how that informs opioids that people take I mean clearly the so-called opioid crisis is a concern many people addicted to opioids people have died from taking too many opioids but presumably some people have benefited from these opioid drugs as well so would like to talk about that and then I'd like to also talk about some of the um things that are adjacent to the prescription opioids things like katom which right now are sort of called into question as to whether or not they will continue to be legally available over the counter so first and foremost what are the endogenous opioids how do they work and that I think will set the stage for the rest yeah yeah so we all have these endogenous and keyins and endorphins that um act as painkillers they are uh analgesics they are natural substances in all of us that get expressed uh there is a certain endogenous tone to these that some have uh done research on here again Jared did research on this and Steven Brule and others on showing that higher endogenous opio levels May um you know lead to less emotional reactivity for instance um thank God we you know we have endogenous opioids or you know we just couldn't handle it um what chemists have figured out is how to you know bring in exogenous opioids and morphine was the prototypical one uh from the from the poppy and since then medicinal chemists have built on variations of morphine and created other compounds some again variations on morphine some are purely synthetic like the oxycodone could I ask a question because I'm fascinated by the history of these things how did or when and or when did somebody look at the poppy and then say Oh I'm going to start eating poppies or isolating things from poppies and realize that that morphine thousands of years ago okay so poppies have been used for a very long time long long time these things have been around um so this is uh this is old school work that's only been refined in more contemporary history and the whole topic of opioids is such an incredibly controversial area and I I feel like I have to you know you have to understand the speaker my in this case me my you know one's position on this um my usual Mantra is I am not pro- opioid I am not antiopioid I Am pro patient so I have seen opioids positively transform people's lives help them get back to work spend time with friends and family relieve suffering particularly in situations um end of life but also in people with chronic pain and I have seen opioids destroy lives at a personal level I come from a family background deep deep in addiction I have lost close loved family members to addiction and I'm respectful of that what I've learned is to not get into this binary mode of thinking it's either this or it's this but to treat opioids as a clinician as a tool to be used in certain circumstances in some people not typically as a Frontline or first line agent um typically much later down if they have failed other therapies you cannot approach the challenge of opioids uh without appreciating the Deep complexity that we're faced with particularly now in society with all of the the litigation ongoing and all the the money involved um it's a it's a highly nuanced topic so what what what more would you like to talk about opioids well I think that most people hear about the opioid crisis and just assume that they are quote unquote overprescribed that people are given opioid drugs as a Frontline treatment perhaps more than they should that the addictive component which I understand is very real that the potential for addiction is very real um as well as the potential for um cross interactions with other things like alcohol um and perhaps even other illicit drugs you know street drugs perhaps if like if people can't fill their prescriptions um and tolerance to the opioids creating issues where people then need more of them they're doing I have a not close family member but a a you know distant family member who had his entire life arranged beautifully he was a practicing lawyer with a beautiful wife and family had a back injury uh was prescribed Oxycontin it it helped initially but then it it set off some behavioral psychological Pathways that had him seeking more forging prescriptions when you know he understood the law he was a lawyer he eventually went to jail got out the same thing happened again he eventually ended up dead right so and I think there are many examples of that that we hear about and those are very Salient and very disturbing very saddening so I think that most people including myself hear the opioid crisis and assume that we really should be doing is Seeking a better alternative but what I'm hearing from you is that there are use cases where opioids make a great deal of sense and that they've really helped improve people's lives and that none of what I just described or anything like it is experienced by those people in fact quite the opposite do I have that right perfectly and and that's again where we we we need to treat these at an individual level on a caseby casee basis um and that one one size doesn't fit all um yes opioids were overprescribed I think everybody agrees to that in this country um and we went through a period of time with massive overprescribing and there's a lot of nuance and reasons why in large part um Physicians we get terrible education around pain and we don't know how to treat it in general coming out of medical school we get about 7 hours of Education on pain U veterinarians get 40 it's great if you're taking I think your dog's name is Castello yeah unfortunately he passed but he took some pain meds for a short while but I found an alternative treatment that worked far better perfect which turned out to be by the way lowd dose testosterone he was castrated like he was fixed when he was younger um and I it's interesting i' I've gone i' I've said publicly on very large scale podcasts that I gave my dog low do testosterone later in life and it ameliorated a lot of his aches and pains at least from what I understood cuz he started moving better and feeling better and sleeping better and I expected the veterinary Community to come after me with pitchforks not one wow did that and yet I heard from hundreds of veterinarians that said yes we wish that we could prescribe those sorts of things to people who castrate their male dogs later in life to humiliate their symptoms um so that opened up to me a whole uh world of understanding about some of the restrictions that vet that vets face in terms of what they prescribe there's a whole discussion to be had about that we'll do a series on animal and pet health vet health great well the Vets hopefully are healthy too you get the point yeah but when it comes to the opioid crisis in this discussion you know I think it's become so Laden with the idea that like doctors are on the take like they're getting paid to give opioids to patients and that's why they're doing that and and I don't believe that necessarily be the case but I think that's what the public perception is that it's all Financial here's the here's the thing um were there bad docks doing bad things yes um I'm going to invoke uh a good friend of mine Keith humph at St oh yeah terrific terrific um psychologist who an addiction medicine uh psychologist and public policy person and the way he breaks it down and I subscribed to this is you know the there's three types of Physicians remember there's about a million physicians in this country about a million um you've got Physicians doing the right thing for the right reasons vast majority dos we need to leave them alone we need to support them we need to help them do their job and not put more obstructions in their way there is a much smaller group of docs doing the wrong thing for the right reasons what I mean by that is these are docs who did overprescribe opioids in this case in this context they um did buy into the marketing messages that were put forward they did not have much education around Alternatives in treating pain and they thought by handing out pills just pills uh in their very brief visits with patients remember primary Carex as my heart goes out to them you know what do they get 14 minutes or so with the patient they gave them something that they thought would help they were doing the the wrong thing for the right reasons but they believed that they were helping they didn't have they weren't catching Financial incentives or okay got it that's right those people we need to educate them we need to train them on proper pain management opioid prescribing deprescribing and then you've got the tiny little group at the top of this if you will pyramid these are um docks doing the wrong thing for the wrong reasons these are bad docks these are your pill Mills these are people breaking the law they need to go to jail end of um the thing is is that that little group at the top in the million or so Physicians we have in this country it represents such a small representation but it got blown out by the media and everybody else particularly those docks doing the right thing for the right reasons got caught up in it it engendered a huge amount of fear huge amount of fear on the physician side and then what happened is the docs just started abandoning patients they cut their patients off um I had a young housewife two young kids uh doc Cut Her Off from a little bit of vicadin that she was taken intermittently for um um some back pain that had been well managed on this she was doing all the right things cut her off she turned to black tar heroin you know um California great state of California tried an experiment where they mon monitor death certificates in our state for and the docs prescribing opioids for that and uh they went after the docs thinking that if they targeted the docs doing that it would lead to a reduce a reduction in opioid deaths it led to a doubling I know counterintuitive because what happened is the docs abandoned the patients and so we have to be aware of the negative consequences of this now the current I'm not Trying to minimize the opioid crisis because it's real but we also now need to put some context the opioid crisis is being driven by the illicit fenel it is more if you just look at the CDC data it's very clear that the fenel coming in Via Mexico China and others uh is what driving most of the deaths um Keith um getting back to Keith led a beautiful uh Lance at Stanford Commission on the North American opioid crisis and put together a very rational plan I just finished serving as a senior adviser to the medical board of California where we revised our prescribing guidelines here they were very Draconian before hard limits made people fearful both patients and docs and we've shifted it back over to put the control back in the hands of the physician patient relationship uh we're hoping it'll make a difference you can see I'm I'm uh I'm going on a bit here there's there's just huge complexity in this space uh I understand you're going to do an episode you know some some time on it in the future and I hope the audience has more opportunity to listen to this other questions I can answer for you though on that yeah I really appreciate the thoroughness of your answer um I think that you set a picture in a context that I certainly didn't understand or appreciate um and it sounds like one certainly not the only but one of the major issues is the creation and the propagation of a black market by doctors cutting off patients presumably out of fear um those patients then seeking not any but um illicit or black market routes to treating their pain which you can understand why they would do that I mean I'm not justifying anyone doing anything illegal but somebody's in pain and they had something that worked and now they don't and they're going to go looking for things that are similar to that thing and um you're telling us that fentanyl in street drugs basically is what's killing people presumably I doubt it's fentanyl prescribed by physicians or perhaps it is it's not no there used to be a bit of confusion around that because fentanyl is a prescribed medication in a patch form and in a troch the troch used for end of life cancer pain but unfortunately some of the coding used by the CDC in other words got that confused with the elicit and so it took a while to get a better handle on it but I think you know we do now yes most of it is being driven by the fenel and we're just seeing this incredible epidemic wave of it it can be made so cheaply brought across the borders reasonably easily uh something we definitely need to do to address we want to be careful about not conflating that crisis with the issue of pain which is an epidemic in its own right and for the segment of people who are using opioids responsibly and effectively for their pain um and that's where again that Nuance comes in um are there patients who are also on opioids that have been weaned down you can wean them down gently compassionately and they do better um the answer is yes uh my partner Beth is just finishing up a study on that and you know showing that with Compassionate Care a number of these patients can be weaned down who voluntarily want to come down and sometimes they find their pain actually improves and part of that Improvement may be that opioids have degrees of side effects and by elimination of those side effects and the um the other aspects they're seeing Improvement could you list off some of the more um commonly used opioids um you know morphine and it's uh commercial Del uh commercial derivatives Ms conton which is a long- lasting version of morphine oxycodone which by itself is a short acting medication but when you encapsulate it in a long acting version it becomes Oxycontin which was the trade name that Purdue uh put forward um fentanyl we mentioned comes in a patch form uh there are mixed agents like uh Tramadol which is a kind of a weak opioid but also has some uh what's called serotonin and norrine reuptake inhibition uh we've got diloted which is a version of uh trade name for hydromorphone so there's a slew there's I don't know more than 20 different opioids within that list of 200 medications that we have methadone is another one um people usually think of methadone is uh a medication used to uh treat addiction people go to methadone clinics it's a longlasting opioid in the right person and certain circumstances it can be used effectively for chronic pain um by and large they all have the same or similar mechanisms of actions working on opioid receptors this is getting back to your original question to me about where these things work there are opioid receptors in the periphery there are rich sources of opioid receptors in the spinal cord and the dorsal um the uh back part of the spinal cord and then there are many areas in the brain that are rich in opioid receptors it's you know it's all a naturally occurring area when we put in an opioid by mouth we're binding to those receptors and activating those neural circuits in many cases when I say activating they have an inhibitory role I mean that's one of the major parts is there any role for benzodiazapines in pain relief rarely if to I many of my colleagues would say you know Sean it's just a hard no um I Andrew I'd have to come up with an edge condition of somebody who has a generalized anxiety disorder un poorly treated with anti- anxiolytics with chronic pain and when you find you treat their anxiety with like a benzo it helps with their pain as well the but these are Edge conditions by and large no got it and what about katum I had a um a odd experience with katum and I've never taken it uh the experience was the following I started learning about it hearing about it uh from listeners on the podcast realized by doing a little bit of a web search that it's available over the counter and that certain people like to take it often like every day at low doses or even higher Doses and that there was huge variation in terms of the amount of katum in the various products and how much people were taking some people talking about as something was as if it were innocuous and we can ask whether or not indeed it is innocuous and so I put out a a tweet I guess now that Twitter is called X I guess I put out an X anyway doesn't matter and I and I said that my um first pass view of the literature on katum the scientific literature is that you know it had a lot of property similar to opioids although different as well and that it seemed kind of odd and maybe even problematic that it was so widely available and I got bombarded with um I don't want to call them katum enthusiasts because what I soon discovered was that these people um were angry with me for um placing even a partial Shadow on katum but what was interesting to me was that they were saying that in their case and I'm assuming they were telling the truth that katum had helped them get off prescription opioids and that they heavily rely on katum in various do levels of dosage um in ways that they felt really help them and so two things happened one I've been put in the crosshairs of the prrum community not not to a a severe extent but perhaps the more important thing is and I want to thank that Community uh in part for you know now it's inspired me to do a deep dive search on katum I'm going to be interviewing one of the Laboratories that's done a lot of the research on katum later in uh 2024 but also it it's made me realize like there these compounds that are available over the counter that many people feel so passionately about because they really feel like it's helped them I'm not saying it has I'm not saying it hasn't but then again I've never taken it what is katum at or perhaps what receptors does it tickle and what are your thoughts about katum and people using katum and maybe I'm pronouncing it wrong I've also heard Crome I'm calling it katum yeah uh katum is this natural substance that does have as you said opiod deric um properties as well as others that is not fully understood it's been available well naturally for many many years brought in to the United States and I've heard the same stories and I just want you to be prepared that anything I say about katum there's going to be some angry people after this and it is what it is um I have heard the same stories that you have heard about people taking katum and saying it's helping them to stay off of uh prescription opioids or illicit opioids and I get that I think in some way it's binding opioid re ctors and reducing the uh natural craving for these other substances and it makes perfect sense methadone does that buern morphine which I didn't mention before but is a is an interesting opioid that U binds to these receptors and it reduces craving um where I have challenges is in uh just because something is natural doesn't mean that it is safe we are seeing an increased number of Overdose deaths associated with katum um is it poly substance yeah in some cases it is but I think there's a lot we don't know so so poly substance people taking creatum but also alcohol uh benzos getting back to the benzos um personally uh I think we need to put a lot of research into this agent and if it merits it I think it should be a uh a prescribed substance I think part of the challenge that we have is that we don't understand the quality the Purity the dose that people are taking of this thing uh you know similar type of story with cannabis by the way uh so I'm hoping that we're going to get the research that we need to really understand what it's doing and whether it is safe and effective I'm left with a lot of unknowns right now you mentioned cannabis is cannabis effective and by extension is CBD effective for managing pain yeah there's another controversial one you'll get a few comments about whatever I say you know in general listeners of this podcast yes they tell us where they're upset they'll also tell us where they agree um are our goal here is never to um satisfy everybody but just to you know some of this lands in the in the of Highly Educated opinion um some of it is still as you pointed out speculation because we don't really know what Crum sources people are taking or cannabis Etc but um I think you'll find and my experience has been that um people appreciate that we're having the conversation and we do read all the comments and those comments often as I mentioned in my earlier anecdote about that tweet um often direct us to explore things further and we can always have a you know a second discussion about this down the line so we invite all your comments and criticism cannabis well here's what we know in carefully controlled laboratory situations cannabis has been shown to reduce neuropathic pain that's that nerve related pain from people who have either nerve injury uh diabetic neuropathy uh post-rape neuralgia terrible burning nerve pain condition it has been shown to reduce that in small samples from large larger scale epidemiology studies and even larger like Clinic based studies that I've done we find it has not been particularly helpful on average compared to people not on uh cannabis there's a lot we don't know about the causality of that and the direction of it but all to say that there are um many many questions that remain um I think the challenge that I personally have is that we're running huge population level experiments as we speak right now by you know providing unfettered use of cannabis and the bad news is is that we're probably going to see some real UNT consequences of it and we're already are um the good news is I'm hoping that at a state level we'll be able to use that data to really inform um what's going on with cannabis I mean some of the challenges are what I referred to with uh cannabis is not cannabis is not cannabis you to CBD ratios the dose yes all of that we don't know what you're getting it remains a scheduled One Drug by the DEA um I uh in some of my leadership roles and others have called for scheduling of it as a schedule to why why not to purposely try to restrict use but by making it a schedule to drug you've now made it so much easier to research uh I don't know if people understand how many barriers there are to scientists studying schedule one drugs could you explain schedule one versus schedule two thank you yeah so schedule the scheduling of drugs is a categorization that describes their abuse liability and so you have drugs like PCP heroin um cannabis which are schedule one which are defined as having high addiction potential and no uh utility which is just wild because when I think about PCP Fen cycline I certainly don't want people to run out and start taking PCP but chemically and physiologically PCP is ever so similar to ketamine and you know rarely is this discussed but ketamine is now uh widely used as a therapeutic presumably ketamine isn't scheduled to uh maybe even schedule three yes and so some of the the the stuff that's thrown into schedule one makes no sense it's historical it's all his it's decades and decades ago of history and clearly cannabis should not be a schedule one hands down no question uh by scheduling it though you will have the societal benefit of being able to make it more easy to study and then you get the NIH and the FDA into this and we can start really getting answers to the questions which I do I think it works at the end of the day do I think there is some variation of cannabis THC CBD ratios that will provide some benefit oh absolutely there's too many receptors in our brain that are involved with modulation of pain I just don't know what those are um a friend of mine uh Mark Wallace uh runs pain at UC San Diego go has come up with a really nice recipe cocktail of ratios of THC to CBD that he feels very strongly that he can help people um using that as an active agent yeah I know that in uh Colorado there's a strain of cannabis where they it's pure CBD no THC I think they call it Charlotte's Web and parents of children with intractable epilepsy will actually move to the state of Colorado in in order to get it because it seems to be effective for the treatment of certain forms of pediatric epilepsy that was shared with me with one of our colleagues Nolan Williams when he was a guest on the podcast so these plant-based compounds have have their place whether or not it's katum perhaps right we're remaining open about that or cannabis the T the THC or the CBD or some combination I think it's really interesting I think as long as we're talking about plant compounds how do you view the fields that are what I would call somewhat adjacent to traditional medicine so things like acupuncture Chiropractic physical therapy and so forth as a pain physician uh within the field of pain medicine or pain management I think about six broad categories of therapies that we provide for people with chronic pain one of these uh is the medications and there's a whole large group of categories of medications of 200 or so uh available two nerve blocks uh and procedures these range everything from trigger point injections to nerve blocks with local anesthetic and steroid on up to minimally invasive procedures like spinal cord stimulators uh implantation of drug delivery pumps three psychological and behavioral therapies pain psychology which has many forms now can be very effective four physical and occupational therapy approaches to chronic pain five this is what we we typically call comp implen alternative medicine approaches it's a little bit of an outdated term but I think of that as acupuncture neutraceuticals these are the over-the-counter agents that have actually shown to have benefit in pain that you can get over the counter and last but not least six what I call self-empowerment uh or increasing your agency and here it's about education it's about uh learning skills it's about being here on the hubman you know Lab podcast learning about pay pain um it's it's that self-empowerment and what we find is that those six categories all brought together typically have the best benefit for people living with chronic pain to a lot of people listening to us right now think oh yeah acupuncture I mean this is a you know thousands or tens of thousands of years old practice that clearly is grounded in a lot of clinical data and clearly works and then other people will go oh my goodness they're talking about acupuncture like sticking needles in the body are they just like pain treats pain is that what it is about but um as you and I both know unless it's being performed um incorrectly acupuncture is not painful to receive does acupuncture help treat certain forms of pain is there any scientific basis yes yes there is um do I understand what's going on with acupuncture having completed an act an NIH funded acupuncture study I just saw that uh published no uh you know I'm I'm just being straight um we still don't know exactly how acupuncture is working uh we do know that there's a nice study that showed activation of peripheral adenosine receptors that have a peripheral analgesic effect we know that acupuncture as compared to Sham acupuncture engages different brain regions it's interesting that many of the acue points overly peripheral nerves and so by needling those nerves are we causing a central change we're turning down the amplifier if you will in the brain maybe um where does this fit into my clinical use my usual statement is that if you can afford the wallet biopsy give it a try although find a really good acupuncturist I've oh yeah yeah I've had acupuncture done uh I wouldn't say many times but several times and I will say this um one of the acupuncturists I went to put needles in my face and I ended up having to go to Stanford Derm to get some of the angomas that were like blood vessel growth that was the consequence of those needle insertions and so I to the point where I won't if I go to acupuncture I'm like don't put anything don't put any needles in my face because I'll take an angom on my leg or whatever I don't care and I it's not vanity but I didn't like the way that the needles were introducing angomas to my face now that was probably because this acupuncturist wasn't doing things correctly not saying all acupuncturist do that but here's the problem how do you know know which acupuncturists are reliable versus not and for that matter how do you know which physician is reliable versus not I mean I work at an institution like Stanford where I can ask a lot of people and I still my uh senior administrators won't like this but when I get a recommendation from a doc at Stanford I always call somebody at UCSF and cross check yeah and I don't tell them that I'm cross-checking and I'll do the reverse as well when I when I was at UC San Diego I would check up with Stanford so but most people don't have access to that kind of community I mean I can pick up the phone and contact somebody in pretty much any medical specialty and at multiple institutions but for most people they're waiting into the abyss of acupuncturists of Physicians I mean how do are people supposed to navigate this you found a perfect way to do it and many of us do the same thing and for those who don't have access to highquality experts you can use variations of that so you're right with acupuncture most of the ones I've been associated with we use in the clinic or outside are all have been high quality the recommendation would be to try to get uh a referral or recommendation from somebody who refers to that acupuncturist docs want to have relationships with people with other clinicians that do a really good job we don't want to be referring to somebody who's bad because it reflects badly on us so it's really doing what in a way what you were doing so so try to connect with your primary care doctor others and get some recommendation um for who is high quality um with regard to clinicians pain Physicians for instance that's tough there's 5 to 10,000 of us that are Subs specialty trained out there if your pain is really complicated a complex pain problem you're probably better off with a ter a referral center that can provide comprehensive Services where possible so is there a is there a centralized website where people can say okay I live in the state of Iowa or I'm um you know a lot of our listeners are overseas or you know where people can find out the like the uh the ratings based on patient experience although that can be complicated I confess sure the one star out of five star ratings are are a little bit more Salient there' been studies on this people tend to if you know you see a negative review those tend to grab your attention even if there fewer of them than the many thousands of positive reviews but I mean patients should be able to get the information that they want about previous patients experience right yeah I got to tell you the uh the patient ratings um it's a highly manipulated situation um how so well you can pay companies to help jack up your ratings I see that's it's rather easy I see it in the community all the inflation of ratings oh my yes inflation of ratings and so then you inflate it and it overcomes any of the negative ones um we haven't taken an approach uh on this and maybe that's naive of us um you know we see 25,000 patient visits a year and only a tiny percentage of them put some rating and it's probably the extremes undoubtedly but we don't manage it I know that in many Community settings that they do I didn't answer your question is there a reliable source of quality I still think at the end it's going to be uh relationships and word of mouth and referral I do the same thing you do I you know to see Hannah Watford the allergist I asked my primary care doc at Sanford who's the best who is the person that knows the most about food related issues well some really entrepreneurial guy or gal or group of guy or gals will put together a website or an app or something that really uh addresses this problem head on because I can think of of very few things more useful than a truly independent way of understanding prior patient experience and finding the best person for a particular problem and I think AI can help with this yeah but I think Ai and you know human interface anyway somebody out there should do it um I'm curious about Chiropractic for a lot of people again not chiropractors let's not talk about the people specifically but Chiropractic a lot of people put acupuncture and Chiropractic um adjacent to one another but my understanding is that insurance often will cover acupuncture but not Chiropractic work um maybe I got that backwards or maybe I'm just all out wrong but you know with Chiropractic work you're talking about often the attempt to relieve um compression of nerves certainly nerves are being manipulated if any part of the body is being manipulated I guess manipulate is kind of a word that implies something sinister is happening it's being um adjusted um what are your thoughts about chiropractors assuming the chiropractor is well trained and responsible can it help pain can it help back pain neck pain whole body pain yeah first of all uh acupuncturist and Chiropractic are two entirely different professions just to just to be clear for people and they sometimes get lumped into a similar category of pain treatments and that may be where uh you know that comes from uh just closing out on the acupuncture again um just to summarize yes in some patients in some circumstances I found acupuncture to be useful and it's worth a try CMS uh Center uh Medicare uh is now paying for acupuncture for people over the age of 65 uh Medicare for Medicare patients that's something recent and uh we were happy to see that I believe that was for back pain that should be fact checked um but Chiropractic mixed data uh um well controlled studies some of some have shown that it can be helpful for low back pain uh some have shown it isn't it's it's truly not clear uh the type of Chiropractic that involves uh that doesn't involve kind of you know the the fast High Velocity manipulation as a physician I have some concerns about that particularly around the neck uh I've taken care of patients that have had vertebral artery dissections from um that rapid wrenching what is a a vertebral Artery Dissection one of the the the main arteries that goes um from the body to the brain and the back portion of it is called the vertebral artery and uh when you do these high velocity manipulations um there is a risk albeit small of having a dissection or an emis thrown off and I've had so it's like a stroke it's like it is a yeah it's like a stroke um but there's a lot of approaches that can be done that uh in some patients have shown some shown some benefit I think the key with a number of these therapies and I don't want to single out AC acupuncture or Chiropractic if you go to them ask yourself am I getting durable benefit meaning everybody feels good after a massage right but couple few hours later it's kind of worn off it's a nice experience in the moment for most people if you're finding that for acupuncture Chiropractic or anything for that matter you know ask yourself is it really providing you durable benefit that is worth the effort um or is it just rapid it feels good in the moment we tend to use that in our clinical practice is a threshold you know and we like to see things that last for a longer period of time and in many of these treatments whether it be acupuncture Chiropractic we use those as an inroad into more of a functional rehabilitative approach uh meaning when you get chronic pain you tend to uh withdraw you tend to stop ex exercising you stop moving your muscle atrophy you become deconditioned because of the pain and so we want to use these tools that we've been talking about as a way to get people engaged in activity to correct the underlying biomechanical issues that may be present and so they all need to be appropriately staged and that's where working with a good clinician can help with that yes certainly in my case anytime I've had back pain even when it was very severe provided I wasn't harmed and I was just hurt uh continuing to move and not becoming sedentary was absolutely the fastest route to recovery and um and in particular doing certain exercises that uh that were particular to my my case um what if any is the role for physical therapists in the treatment of chronic pain absolutely crucial absolutely crucial uh despite being a physician not a physical therapist I have great appreciation and respect for what the physical rehabilitative approaches do because at the end of the day we're trying to get people back to an improved quality of life and physical functioning I mean that and is often what people are most looking for control over their pain control over their life yes reduction and pain but more being able to do more things and there tying in with good physical therapist occupational therapists people who can do uh goal setting uh absolutely critical all of the treatments that I provide typically are meant to help support an increase in physical rehabilitative approaches and so when I do nerve blocks or procedures or give them medication and if we end up reducing some pain we want to tie that in with more activity and what the physical therapists are great particularly those trained in chronic pain is knowing that that difference between hurt and harm they can work with people to know what's safe for them to do to rehabilitate they can teach them uh more about body mechanics and help improve endurance and strength uh they can work around pacing pacing is so critical for people with chronic pain now this isn't just exclusive to the physical therapists the psychologist do pacing I do pacing what is pacing here's the problem with chronic pain one of the many problems it waxes and waines and so what happens is you go out and have a good day you go out like Gang Busters and you go do everything that you haven't been able to do for the last week because you've been in pain and then you pay the price and when you pay the price you're back in bed or you're on the couch and you're not moving and what happens is you go into this roller coaster of of activity and no activity at all and what happens is it entrains in our brain it's a classic negative reinforcement model this is classic psychology and so then people become fearful of more movement and as a consequence they get more and more um disuse uh atrophy and then more disability so the key what do you do about that the key is you set small goals baby steps if you can walk comfortably for a block right now great walk that block tomorrow maybe walk a block plus an extra 50 feet and maybe the next day another 50 feet no more no more if you're having a great day don't go do five blocks you're training for a marathon you're training for the long win now what's going to happen along the way is that you're going to have good days and you're going to have bad days on the good days don't go out and exceed it set a threshold time it on your watch set a Distance on the bad days recognize we all have bad days everybody has bad days and you know you may need some rest during those bad days but then the next day get up and restart you know where you were and that's the type of thing a physical therapist good pain psychologist good physician can help you with and tying that in by the way with these other therapies very interesting I've never heard of pacing but it makes total sense and I can see how people could really hinder their own progress without that basic understanding which thanks to you we now have um and it's something that hopefully all these therapeutic modalities keep in mind I mean I don't know whether or not the acupuncturists are talking to the physical therap therapists are talking to the physician but I guess this is the reason for referrals right why somebody has a primary care dock then then it you know radiates down to uh the rest is that why in a in an ideal utopian world that's exactly it I mean outside of uh Comprehensive Pain centers that have all of the stuff collocated you are dependent on a dock to play quarterback uh and bring all those referrals together it's incredibly challenging for uh Primary Care dock to do that with the limited amount of time they're given to see a person um this is where we're trying to use technology to to help better with that integration and I I do think there's hope for the future we'll have better ways of managing that and handling it what is your view on non-prescription compounds so-called supplements or neutraceuticals for the treatment of pain fascinating topic this country is rather unique in having uh you know a wide slew of over-the-counter agents that are actually um prescription in Europe and in other countries and there are over-the-counter agents that have been shown to be effective for a number of pain conditions so for neuropathic pain acety carnitine is one of them acety carnitine is thought to work on mitochondrial metabolism and improve mitochondrial health and it's been used I believe as a anti-aging and maybe even a cognitive enhancement agent um you need and it's been studied out of an Australian study I think it was called the Sydney trials uh actually and what they found it's one of the few over-the-counter agents that actually had disease modifying properties meaning they studied this in diabetic neuropathy the clinical endpoint was not pain reduction the clinical endpoint was nerve induction velocity changes and that's how we monitor nerve health is in a normal nerve they move nerve pulses move at a certain rate and when they're injured from diabetes they they you know it's much slower and you lose signal this actually improved nerve Health you can buy those at a vitamin shop uh order them online uh alphal lipoic acid is another one alphal lipoic acid uh at least two mechanisms one is it's a free radical scavenger and second uh that's been more recent is it is a ttype calcium channel modulator and calcium channels are in our nerves and it uh turns those down and it can have some benefit for neuropathic pain um people have taken alphalipoic acid for a general sense of well-being and it is generally well tolerated it can cause a little bit of stomach upset I will tell you I took this one myself for a while and this is you know again just an N of one what I found though is you have ttype calcium channels in your heart and I do hit uh high intensity interval training and I was Finding I couldn't get my heart rate over 150 so I had I stopped it um that's not a adverse event that's just an annoyance but that's useful um vitamin C so if you're going in for surgery and it's a maybe a nerve related surgery that you're going to have they found vitamin C prophylactically can reduce the likelihood of having certain nerve pain conditions after surgery fish oil the Omega-3s have been found to be beneficial uh around chronic pain um more recently the data here is on smaller numbers creatine which I imagine you've probably talked about it at at some length but creatine has shown in small pilot studies some benefit in fi myalgia and some other uh types of conditions so there are a number of these substances that are backed up beyond the uh you know the anic data that we joke about the anecdotal there's actually good randomized control trials and this is uh something that people can uh easily take advantage of um just be mindful that just because it's natural just because it's over the counter doesn't equate with 100% safety meaning get educated about the side effects and the Adverse Events get educated about the drug drug interactions the agent agent interactions and for instance there are these over-the-counter agents some of which um you want to be careful of and not taking when you're going into surgery because they can be uh platelet Inhibitors and they can cause you to bleed more isn't vitamin C one such comp uh substance that that causes uh excessive bleeding or or some people report that um high levels of Omega-3s can increase the um can reduce the viscosity of the blood meaning you bleed easier the the Omega-3s of fish oils yes absolutely the vitamin C I'm not familiar honestly with that as a blood thinging agent maybe I'm I'm uh misinformed there or or maybe I'm just for it but that's that's one I don't usually think of as a a blunt thinner someone will put in the show note comments one way or the other I'll get corrected I I but there's a number of these over-the-counter agents that are uh that are available the vast majority are innocuous that I've mentioned that I've mentioned there meaning they they don't uh cause harm at the at reasonable dosage um uh but they can have positive effects well perfectly stated yeah well thank you for sharing that list I think um as you mentioned many compounds that are only available by prescription overseas are are indeed available over the counter in the US in this area of neutral like supplements is um still an area that's actively debated depending on people's stance but it's refreshing to hear somebody who's you know a uh um formerly trained physician and um and scientist who um Embraces so many different approaches in in the treatment of pain along those lines um perhaps you'd be willing to talk about the olical treatments that can be effective for pain again absolutely critical in the management of people with you know wide range of pain problems and recall what we talked about is you know this is no susception these are the signals coming up to the brain once it hits the brain you know we're dealing with everything that person is Liv through and also is currently experiencing meaning there are levels of anxiety depression how they cope with pain in the past how they cope with it now uh early uh life experiences is a paper that just came out in jamama uh literally in the last few days where they did a metaanalysis of brain Imaging studies on people with early adverse life events and what they found is abnormalities in emotional processing emotional functioning and people who have these um giving strong evidence that what happens to you early in life impacts us as adults and stays with us it changes our wiring now this is where in part pain psychologists behavioral therapists can come in they can help with some of the uh maladaptive coping the the thought processes involved with pain they can help teach skills so for the vast majority of pain psychology this is not your typical psychoanalytic lying on a couch you know talking about you know whatever this is about teaching people skills um incredibly helpful uh does it eliminate pain um few of the things that we do actually eliminate pain what we're trying to do is Chip Away you know a little bit with this medication a little bit with this proc some this procedure bit with psychology we're trying to hit all of these Pathways in aggregate U to make a real difference the pain psychologist use classically techniques like cognitive behavioral therapy which involves often recognizing these unhelpful thoughts and patterns that we all get into around pain and even life to interrupting those thoughts to helping people again with with goal setting and pacing to teach people relaxation techniques through deep breathing um things like biof feedback um in Silicon Valley where I practice the engineers love the biof feedback I'm an engineer by formal training so I get it but it's that closed loop feedback because remember the the brain is controlling the periphery and controlling the sympathetic nervous system and when we're in pain our sympath sythetic nervous system gets revved up when the sympathetic nervous system gets revved up blood vessels constrict uh heart rate goes up our muscles get tense um and we need sometimes ways of learning how to calm down that sympathetic nervous system um cognitive behavioral therapy mindfulness-based stress reduction acceptance and commitment therapy are some of the tools that they use my partner Beth has developed a brief inter ition called empowered relief yes I'm biased um it works we've studied this in an NIH funded study and it's a way of getting eight weeks of cogni behavioral therapy in two hours wow not meant to replace CBT but as an additional tool and you're going to see as time goes by more and more of these tools come out and the beauty of them is they're going to be much easier to disseminate broadly to the public than for instance a pill you know I can't we can't just go put into FedEx or the US Post Office you know start sending out pills to everybody but we can develop treatments online that uh can teach people skills and really help is that the plan for this um abbreviated but equally effective cognitive behavioral therapy yes now you're getting into kind of my beths in my life mission so you know I've spent the last 12 years building a uh digital platform a health platform that we've integrated into clinics and capture high quality data covering all aspects of people's physical psychological and social functioning and the reason for that is to address a critical need that we have on better quality data about people the data and the information that we have on people with pain and many health conditions is terrible and so I created this platform to be able to capture high quality data put it to use use AI in the background for prediction and now Beth has created these brief interventions which we're integrating and the notion is to make that widely available for free we're giving it all away like I said this is a life mission we both have been blessed to be at Stanford where we have everything but you know you go just 30 miles 40 miles outside of the Bay Area and you're in a healthc care desert and I don't say that disparaging to any docs working out there but it's different there's only a handful of large academic centers and large practices in the country but you get outside those those catchment areas people struggle with how to get good quality care you asked that question earlier how do you find good quality care and so we're working to make that that available to everybody fantastic I was going to ask you as a final question what is your if you had one wish for the future of pain medicine and the treatment of pain what that would be um before you answer that um I'll just add an answer that you already gave which is it sounds like the implementation of this um incredible set of tools and database that you've um collaborated with Dr Darnell Beth Darnell to uh to develop is at least one of them so now that that um that answer was given by me then you can it frees up uh the opportunity for you to give another answer what is the if you had one wish for the field of pain medicine uh going forward what what would that wish be yeah so a few years ago um I co-led for the country the development of the national pain strategy and this was uh sponsored by the NIH and health and human services and I co-led this with Dr Linda Porter from the NIH we brought together 80 uh National experts in pain research pain clinical care pain policy and people with lived experience with pain we put together a strategic plan for the country on how to enact a cultural transformation and change the way we assess uh care for people with pain how we educate professionals how we communicate with the public my wish would be for full implementation of the national pain strategy it unfortunately uh took back seat when it was released the same time with the CDC opioid guidelines and the opioid guidelines sucked all the oxygen out of the room but the the Strategic plan it was well thought out it's the one that we have for our country it's non-controversial nonpartisan it is motherhood and apple pie um and it's if we just actually Implement what we put forward it'll make a huge difference in the lives of people uh living with pain is there anything that people listening to this podcast can do to try and move the implementation of that initiative up are there Congress people to call I mean this is how so that's how I learned in junior high school and high school uh what little I attended and by the way go to school folks I had to catch up a lot but I do do remember them saying that you know this was a democracy is a democracy and that um those phone calls and letters can often matter for what um gets you know sent up the flag pole and what ultimately gets approved and implemented beautifully stated you're you're absolutely right and in fact the nidus for the national pain strategy originally came about through a number of concerned citizens with pain doing that very thing and lobbying what became a bipar you don't hear that much anymore bipartisan effort um to put forward a national Pain Care Act that got put into the Affordable Care Act that called for the development of an Institute of medicine report on pain that led to the National pain strategy all starting with concerned people making those phone calls and writing those letters so that means calling your congressman and congresswoman leaving messages I hear this works I mean I know people they're doing this for other initiatives um and one call two calls doesn't make much of a difference but that if people are saying um you know this is important to them that people in power eventually start taking action the the legis they listen and and in part um Again part of this life mission both to develop this platform I've created a nonprofit um called pain USA and its main mission is to help Advance the implementation of the national pain strategy and baked within that is this platform also to use highquality data to better inform the care of patients of people with pain and to deliver highquality um treatments because we do know also that people listen to data and we need good quality data to influence uh those messages but please yes make those calls write those letters it does work well Sean Dr Mackey thank you so much for everything that you're doing you took us on quite a tour um in terms of depth and breadth of the thing that we think of and unfortunately in some cases experience as pain although we also learned it's highly adaptive in some cases can protect us does indeed protect us thank you for taking us on that tour of the biology the psychology the various treatments the context in which all of this exists we touched into some somewhat controversial areas but I really appreciate the thoroughness and the nuance and the sensitivity with which you touch into all of those issues and um just on behalf of myself and everybody listening I just really want to thank you you've um contributed a great deal today to the public education of what pain is what it isn't and how to treat it so thank you ever so much thank you Dr huberman I appreciate the opportunity to come on and spend some time and uh you're giving a platform to help educate and inform people out there I got to tell you Nobody Does it Better you you've been Absol absolutely amazing and um thank you again thank you it's a labor of love and I appreciate the kind words come back again thank you thank you for joining me today for my discussion all about pain and ways to control pain with Dr Shawn Mackey I hope you found the conversation to be as interesting and as informative as I did to learn more about and explore some of the resources that Dr Macky

Title: David Goggins on Controlling the Multi-Voice Dialogue in Your Mind
Published: 2024-01-09 18:05:07 UTC
Description:
This is an excerpt from the Huberman Lab episode with David Goggins.

It’s a brutally direct, mechanistic, and actionable discussion about how to embrace, confront, and control the dialogue in your mind — paying specific attention to the negative voices as a way to transmute all that into successful real-world behavior. Daily.

One thing is made clear: there is no way to avoid internal agony if your goal is to be the ultimate version of yourself.

The good news is that anyone can do it, but it requires going inward. Over and over again. David explains how.

He also explains how people get distracted by the observable things in others — choosing to point their fingers at others, criticize, focus on hacks, etc, as a way to avoid doing the real internal work for themselves.

The episode is a roadmap anyone can apply to better themselves, but only if they are willing to embrace the full reality of their deepest self-doubts, fears, shame, and darkness. As David explains, that’s the basement and the place from where true growth starts.

Transcript Language: English
You have all these voices that are telling you you're fucked up, and this is going to be hard. But for some reason, you put so much practice into you that you can ignore every one of 'em that are telling you you're not going to fucking make it and still be able to fucking make it because you have put the practice in that you know this is the process. It's such a daunting task that all the voices are saying no, but you still had the conviction that, "I know I can do this," and that's what it took for me to get here. When you put that practice in, every day you lace 'em up... And I don't mean run. It's just a metaphor for life. When you lace them motherfuckers up every day, pretty soon you win. You have the courage and the heart and the dedication and the mindset about everybody can go fuck themselves. I know what I know. I've listened to myself enough to know I know what I know. None of you can hear what I'm hearing. And that's what people don't do enough of. They don't listen to their journey. They listen to everybody else's shit. You're not looking at the truth in front of you. The truth in front of you is it sucks. This is what it takes, creating another voice and sometimes going at it alone.

Transcript Language: English
Now the diabolical thing about the flu virus is that just like the diabolical thing about the cold virus, you start shedding virus, that is you are contagious about 24 hours prior to the onset of first symptoms for you. So that means that you can be a flu viral vector even when you aren't having symptoms. That's just the unfortunate aspect of these viruses. They're very clever, they don't have brains, but these viruses have adapted to propagate from host to host to host. They have a drive to continue to stay alive and to infect more hosts. So even though they don't have a brain, they have a sort of, let's call it viral intelligence. And as I've said several times now, if you are still exhibiting symptoms of the cold or flu, you are contagious. However, with respect to the flu, you are most contagious during the three days when you feel the absolute worst, when your fever is at its worst, when you are coughing, and sneezing, headache, all of that, when that is at its peak, that is when you are most contagious.

Title: How to Prevent & Treat Colds & Flu
Published: 2024-01-08 13:00:07 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I explain the biology of the common cold and flu (influenza) and how the immune system combats these infections. 

I describe behavior, nutrition and supplementation-based tools supported by peer-reviewed research to enhance immune system function and better combat colds and flu. I also dispel common myths about how the cold and flu are transmitted and when you and those around you are contagious. 

I explain if common preventatives and treatments such as vitamin C, zinc, vitamin D and echinacea work. I also highlight other compounds known to reduce contracting and duration of colds and flu. 

I discuss how to use exercise and sauna to bolster the immune response. 

This episode will help listeners understand how to reduce the chances of catching a cold or flu and help people recover more quickly from and prevent the spread of colds and flu.

Correction: I misspoke in the episode. A micron is 1/10,000 of a centimeter, not 1,000. Additionally, 1 millimeter equals 1/10 of a centimeter, not 1/100.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today we are discussing colds and flu we will talk about what a cold really is and what a flu really is in terms of how they impact your brain and body and of course we will discuss how to avoid getting colds and flu there are indeed some excellent science supported techniques to avoid getting colds and flu but of course it is impossible to completely avoid ever getting a colder flu in your lifetime so we also discuss how to more quickly get over a colder flu should you happen to catch one so during today's discussion I'll talk about the immune system I'll give you some mechanistic understanding of how your immune system works and I promise to make that discussion accessible to everybody regardless of whether or not you have a background in biology and with that understanding of how your immune system works you will be in in a much better position to understand which tools that is which protocols to implement should you be exposed to a colder flu or if you are trying to get over a cold or flu more quickly than you would otherwise you'll learn about some potent behavioral tools for bolstering your immune system and we will also discuss various compounds that you might consider taking to enhance the function of your immune system to ward off or treat colds and flu I will also be dispelling a number of common myths about treatments for the common cold C and for the flu there are oh so many ideas out there about what one could take or do in order to avoid getting the colder flu or more quickly get relief from a colder flu however many of those are pure myth there's just no sence to support them and indeed there's some science that counters those ideas but the good news is there are indeed science suppored behavioral protocols and compounds that one could consider in order to avoid and treat colds and flu before we begin I'd like to emphas ize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is ju ju makes medical grade red light therapy devices now if there's one thing I've consistently emphasized on this podcast is the incredible role that light can have on our biology and of course I'm always telling people that they should get some sunlight in their eyes as soon as possible after waking on as many days of their life as possible for sake of setting circadian rhythm daytime mood focus and alertness and improve sleep now in addition to sunlight red light and nearin red light has been shown to have positive effects on improving numerous aspects of cellular and organ Health including faster Muscle Recovery improved skin health and wound healing even improvements in acne or that is removal of acne reducing pain and inflammation improving mitochondrial function and even improving Vision itself what sets ju apart and why it's my preferred red light therapy device is that it has clinically proven wavelengths meaning it uses specific wavelengths of red light and near infrared light in combination that trigger the optimal seller adaptations personally I use the handheld ju every day the handheld ju is about the size of a thick piece of toast and I also own a ju panel that allows for full body exposure and I use that one approximately five times per week for about 10 to 15 minutes per session if you'd like to try ju you can go to ju spelled jv.com huberman again that's jv.com huberman for this month only January 2024 juv is offering exclusive discounts to huberman lab listeners with up to $500 off select ju products again that's ju spell jv.com huberman to get up to $500 off select ju products today's episode is also brought To Us by Helix sleep Helix sleep makes mattresses and pillows CL that are tailored to your unique sleep needs now sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance when we are sleeping well and enough mental health physical health and performance all stand to be at their best one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is to make sure that your mattress is tailored to your unique sleep needs Helix sleep has a brief two-minute quiz that if you go to their website you take that quiz and answer questions such as do you tend to sleep on your back your side or your stomach do you tend to run hot or cold in the middle of the night maybe you don't know the answers to those questions and that's fine at the end of that two-minute quiz they will match you to a mattress that's ideal for your sleep needs I sleep on the dusk D mattress and when I started sleeping on a dusk mattress about 2 years ago my sleep immediately improved so if you're interested in upgrading your mattress go to helixsleep.com huberman take their two-minute sleep quiz and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you and you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order and two free pillows again if interested go to helixsleep.com huberman for up to $350 off and two free pillows today's episode is also brought To Us by Roa Roa makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are the absolute highest quality I've spent a lifetime working on the biology the visual system and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly Roa understands those challenges and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses accordingly so that you always see with Crystal Clarity Roa eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed with a new technology called float fit which allows them to fit perfectly and not move around even when you're active in fact whenever I'm wearing my Roa eyeglasses or sunglasses I usually forget that I'm wearing them I happen to wear Roa eyeglasses at night when I drive or if I'm reading at night and I wear Roa sunglasses during the daytime if it's very bright especially if I'm driving into sunlight if you'd like to try Roa eyeglasses or sunglasses you can go to roka.com that's r.com and enter the code huberman for 20% off your first order again that's r.com and enter the code huberman at checkout okay let's talk about the common cold first off no unfortunately today I cannot tell you the cure for the common cold because indeed there isn't one one interesting question however is why don't we have a cur for the common cold and the reason is that the cold virus as it's referred to is actually a bunch of different viruses some colds are caused by one what's called serotype of the virus other colds are caused by a different serotype of the virus there are over 160 different types of what people call the cold virus now cold viruses fall under an umbrella of a general category of viruses called Rhino viruses you can remember that easily because rhino sounds like Rhino horn the rhinoceros horn which is of course in the center of the Rhino's face which is where your nose is and the cold almost always causes some degree of nasal symptoms in humans it's either runny nose or sneezing or stuffed up nose or sometimes unfortunately all three now the reason we don't have a cure for the common cold is that all of those different serotypes of the cold virus mean that the virus itself has a different shape on its outside and as a consequence even if you've been exposed to a cold and you've developed antibodies against that cold virus the next cold that comes along very likely has a different shape and therefore your body's antibodies to the cold virus it combed successfully before can't latch onto and defeat that next different serotype of the cold virus now a little later I'll talk about the immune system and how those different antibodies are generated but for the time being understanding that there are a lot of different types of cold viruses explains first of all why we don't have a cure for the common cold but also why you can get multiple colds within a given year or even within a given season because even if you develop antibodies against one serotype of the cold virus a different serotype can come along and you can get sick again with that new serotype of the cold virus so how do you catch a cold now one of the problems with the cold virus being called the cold virus and the fact that indeed there are more cold viruses present and transmitted between humans in the cold winter months of the year is that people generally assume that it is the cold temperatures outside that actually give you a cold virus and that is simply not true however what you heard as a kid if your mom most likely but maybe your dad said hey don't go outside without a sweater or jacket on you're going to catch a cold or you're going to catch cold you know has ated this uh this myth that the cold temperatures themselves are the cause of catching a cold virus and that's simply not true the virus that we call the cold virus is spread by breathing or by sneezing or by people sneezing or coughing or breathing onto their hands and then touching surfaces and then other people touching those surfaces and then touching most likely their eyes in order to self- infect now we're going to get into the details of how far the virus can spread with a sneeze how long it can survive on the hands Etc but for the time being know this the cold virus is a pretty stable virus in that it can survive on surfaces nonhuman or human surfaces meaning skin or on a table or on a glass or on a door handle for up to 24 hours so for all you hypochondriacs out there I probably just gave you a little spike in cortisol and for you non- hypochondriacs I hope what I just said cues you to the fact that just avoiding people who are sneezing and coughing is not sufficient to avoid getting colds and flu However the fact that a cold virus is Alive and Well on a given surface let's say on a door handle does not mean that if you touch that door handle that you will necessarily be infected with that cold virus and that's because your skin actually provides an excellent barrier against most viruses and bacteria your skin also includes a lot of antiviral substances on it even if you haven't put any of that you know alcohol stuff or the hand sanitizer stuff on your skin is a very important barrier component of your immune system we're going to talk about that a little bit later but if somebody has a cold and they happen to perhaps you know wipe their nose or sneeze into a tissue hopefully into a tissue and then discard that tissue the cold virus particles are extremely small how small well most of us are familiar with thinking about centimeters or inches if you think about a millimeter being 1/ 100th of a cmet well you can take a millimeter and you can divide that up into a bunch of little slices also such that you get the Micron the Micron is 1 1,000th of a centimeter and if you want to get a sense of how thick or thin that is the side of a credit card the little thin side of a credit card is about 200 microns thick so if you set your credit card flat on a table and then you look at it from the side that tiny tiny thin little Edge that's about 200 microns the cold virus is made up of particles that are probably in the range of about five microns or so so it's extremely small I mean the cold virus therefore with a good sneeze or even a light sneeze can spread really far now the good news is those particles are relatively heavy they don't tend to mist about in the air for very long they tend to fall down onto the ground or onto surfaces but as I mentioned before they can survive for a very long time on those surfaces so should you touch your hand to a door handle or table or shake the hand of somebody that has cold virus on their hands either because they themselves have a cold or they contacted somebody else had cold virus and it somehow landed on their hands just cu the other person sneeze all these scenarios are very realistic that cold virus will not infect you unless it can get inside of your body and one of the primary entry points of it getting inside your body is via the Eyes by wiping that cold virus on your eyes now you may think okay I'm just not going to touch my eyes but a little bit later we're going to talk about a study that shows that almost always indeed almost always when you meet somebody new you touch your eyes and the frequency of people touching their face that is the region of the face around the eyes and their eyes throughout the day is extremely high so this is one of the primary routes by which the cold virus is transmitted from one person to the next but of course there's also the route that we're all familiar with which is the person that is sneezing or coughing or blowing their nose into tissues and then throwing them in the trash and not washing their hands after each and every time they do that so an important aspect of today's discussion that we will get into once I also present to you what a flu is and how it differs from the cold is that we're going to need to talk about what stage of infection people are actually contagious with the colder flu and there's actually a lot of Mythology about this in fact there's a lot of just lying about this people will be coughing or sneezing and they'll say oh yeah I'm not contagious any longer or people make up these things like oh you know if you had the flu for 2 days then you're no longer contagious or that you can't be contagious until you have symptoms so we're going to go through all the aspects of contagion and how coughing or sneezing or how long you've had a cold or flu actually relates to whether or not you're contagious in a little bit but for the time being know that the cold virus is very very small it can be transmitted through the air it can be transmitted via contact from skin to- skinin contact and it can survive on surfaces for up to 24 hours and when you touch those surfaces or a person with the cold virus most often the way it's going to get into your body and infect you such that you get a cold is by touching your eye region although touching other regions of your body can also pass the cold virus into you for instance the mouth and lips but that's actually far less common so we'll get into that in just a little bit now different serotypes that is different types of cold virus tend to create a different array of overall symptoms such that you know one cold might be a really quote unquote bad cold others are more mild some tend to induce more runny nose others more stuffy head and a little bit of a fever or in some cases a lot of fever one thing that's important to understand is that if people are going to be infected by the cold virus they tend to develop symptoms one to two days after they were exposed to the virus now the good news is if you are exposed to the cold virus that doesn't necessarily mean that you are going to catch that cold virus that is if your immune system can fight off that cold even if you've never been exposed to that serotype before then you won't actually have that cold and you won't transmit it so put differently it is is possible to avoid getting a cold virus even if you've never been exposed to that serotype of cold virus and you happen to come into contact with somebody who has that serotype of cold virus or you touch a surface of some object door handle Etc that has particular serotype of the cold virus on it and God forbid you then wipe your eyes that doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to get sick and a good portion of today's episode is going to focus on tools that are supported by science that allow you to bolster your immune system and greatly increase the probability that even if you're exposed to a novel serotype of the cold virus that is one that's new to you that your body's never seen before that you won't get sick another thing to understand about the cold virus is that you're generally most contagious to other people when you feel at your worst that is when you're coughing and sneezing and you got the stuffy head watery eyes and so on but you can also be contagious to other people when you are starting to feel better that said most of the data point to the fact that about 5 to 6 days after you hit your peak of worst symptoms or I guess we should say your Nader the dip of worst symptoms because it's such an awful state to be in you are probably exiting the phase in which you're contagious now I want to be very clear that does not mean that if you've had a cold for five or six days that you are no longer contagious if you continue to experience sneezing and coughing watery eyes in the evening you're feeling much worse first thing in the morning you're feeling especially groggy Etc well then you are still contagious another way to frame this is you know those people that continue to show up at the gym and show up at work and they tell you yeah I got this cold but I've had it for a few days I'm no longer contagious and they're wiping their eyes and they're blowing their nose frankly they don't know what they're talking about they are basically a walking talking breathing sneezing coughing cold virus Vector a vector is a route for passage of a virus so please if you are sneezing if you are coughing if you are still experiencing the symptoms of a cold stay home stay away from other people as much as possible and I realize that some people simply cannot avoid going to work or cannot avoid interacting with other family members or other people if they have the cold virus but this mythology that if we've had a cold for a few days and we're starting to feel better but we're still exhibiting symptoms that we're not contagious that is pure myth it's simply not grounded in fact now there's nothing that could be done about that first day or two after which we're exposed to a cold virus where we are not not experiencing symptoms and it's quite possible to pass the cold virus on to other people but I think that every workplace every home environment every gym every society would benefit greatly if people who were sick with the cold did not expose other people to that cold virus as much as possible and indeed this is a serious issue it's not just about a few sniffles and watery eyes there's an enormous financial and mental health cost and physical health cost to people getting the cold and it's not just about people who are immune compromised or elderly people what we're generally referring to as the cold today can be mild it can be moderate it can also be very severe and it can exacerbate other health issues that people have and we'll talk about that a little bit later and how to offset some of those health issues okay so now let's talk about the flu virus the flu virus is as I mentioned a virus and just like with the cold there are different serotypes of the flu virus there are also different General categories of flu virus so you've got your a type flu viruses your B type type flu viruses and your C type flu viruses and by the way I'm saying flu viruses but of course I'm referring to influenza but it's just kind of Common Place nowadays to refer to influenza as the flu similar to cold viruses the different types of flu viruses exist based on the different types of proteins that they express on their surface in fact in the news over the last few years there have been a number of different flu virus strains that have been described according to their surface protein character istics things like the H1N1 virus what is H1N1 H1N1 describes the different types of proteins that are expressed on the surface of that particular flu virus now the most common type of flu viruses are in that a category of flu this is the type of flu that caused the Spanish flu now the Spanish Flu which by the way did not originate in Spain people think it probably originated in New York or perhaps elsewhere but certainly not in Spain killed anywhere from 17 to 50 million people depending on which literature you read that's an enormous number of people and it occurred in four different waves of infection that occurred between the years 1918 and 1920 the Spanish Flu was a type A H1N1 virus and actually it's worth noting that this winter season there have been some cases of H1N1 already reported in the United States and elsewhere now of course the goal is always to contain the propagation of those flu viruses and that is done through a number of different approaches the best and most reliable approach of course is to not come into contact with somebody that is carrying the H1N1 or any other type of flu virus however based on the way that the flu virus infects the body the way that the symptoms emerge and the ways that viruses propagate that can't always be avoided one thing to know and I consider this a fortunate aspect of flu virus biology is that the flu virus unlike the cold virus can only exist on surfaces for for about 2 hours after about 2 hours it tends to die off so the flu virus is most typically passed by human human contact or coming into contact that is walking into a cloud of somebody's sneeze that contains flu virus or somebody's cough that contains flu virus and yes it is possible that shaking someone's hand could actually introduce flu virus to your hand and then if you wipe your eyes or I'll talk about a few other portals of entry for the flu virus and cold virus in a few minutes can get into your body and infect you and yet you can pick up the flu virus from surfaces however that is far less common than the flu virus passing from human human contact now there aren't as many different types of flu virus as there are types of cold virus and that's why there have been attempts at making flu vaccines or so-called flu shots I think most people are familiar with the signs and advertisements online and in the workplace and school saying you know get your flu shot this season the reason that flu shots can exist at all is because there are limited enough types of flu virus present in a given year that specific vaccines that is flu shots can be generated against that particular strain of the flu virus so how effective is the flu shot and I want to be very specific here when we say the flu shot singular it sort of implies that there's one flu shot that can combat all the different types of flu and as you just learned that is not the case so we probably should be saying the flu shots but just for sake of Simplicity when I say the flu shot I mean the flu shot that's given in a given flu season that is directed at specific strains of the flu because researchers have determined that that particular strain of flu or strains of flu are the ones that are most abundant for that particular flu season Studies have shown that getting the flu shot reduces one's risk of Contracting the particular flu that is most abundant That season by about 40 to 60% but of course the flu shot is completely ineffective at combating any other forms of the flu virus and of course colds or other types of upper respiratory infections Studies have also shown that taking the flu shot can reduce the severity of one's symptoms if they in fact get the flu anyway now personally I don't typically get the flu shot and the reason for that is that I don't tend to go into environments where I am particularly susceptible to getting the flu I don't work in a hospital or clinic I don't tend to interact with large numbers of people on a daily basis so for me I've opted not to get the flu shot now that doesn't mean that I've never contracted the flu as I mentioned earlier I tend to get sick with a cold or flu about once every 18 to 24 months and the severity of that cold or flu has ranged from you know at one point a very high fever in one case but typically a moderate fever and the usual symptoms of malaise that we've been discussing and I've managed to get over those without having taken the flu shop pretty easily now of course we also don't know that those were actually flu despite the distinct differences between the symptoms of Cold and Flu most people don't really know whether or not they have a cold or flu so this is another thing to think about when considering whether or not to get the flu shot ultimately because at least to my knowledge most workplaces do not mandate that people get the flu shot I could be wrong about certain workplaces but my experience is that most workplaces do not mandate that people get the flu shot when you take the flu shot you're really hedging a bet you're hedging a bet against the fact that you will be or not be exposed to that particular strain of flu virus that's most abundant That season or strains of flu virus that are most abundant That season and that the flu shot that you're taking is directed at those particular strains so again in my case I don't tend to take the flu shot but of course you need to make the decision that's right for you for instance if you have family members that are immune compromised or you work in a school or you think that you are exposed to a lot of flu or you're concerned about transmitting flu to any one individual or group of individuals those are all things that need to be taken into consideration and of course speak to your physician I will also say this which is that I mentioned that I've tended to catch colds or flu at a rate of about once every 18 to 24 months and when I say a cold or flu I mean a serious one one that keeps me in bed where I have a fever and I'm sweating what I have done and I continue to do is because I pay pretty close attention to how well I'm sleeping or different life events my different workouts Etc and I put those into my calendar and I have a short hand to do that so it only takes about 30 seconds each day okay did this work out it was kind of level seven out of 10 intensity got good sleep last night or poor sleep in know what good in poor sleep is for me I mean that's about the level that I'm charting these things I have been able to go back and look at the events preceding when I've come down with a cold or flu again I don't know whether or not it was a cold or a flu but before I got sick and I have seen for instance if I've ever done two hard workouts in a day something I never do any longer I've tended to get sick after that if I've tended to do hard workouts and then expose myself to cold temperatures while traveling especially traveling overseas that tended to precede those colds or flu which again for me are very seldom so it's a limited data set this is entirely anic data meaning related to my own history of getting colds and flu but it's something that I actually recommend people do which is you know to pay attention to when you first started getting symptoms pay attention to when you got over a given what you think is a colder flu and then to look at what was happening in the days before in that day I don't think it's possible to do hyper precise forensics on a colder flu right I mean you could have gone into to the gas station put your credit card in the machine to you know grab a drink out of the refrigerator and picked up a colder flu from the handle of the refrigerator or from the credit card machine or even from the gas pump you simply don't know however if you look at the pattern of behavior travel sleep exercise sorts of interactions you were having prior to getting a bad cold or flu chances are you're going to learn something interesting and be able to avoid getting a serious cold or flu at least to some extent going forward and I've done that I think fairly successful y because I can tell you that the frequency or colds or flu that I've come down with has indeed been dropping from year to year so where're as a decade ago I tended to get colds or flu probably about once a year and in some cases even twice a year although that was pretty rare that really expanded to about once every 18 months and then in the last five years I think I've gotten sick uh two times pretty badly with a colder flu and then once with a kind of mild colder flu so I tell you all that just as an example of how you can start to think about how your immune system interacts with different types of behaviors different types of situations such that you can learn something about your immune system and what's going to best protect you against getting colds and flu going forward which of course is a great thing to do because we all think that we can get out there be around people that are coughing and sneezing we can go to the gym when it's crowded and winter oh that person over there is you know coughing but I'm going to just you know stay a few feet away no big deal and while I don't want to turn anyone into hypochondriacs that's how you get infected that's how you get a colder fluid and at the same time I don't think anyone should you know get to the point where they're afraid to go into a gym or afraid to go to the workplace but I will say once again if you're sick with a colder flu if you are coughing sneezing blowing your nose runny eyes and you're walking into work or the gym or onto public transportation and you're telling people I'm not contagious you're lying I'd like to take a brief moment and thank one of our sponsors and that's ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens I started taking ag1 way back in 2012 the reason I started taking it and the reason I still take it every day is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas for vitamins and minerals and it ensures that I get enough Prebiotic and probiotic to support gut health now gut health is something that over the last 10 years we realized is not just important for the health of our gut but also for our immune system and for the production of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators things like dopamine and serotonin in other words gut health is critical for proper brain functioning now of course I strive to consume healthy Whole Foods for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day but there are a number of things in ag1 including specific micronutrients that are hard to get from Whole Foods or at least in sufficient quantities so ag1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals that I need probiotics prebiotics the adaptogens and critical micronutrients so anytime somebody asks me if they were to take Just One supplement what that supplement should be I tell them ag1 because ag1 supports so many different systems within the body that are involved in mental health physical health and performance to try ag1 go to drink a1.com huberman and you'll get a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 and five free travel packs of ag1 again that's drink a1.com huberman now the Diabolical thing about the flu virus is that just like the Diabolical thing about the cold virus you start shedding virus that is you are contagious about 24 hours prior to the onset of first symptoms for you so that means that you can be a flu viral Vector even when you aren't having symptoms that's just the unfortunate aspect of these viruses they're very clever they don't have brains but these viruses have adapted to propagate from host to host to host they have a drive to continue to stay alive and to infect more host so even though they don't have a brain they have a sort of uh let's call it viral intelligence and as I've said several times now if you are still exhibiting symptoms of the colder flu you are contagious however with respect to the flu you are most contagious during the three days when you feel the absolute worst when your fever is at its worst we'll talk about how to deal with fever a little bit later when you are coughing and sneezing headache all of that when that is at its peak that is when you are most contagious so again I realize that people can't always avoid contact with other people you know you live under the same roof sometimes caretaker is interacting with the person that has the cold or flu and I do want to remind you something I said earlier which is just because you come into contact with a colder flu does not necessarily mean that you will come down with that is be infected by a colder flu whether or not you come down with a colder flu is of course dependent on whether or not you come into contact with it you can't catch a cold or flu that you've never come into contact with just like you can't get eaten by a shark if you never go in the ocean however the probability of coming down with that cold or flu of it getting past your immune system barriers and infecting you is going to be strongly dictated by the different aspects of your immune system for which there are three major aspects which we'll talk about next and of course the things that you do to bolster those three aspects of your immune system okay let's talk about your immune system and I have to confess that even though I've spent well over three decades being a student of and a researcher of the nervous system the immune system is oh so cool and I say that because it has this incredible elegance and logic to it it basically consists of three major lines of Defense there's a physical barrier or rather a set of physical barriers that exist between the organs of your body and the outside world and you're probably immediately thinking skin and yes indeed it includes your skin but also some interesting things like the mucosal lining of your nose and mouth and even some of the liquids that are on the surface of your eyes we'll talk about those in a moment then there's a second line of defense which is for any virus or bacteria or fungus for that matter but today we're talking about viruses colds and flu viruses any viruses that get past the physical barrier of your skin and the mucosal lining of particular regions of your body well then you have What's called the innate immune system the innate immune system is this very generalized response system it's General in the sense that it deploys a basic set of neurochemicals that are not specific to the particular virus that's made it into your body so not only is it not specific to a particular serotype of the cold or a different type of flu virus but it's not even discriminating between cold or flu virus this thing we call the innate immune system is a generalized response system to go and combat viruses so it could be a cold it could be a flu it could be a bacteria it could be a fungus it could even be a physical object and your innate immune system responds by saying okay let's go deal with this now the third component of your immune system is What's called the Adaptive immune system and I alluded to this aspect of your immune system a little bit earlier the Adaptive immune system is the aspect of your immune system that recognizes because the innate immune system told it that something has infected the body at some level at some organ or set of organs and there's an emergency and the Adaptive immune system goes in and in a very targeted way figures out what sorts of proteins it needs to produce that is antibodies to combat that specific serotype of virus okay so the immune system has a physical barrier component and it's not just skin some other things as well you've got your innate immune system which is this generalized response system and then there's the Adaptive immune system let's talk about the physical barrier component first and this is actually a good opportunity for us to just take a brief step back and realize that anytime we're talking about our physiology there's going to be a mechanical set of features and there's going to be a chemical set of features so right now we're talking about the immune system and the mechanical feature or the physical feature of the immune system is this barrier between the organs of our body and the outside world and the most obvious of those is the skin you are contained in this bag of stuff that we call skin the skin isn't just for putting clothing on and for adorning with jewelry or tattoos if that's your thing watches Etc your skin is a living organ in and of itself I think we're most accustomed to think about the heart and the lungs and the liver and the Brain as organs of the body but the skin is an organ of the body as well it has a bunch of different layers of cells from the outside to the inside actually the skin cells themselves are made in the deeper layers of the skin and they migrate out towards the surface of the skin and at the surface of the skin on top of those cells and made by those cells are different types of chemicals that actually serve as antibacterial and antiviral agents meaning if a cold virus or flu virus or other type of virus lands on the skin it can neutralize and kill that virus so your skin is a very important physical barrier against viruses such as the cold or flu virus getting into your body and infecting other cells and tissues now your skin is not contigous meaning there are holes in it so let's think about those holes for a second as we go from head to foot it's pretty obvious that your eyes have these two openings and those are openings in your skin right as you open your eyelids beneath there are your corneas the shiny part of your eyes and a little bit further back at the back inner lining of your eyeball you have a very thin three cell layer thick piece of tissue that we call the neural retina and I say this because the neural retina is actually a piece of your brain so you have two pieces of brain that line the back of your eyes and that's the light sensing tissue in the back of your eyes now I say this because what this means is that it's a very short distance between the opening of your skin that we call your eyelids and your brain now most of the brain of course is contained in the cranial Vault within what most people call the skull but your brain isn't far away from those openings that we call your eyelids so as a consequence on the surface of your eyes those corneas the shiny part of your eyes on the outside there are a bunch of different chemical features there are tears that are made by your lacrimal glands but there also a lot of antibacterial agents that actively kill off stuff that could potentially infect your body could make it into your body maybe even into your brain if you've ever woken up in the morning and you have some crust on your eyes and you look at that crust that kind of yellowy stuff sometimes it's yellow I know this is kind of gross that's actually dead bacteria that your eyes have successfully defeated during your night's sleep so when you wipe those away you're taking the casualties of a war that you won during your night's sleep and you're whisking those away now as we descend a little bit further down the face they're of course the nostril openings and the nostril openings tend to be kind of sticky right they're moist sticky and warm right you don't have to put your fingers up them right now you just know they're moist sticky and warm get your fingers out of your nose please the mucosal lining of your nose is actually a very important substance that is sticky in order to trap viruses such as colds and flu viruses and then chemical components within the mucosa lining can neutralize them that's the best case scenario there are of course scenarios in which the cold or flu virus takes residence in your mucosal lining and can make its way back into your sinus passages and can then infect other cells and tissues of your body because the virus replicates and spreads throughout the body and then going a a little bit further down I realize this is obvious you have your mouth and what's really interesting is that your mouth also has mucosal lining which is sticky and it has chemical components to neutralize incoming viruses but we know that the type of mucus and the type of bacteria that live in your nose and mouth that by the way are very healthy for you and encourage healthy immune system function that is act as ways to neutralize viruses within your nose and mouth are very different so your nose and your mouth may seem similar at the level of okay well it's warm and sticky in there there's mucus but they are very very different tissues in fact if you think about your mouth it's this incredible structure that not only lets you eat and breathe in and out through although I suggest most people be nasal breathers for most of the time of their day and night if you can of course sometimes you have to mouth breathe but keep this in mind that you have this big opening in the front of your face and bacteria are getting in there all day long viruses are getting in there all day long and in most cases you are successfully combating those viruses and bacteria because the mucosal lining of your mouth and your nose for that matter and the microbiota those little micro organisms that have taken resonance in your nose and mouth are helping to contribute to fight off bacteria and viruses provided the microbiota there are diverse and are of the type you want which we'll talk a little bit more about later and then descending further down the body of course there are other openings Into Your Skin Barrier namely the urethra of the penis or vagina and of course the vaginal Canal so the genitals of course have their own mucosal lining and as you can imagine it is distinct in terms of its physical makeup and its chemical makeup from the mucosal lining of your nasal passages and mouth and then of course we have the rectum and anus which is the outflow pathway of your intestines which are post-design and frankly there need to be more data in order to really resolve this but it seems like the primary entry site for viruses to get into the body tends to be the eyes or the mouth and we can get into some of the reasons why that would be so but if you think back to our conversation about the way that colds and flu exist in the world either as aerosols or on surfaces of objects or on surfaces of skin well then what I'm about to tell you next will make it oh so obvious why the eyes and the mouth are the primary sites of for colds and flu and if you keep that in mind there's a good chance you can avoid a lot of colds or flu that you would otherwise catch okay so before I talk about the important roles of the innate and the Adaptive immune system in keeping colds and flu at Bay I'll tell you that you have a problem and that problem is that you tend to touch your eyes very often in fact you tend to touch your eyes most often after you shook somebody else's hand now why am I picking on you well in fact I'm not I'm picking on all of you and I'm picking on myself included because there have been several studies now primarily from Noam soel Lab at The whitesman Institute showing that when people encounter another person and they shake their hand they either touch their eyes or touch another region of their face very close to the eyes or that they touched their hand to their mouth now there are a bunch of theories as to why people do this there's the idea that people are actually sniffing their own hands and in particular sniffing their own hand more often after they Shake someone else's hand as a way to detect what chemo signals exist on the other person not necessarily conscious smelling of the other person's smell but rather some sort of unconscious mechanism by which we take the chemicals of the person we come into contact with and we bring them to our nose our eyes or in some cases our upper lip and that our olfactory system that is the neurons that exist just behind the back of our nose are processing that information and getting all sorts of important information about how stressed the other person is their hormones uh whether or not we recognize them the fact that they are different from us that's right we are also smelling ourselves all day long noom's lab has shown this that people are kind of walking around in their own odor Cloud we tend to touch our armpits we tend to touch different aspects of our body yes and smell ourselves multiple times throughout the day this is all being done unconsciously I suppose some people are doing it consciously and that there's a lot of information about our physiology and health and when we do this after shaking somebody's hand that there's a lot of information about the other person's physiology and health that our nervous system our factory system and deep parts of our brain that are involved in primitive type behaviors but also some pretty sophisticated behaviors are taking into account now Noom soel was a guest on the hubin Lab podcast I encourage you to check out that episode if you have time it's a fascinating Voyage into the olfactory system and not just conscious smelling or sniffing of things so we go oh that smells good or that smells bad or that person you know is somebody I want to mate with or hang out with or avoid it's also unconscious processing of so-called chemo signals chemical signals but the reason I'm bring up these studies now in the context of colds and flu and how to avoid getting colds and flu is as a reminder that we are pretty much wired to contact our own face with our own hands at the level of our eyes nose and upper lip and around the eyes very shortly after we touch somebody else's skin and if you are mindful of it you can actually avoid bringing colds or flu to your face now in doing so are you're going to shortcircuit a bunch of other important biological processes involved in understanding what's going on in your environment because you're not bringing in those smells I suppose that's possible but with respect to avoiding colds and flu it seems like a pretty good trade-off to me so the point that I'm trying to make here is that in order for you to catch a cold or flu that cold or flu virus the little particles of cold and flu virus need to make it into your body and the primary entry sites are eyes nose mouth and the primary actions by which we bring colds and flu viruses to our eyes nose mouth are by touching other people or by touching other surfaces that have colder flu virus just to remind you cold virus can exist up to 24 hours on a given surface flu virus tends to die off after about 2 hours on a given surface and we're bringing to our face we are literally bringing the virus to ourselves so a little bit more conscious awareness about that fact means that you can probably avoid colds and flu to some extent how much well it's unclear it's unclear because as you recall some people have and are passing along cold or flu virus prior to any symptoms and of course it's possible that you can walk into an aerosol cloud of cold or flu virus even if a person isn't there and you don't come into contact with them but some conscious awareness of these routes of path passage for the colder flu virus I do believe can reduce the probability that you will catch a colder flu and of course I'm not encouraging people to never touch touch is an important part of social connection and social bonding but if you start to think about these portals of entry for the cold and flu virus into your body well then you you know perhaps might think twice before you know hugging someone kissing them on the cheek during a time in which you're trying to actively avoid getting the cold or flu now I feel a little bit funny about sharing this information because again I don't want to encourage will always be at you know arms distance you know uh you know fake fist bumping you know keeping a gap between them again touch is an important component of social connection but since today's topic is colds and flu and how to avoid getting colds and flu just like you can't get eaten by a shark if you don't go in the ocean there's a much lower probability that you're going to get a colder flu if you're not touching a lot of hands and bringing those hands to your eyes nose or mouth I suppose one way around the sort of do I hug do I shake hands thing is to just be conscious of the fact that when you shake somebody's hand that you're very likely to touch your eyes or face within the next 30 seconds or so and maybe you end up being that person who puts some hand sanitizer on your hands sometimes that can feel a little awkward to do that right in front of somebody you know it's kind of sending a signal like hey I don't want you to infect me but guess what you don't want them to infect you okay let's imagine that a cold or flu virus makes it into your system it breaches the physical barrier of your skin and mucosal lining now you have in mind all the different ways that could happen and all the different ways that could be prevented but we are starting at a point here a hypothetical point whereby that colder flu virus has made it into your body your immune system has an absolutely exquisitely sophisticated way of knowing you versus other meaning cells within your body that are of you and cells of your body that are from other organisms or viruses from the outside world and when viruses such as a cold or flu virus are detected in your body your body might not even recognize that it's a cold or flu virus it might not even recognize that it's a virus at all it just knows that this thing that's in me is of other it's not me I've never seen it before this is not me these are not my cells these are not the chemicals that I'm producing and your immune system is amazing in that way and when it occurs your innate immune system launches a response what is that response well first of all the response is very rapid right colder flu makes it into your body and your innate immune system immediately or near immediately launches an attack on that Invader or Invaders because as soon as the virus gets into your body it's going to start replicating as quickly as it can what happens white blood cells that your body produces will go to the sites where those viruses are and the by the way those viruses are basically getting into cells of your body and then hijacking the genetic Machinery of those cells in order to replicate within those cells and then exit those cells and then go infect more cells that's how these viruses work your body's making white blood cells things like neutrophils natural killer cells macras these are what we call affector cells that act as a kind of ambulance system and go to the sites that those viruses exist and the cells that they've infected and start trying to physically barrier them in and also use specific chemical mechanisms to neutralize and kill those viruses again anytime you're think about biology think mechanical features and chemical features of a response now a key component of the innate immune system is What's called the complement system not complement like oh you look very nice today but complement okay the complement system which exists in the plasma within your blood these are chemicals in your bloodstream that go and Mark specific cells that have been infected or viruses with a signal a chemical signal that essentially looks like an eat me signal to these other cell types of your immune system such that those natural killer cells go through the body and go looking for the cells that have this eat me signal on them and try and destroy those particular cells the other thing that urinate immune system does is that the cells that have been infected and that are undergoing damage remember they have colder flu virus within them and they're hijacking the cell or Machinery of those cells and using it to produce their own virus more of the virus and as a consequence the genetic Machinery of those cells is not able to do a bunch of other things that it normally can do or at least not as well well those cells that are really hurting release a help me signal and then in response to that help me signal your immune system releases what are called cyto kindes things like interlukin 1 interlan 6 tumor necrosis Factor Alpha just fancy nerd names for different types of molecules that go to the site of infection and try to help or assist to remove that infection and they also Tred to assist the repair of the cells that have been infected by those viruses now one of the mechanical or physical consequences of these chemical signals like Incan 1 Incan 6 tnf Alpha again those are all cyto kindes being drawn to a particular cell or region of cells that have been infected is that it creates some physical swelling of the area it impacts the vasculature the veins and capillaries that feed that area and in response to they put more blood there so you get some swelling or you'll get in some cases the release of histamines right we think of anti-histamine drugs well histamines are an aspect of your immune system they move around in your body in these really cool cells called masted cells Mas mass cells and when the histamines are released that area becomes kind of hot and swelling it's what we call edema and that whole area is marked as really a sight just like a crash site on the side of the road it's like hey we've got eat me signals to get the debris and the bad stuff out of here try to get those viruses out of here we've got help me signals to try and help the injured cells just like you would try and help people at a car crash and there's a bunch of swelling so there's additional blood flow sometimes there's some other physical features as well now the important thing to know is that the innate immune system is very fast and it is agnostic to the type of infection in fact it doesn't even matter if it's a bacterial physical fungal or viral infection but it certainly isn't paying attention to the exact serotype of cold virus or whether or not it's an H1 influenza or another type of influenza so way to think about the innate immune system is that it is a very fast and non-specific response to a viral or other type of Invader now that's all a bunch of biology but if you think about it let's imagine a scenario where you go to a party hang out the party you don't see anyone coughing or sneezing but maybe one person there has a cold virus or they have a flu virus and they aren't even aware of it they're not going to come down with symptoms for another day or so you talk to that person you shake hands maybe touch your eyes maybe you don't but you're exposed to that colder flue virus you go home you go to sleep you wake up the next morning you feel fine and then sometime in the next afternoon you know you start to feel a little tickle in your throat or you start to feel just a little bit of fatigue or malaise do you have that colder flu well possibly okay we don't know for sure but assuming that that cold or flu virus did indeed make it into your system then your immune system is starting to create a set of responses that we talked about a moment ago but it also tends to impact things at the level of your brain such that you kind of feel like you know I don't feel quite right I feel like a little bit I don't feel great and there are a lot of reasons why you would feel that way and we'll talk about those reasons a little bit later but does that mean that you're necessarily coming down with a colder flu well technically yes your inate immune system is deployed to fight this foreign viral Invader but whether or not you actually get a full-blown cold or flu or put differently how severe that cold or flu infection is depends depends on whether or not your innate immune system can fight off that colder flu at the outset and indeed there are many cases we believe where you get exposed to a colder flu it makes it into your body but your innate immune system is sufficient to beat it to fight it back this is one of the reasons why it's so important that if you're starting to feel a bit under the weather and you think you're coming down with a colder flu that you do certain things in order to make sure that your innate immune system is both ready and that it can launch a fullscale attack on that colder flu virus we're going to talk about how to do that a little bit later I'm not trying to withhold it's just it's important to understand that just because the virus makes it into your body doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to get a full-blown cold or flu and in fact that inate immune system sometimes is sufficient to prevent that colder flu from replicating enough that you get the full-blown set of symptoms and that's kind of an ideal scenario so we're definitely going to talk today about what to do if you start to feel a little bit of malaise what to do if you just discover that oh you know that person I was hanging out with at the party the night before they're really sick with a colder flu because there are things you can do to increase the probability that your innate immune system can handle the battle sufficiently such that you never have to get to the next component of the immune response which is the Adaptive immune response I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor insid tracker insid tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals now I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term Health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test now a major problem with a lot of blood tests out there however is that you get information back about metabolic factors lipids and hormones and so forth but you don't know what to do with that information with inside tracker they make it very easy because they have a personalized platform that allows you to see the levels of all those things metabolic factors lipids hormones Etc but it gives you specific directives that you can follow that relate to nutrition behavioral modifications supplements Etc that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you if you'd like to try insid tracker you can go to insid tracker.com huberman to get 20% off any of insid tracker's plans again that's insidetracker tocomin okay so the third layer of your immune system is your adaptive immune system and this is an amazing aspect of you okay the stuff we talked about up until now the physical barrier the innate immune system so so cool but the Adaptive immune system is really a mindblower the most important thing to understand about your adaptive immune system is that as the name suggests its job is to create antibodies specific to the very Intruder that made it into you and infected your cells the very specific serotype of cold virus the very specific type of influenza such that you defeat that virus but then in an amazing way your adaptive immune system also maintains a memory of that battle and keeps within your body believe it or not within a population of stem cells which are cells that can rise to more cells such that if you ever encounter that same serotype of cold virus or same strain of influenza again that your antibodies can immediately neutralize that colder flu virus the Adaptive immune system has the ability to make proteins that have a particular shape on their surface that matches the shape of the thing that your immune system is trying to kill now the Adaptive immune system has two basic phases in the first phase the Adaptive immune system makes these things called immunoglobulins IGS and the immunoglobulins come in different forms there's IGG there's IGM there are other types of IGS as well for sake of today's discussion know that the initial wave of antibodies that the Adaptive immune system makes or of the IGM variety and the IG antibodies can travel to and latch on to the surface of the colder flu virus and it matches it pretty well it's not perfect but it matches it pretty well think about uh for instance a particular serotype of cold virus or the H1N1 flu virus having you know very particular Contour on its surface the M approximates that Contour such that it's better at fighting that colder flu virus than is the innate immune system but it's not a perfect fit however the Adaptive immune system doesn't stop with the production of those igms the Adaptive immune system takes that information about how precise or imprecise that fit is between the IGM antibodies and the surface of that particular cold or flu virus and then in an amazing way send signals back to the stem cell populations in the bone marrow and other tissues and then more antibodies come out of the IGG variety and the IG proteins are very specific to the shape of that particular cold virus or flu virus such that the Iggs then can Define to and neutralize those viral particles okay so when we talk about the immune system we're talking about a physical barrier that if it is breached a cold or flu virus takes residence and starts to replicate the innate immune system launches a generalized attack on that colder flu virus and then the Adaptive immune system kicks in usually a couple days later first with the production of antibodies that are pretty specific to the particular virus that happened to make it into the body and infect cells but then there's a second wave of production of antibodies and those antibodies are incredibly specific for that particular cold or flu virus and as I mentioned earlier the Adaptive immune system then acquires a memory of the specific fit between a given antibody that it made and the viral Invader and the successful battle that those antibodies waged on that Viral Invader and that memory is maintained such that if the next week or the next season you encounter the exact same serotype of cold virus or same type of flu virus well then you already have antibodies ready to be deployed sometimes the antibodies continue to circulate in your system sometimes you need to generate more of them and the immune system is that amazing it can actually send a message back to that stem cell population in the bone marrow or elsewhere say Hey listen this virus that we beat a few weeks or months or years back it's back we need more antibodies and boom your adaptive immune system churns those antibodies out and kills the virus now as a final point about the immune system I've been talking a lot today about cells traveling to and killing viruses and sending signals eat me help me Etc it's important to understand that while cells can migrate through the the body a lot of what we're talking about here is the movement of proteins through the vascular through the blood system of the body but there's another system that's very important for all of this that's collaborating with the vascular system and that's the lymphatic system we don't have time to go into a whole lecture about the lymphatic system but suffice to say the lymphatic system can pull stuff from the blood such as viruses but also cells that have been beaten up or cells that have been eaten and are contained within other cells such as macrofagos and it can do some filtering of those different cell types and it can produce its own useful chemicals that then can be reintroduced to the bloodstream in order to help combat the infection now this becomes very important when later we talk about how specific forms intensities and durations of exercise can increase the ability for your innate immune system to combat infections so that your adaptive immune system perhaps doesn't even have to get involved in the battle because your innate system handled it there are data to show the exercise of sufficient intensity and duration but not excessive intensity and duration can recruit the lymphatic system and recruit or increase the activity of the innate immune system even in the absence of an infection such that if you go to that party and you encounter that person with a colder flu you can defeat that colder flu virus at the outset and never have to deal with making antibodies to that colder flu virus at all okay so now you have a fairly sophisticated biological understanding of what colds are what flu are and the way that immune system works to fight off viruses like colds and flu so with that in mind I think now is the appropriate time to start talking about what the scientific peer-reviewed research says about how to allow your immune system to function at its best such that you can combat colds and flu meaning if you are exposed to a cold or flu that is if it breaches that physical barrier of your skin and the mucosal lining of your nose your mouth or it gets into your eyes that you stand the greatest chance of defeating that colder flu at the the level of your innate immune system such that your adaptive immune system never even has to respond to it by creating all those specific antibodies now fortunately there are a lot of different things we can do to improve the function of our immune system in fact I feel like anytime the winter months roll around we start to see the same list of things surface online and in the press and I don't want to diminish these things they are in fact the Bedrock of maintaining and enhancing the function of your innate immune system so what are those well some of these will be pretty obvious things like getting enough quality sleep each night we know for instance that if you're sleep deprived so especially if you stay up all night but certainly even if you only get 50% or 75% of your sleep requirement that your innate immune system is going to suffer it's not going to be as effective at combating flu or colds in addition to that we know that exercise of specific type and specific duration and specific intensity can serve to bolster the innate immune system and we'll talk about the specific exercise protocols that can best achieve that we also hear and it's absolutely true that we need adequate nutrition if we are in a caloric deficit for instance if we're trying to diet through the winter months which many people try to do that can place our innate immune system in a bit of a compromised state that said things like intermittent fasting or even longer duration fast have been implicated and here I really want to underscore implicated in brief improvements in the function of the immune system however extended fast or not eating enough calories to maintain body weight for many many days in a row can actually compromise the function of the innate immune system I'll go into this a bit deeper in a moment and then of course we hear about stress that we're all supposed to regulate our levels of stress not get too stressed and here I have to put an asterisk next to those statements because yes indeed chronic stress meaning stress that continues day after day after day or even short periods of stress that impede our ability to sleep at night can indeed reduce the functioning of our innate immune system however it's also clear that short bouts of stress provided that they don't inhibit our ability to sleep that night can actually enhance the function of the immune system and this is something that I don't think is talked about enough you know we hear so often that quote unquote cortisol is bad it's a stress hormone listen cortisol is fantastic provided that it is elevated early in the day and not late in the day or evening also cortisol does have thresholds Beyond which if it's too high can be bad for us but it's also the case that if cortisol levels are too low that's bad for us and it's especially bad for the functioning of our immune system because glucocorticoids of which cortisol is have an important role in activating those natural killer cells of the innate immune system they are one of the primary signals by which those inter lucans like interlan 1 and interlan 6 are deployed in our body and so very often we'll hear stress increases inflammation and indeed interlukin 1 interlan 6 are pro-inflammatory you might think oh my goodness I don't want that I don't want cortisol I don't want these Incans elevated but guess what the inflammation response is also an important component of that innate immune system that allows us to combat infections so in trying to keep our innate immune system tuned up I realize that's not a biological statement tuned up but keep our immune system functioning at its best we want inflammation available as a tool to combat infection we want cortisol available as a way to activate that inflammation and other aspects of our immune system we just don't want so much cortisol and so much inflammation that we can't sleep and that our gut microbiome suffers and that brings me to the other component that's important for the basic functioning of your immune system so that you can be at your strongest when you inevitably encounter those cold and flu viruses why do I say inevitably look if you exist in the world that is if you live live on planet Earth you are going to be bombarded with different viruses and bacteria and funguses and all this stuff throughout your days and yes in those winter months because people are spending more time indoors and they're touching each other and surfaces more breathing on each other more sneezing on each other more and so on and so forth there is more propagation of colds and flu so if we take a step back and we ask how can I have my immune system as strong and ready as possible to combat cold and flu viruses we get to those Basics it's make sure you're getting enough quality sleep each night how much is enough however much you need in order to not feel sleepy during the day except maybe the requirement for a short nap of anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes not everyone requires that but that's perfectly normal to have an afternoon dip in energy that can be restored with a short nap or non-sleep deep bre we'll provide links to non-sleep deep breast and other tools in the show note captions that you know are zero cost tools to allow you to recover your energy some people just simply take a nap and that sort of thing if you want tools for improving your sleep and making sure that you're getting enough quality sleep each night we will also provide a link to our zeroc cost sleep tool kit that details that in PDF form it just lists out the things that you can do or take if that's your choice and so on and so forth and of course we've done episodes on quality nutrition and what that means we've done episodes on stress and how to combat stress and we've done episodes on the so-called gut microbiome but right now I just want to mention that the gut microbiome which are the trillions of little microbacteria that interact heavily with the immune system and help support the immune system you want to keep the gut microbiome healthy so you'll notice that we include some tools related to the gut microbiome here in a moment and and this is very important keep in mind that the microbiome doesn't just exist in the gut so often these days we hear about the gut microbiome and I'm oh so happy that the gut microbiome is getting the attention that it deserves in the context of mental health physical health and performance but we can't forget that the microbiome also exists on the surface of the eye and in the nasal passages and indeed the microbiome that's specific to the nasal passages as I mentioned before is very different from the microbiome that exists within the mouth and the microbiome that exists within the mucosa of the nasal passages seems to be the most effective at combating any viruses that we encounter especially cold and flu viruses so while ideally you would never encounter a colder flu virus we know that if the colder flu viruses go in through the nasal passages you stand the greatest chance of combating that particular cold or flu so what does that mean this is where I get to make a strong push for being a nasal breather certainly in sleep you want to be a nasal breather but also throughout the day unless you're speaking or unless you're exercising hard enough that you need to breathe through your mouth or unless you're eating being a nasal breather is known to provide the right millu the right environment to keep that nasal microbiome at its healthiest and to promote the diversity of microbiota in the nasal passages that can best protect you against colds and flu and there are a growing number of studies that point to this fact I'll provide a link to one that I like very much which is entitled alterations in oral nasal Fingal microbiota and salivary proteins in mouth breathing children this is but one study pointing to the fact that being a nasal breather is a good thing mouth breathing children and mouth breathing adults meaning children and adults that default to mouth breathing tend to get more in C of of the upper respiratory tract including colds and flu consciously focusing on nasal breathing is one of the best things that we can all do to combat any colds or flu that we might encounter so earlier we talked about trying to avoid touching your eyes at least without washing your hands first or sanitizing your hands first after you meet somebody keeping in mind that most people do that unconsciously here we are also saying when you enter a room you're hanging out with peoplebe you're waiting for public transportation or you're at work work or walking down the hallway unless you are exercising hard unless you are talking try to focus on being a nasal breather there are a bunch of other reasons to be a nasal breather as well but this is one of the primary ones and I'll provide a link to another reference which is the book Jaws by my colleagues at Stanford which talks about nasal breathing and the importance of nasal breathing but also the degree to which children and adults open themselves up to increased levels of viral infections as well as bacterial infections but viral infections in particular when they rely on mouth breathing and the incredible benefits of doing this very simple zeroc cost thing of whenever you can consciously remember to breathing through your nose as opposed to breathing through your mouth and just as an additional point about nasal breathing because I can't resist telling you this I just think it's so cool such an interesting adaptation when we breathe through our nose we heat the air in a way that's very different from the way we heat the air when we mouth breathe and by heating the air that's coming into the nasal passages it shifts the probability that colder flu viruses will successfully embed in the mucosal lining and infect the underlying cells and get into the other cells and tissues of our body so this whole thing about nasal breathing is important and effective at the level of temperature regulation of the millu within the nose and therefore the viruses that end up in the nose as well as the mucosal line and the chemicals made by the mucosal line and again the nose is a very different place than the mouth in fact I'll provide a link to yet another paper uh which is entitled human nasal microbiota it's a really interesting paper it's actually an interview with a scientist who's expert in the nasal microbiome talking about how this structure within our nose really is the primary defense site by which we destroy potentially incoming viruses so if it sounds overly simple just breathe through your nose it is very simple but it's also very effective now it's also clearly the case that keeping your gut microbiome is advantageous for keeping your innate immune system at its most robust level of functioning and I should mention that your gut microbiome isn't just about your stomach you know we hear the word gut and we think stomach but it's actually the entire length of your digestive tract from your mouth out the other end and different microbiota exist at different locations along that tract of mucosa and there are a couple things that one can do in order to make sure that the gut microbiome is best supported along that entire length the first one is that and this was covered on the episode that we did with my colleague Justin sonenberg who is a world expert in the gut microbiome and that is to consume anywhere from two to four servings of low sugar fermented foods per day so things like sourkraut things like kimchi things like kefir things like kombucha it can be a little bit of work to figure out which of these you like and which ones you're willing to consume on a regular basis but it's very clear that the brine you know that kind of uh salty solution around the sauerkraut and by the way when I say sauerkraut what we're talking about here is the type that has to be refrigerated it contains what are called live cultures as opposed to the sauerkraut that can exist in the non-refrigerated portion of the store or pickles that also have that Brine and that have to be kept in the refrigerator even before they're opened and of course like yogurt which have active live cultures those are the sorts of things that are going to best support the diversity of microbiota along the entire length of the gut microbiome such that your gut microbiome can do its job in supporting your nervous system but here especially in the context of today's discussion your immune system now the low sugar component of low sugar fermented foods is important because what we know is that if you're consuming yogurts with a lot of sugar or you're consuming kombucha with high levels of sugar or you're consuming pickles or sauerkraut that have a lot of sugar in them you're probably going to start to create some other issues related to the sugar what you're really looking for are these low sugar fermented foods and they can be a little bit tricky to seek out in the store but they're usually there and once you identify the ones that you like you should really aim to get two to four servings of those per day you can also consume a Prebiotic or probiotic in the form of capsule form things like ag1 athletic greens also contain Prebiotic probiotic but it's very clear that consuming two to four servings of low sugar fermented foods per day is among the best ways to promote health of the gut microbiome and that the gut microbiome is so so important for keeping the innate immune system thriving such that it can combat the colds or flu that are trying to bombard your system now there's another tool that you can use to enhance your gut microbiome I have to warn you this one might make a few of you um cringe a little bit but this is one that I actually started doing about four months ago um it's an interesting one it kind of dates back to some older quote unquote traditional medicine practices but it makes really good logical sense to be fair I'm not aware of any randomized control trial exploring the use of this protocol but it's so simple and completely cost-free and it stands so strongly on the logic of how the gut and oral microbiome work that frankly I started doing it and you know whether or not it's placebo effect or not I don't know but I feel better and it's so easy to do and it stands to potentially improve the fun of your gut microbiome enough that I figured I would at least share it with you and then you can decide so what this protocol essentially consists of is before you go to sleep at night or in the morning you pour yourself a little bit of water whatever water you happen to consume just clean clear water and then you take a sip of that water when you wake up in the morning and you swish it around in your mouth and then you swallow it now for those of you that are like oh gross let's think about this is it really gross to swish a little bit of water around in your mouth and then swallow that water when you first wake up prior to brushing your teeth of course well it might seem gross to you but throughout the night when you're sleeping especially if you are a nasal breather while you sleep the environment within your mouth is such that you're breeding a lot of bacteria you are creating all those little microbacteria that potentially can inhabit your digestive tract and provide at least some of the substrate for the microbiota in your digestive tract to thrive and if that seems gross to you keep in mind that's what having a healthy gut microbiome really is all about so the protocol is very simple at zero cost you take a swig of water swish it around and swallow it oddly it doesn't taste bad um in fact it'll just taste like swallowing um and in fact it tastes like swallowing a little bit of water it's not as if it tastes like um bad breath or something like that it's a very simple protocol that again no randomized control trials but really stands on the logic of how the oral microbiome and the gut microbiome interact and because what we're talking about here is supporting the function of your gut microbiome such that it supports the function of your inate immune system such that you can avoid colds and flu at least to me it seems like a pretty low bar yes okay so to bolster your inade immune system you want to get that quality sleep as often as you possibly can you want to support the gut microbiome in the ways that we just described what about exercise we hear it all the time time exercise is so good for us it enhances the immune system and on and on and listen I'm a huge believer in exercise I personally like to do three bouts of cardiovascular exercise per week one long one medium one short and I do three bouts of resistance training each week all of that and specifically what I do is available to you as a zeroc cross protocol in the form of a PDF we have a link to that in the show note captions I also have a whole episode about foundational Fitness and so on and so on the discussion we're going to have now now is about what general forms of exercise actually do support the innate immune system and and this is really important what forms of exercise actually deplete your innate immune system this isn't talked about enough I think there are certain intensities and durations of exercise that make us more vulnerable to colds and flu so we're going to discuss that before we do that I want to just briefly touch into something that I hear a lot which is the question if I'm feeling a little bit rundown should I exercise or not and to be honest there isn't a straightforward answer to that question it's impossible for me or for you to know whether or not you were indeed exposed to a cold or flu and you're starting to combat it at the level of your Nate immune system or whether or not you're just you know feeling a little bit sluggish however what we do know is that if you are feeling malaise at the level of the body like your body is feeling different it's feeling heavier you're feeling tired you're feeling tired at a time of day that doesn't make sense given your usual patterns of being tired you're feeling tired in a way that doesn't make sense given how much sleep you got the night before right I mean here what we're talking about is ruling out any possible you know life stressor you were up too late or you drank caffeine at the wrong time or something like that what we know is that you're if you're feeling that General malaise across your whole body it is fairly likely that you're coming down with something and that your best response to that would be to go home take a hot shower or bath I'll explain why you would want to do that in a few minutes and then get into bed early and even if you can't fall asleep to just be as still and as relaxed as possible we know that if you push into bouts of intense activity or even just push yourself to engage in activity when you're feeling run down at that sort of whole body level maybe a little tickle in your throat you are going to compromise the function of your innate immune system and it's very likely that you're going to get more sick than you would otherwise so here's my suggestion if you're starting to feel rundown at the level of whole body malaise or you just don't feel right you're best off taking a hot shower bath and getting into bed or just getting into bed and trying to rest and get as much sleep probably even a little bit of extra sleep and here's why that whole body malaise that extra fatigue that's not easily explained by other factors in your life have to do with the fact that when your innate immune system is activated meaning it's already combating a cold or flu interlukin 1 and interlukin 6 have a way of interacting with a particular brain area called the dorsal rafay nucleus which is choa block full of neurons that release serotonin and serotonin from the dorsal rafay nucleus acts on specific regions of your hypothalamus areas like the preoptic region for those of you that want to know and other areas of the hypothalamus that generate a state of sleepiness in addition when we are getting sick our sleep patterns change we feel like we need to sleep more but we don't feel as rested from that sleep and that has to do with the ways that serotonin interacts with some of the components of the brain circuitry involved in sleep that controls slow wave or deep sleep and this is a whole discussion unto itself I actually covered a lot of the mechanistic aspects of this business of immune induced sleepiness and Malay is associated with feeling sick in an episode about interactions between the neural and immune system that I will also provide a link to in the show note captions but suffice to say if you're feeling that whole body Mala is and especially if you also have a little bit of a throat tickle you're just not feeling right for you you're not accustomed to feeling that way at that time of day or night well then I encourage you to get rest because chances are you're already combating an infection however if you are out and about a lot during the winter months or you're interacting with a lot of people by virtue of work or public transportation or whatever the gym Etc you're a school teacher maybe your kids are coming home with colds and flu and you're not yet feeling that malaise you're not feeling any throat tickle you're not getting that kind of um kind of burning or tickle within your nasal passages when you breathe you know we're all familiar with these things the watering the eyes that kind of precedes the getting the full-blown cold or flu well if you're not experiencing that stuff and you want to keep your inate immune system strong and able to combat off colds and flu then we know that exercise can be an excellent way to increase the output of that innate immune system what I mean by that is the appropriate intensity and duration of exercise can act as a stressor that promotes a bit of inflammation yes the release of cyto kindes and a bit of activation of the innate immune system including the production of more white blood cells natural killer cells such that you're sort of prompting the innate immune system to almost think that there's something to battle such that if you ever encounter an infection you can defeat it right off the bat so we're going to get granular here about what we mean by proper intensity and duration of exercise there's a wonderful review that was published in 2019 in the Journal of Sport and Health Science entitled The compelling link between physical activity and the body's defense system and there's a lot to this review article but I'll just highlight a few of the critical features that are going to directly relate to protocols that I think all of you are going to be interested in first of all we know that exercise that's of 60 Minutes in duration or less and that is intense but not allout effort okay here we're not talking about percentage of single repetition max weight here we're not talking about 70 to 85% of one's VO2 max what we're talking about is you subjectively gauging what is a 10 out of 10 effort like you could not do any more you could not contribute any more effort to that exercise bout and that's true whether or not we're talking about resistance training exercise or cardiovascular exercise like running or rowing or things of that sort what we know is that if you do that sort of exercise for about 60 Minutes or Less you promote the exchange of components between the blood and the lymphatic system that increase the circulation of those cells and chemicals within the innate immune system such that not just during exercise but for many many hours afterwards maybe even as much as 24 hours afterwards your innate immune system level of Baseline activity is ramped up allowing you to better combat infections such as colds and flu okay so this is an incentive for getting a regular exercise of 60 Minutes or Less per day making it of sufficient intensity for your anate immune system to deploy more of those chemicals and for your lymphatic and blood circulation to increase their exchange of materials enough that your Nate immune system is bolstered however it is absolutely not the case that more is better in fact it's probably the case that less is better here's what we know for sure and this review covers sort of the extreme of these examples but for instance people that do bouts of walking each day for about 60 Minutes brisk walking experience increased te- cell function so that's an immune cell that goes out and combats cold and flu viruses and natural killer cell activity so those increase increase macras function you are now familiar with these cells if you don't know exactly what they do just keep in mind that you heard about these in the context of what the innate immune system does to go out and fight colds and flu cyto coses increase but not dramatically okay so this is a mild inflammation response stress hormones such as cortisol epinephrine norep nephrine also called adrenaline and noradrenaline those are deployed as well so 60 minutes or less of this moderate to high-intensity exercise creates this mild stress response and an increase in the function of the inate immune system however people that run a marathon and as I recall a marathon is 26.2 miles if I'm not mistaken they experience a very different pattern of immune response to that long bout of exercise so here we're comparing one hour of exercise to 3 hours is that what it takes to run a marathon I have some friends that are marathoners I'm guessing about three maybe four hours if you're really slow but somewhere between you know I don't know two and a half and three hours if you're trained up and you're doing it and you're doing them regularly well here's the point people who just ran a marathon and people who have been training for a marathon and are approaching that Marathon are severely immune compromised the levels of their te- cell function are way below Baseline meaning their inate immune system is not functioning nearly as well as it would if they were to not exercise at all their natural killer cell activity is also greatly diminished these are huge huge reductions in these cells that is in the function of the inate immune system and their stress hormones and their inflammatory molecules such as cyto circulating in their blood are extremely high now again we're representing opposite ends of the spectrum here with 1 hour or less of exercise daily versus 26.2 mile marathon exercise or half marathons as the case may be and let me be very direct I'm not discouraging people from running or training for marathons or half marathons I think that's great just understand what you're doing to your immune system when you do that and take the necessary precautions but I think most people listening to this are trying to think about ways that they can avoid getting colds and flu and certainly running marathons is not going to be the way to do that quite the contrary the way to do that is in addition to the other things we've been talking about to get regular exercise maybe not every single day I'm actually aan of taking one day per week completely off from exercise usually on that day I'll do some sauna and cold if I have it available to me but the point is this you don't have to exercise for an hour a day in order to get this Improvement in the inate immune response data show that you can get this Improvement in anate immune response with as little as 20 minutes per day and probably even as little as 12 minutes per day however if you're going to try and accomplish this increase in the innate immune system function or output with a shorter bout of exercise such as 12 minutes it better be 12 minutes of very high-intensity training in fact that's what lands on my uh for me it's Friday but it doesn't really matter which day of the week there is one day of the week where I do a very short bout of cardiovascular exercise but I'm sprinting hard for anywhere from 20 seconds to a minute and then I'm taking a brief period of rest and then repeating that for a total of 12 minutes now some people here oh only 12 minutes of exercise required and they default to 12 minutes every single time they train I don't think that's a good idea I think we can take the law of averages here and say the following I do believe everyone should do a combination of cardiovascular training and resistance training perhaps I think in general not on the same days but if you're going to do that and you want to maintain healthy immune system function my suggestion what I do is unless it's the long bout of cardiovascular training that I do once a week and long for me means 60 to 90 minutes and sometimes longer if it's a hike which certainly doesn't require that much intensity I suggest warming up for about 5 to 10 minutes and then limiting your total workout duration to about 50 minutes maybe 60 minutes if that's what's required to complete what you need to do in order to keep with your exercise goals but to be very careful about exceeding 75 minutes of exercise in any one single exercise bout and if you remember back to the beginning of the episode when I said that I track what I do on a day-to-day basis and I don't do it in a very detailed way but I do take note of when I've gotten a bad flu or cold I can tell you that in almost every single case where I've gotten a bad flu or cold there are two things that have preceded that bad flu or cold one is sleep deprivation typically it would be nights where I got two hours of sleep or less for more than one night okay the second thing is anytime that I really pushed it with exercise and went all out and I went for 75 minutes and then I continued to 90 minutes and then maybe later that day because somebody invited me on a run or something like that I also did that second run or that second workout of some kind could be running in the morning and weight training in the afternoon some people can do that kind of training on a regular basis even and not get sick I am not such a person I've managed to maintain fairly consistent Fitness output meaning the three cardiovascular and the three weight training sessions per week for more than several decades now and part of the reason I think I've been able to do that is because I don't ever push too hard for too long within a given workout so this is really a call for moderation in terms of the duration and intensity of the exercise that you're doing but we're not talking about really being laidback we're not talking about easy workouts what we're talking about is an hour or less of moderate intensity to high-intensity exercise depending on the duration of that exercise and keeping in mind that when you're doing that you are activating that innate immune system you are literally creating an immune response you're increasing inflammation you're increasing those cyto kindes you're increasing stress stress hormones we have to start to think about exercise for what it is which is a form of stress that induces adaptations Dr Andy Galpin talked a lot about this in the series that he did on exercise physiology it's an excellent series that covers everything from strength to hypertrophy to speed to endurance nutrition supplementation you can find all that at hubman lab.com very easily exercise is a very potent tool we know that we know that in the context of changing Aesthetics like body mass composition you know increasing muscle reducing fat we know that in the context of reducing resting heart rate reducing resting blood pressure we know that in the context of all these other health metrics here we're talking about using exercise as a very potent tool to increase the function of the Nate immune system to keep you healthy not just through the winter months but around the year and especially if you're getting less sleep if you're interacting with kids or adults that are carrying infections home from school or work on a regular basis or maybe you even work in an environment like a hospital or a clinic where you're regularly interacting with patients that have these issues one thing that I often get asked is if I am sleep deprived should I exercise and that's a little bit of a tricky one my initial response for many years was no no if you're sleep deprived you're better off not exercising however I now need to qualify that answer because there are data showing that if you're sleep deprived and you exercise especially if you exercise early in the day and it doesn't disrupt your sleep schedule so it's not making you go to sleep even later the next night that it actually can cause some adjustments in the function of your immune system and in the way that you regulate your blood sugar that offset some of the negative effects of sleep deprivation that said you should never ever compromise the amount of sleep you could get in order to get exercise such that you run yourself down so what I'm really saying here is if you get one bad night's sleep should you skip your workout and you feel like ah you know I'm not feeling sick and should I work out or should I go back to sleep probably going back to sleep is the better idea but if you don't have the option to go back to sleep for whatever reason you can't fall back asleep then you would be wise to do a bout of exercise but I would suggest reducing the intensity and duration of that exercise by about 25% maybe even 50% and that should allow you to offset any of the negative effects of sleep deprivation for that one night keep in mind exercise is not a replacement for sleep and then to allow you to get to sleep at the appropriate time later that night and back onto a regular schedule keeping your innate immune system tuned up and ready to combat any colds or flu now one more point about exercise and here we're also going to dovetail in an important point about nutrition in the review that I mentioned a few moments ago they cover some of the data from studies exploring the post exercise stress response so this is the post exercise induced increase in things like cortisol those natural killer cells the production of white blood cells and so on it's very clear that if you are in a state of chronic stress because you're you're exercising a lot Andor because you're not sleeping enough or for whatever reason maybe you have a lot of Life stress it's very clear that ingesting carbohydrates after exercise can help attenuate some of the inflammation that exercise induces when we talk about carbohydrates we're talking about rice oatmeal pasta those sorts of things soal complex carbohydrates and fruit post exercise has been shown to attenuate to reduce some of the markers of inflammation by about 30 to 40% when contrasted with water only intake especially if you're training fasted so for those of you like me that like to wake up in the morning and just drink fluids you know for me it's water y bate coffee and by the way I've said before that people should delay their caffeine intake 90 minutes if and only if they're experiencing an afternoon crash but that if you are exercising first thing in the morning it's perfectly fine to ingest your caffeine right away so that gives you increase in energy for that exercise that's certainly what I do on days that I exercise but if you fast and then you're drinking caffeine and then you're exercising and that exercise goes longer than 60 Minutes certainly if it goes longer than 75 minutes you would do well to ingest some complex carbohydrates maybe also some fruit perhaps not immediately after exercise but within the 45 minutes or so or hour or so after exercise so that you're not ramping up those inflammatory molecules and leaving them ramped up for many hours into the morning and throughout the day because of course this episode is not about exercise and nutrition but here we're talking about the role that exercise and nutrition play in helping us combat colds and flu by increasing the function of that innate immune system and the reasons why carbohydrates can have this effect on cortisol Etc is an interesting and important discussion into itself we'll leave it for another episode but keep that in mind also I don't know about you but a nice bowl of oatmeal some fruit and a protein drink or some eggs after an hour or so of exercise in the morning when I haven't eaten anything since the night before tastes really really good so continuing with the theme of things that we can do at the level of behaviors to improve the function of our innate immune system and combat colds and flu perhaps even prevent us from getting colds and flu at all but certainly help combat them if they've initially made their way into our system but we haven't developed full-blown symptoms and we want to prevent those full-blown symptoms is the use of deliberate heat exposure in particular sauna there's a nice study on this that was published very recently 2023 the title of the study is the effects of a single and series of finished sauna sessions on the immune system response and heat shock protein 70 levels in trained and untrained men it's a very interesting study they compared athletically trained and non-athletic trained men as most of you probably know when you get into a hot sauna heart rate increases there's vasod dilation there's the increase in the release of heat shock proteins there's the increase in things like dorphin which if it's sufficiently hot are increased to levels that make us feel kind kind of agitated and not so good we have to actively calm ourselves in the sauna so we're not talking about an easy cruise at 150° fenhe we're talking about getting up into the you know 180 degree Fahrenheit or 210 degree Fahrenheit range maybe even higher if you're heat adapted and that the dorphin makes you feel lousy in the short term but that it upregulates a bunch of different biological mechanisms that give you kind of low-level Euphoria and actually the capacity to experience more feelings of well-being from the endorphins that you make after you get out of the sauna this is oh so important to understand whether or not we're talking about exercise or deliberate cold exposure or deliberate heat exposure what happens during the heat exposure cold exposure exercise is more often than not just the trigger for the long-term adaptation that we're seeking just like exercise increases your heart rate and blood pressure but then leads to reductions in resting heart rate and blood pressure and so on and so forth this study is interesting and there are a lot of different takeaways from this study because they compare these two different populations I'll just give you the top Contour of what the protocol entailed there were 10 sauna sessions each of those sauna sessions were three rounds of 15 minutes of sauna so one session meant going into the sauna the sauna was of a given temperature but I think for most people what's going to work in terms of what parallels the study is going to be somewhere between 176 and 210 degrees Fahrenheit depending on how heat adapted you are always be safe don't do this if you're pregnant don't this if you're a child Etc so they're doing three rounds of 15 minutes each separated by 2 minutes during that 2 minutes they take a cool shower where they cool off in some way they're not going into a cold plunge but they're cooling off with a cool shower and they're doing that three times that's one session they do 10 sessions those sauna sessions were spaced apart by at least a few days and the entire experiment meaning all 10 sessions were completed within a 3-we period and then a bunch of things were measured like the amount of white blood cells and immune cells that were deployed after the first session versus the third versus the eth versus the 10th and so on as well as the levels of cortisol and inflammatory markers there are a lot of different things measured in this study here's what we know sauna baths as they're calling them resulted in a statistically significant increase in cortisol concentration after the first and the 10th sauna session okay so every time you go into the sauna you're getting an increase in cortisol we know that because the heat is a stressor again don't think about heat as oh you're just kind of relaxing in the onet so nice you're getting a cortisol response cortisol is a glucocorticoid stress hormone as it's sometimes called which can be a good thing if it sets in motion a number of other things such as the increase in the activity of the anate immune system and indeed that is what they observed after and here I'm paraphrasing after the first and 10th Saab baths they witnessed an increase in lucite count lucaites are a particular type of cell of the inate immune system however only after the last sauna session did this change reach statistical significance in the trained group so what they observed was that athletes who are trained are used to being in high heat conditions because of their athletic training people who are not trained in athletics are not used to that there are a lot of different ways to look at these data but the simplest takeaway is that if you are already very heat adapted because you do sauna regularly or you exercise regularly well then it's going to take a stronger stimulus or more sauna either longer or hotter or more frequent to get the sorts of increases in innate immune response as compared to someone who's never done sauna who's not exercising regularly and that just makes sense if something isn't stressful to you you're not going to get the stimulation of that innate immune response and the overall takeaway from this study was that I do believe that if you're feeling run down a little bit bit or if you're just trying to keep colds and flu at Bay having some regular is practice of getting into the sauna for three rounds of 15 minutes separated by two-minute cool off you don't necessarily have to do a cold shower or a cold Plunge in between although I don't see why you couldn't or wouldn't you could also just get out of the sauna and be in the cool air and then get back in or perhaps you do something more akin to what's been shown in other studies that explore the relationship between heat exposure and immune response which is to do two rounds of 20 minutes or one round of 30 minutes in the sauna whatever you can do safely and comfortably keep in mind safety is Key Don't harm yourself I say that not to protect me but to protect you that sauna is an effective way of increasing the activity of the inate immune system it increases Lucy levels yes it increases cortisol levels but in a way that promote the activity of the inate immune system however and here we are back to exactly the same thing we said about exercise if you're already feeling really rund down feeling kind of heaviness in the body you don't feel well you're starting to get some sniffles don't get in a very hot sauna but for sake of keeping colds and flu at Bay sure do three rounds of 15 minutes in the sauna between 176 degrees 210 degrees whatever you can safely tolerate take those two-minute breaks in between maybe do a cold shower or coolish shower maybe just stand outside the sauna in between if you're feeling really strong do a coal plunge for a minut two minutes in between you don't have to but you certainly could and then get back in and then repeat or just do one 20 minute session or 30 minute session all of which have been shown to promote the activity of the Nate immune system however and I realize I said this before but I feel like I need to say it again especially For You hardcore exercisers or people that really feel like oh I can push through if you're already sick and you have the symptoms of a colder flu you want to limit the amount of stress to your body you want to get into bed and sleep if you can't sleep you want to relax you do not want to exercise you should not exercise not only do you stand to get other people ill by going places where you exercise but even if you exercise at home or in total isolation you're going to prolong the duration of that illness because there are many many reasons why being still slowing your circulation and allowing your innate and then in that case your adaptive immune system to kick in and combat those infections is going to get you back into a regular exercise and work regimen much much faster than would be the case if you were to push through okay so now we get to the portion of the discussion that I think probably many people are anticipating which is what can you take to reduce the probability of getting a colder flu or shorten the duration of a colder flu and I actually put out a call on social media I asked the question on Instagram and on X formerly called Twitter you know what do you do for a colder flu and what are you curious about in terms of what one can take for cold or flu and I got thousands upon thousands of answers however many of those answers converged on some common things things like taking garlic I heard for instance that some people are chewing a raw clove of garlic every day during the winter um I heard about people who take fermented garlic some people swear by eonia some people swear by eonia vitamin C and Zinc now there are far too many compounds that exist in the wellness and indeed in the medical literature to cover all of them so I'm going to highlight a few that I think are especially interesting and that have been shown in p reviewed science to be potentially useful some of these you've heard of before and some of them I think are going to be surprising or at least new to you first let's consider what most people believe to be a very effective way to hasten colds or flu that is to make them last shorter duration of time than they would otherwise maybe even prevent colds or flu the big one there is vitamin C we hear all the time vitamin C antioxidant I grew up in an area where the Noel prize winning chemist lonus Pauling who was a fanatic about vitamin C he took many many grams of vitamin C each day used to tout the benefits of vitamin C here's the deal there is some evidence and it's not great frankly that points to the fact that taking 6 to8 grams grams so that's 6,000 to 8,000 milligrams of Vitamin C per day that is a lot of vitamin C each day can perhaps delay the onset of a cold or shorten the duration of a cold so here we're talking about very high doses and not a very robust effect I should mention that for most people who aren't accustomed to taking much vitamin C if you were to take 6 to eight grams of vitamin C in capsule or powder or pill form chances are you're going to experience some significant gastric distress some people can build up to that level or take it with food in a way that doesn't cause that gastric distress but many people will experience gastric distress there's been a lot said about vitamin C and its other potential roles in our physiology and I don't want to touch on those now because it may have some interesting roles in other aspects of our physiology but I have to say that in scouring the literature on vitamin C I encountered a recent paper so this was published in 2023 and the title of this paper is retraction extra dose of vitamin C based on a daily supplementation shorten the common cold a metaanalysis of nine randomized controlled trials what is this paper that was recently published why is retraction the first word in the title Well turns out that the metaanalysis of nine randomized control trials showing a small but significant Improvement in the outcomes for colds and flu or reduction in probability of getting colds and flu that study was retracted and it was retracted on the basis of multiple instances of an error in which the placebo groups had been double counted in Trials more than the two intervention arms so there were some serious data analysis flaws in that metaanalysis now that is not to say that vitamin C is of zero benefit for reducing the probability of colds and flu but must say provided that you're getting sufficient amounts of vitamin C from your food intake maybe you're also get a little bit in your vitamin mineral supplement or if you take a foundational supplement like ag1 or something similar almost certainly you're getting enough vitamin C it does not seem that taking high doses of vitamin C and I would Place 6 to8 grams of vitamin C in the high dose range is going to be effective for treating or preventing colds and flu so more data may arrive in the near future but vitamin C is probably not a very good investment if you're taking it solely for the purpose of enhancing your immune system function and staving off colds and flu now what about vitamin D we hear a lot these days about the importance of having sufficient vitamin D levels and ideally everyone would get their vitamin D levels measured by regular blood test I do get my blood work done every 6 months I find it be incredibly informative tells me what's going on below the hood in ways that I never could be aware of where I not to get that test but I realize that there's a cost to those tests and not everyone can afford them I think most Physicians would agree that supplementing with anywhere from a th000 to 2,000 IU of vitamin D per day is probably safe for most people and will buffer that level of vitamin D in their system such that they're unlikely to be deficient and unlikely to far exceed what's safe in the body however there are people who need higher levels of vitamin D supplementation in order to achieve sufficient amounts of vitamin D for their mental health and physical health I mean vitamin D is involved in a lot of different processes in the brain and body now it is clear that people who are vitamin D deficient so these are people whose vitamin D level levels have been measured oftentimes have diminished immune system function and are more prone to acute respiratory tract infections there's a very lengthy and very interesting review entitled vitamin D supplementation to prevent acute respiratory tract infections systematic review and metaanalysis of individual participant data this is a beast of a thing um I did read it all very very interesting many many studies the exact takeaways from a large review like this of 20 randomized control trials is a little bit tricky I mean they did conclude that vitamin D supplementation did reduce the risk of acute respiratory tract infection among all the participants however the degree of prevention was small to moderate in some cases they did point out however that just because people with low levels of vitamin D tend to get colds and flu more often than people that don't does not necessarily mean that vitamin D deficiencies are the reason for that for instance we know that people that get regular sunlight exposure and as everyone knows I'm a big big proponent of getting sunlight in your eyes as early as possible in the day after waking up and if it's cloudy out to get even more time outside if you can and if you can't get access to sunlight for whatever reason to perhaps invest in a 10,000 Lux light tablet you can find these online at reasonable cost you know $100 to $200 in some cases getting sunlight sets in motion a huge number of different things including increasing the amount of vitamin D in your system but a bunch of other things as well increases in cortisol increases in dopamine increases in serotonin that Cascade toward and relate to improved immune system function so what is the takeaway here I think that for most people supplementing with a th to 2,000 international units of vitamin D it's probably safe however if you need more vitamin D you won't know that unless you take a vitamin D test that is you measure the amount of vitamin D in your bloodstream and some people indeed need 5,000 to 10,000 IU of vitamin D per day but you don't want to overdose yourself on vitamin D that is if you already have sufficiently high levels of vitamin D in your system and you're getting sufficient sunlight well then taking 10,000 or more international units of vitamin D could possibly be detrimental I think it's fair to say based on the metaanalysis and review that I mentioned a moment ago and the other papers that I was able to glean that vitamin D itself is unlikely to be the sole protectant against colds and flu but it's probably a good thing to include in your general kit of nutrition and supplementation tools if your goal is to keep your innate immune system fighting off colds and flu sufficiently other things that perhaps support the innate immune system are going to be as I mentioned earlier the things that support the gut microbiome so those low sugar fermented foods maybe a Prebiotic probiotic capsule maybe something like athletic greens ag1 although certainly you could achieve sufficient microbiome support from Foods if you're careful and intentional about the foods that you select now the other compound or substance that we often hear about in the context of colds or flu is eonia eonia is a compound that has been proposed to improve immune system function now when you go into the data and you explore what does taking eonia tinctures or other forms of eonia really do to avoid colds and flu the answer that comes back is not much if anything now is taking eonia dangerous probably not however it has been shown in a few studies that people that take eonia regularly at high doses can potentially impede the function of their innate immune system that is reductions in white blood cell count reductions in those natural killer cells so my suggestion would be if you absolutely love e eona for whatever reason you're convinced that it helps you that you reserve to taking it when you're starting to feel a little bit rund down or perhaps just in the winter month not months plural but month when you're most prone to those cold and flu infections but then not taking it continuously throughout the year and certainly not for more than four weeks at a time but again if you're doing that just know that there aren't really any strong scientific data to support the use of eona by contrast there are pretty darn good data that support supplementing with zinc as a way to combat colds and flu in particular colds now here the dosages really matter it's been shown that if you take less than 75 milligrams of zinc in supplement form to try and impact the probability of getting or shortening a common cold it's not going to work you need to take 100 milligrams or more and now 100 milligrams or more of zinc for some people it's going to cause some gastric distress if you take it on an empty stomach I've actually made the mistake of taking I think it was 50 milligrams of zinc on an empty stomach and I felt really nauseous did not feel well so don't take zinc on an empty stomach and if you're trying to shorten a colder flu that you think you've already contracted or you're trying to keep a cold or flu at Bay because you were around people with cold or flu or you're just worried about it taking 100 milligrams of zinc perhaps divide it up into two doses of 50 milligrams each or maybe 100 milligrams all at once but making sure that you take that with at least a moderately sized or full meal certainly could be advantageous keep in mind that people that are older than 65 are perhaps the ones that need to supplement zinc the most also keep in mind that children meaning people younger than 15 should probably not supplement with too much zinc it can be problematic and certainly pregnant women should have talked to their doctor before supplementing with zinc indeed anytime you're going to take anything whether or not you're young old pregnant or not you should consult your physician before you take anything or remove anything from your health protocols one of the more interesting aspects of supplementing with zinc that I was able to find in the literature is a three times faster recovery rate for people that already contracted a cold so in this study people weren't taking 100 milligram but the dosage came pretty close they were taking 90 milligram per day of zinc acetate and they experienced a three times faster recovery rate from that cold compared to people who were not taking the zinc now of course there could be other factors as well but the study was fairly convincing so given that zinc is fairly low cost given that it's generally safe for most people and the fact that if you take it with food it doesn't cause any discomfort supplementing with Inc at a level of anywhere from 90 to 100 milligrams per day probably no more than 120 per day seems like a logical way to Stave off colds and flu and reduce the duration of a cold or flu should you contract one now I want to be very clear that I've been talking about colds and flu kind of in uh in concert kind of treating them more or less as the same thing some of that is for sake of time and simplicity most all the studies showing a benefit of zinc are studies showing the benefit of zinc for the treatment or the hastening of colds not for flu specifically however I consulted with a few Physicians one of whom is expert in this area and he said I didn't see any reason why you wouldn't take zinc if you had a flu there's no reason to think that it would introduce any kind of increased risk but again consult with your physician before taking or removing anything from your supplement regimen now a lot of the compounds that we're discussing are sort of conventional in the sense that I think most people have probably heard of them already perhaps the most esoteric sounding one thus far is eona which we established probably not very helpful for colds or flu but we've been talking about vitamin C we've been talking about zinc vitamin D making sure you're getting your sunlight supporting your microbiome and so on and so on one compound that I'm guessing most people perhaps have not heard of but that is very interesting that in fact I've taken before and that I stock in my supplement cabinet in case I feel like I'm coming down with something is an acetylcysteine or Knack what is Knack Knack is a precursor to glutathione what is glutathione glutathione is the master antioxidant it's involved in reducing what are called reactive oxygen species which build up in cells that are very metabolically active reactive oxygen species build up even more in cells that are under stress or a body that's under stress and it also has the property of reducing reactive nitrogen species reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species significantly increase under conditions of infection and having sufficient levels of glutathione is a good thing now netal is used in certain clinics overseas and in the US as a way to treat cystic fibrosis because it's also a mucolytic and cystic fibrosis is the buildup of fluid in the lungs and a mucolytic substance is something that loosens up the mucus and allows it to flow more readily out of different cavities of the body including the lungs the nasal passages and sinuses and indeed last winter I did unfortunately get a cold I told you about once every 18 to 24 months I get a cold and it was a pretty nasty 1 I was feeling super congested at first I thought it was an ear infection pretty quickly I realized I had a cold and I was feeling so congested I wasn't sleeping well and it was suggested to me to take an acetylcysteine I ended up doing that at a dosage of anywhere from 600 to 900 milligrams three times per day so it was a 600 to 900 milligram capsule depending on which brand I purchased a lot of different versions of this out there on the market I took it morning late morning and afternoon and indeed it is a powerful mucolytic the mucus just starts flowing out of you you better have an extra box of tissues handy and that greatly relieved the pressure in my sinuses and the reason I liked using Knack is because I've actively avoided using decongestants that one can purchase over the counter most decongestants are of the Alpha One Agonist variety what's an alpha 1 Agonist it causes Vaso constriction that Vaso constriction can be beneficial in preventing some of the intense congestion that one gets when you have a sinus infection or a cold or a flu but then when those decongestants wear off off one tends to get a rebound increase in congestion and it's really painful headache Etc in addition some over-the-counter decongestants can be habit forming not necessarily addictive but habit forming and they don't seem to have any other positive health benefits so I prefer not to take decongestant if I can avoid it I had a very good experience with Knack and the use of knack and acetal cysteine as a decongestant and also as a way to prevent getting colds and flu is not an entirely new idea in fact there's a paper dating back to 1997 entitled attenuation of influenza-like symptomology and Improvement of cellmediated immunity with long-term anical cinee treatment now in this study they looked at people who were taking 600 milligrams of anal cysteine twice per day for 6 months and what they observed is that the people who took anical cysteine had a significantly lower probability of Contracting influenza now this is but one study there have been a few other studies and unfortunately there isn't a large body of research looking at Knack as a preventive for colds and flu but the data in this paper are interesting enough and I was compelled by them enough to seek out a physician who I noce it was answering my prompts on social media about what do you use for colds and flu and when I put that out there as I mentioned I got thousands of responses on both Twitter X and on Instagram and one particular physician who happens to have a YouTube account his name is Dr schwell he's a medical doctor he works in an INT Ive care unit and he deals with a lot of patients who have different strains of flu in fact he was the one that cued me to the fact that this year there seems to be a fair number of H1N1 flu virus going around and remember the H1N1 flu virus while it's not you know deadly to everyone it can be quite severe in some people so we do want to be on the lookout for and trying to avoid getting H1N1 if we can I spoke to Dr schel he was very generous with his knowledge about anical cysteine he did acknowledge and I'll acknowledge again here that it would be great to get more randomized control trial data on netal cine but we did talk about this paper this 1997 paper and he did mention that he and other clinicians that are forced to be in the hospital dealing with patients all through the winter and all year long they're getting bombarded with cold and flu exposure all the time that they meaning he and some of his colleagues deliberately take anical cysteine as a preventative to try and reduce the probability of getting colds and flu and while we don't want to make too much of any one study or anic data which is what we're describing when I tell you about a physician who told me this or what I did and experien that I think it is worth paraphrasing the study that I mentioned before NAC prevented the symptomatic forms caused by here they're talking about the ah1n1 influenza virus quite efficiently since the large majority of infected subjects in the placebo group 79% developed clinically apparent disease versus only 25% in the knat group in other other words Approximately 80% of people in the study who did not take an acetylcysteine got influenza whereas only 25% of the people who were taking anical cysteine contracted influenza so that's a fairly dramatic difference and certainly the fact that anal cysteine has been shown to increase glutathione that's its primary mechanism of action as far as we know and the fact that increases in glutathione are generally healthy and good for us and the fact that anical cysteine is still available legally over the counter in the US at least currently it is some years back as you may have heard the FDA called for removal of netal cysteine from over-the-counter sales that I should point out was based on the fact that certain supplement companies were making claims about netal cine as a treatment for hangover and making a bunch of other claims for which there was no real data but either because the FDA was effective in getting those companies to cease those claims Andor because of advocacy groups which worked very hard to try and keep netline available for over-the-counter sales as far as I know at least right up until prior to recording this episode netal cysteine is available for sale over the counter so whether or not you decide to use netal cysteine as a preventative and there again the dosage is about 1,200 milligrams per day divided into two different dosages of 600 milligrams each or if you decide to take anal cysteine in the manner that I did which was not as a preventative but once I had a cold couldn't fight it off apparently got the cold decided to take 900 Mig three times per day avoiding that intake close to sleep because it did disrupt my sleep if I took it too close to sleep because of the way that the mucus would flow so readily you know essentially I know it sounds gross but I felt like it was filling up the back of my throat so-called postnasal drip but it felt like post naal waterfall and I decided to restrict my intake of anical cysteine to earlier in the day only and of course there's the third option which is that you opt to not take anical cysteine until more randomized control trials are published or not take an Cal cysteine at all because you're of the sort that thinks okay with some sleep a hot shower a good meal some chicken soup maybe a little garlic who knows maybe you have some other tools and techniques that you like you like that ginger tea lemon Etc maybe that's all you need and if that's all you need and that's all you want in order to deal with a cold or flu be my guest I certainly am not here to convince anyone that you have to take a certain supplement but I did feel like I would be remiss if I didn't cover what are generally referred to as the so-called preventatives and treatments for colds and flu things like zinc vitamin D vitamin C we now know that unfortunately vitamin C gets a you know probably a D minus or an F at least as the data stand now but there are these other things like zinc and potentially an acetal cysteine that can be beneficial in shortening the duration of colds or flu and perhaps even helping us avoid getting colds or flu all together if you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast please subscribe
