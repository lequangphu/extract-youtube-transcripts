Title: How Relationships Shape Your Brain | Dr. Allan Schore
Published: 2024-11-11 13:01:08 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. Allan Schore, Ph.D., a faculty member in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles, a longtime clinical psychotherapist, and a multi-book author. We discuss how early child-parent interactions shape brain circuitry, impacting our ability to form attachments, manage emotions, and navigate conflict and stress. We cover how the development of right-brain circuitry related to emotional processing and the unconscious mind regulates physiological responses, influencing adult friendships and romantic relationships. We also explore how improving your ability to listen to the emotional tone—rather than just the meaning—of words is a vital skill for fostering better relationships with yourself and others, and how it plays a role in reshaping brain circuitry.

Additionally, we explain how circuits in the right brain hemisphere drive creativity and intuition and discuss activities to access the unconscious mind. This episode delves into how the unconscious mind regulates emotions—both your own and others’—and shapes our sense of self. By the end, you’ll have new knowledge and tools to build more secure, meaningful, and impactful connections of all kinds: professional, romantic, familial, friendships, and beyond.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Alan Shaw Dr Alan Shaw is a clinician psychoanalyst and he is the world expert in how childhood attachment patterns impact our adult relationships including romantic relationships friendships and professional relationships as well as our relationship to ourselves Dr sh is on the faculty in the department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the University of California Los Angeles School of Medicine he is also the author of several important books including right brain Psychotherapy and development of the unconscious mind today's discussion with Dr Shaw is an extremely important one for everyone to hear to understand themselves and to understand the people in their lives why well we all go through the first 24 months of age you wouldn't be listening to this if you hadn't and during that first 24 months of age your brain develops in a particular way depending on how you interacted with your primary caretaker namely your mother but also your father or other primary caretakers in that first 24 months your right brain and your left brain mediate very specific but different processes for instance today you'll learn from Dr Shore that your right brain circuitry that is Pacific circuitries on the right hand side of your brain are involved in developing a very specific type of resonance with your primary caretaker that transitions from states of calm and quiessence that you both share simultaneously to states that are considered up states of excitement of enthusiasm of being wide-eyed and the transitioning back and forth between those States as Dr Shaw explains is critical to our emotional development and how we form attachments later so if you've heard for instance of avoidant attachment or or anxious attachment or secure attachment today you'll understand why those particular attachment Styles develop how they translate from early life to your adolescence teen years and adulthood and in fact how those childhood attachment patterns which of course we can't control for ourselves but we can control for our children how we can modify them through very specific protocols in order to achieve better relations with both others and with ourselves it's indeed a very special conversation and to my knowledge unlike any other discussion about relationships Neuroscience or psychology that certainly I have heard before and I fully expect that for you it will be as well before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is David David makes a protein bar unlike any other it has 28 g of protein only 150 calories and 0 g of sugar that's right 28 g of protein and 75% of its calories come from protein These Bars from David also taste amazing my favorite flavor is chocolate chip cookie dough but then again I also like the chocolate fudge flavored one and I also like the cake flavored one basically I like all the flavors they're incredibly delicious for me personally I strive to eat mostly Whole Foods however when I'm in a rush or I'm away from home or I'm just looking for a quick afternoon snack I often find that I'm looking for a highquality protein source with David I'm able to get 28 gram of protein with the calories of a snack which makes it very easy to hit my protein goals of one gram of protein per pound of body weight each day and it allows me to do that without taking in excess calories I typically eat a David bar in the early afternoon or even mid-afternoon if I want to bridge that gap between lunch and dinner I like that it's a little bit sweet so it tastes like a tasty snack but it's also giv me that 28 gram of very high quality protein with just 150 calories if you would like to try David you can go to david.com huberman again the link is david.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity now I've spoken before on this podcast about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts of quality sleep each night now one of the best ways to ensure a great night's sleep is to ensure that the temperature of your sleeping environment is correct and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3° and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase about 1 to 3° eight sleep makes it very easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment by allowing you to program the temperature of your mattress cover at the beginning middle and end of the night I've been sleeping on an eight- Sleep mattress cover for nearly 4 years now and it has completely transformed and improved the quality of my sleep eight sleep recently launched their newest generation of the Pod cover called the Pod 4 ultra the Pod 4 ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity I find that very useful because I like to make the bed really cool at the beginning of the night even colder in the middle of the night and warm as I wake up that's what gives me the most slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep it also has snoring detection that will automatically lift your head a few degrees to improve your air flow and stop your snoring if you'd like to try an eights Sleep mattress cover you can go to 8sleep.com huberman to access their Black Friday offer right now with this Black Friday discount you can save up to $600 on their pod for Ultra this is eight sleep's biggest sale of the year eight sleep currently ships to the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com huberman and now for my discussion with Dr Allan Shaw Dr Alan Shaw welcome nice to be here to kick things off I have a simple question which is what percentage of our thinking and our Behavior do you think is governed by our conscious mind versus our unconscious mind you understand that I was trained in psychoanalysis and I'm a psychodynamic psychotherapist in addition to a scientist neuroscientist so the unconscious has been something that I have been aware of and have been writing about and it's a central part of what I'm writing about to this day essentially as we're going to see I'm suggesting that the right brain is the unconscious mind so when you ask what how much of things really are conscious and how much are UNC conscious I'm also looking at that neurobiologically in terms of how much of activity is going on in the right brain the right brain is always processing information always especially emotional information at levels beneath conscious awareness especially when you're in in in an emotional interaction so how much really are things that conscious I would say that when it comes to the basic motivations of why we do what we do 95 to 90% of that is is unconscious and there has been data to show that that is the case that most although we think that our conscious mind literally is making all of these decisions underneath at at all points in time the unconscious is operating used to be thought that the unconscious only comes forth in dreams at night well we now know that this right brain is reading unconscious Communications between us Communications is it safe to be with you do you understand what I'm saying really the critical ones always operating and much more important than we had thought itself let's start thinking about and talking about this right brain versus left brain thing and what I'd like to know is when we come into this world how much lateralization as we call it um how much right versus left brain specialization is there at the time when we exit the womb when we take our first breath the answer to that is is is pretty clear at this point in time and incidentally some of these questions about the unconscious are provided by neurobiology but essentially here's what we know there was discoveries that were being made in the 80s and the 90s about the human brain growth spurt the human brain growth spurt occurs from the last trimester of pregnancy through the second until the third year of Life all of that time is a period of right hemisphere dominance and actually there have been six major studies in Neuroscience Laboratories around the world that have shown that the right hemisphere is dominant during that period of time in fact there recent study in Mexico where they looked at 2 to 3 months 6 to 8 months 9 to 12 months at each point in time they noticed that the right hemisphere was accelerating its growth the left was not so the right is dominant very early in fact there's evidence to to show that even in utero there is a right lateralization now remember the lateralization is part of all systems and what is lateralized is not only the cortical areas but the subcortical areas Etc so if you take let's say the amydala there's a difference between the right amigdala and the left amydala and again the the right hemisphere so the answer to that is very clearly now the left hemisphere does not come into a growth spurt until the end of the SE second year and into the third year up until that point which means everything about attachment is about right brain Dynamics does that mean that everything about attachment is occurring in the first you know uh 24 months yes absolutely and it's occurring during that brain growth spurt while the right hemisphere so essentially what you have now is that in the baby's brain that baby's brain is now in a right brain growth spurt and the mother now is shaping that baby's right brain through the attachment mechanism through her regulation of that brain so she helped shaping that brain For Better or For Worse and incidentally that means also not only secure attachments but also the matter because it's for better or worse it's also the early evolution of insecure attachments and we'll talk about what those insecure attach all of those really are being shaped by the right what's more there's evidence to show that it goes right hemisphere then it goes left hemisphere and then it goes back into left and back and right along the along the lifespan so although you have a tremendous growth spur more than any other time in the first two two and a half three years of life think now about adolescence where you have another growth spurt is adolescence marked by a right brain growth spurt it's marked by the initially right and then it goes left so essentially with puberty and with the onset of testosterone and and androgens and estrogens it shifts now into another growth Spirit at that point in time uh which means just for the record now the attachment relationship which is essentially going to be about how we regulate our emotion because I'll be talking about attachment is about the communication of emotions right brain to right brain in the first two years of life and about the regulation of emotions in that same period of time Etc but ultimately that leads to the strategies that we have for aect regulation for a an attachment is essentially aect regulation affc communication and affect regulation so now what you're looking at if you have a mother and an infant they are communicating with each other right brain to right brain and how are they doing it by face voice and gesture the mother is now reading the expressions of the baby's face the visual the auditory the pro of the voice and then the tactiles so she's picking up these kinds of communications that are coming out of that baby tactile gestural Visual and she's now picking up those Communications now she's resonating with those Communications and then she is going to regulate those Communications and that's essentially what it's about in the end what we have is strategies of affect regulation how we regulate affect for the rest of our lives depends upon the attachment relationship of the first two years which is a right brain to right brain connection now there have been hundreds thousands of studies on attachment as you're well aware of at this point in time but the key to it literally I be I began this in 1994 with my first book a regulation and the origin of the self the neurobiology of emotional development okay remember BBY was studying attachment in the 60s but the problem of emotion really was not picked up and early on when they were looking at attachment they were looking at behaviors and they were looking at cognition so if you know the attachment literature remember the strange situation yeah just to remind listeners I've talked about this on previous podcast I'll provide a link to that segment but a strange situation can briefly be described as parent and uh usually mother and child come into the clinic um they deliberately leave the baby with a caretaker um this is sort of a pseudo daycare type situation mother leaves and then there's a lot of attention paid to how the infant or young child toddler whatever age they were looking at reacts are they nervous are they able to engage in play um and then they look at the return of the mother and how they react to that and there was this classification of behaviors along the lines of um secure attached insecure attached um there was a uh a categorization of kind of uh an amalgam of different things these so-called dbab that were uh kind of um a bunch of other things and this is where um we hear a lot nowadays about uh secure insecure and anxious and avoidant uh adult relationship Styles there's been a lot written about that and talked about that uh we don't have time to go into all that in detail but this is what Dr sha is referring to I'm really intrigued by this idea that there's a right brain left brain uh dominance that takes place throughout the lifespan and has it been carefully mapped into adulthood such that we can say as a function of chronological age um you know when somebody hits their early 30s that they're more right brain or left brain dominant or is it more um developmental Milestones as opposed to chronological age I think it's developmental Milestones there you know I'm thinking uh that um remember Eric Ericson talking about different stages of life and how you have a high Roy here literally because the attachment is a hierarchy it starts subcortical and then it goes to cortical so so what he said was that there are changes along the line and that um it it it fits with that so the attaching relationship is there at later points in time and really what it does it guides us through our relationships with other people it certainly guides us through strategies of what to do with stress and that way that we deal with that stress is now going to depend upon how the mother is regulating that baby stress during a CR itical period now the the term critical period is a CR is an important one here too because again at at the first two years of life it's the right brain is is in that critical period there but that leads to strategies of aect regulation of how we deal with stress but also how we deal with novel situations and again all of it has to do with emotion now I jumped there because I I talked about there was attachment models move from Behavior to uh cognition to emotion and essentially the first book that I wrote was on the neurobiology of emotional development and in 1994 when I came out with that book that was about the same time that Antonio damasio came out with his book and really it was not until the mid90s partly because of the neural Imaging which was coming during you remember the decade of the brain that uh emotion really now became a matter that science Wasing looking at for the first time the point that I'm making here is that attachment is not psychological it's psychobiological and there was always this Rift between the psychological and the biological but when you're talking about emotions you're not only talking about psychological events you're talking about physiological events that are associated with those events for example the physiology of the stress response a physiology of the sympathetic nervous system which is energy expending and the parasympathetic nervous system which is energy conserving so the mother is a regulator of that and the way that she is a regulator of that baby is that she's tracking that baby's arousal levels she's tracking that baby's emotions as they change in time moment to moment and then she's synchronizing with that and that allows her now to be able to regulate it so we're going from the recognizing that baby's emotions synchronizing with those emotions and then being an aect regulator so the mother who is securely attached now is a good affect regulator of that baby she not only is an affect regulator of the negative states of the baby because negative States and negative aects are adaptive by definition baby cries mother nurses baby and there that's a signal she sending there literally and the mother then intuitively knows intuitively knows she's not using her left brain to figure out what to do with that baby she's doing it intuitively and intuition is a right brain function and she's regulating that baby implicitly now let's go back over implicit to explicit okay you're seeing a lot now about the shift from explicit to implicit something that is implicit goes on at levels beneath awareness so when she is intuitively knowing what to do that right now this baby is is down regulating too much and she wants to bring that baby up should now use her tone of voice literally to raise that baby up into a more excited state or if the baby is disregulated sympathetic hyperarousal she knows how to downregulate that and she'll downregulate that by her facial expression by the tone of her voice now now her tone of her voice is now trying to soften and to quiet down so Essen what attachment is is the regulator of arousal of emotional arousal and that emotional arousal also includes the autonomic nervous system so what we have here is the regulation attachment of the lyic system the emotion processing lyic system positive and negative and the autonomic nervous system so they are limbic autonomic circuits and those circuits are in the right brain now on this matter as it turns out the right brain has a control system of attachment now since the right brain is there first before the left because there's no speech at two years she's regulating this baby at two months 6 months 12 months all of it is occurring non-verbal she's doing this implicitly not explicitly the left hemisphere processes explicit stimuli conscious stimuli rational stimuli that's not there everything is being done implicitly beneath levels of awareness and uh again that allows it to be the regulation so attachment Theory my attachment Theory regulation theory is essentially attachment is interactive regulation Stay With Me Now ultimately what we have are two forms of of of Regulation what we're doing is we're regulating the self right you I mean it's it's the subjective self which is in the right hemisphere the left is objective self the left is verbal conscious she's regulating the right Hemisphere and she's doing that again by tracking the baby's emotional states as I said but but again what the child learns now from that is that her right brain is becoming more and more complex from the first year to the second year and it's going to turn out some of these functions that are more complex are being also stimulated by the mother and ultimately by the end of the second year that baby can regulate its emotional states by itself in its right brain but we have two forms of Regulation you can regulate your states by Auto regulation by yourself in other words you're not with other human beings at this point in time you have a an efficient right brain which can regulate and incidentally what we're talking about here is the regulation of the amydala by the right orbital frontal cortex the right orbital frontal CX is the highest level of the right hemisphere it's also has the most sophistic ated and the latest evolving parts of the brain are in the right frontal cortex not the left the right orbital frontal not the left dorsal lateral cortex is the key to this so what we learn from attachment here again is how to both in a secure attachment how to auto regulate your emotions when you're apart from people in other words you go to a quiet place at this point in time you're regulating yourself down so to speak and you're getting nice regulation of the amydala by the right overal front cortex or interactive regulation which is now you go to another human being we go to another human being under times of stress in an optimal situation we also go to another human being to share Joy States and remember I said that the mother is upregulating Joy States and down regulating negative States so in a secure attack you have somebody now who can do both in certain forms of insecure attachment that's not going to happen the avoidant attachment is always autoregulating his States so uh just so I'm clear in avoidant attachment the baby which is now let's say 2 and a half years old um three years old that's already a toddler that's a toddler excuse me um the toddler is auto regulating more often than seeking another to help uh sort of do coordinated regulation yeah what I'm what I'm saying is a secure attachment and and let's s of only backup step on that the key to attachment is psychobiological Attunement you know the phrase notice psychobiological Attunement that the mother is regulating not only the psychological aspect but literally is as regulating the physiological aspect of that which means that she's regulating the autonomic nervous system think about porous social engagement system what we have here is the capacity by insecure attachment who have and then the second part of the the attachment is repair now let me go back psychobiological Attunement sometimes she Mis attunes sometimes she misreads the baby States for one reason or another what happen in a good enough caregiving is that the mother who has Mis attuned now re returns to that baby now resynchronizes with that baby now reconnects right brains to right brains with that baby and that repair is a key here you have misattunement and repair so the key to a secure attachment is not only psychobiological Attunement but it's also also the repair of the misattunement and it that allows the baby now to EXP understand that situation and being able to use that now to order a case that's a secure but if she misat tunes for example and doesn't repair let's say or she's not that good at psychobiological attuning let's say as an avoidant mother because avoidant personalities are uncomfortable with real closeness another term for an avoidant personality is a dismissive personality and what they they are dismissing is the need for interactive regulation so they're always Auto regulating it or you have another time in which you have another form of attachment an insecure anxious attachment where that person is always interactively regulating or is always going to others to help them regulate but can't Auto regulate I think this is a really important thing to hover on for a moment just um given some context about um hundreds of thousands of questions that I get about avoidant versus secure versus uh anxious attach and and you stated it all incredibly clearly but I want to make sure that we uh double click on this as they say um the idea that if a child and mother did not coordinate their um autonomic the word synchronize synchronize um did not synchronize their autonomic regulation in the proper way that there would be a non in Secure attachment I'm using that language for a specific reason um makes total sense but this idea that if the child which soon the baby which is a toddler at three or so um is avoidant then they're going to have to learn to Auto regulate and they're going to seek others to help them regulate less than a secure attached and the anxious attached baby toddler adolescent adult will do just the the opposite they're going to have a hard time self soothing but they are going to feel let's say these might be the kind of people that don't well tolerate um a text message not getting responded to at a very short latency for instance and we all and we all yes depending on context we have this right but um I find this to be incredibly important which is why I wanted to go back through it because I think nowadays we hear so much about anxious and securely attached avoiding Etc in the of adult romantic relationships but I hope that people are realizing the truly incredible importance of your work which is that the same circuitry and mechanisms that are used to establish infant mother attachment are repurposed later in life for adult relationships I I think that when we hear that it makes sense but I don't think that most people know that they assume somehow that there's circuitry in our brain and body for adult romantic attack M that is distinct from our attachment circuitry that we had with our parent and I think your work speaks very loudly um that they are in fact the exact same all of this is happening in the right brain all of it and incidentally attachment relationship is retained as an autobiographical memory in the first two years of life even before there's a left hemisphere and that under later stress situation that will be the key there incidentally the attachment whether it's secure or insecure is also the key to positive and negative transferences that's where it's communicated um let me go back and say a little bit more about one other form of attachment and that you mentioned the type D attachment the the D babies dis disorganized babies so you have secure you have two types of organized insecurely avoiding and the anxious and then you have a disorganized disoriented one now ultimately that person under stress is not able to Auto regulate or to interact regulate so what they will do at that point now now I'm now thinking about let's say PTSD various uh borderline personality disorder that person now literally can't go to the other for order regulation or inative regulation that person now will use a a defense literally to shut down the ATT attachment system and that's exactly what dissociation is dissociation just shuts down the attachment so in the anxious attachment you have a continual activation of the attachment system which means a continual activation of the right hemisphere all of the time and in the insecure dismissive attachment you have a deactivation of the attachment system which would be a deactivation of the right brain so in the end a secure attachment is an efficient one but it's an efficient one that can switch back and forth between that not only that it also at a later point in time when the left comes online it can also communicate much better with the left hemisphere that you know then without that regulation theory is essentially a theory of the development of the self in an optimal situation but it also talks about the psychopath ogenesis of the self the early origins of psychiatric disorders and personality disorders and I'm thinking about not only schizophrenia and depression but I'm now thinking about um uh narcissistic personality disorders borderline personality disorders maybe we'll come back to more on that and then ultimately the repair of the self so regulation theory is about the development of the self the psychopath ogenesis of the self and then the repair of the self because these attachment situations are now going to play out under all periods of stress the right hemisphere is dominant for the stress response the right hemisphere is dominant for the sympathetic nervous system the energy expending and the right hemisphere is dominant for the parasympathetic nervous system so again all of that will play out at later points under stress and when those systems break down that's when the patient will will will form symptomatologies and come into therapy and in therapy the the therapist now the key I'm jumping here no this is great because there's a right brain to right brain interaction between the mother and the infant there's also a right brain to right brain interaction between the therapist and the patient and the key to to both of them is regulation person is coming in in a disregulated state the key to to that is regulation and the key to any form of therapy whatever the form of it is again is interactive regulation and it's a therapeutic relationship the thing which is the best indicator of whether somebody will do well out of therapy and whether a clinician will do well out of therapy is how well they can deal with the therapeutic relationship and a really good therapist literally knows how to bring back those attachment things there because now the person is starting to feel safety and trusted and in Cally attachment is about safety and Trust which is very much autonomic but again here um the key to uh to therapy is being able to form a therapeutic relationship with the patient so the key here is can the therapist form co-create a therapeutic relationship with an avoidant patient with a secure patient with anxious patient or the borderline patient as you can imagine the toughest thing is going to be able to do with the borderline patient with the schizophrenic patient so what you have here is that the attachment Dynamics are laying out so in the very first session what's happening the therapist is listening to the verbalizations of the patient in order to diagnose and understand the symptomatology but the therapist is also listening beneath the words and the patient is tracking the attachment relationship underneath it tracking the arousal and the arousal disregulation underneath that tracking it in his own body so to speak Etc and again that is a different type of listening again the therapist is listening to a left brain but more or less the therapist is listening to the right brain and the question is how does a therapist do that and in order just for the record for the therapist to be able to get to the attachment Dynamics which are right lateralized the therapist has got to switch out of the left into the right and there's a term for that the term for that is surrender surrender you cannot consciously purposely put yourself into the right you've got to let go you've got to let go think let it be so to speak I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor ag1 ag1 is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink with adaptogens I've been taking ag1 daily since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast the reason I started taking ag1 and the reason I still take ag1 once and often twice a day is because it is the highest quality and most complete foundational nutritional supplement what that means is that ag1 ensures that you're getting all the necessary vitamins minerals and other micronutrients to form a strong foundation for your daily Health ag1 also has probiotics and prebiotics that support a healthy gut microbiome your gut microbiome can consist of trillions of microorganisms that line your digestive tract and impact things such as your immune system status your metabolic Health your hormone health and much more so I've consistently found that when I take ag1 daily my digestion is improved my immune system is more robust I rarely get sick and my mood and mental focus are at their best in fact if I could take Just One supplement that supplement would be ag1 if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer for this month only November 2024 ag1 is giving away one free month supply of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil in addition to the usual welcome kit of five free travel packs and a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 with your order omega-3 fatty acids are critical for brain health mood cognition and much more again go to drink a1.com huberman to claim this special offer tell me more about uh surrender and I just want to make sure I understand this is surrender on the part of the therapist trying to uh yes listen to The Narrative that the patient is sharing but also paying attention to the underlying emotional state is the person uh quaking are they um Angry is there uh feelings of um despair shock uh hyper dis right so they so they're carrying this in in their parallel tracks and then is the is the goal of the therapist if they're an effective one to then soothe the patient or is it to allow the patient to have some sort of catharsis some release of this like at what point does the therapists intervene and try and coordinate and show the the patient a different a different way to think about and feel about the topic matter what I'm suggesting here is that essentially the therapist is listening left brain to Left Brain but the therapist also is always listening beneath the words Etc and he's listening to the right brain to right brain Communications and the patient now who is depressed is coming out with rip brain Communications there's sadness in the voice the face is clearly disregulated and essentially as the therapist is tracking that the the emotional arousal whether it's into hypoarousal and depression or hyperarousal in you know into anxiety the first thing there is to synchronize with that patient so that my physiology is sinking with their physiology and and now through the right insula inter receptively I now literally am feeling in my body what the patient is feeling in their body I Now understand that patient from the inside out and incidentally what I'm picking up in my body about the disregulation of that patient may be very different than the verbal report that that patient is giving at that time but the key here literally just like the mother is synchronizing with that baby's crescendos and the decrescendos of that autonomic state of those emotional state I'm picking up those points where they are shifting into and out of an emotional state I'm synchronizing with that and then ultimately when I'm in sync with that kind of thing then at that point purely implicitly I'm now starting to slow the tone of my voice if I want to reduce that arousal down or I'm up regulating the voice at that point in time I am now interactively regulating and we are now synchronized together so essentially what's going to happen is that as we synchronize as they're going to disregulation we're now synchronizing together as we're going down into into regulation so the therapist can um literally and somatically um show the patient what Auto regulation is like or what coordinated regulation is like and you'll see it on my face face voice gesture you'll see it on my face you'll see it in the tone of my voice you'll see it in my gestures those three sensory modalities are now going back and forth between us so the key of the first session literally is not only to diagnose really it's to start to begin to synchronize with that patient and to form a Therapeutic Alliance with that patient and at the end of the first session the patient may say I don't know why but I'm feeling better and I have some idea that you can understand but it's got to be more than that what I am feeling literally so often nowadays I think we hear that um adult romantic relationships can provide a a healing of some of the failures of childhood attachment um and there's also a phrase thrown around a lot that um we need to learn to parent ourselves um this is more of a pop psychology uh online social media thing you know that that people need to learn to mother and father themselves at some level to self soothe and to you know who knows what that means I'm not going to try and Define it it's not operationally defined so the question I have is um to what extent do you think the process that you just described with a therapist can start to rewire some of the um the capacity to Auto regulate or coordinated regulate essentially here um what you have is over time partly because of this synchron first of all let me let me let me spell synchrony with the capital S what I mean by that is in the Last 5 Years a huge amount of information has come out about this idea about interpersonal synchrony the term synchrony comes from the Greek sync meaning the same chrony time same time so that literally two people literally are synchronized in the same we are feeling something in the same moment and we are feeling it spontaneously between ourselves we are feeling that kind of situation so again here the key to the mother really even more than the auto regulation the key is interactive regulation number one number two it's occurring on an implicit level the mother literally is doing this without any conscious awareness she's doing this intuitively the right hemisphere is intuitive and it's imagistic it's not rational and logical the key to any disorder whatever it is is the regulation of a particular State the regulation of Rage the regulation of loss the regulation the disregulation of a shame a disgust so essentially what you have is the regulation of all of these emotions but that regulation I want to point out is all implicit and here's where the skill of being with patience over a long periods of time is the key here because the key to making changes in the patient is not what you say to the patient or what you do to the patient it's how to be with the patient you understand the difference how to be with that patient especially while that person's being is in a disregulated State Now by definition when they're coming in in the first session they are in a disregulated state so again it's implicit is not explicit if explicit regulation is is an intellectual understanding of my symptoms implicit is an unconscious understanding at a physiological level at a psychobiological level of that and in synchrony is Right un is the mechanism underneath empathy now we know empathy literally has to be there but empathy is a right brain function and there is a difference I said there's a difference in the hemispheres there's a difference between emotional empathy where I am feeling what you are feeling and we are sharing the same feeling and I don't have to think about that literally I know at that point in time we are in the same place there's a difference between emotional empathy on the right and cognitive empathy on the left cognitive empathy is an understanding that makes no changes because essentially what we're attempting to do is make the changes in the right now the changes in the right are going to be in the right Axis they're going to be the orbital frontal cortex which is the executive regulator of the right brain the dorsal lateral cortex is the executive regulator of the left brain the orbital frontal cortex now starts to form new connections with the singulate the insula and the amydala and that's where you're now going to see the changes but again the changes are due to the regulation so you'll see the person now starting to come into more regulated States and the key is synchrony so what's happening here there's a strong Therapeutic Alliance safety and trust and and in that situation now the more synchrony that is there between the two the more interactive regulation there is being between the two and first there will be synchrony between the patient and the therapist then there will be synchrony and interact regulation between that person and maybe other people maybe a wife a partner and ultimately in the symptomatology will change because remember the symptomatology is disregulation and the the whole key is to change it to regulation it's fascinating there are a couple questions I have before we move forward about um mother infant attachment as opposed to Father infant attachment so that's one and I'll ask these again in a moment but I I think you'll see where I'm going here and then I'm fascinated by the idea that these circuits get established early in life then are repurposed for adult relationships they can be modified in the way that you just described but that they cross um gender and uh gender lines so for instance um a female baby can form these patterns of attachment um with their mother female caretaker but then assuming that baby grows up to be a heterosexual woman and she has a attachments to men then these things can be reactivated across gender lines right so this formation of the circuitry is not gender specific although it sounds like it's important that it be the mother to child in some way you keep saying mother child as opposed to caretaker so to just spell them out one by one first question are there any data about the formation of the these circuits in the baby where the mother is either not available if it's an adopt Ed mother um if it's a child raised by extended family I mean there's so many different configurations but you get the point all right here here's what I'm suggesting first of all there has been some um conflict on this but um after 30 years on this um I I I believe that there is a primary attachment figure and the primary attachment figure is the person who is the interactive regulator of that baby when that baby is under stress between age zero and two yeah or let me say it even another way the primary attachment figure is the person who provides the right brain for that baby when that baby's right brain is disregulated could be Dad could be mom could be yes it's true women are better at reading non-verbal cues than men are but it could be and incidentally we now have some evidence that showing that men do have right brains for a second there I wasn't sure if you were joking but I don't know maybe that's reflective of a natury right brain all right now that now that being the case What's Happening Here is that in the first year or two the mother's right brain she is the person who is the right brain in which in most cultures is is a woman but does not have to be it could be a stay-at-home dad who literally has a good right brain and maybe a couple are figuring out that literally you he'd be better in that position but it needs that right brain but other than that what happens here when when it goes now into the second year toward the end of second year and the father comes online got me at that point in time the father now becomes a primary attachment figure also but he has some differences the way he's dealing with that baby he's usually more arousing with that baby and that the play is more arousing with that baby so more um activation of the sympathetic autonomic so so sort of more up let's call it um Up Up level play exactly you're dealing with more up regulation and and and being able to tolerate more hyper Rous States because in the second year one of the things that the father will do with the infant is uh with toddler infant first year toddler second year Ruff and Tumble pay for example Ruff and Tumble play so the father is that so the father literally is now teaching the child literally how to take risks but the father is now moving more towards autonomy and Independence the mother was there at the beginning about interactive regulation that so the father is playing that role and I've also suggested that just as the mother is shaping that baby's right brain in the first year the father is now shaping that baby's left brain towards the end of the first year second and into the third year that he's shaping that baby's his left brain to that baby's left brain that being the case he may also earlier on have had good exper experiences with that baby early on in life and a good example of that would be a father who is tender tender yet at the same time is instrumental and is teaching things about the world so one brain is shaped by the mother figure the brother by the father figure what about under situations where uh there's really just one primary caretaker this is increasingly common nowadays and in some countries like in certain Scandinavian countries people opt to do this um and elsewhere of course but this isn't always a divorce situation sometimes people decide to have children on their own you know I think what's happening in that kind of situation is the person is is initially performing is initially providing the right brain and then that person let's is now providing the left brain so if let's say as a single woman with a child her right brain is there on on the git but then in the second year and incidentally there may be father figures or family members who also can step into that but essentially her left brain is is there also um remember uh we we we both have right brains and left brains but again that's that's a different kinds of skill in a left brain which would be you know the the more autonomous situation what are your thoughts about some of the modern exploration of compounds that can fac facilitate more right brain synchrony between therapist and patient um I've done a few episodes about MDMA uh assisted Psychotherapy these of course were just recently uh not approved by the FDA so these are not legal nonetheless there are interesting clinical studies showing that um these are imp pathogens um one could imagine that they could be useful in the proper context to um improve patient um uh therapist right brain synchrony and accelerate some of this process but it seems like it would also require uh both the patient and the therapist taking the compound and that seems like it would have all sorts of ethical issues yeah yeah remember it's the relationship in the end that is the key there um I'm think I I'm was also somewhat aware of that that literature and you use the word empathogen you know which which is not not quite straight out empathic but mimicking those kind of situations there um my thought is that um that might be more efficacious if it were specifically involving right brain Dynamics with a person who knew how to work with those right brain you what you what you're getting there are very early forms of the behaviors which are subcortical remember the attachment is also regulating the subcortical areas and those are the key ones and incidentally we are paying too much attention to the cortical area we literally have to shift because the subcortical areas are the foundations of the human and everything is built on top of that I'll come back to inudo in a second if I don't get on that in fact I have some people who have worked with me have also been using right brain type Psychotherapy in that with those patients and I think that that will be um um really interesting possibilities of seeing changes where you have the relationship you know in addition in addition to that and also some understanding about how the rip brain works because one of the problems that you have where there there is still some resistance this the idea that the rip brain is just a simpler version of the complex left hemisphere but that's not the case this right brain is working completely differently so I'm thinking that um in that case better situation before I forget this I want to just uh throw one of piece in I said that the right brain is in a growth spur from the last trimester in the last five years 10 years there has been a real interest in in utero development and evidence to show that you're even seeing lateralization in the fetus and so and there's even evidence now scientific evidence to show that the early memories in utero are stored in the right amydala so they're down there so to speak it's so we're not paying more and more attention to what is happening there because at Birth literally what you have here is the deeper parts of the right brain are evolving in Uno the insula and the and the right amigdala the center amydala and that's setting up and you also have synchronization across the placenta whereby they are regulating each other's autonomic nervous systems can adrenaline pass across the placenta I should know this I know adrenaline doesn't cross the blood brain barrier but the brain makes its own adrenaline but do do we know if adrenaline crosses the placental barrier first of all we most of the studies have been on cortisol right and high levels of cortisol they're going to cross it so if you have let's say the amydala which is in a is in a critical period of growth the right Amiga and the cortisol levels are very high that's really going to not be an optimal situation for that amydala to evolve because you're going to have a continuous stress response there and that's going to have and and essentially what that means also that if the mother is in a very stressed State during a utero some of that literally now is going to impact the lower areas of the brain so um as as far as adrenaline goes uh I'm not sure on that I don't see why not uh although um hormones certainly cross you know we're looking at not only changes in neuromodulators especially incidentally the key here that we're trying to regulate are the neuromodulators excuse me dopamine reward noradrenaline adrenaline it's those which also early in life literally form plast neuroplastic so they will form circus that's what we're attempting to to regulate here to downregulate very high levels of neur adrenaline and upregulate you know uh dopamine etc etc I'd like to take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors function I recently became a function member after searching for the most comprehensive approach to lab testing while I've long been a fan of blood testing I really wanted to find a more in-depth program for analyzing blood urine and saliva to get a full picture of my heart health my hormone status my immune system regulation my metabolic function my vitamin and mineral status and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality function not only provides testing of over 100 biomarkers key to physical and mental health but it also analyzes these results and provides insights from talk doctors on your results for example in one of my first tests with function I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood this was totally surprising to me I had no idea prior to taking the test function not only helped me detect this but offered medical doctor informed insights on how to best reduce those mercury levels which included limiting my tuna consumption because I'd been eating a lot of tuna while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens and supplementing with Knack and acetylcysteine both of which can support glutathione production and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels comprehensive lab testing like this is so important for health and while I've been doing it for years I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive I've been so impressed by function both at the level of ease of use that is getting the test done as well as how comprehensive and how actionable the tests are that I recently joined their advisor board and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast if you'd like to try function go to function health.com huberman function currently has a weight list of over 250,000 people but they're offering Early Access to hubman lab listeners again that's function health.com huberman to get early access to function as I recall in your book uh WR brain Psychotherapy there was a description beautiful description of um you know these up States and then these uh more uh calming State coordination between mother and child and I started to uh I actually read this book um when I was living in Tanga I would walk on the road I don't recommend this there are no sidewalks inen and I would read the the physical copy and I I recall very distinctly think thinking about this image of the of the baby and the mother and you know the baby is a little bit you know hyperaroused is is upset and so the mother would make you know sort of um sounds not necessarily words like these kinds of things or humming or or you know bouncing lullabies these sorts of things that's the pro that the pro and then the uh the related release of things like serotonin perhaps oxytocin as well we can talk more about those but then also how critical it is uh for the mother to be able to regulate the baby's um transition to up States like looking at the baby as it comes out of a nap and saying good you know good morning and really wide eyes lots of gesturing lots of gesticulating that is you know um bringing the voice level up and the baby going you know really waking up in a in a kind of a steeper slope of of arousal and how important that was and then that being slightly more related and this makes perfect sense to norepinephrine adrenaline at low healthy levels and perhaps dopamine as well is is that the right way to think about this and if so is that what's going on when we form adult friendships adult relationships are we oscillating back and forth between the ability to hang out and relax and and soothe each other and the ability to kind of get excited about something is this the basis of all relationships and relating yes yes um the key here is emotional regulation again and again it's implicit emotion regulation um one of the tenets uh Central tenets of my ideas here is that first of all there has been too much of an emphasis on the downregulation of negative States you remember the original attachment Theory the secure base the baby would come back in a in a stress State she would downregulate the the negative States but really attachment is about the down regulation of negative States and the UPR regulation of positive States still at this point in time the importance of positive States in The Human Experience are overlooked positive emotions Joy enthusiasm excitement positive States literally are the key and there are monal aspects to that as you just point out for example dopamine etc etc and this goes for therapy also in therapy it's not only just the down regulation and the sharing the down regulation but it's also sharing the upregulation of positive States because that's you know that's that's that's a critical piece of it also but there still is that bias to look one way now in the right brain book I'm also talking about two types of of Love quiet love and and excited love this was the famous uh psychoanalyst Donald wincott who was a pediatrician who was one of the great psychoanalysts of the 20th century and he made the distinction between quiet love which would again be the downregulation of noradrenaline and excited which is into a parasympathetic state so you're going from a hyp sympathetic State into a parasympathetic State quiet love and then excited love which would be also passionate love which is the higher arousal State out of it so to speak and they are both important and ultimately they both need to be integrated and you may have a situation whereby one can do one but ultimately they have to come together let me make this important point in the end we have negative emotions for adaptive reasons it's there let's say Shame Shame is meant to dose down very high levels of arousal and it's if one can't do that very high levels of arousal let's say narcissistic personality disorders you need to be able to so we need to have access to both positive and negative emotion but the real key to a secure attachment is the a ability to integrate both positive and negative emotions so with a really good SEC securely attached uh mother when that baby is in a down state literally she can literally ride down with that baby and synchronize and when it's an Upstate she can she can really ride up with that state in the case of narcissistic personality disorders let's say for example I'm jumping here we've got a an insecure attachment it can be an avoidant attachment or the other one depends what kind there are two different types of narcissistic personality disorders you can have anxiously attached narcissis no but you can have two different types of narcissistic personality disorders a vulnerable attachment and an egotistical attachment you said a vulnerable attachment vulnerable attachment is again an anxious attachment these people constantly need praise yeah yes sound familiar but but also e egotistical attachment but my my point out of that essentially here is the stresses in life are there and that the negative stresses are there but we can learn from those negative stresses also Etc and ultimately we what we need to do is to be able to know how to integrate if we can't integrate the positive and the negative will end up with splitting you know the term yeah because I believe that's a primary uh uh feature of borderline personality disorder which I think we should also touch on yeah yeah so U my understanding about splitting is that it's the uh I love you I hate you phenomenon brought on by um not just an internal switch um which is sometimes seen in like bipolar uh disorder but rather somebody with a borderline personality disorder will um see something like um and be like very upset like suddenly like the fact that um a glass is empty of a drink meant that they didn't think enough to to like refill a glass or something whereas a few minutes before it was perfectly fine it was it was not an issue right there there needs to be a trigger and then they split is that right yeah yeah so essentially you know the splitting usually the splitting goes out externally that person is all bad I am all good so now you have that splitting ET you can't see anything of a goodness in that person at this point in time does it sometimes go the other way that person's all good I'm bad it could also be that all good but you also have internally splitting you have an internal split between a good self and a bad self and internally there's an internal object relation that we all have as we internalize these external relationships so that there's a good self and a bad self literally and that they cannot be integrated so to speak and that that part of me I hate that part of me versus I love that part of me Al in terms of borderline usually what you see at the very beginning is that there's an over idealization of the positive values of that therapist and then there is some there are some then stressors and Mis attunements and ruptures that are repair and now all of a sudden what was totally good now becomes totally bad incidentally that could be if there is not a strong Therapeutic Alliance the point at which the person will drop out are these uh people with borderline personality is I don't know if you still call it a disorder nowadays that gets a little bit into the let's call it borderline um with borderline um do they exhibit the same sort of splitting um idealization and then the idea that somebody is terrible and they want nothing to do with them in the context of work relationship friendships does it extend out into other domains of life or is it unique to certain uh types of relationships I think it's a way of seeing the world remember and the way of seeing the world essentially is very different from the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere the right way hemisphere sees the world through emotional relationships and that uh so that can become a trait that can be really a hard and fast trade let me put it another way um in the case of narcissistic personality disorder the baby is all good the caregiver primary caregiver is always thinking very positive about that about that infant but when that infant now all of a sudden becomes depressed the interactive regulation stops at that point in time and the caregiver doesn't want anything to do with that no the so at that point in time now everything is unconscious if you and I are together and there is a misattunement between us what possibility let's say in a dismissive attachment is all of a sudden I will disengage we got too close and at that point in time maybe I'm acting out my early attachment Dynamics because what the baby is doing is expecting what what the mother will do next and at that point in time there's a misattunement like that and so in the case of a dismissive personality that person will emotionally disengage okay become very abstract at that point in time and at that point in time I can't feel you I hear what you're saying and so at all points in time you have this situation of coming closer and moving apart coming closer and moving apart and this will be acted out in the therapeutic relationship also with and um and so that every time the person is the anxious person is stressed they'll come in closer to you now now they're more demanding about what they need from you look at the tone of my voice while the insecure avoiding now is not going to deactivate it and at that point in time my voice will now get flat you can't even hear the effective tone of my voice so I'm telling you that we always pick up at the level of our own physiology how emotionally close or distant that person is at this point in time especially at points of stress whether I'm coming in or I'm moving out let me go back to this all of this is occurring at an implicit level which is why you said something about reparenting Etc too much is on a conscious level there if you really want to make these changes in a personality they have to be changes in the right brain and that's why all therapy now is looking into emotion All Therapy no matter what form of therapy it's laying on top of the therapeutic relationship and emotion per se I'm pausing cuz I'm just taking all this in and thinking about what are the ways that people can start to tap into this right brain health or lack of health and ways to repair their right brain circuitry so to speak um without a therapist or is that just simply impossible no it's not impossible no it's not impossible we we all grow and incidentally our right brains do grow but again [Music] um the key here I'm suggesting the whole idea about interpersonal neurobiology it was the editor of the nordon Ser interpersonal which is the two-person situation there has been too much of an emphasis on auto regulation and not enough emphasis on interactive regulation the real key to changing a right brain is finding people you can be close with finding people you can be open with finding people you can be vulnerable with that literally you can show your shortcomings and opening yourself up to those people as they open up to you it's literally to form that right brain toght brain communication system with someone else I think I just got it I think if I'm not mistaken what you're describing is interactive dynamics that create or uh elaborate on circuitry that exists in all of us but that for some people might be atrophied because of the lack of proper nourishment emotional nourishment early in life but that we can engage these uh these circuits these right brain circuits but then when we're not around these people there must be something the right brain circuitry that provides a sort of a um a soothing function so that we we must know at an implicit level that like we can do this like we know how to attach in healthy ways to people we have a close friend we can rely on we have maybe friends plural we we uh maybe repaired a relationship with a sibling this kind of thing so it's not that these circuits need to constantly be engaged every moment with the with the Barista with the you know but that that we somehow at an unconscious level uh it must be that we come to realize that um that this circuitry has has re-elaborated or is elaborated in a way that that we know quote unquote we can do it you know remember part of the problem is being able to take in to take these things in here but the key to emotion incidentally let me let me throw out an important another important term in terms of let's say a therapy situation I've said essentially therapy is is about literally reworking emotion and the most the key to to mental health and physical health is also a right brain uh a right brain emotional situation here the key here is that there are heighten effective moments in a therapy session I'm going to go therapy then I'm going to come back to your question we've now formed the Therapeutic Alliance the stronger the therapeutic alliances between us more empathy between us so to speak the more we can share I'm now going to start to drop some of my defenses because the defenses are there to block aect negative affect and begin now to take a chance now to open myself up you know to somebody else's but in a therapy session somewhere around the middle of that session the person comes in out of the world in a left brain State somewhere in the middle of the session they start moving into affect and now the person is starting to talk in a more effective level and now talking about a memory or some sad situation or something that just happened in a relationship with a couple now you even start hearing my voices now the voice tone change and these moments which only May last believe it or not 50 60 seconds are heightened affec of moments these are moments when all of a sudden we are both in the right and we are both synchronized and the affective now is is out there so to speak and that's the possibility now to get this change in these H effective moments so to be in an interpersonal relationship with someone and to co-create with that person a hid and affective moment in both of us which we are sharing at that point in time by taking the risk to be open at that point in time also these are the moments in life that you really go into your autobiographical memory I remember my occasion with that person I can bring back the whole context because remember the right brain acts with images images so I can bring back that image now and I can remember the closeness that I felt at that point in time Etc these are put into bright brain so we we are always putting into our autobiographical memory these hiding effective moments so to have those shared effective moments with other people these are really whereby you're making changes in the right and these are much more important I want to suggest than you know intellectually now there have been certain F I'm now going to I'm going to move into a a little bit of a different place here what I'm suggesting is that these right brain to right brain Communications are always going on but certain people literally can't read them as well other people can and they can't read the face of voice and they're they can't synchronize well can I stop you and ask one question which is let's say that let's take this conversation for instance I'm listening to your words very carefully if I make an effort to listen especially carefully to what somebody is saying the content of their words is there a competition between left and right brain such that I'm now not getting as much right brain listening yeah okay this is this to me feels like the the surrender aspect whereas I can I and I do this during these interviews uh SL um discussions where I'll sit back sometimes and I'm still listening but I widen my gaze I don't look around but I widen my gaze and I'm I'm trying to just feel something coming in I'm not a therapist obviously um no one would ever suspect that I was but I only do it for a few seconds and then I re-engage and I used to think that it was like a like a relaxation of sorts but inevitably I feel like it's a different way to the conversation takes a different direction is is that more or less what you're talking about yeah that's a colossal shift I meanly the cor is you you can shift from the left into the right about 100 100 milliseconds so essentially you can't be in you have to be in one Hemisphere or the other so so if I'm listening very carefully to like exactly what you said and I'm and I'm tracking everything you said like I'm in a like in a courtroom situation then my right brain is suppressed okay is that right good feed good feed now watch where I go here okay the right hemisphere is dominant for attention Okay I mean this baby and this mother literally she's focusing her attention on that baby's face tone was but there are two different types of attention strong neuros Neuroscience to show this the left brain operates by narrow attention narrowly focused attention atton as the best example of narrowly focused attention is you are following my words one after the other but there's another type of attention which is used by the right brain which is called wide ranging attention which comes right out of Freud which he also called maybe you remember this evenly suspended attention I haven't heard that but that's beautiful it's the same thing which is much wider than that and that form of attention is the the form of attention that the right brain has because the attention at that point in time is not only of what's coming from the outside but also attention to what's happening in the inside my own inside the changes in my own physiology at that point in time also so yes there are these two for different forms of attention and essentially the only way someone who was just narrow all the time let's let's take a personality who just lives in the left hemisphere a hyperlinear person exactly hyper logical hyper rational cannot really see the big picture but literally that kind of a situation so essentially that kind of a person is always looking at the narrow aspects of it and cannot see the broader context the broader context because there's a context that's being set up right now between you and I there's also a context that's being set up and that context also has to it a kind of a feeling of safety and Trust as we literally just go off wherever our you know our thoughts are with some idea that literally you'll be able to follow that and you'll come back with me at the same time so the context the emotional atmosphere between us changes when you go left into the right like that point here is that it used to be thought that you the only way you could understand the brain was by looking more intally into one brain if you understood how one brain worked and everything was int psychic but then there's the interpersonal part of it and so essentially we're moving now from a onep person int psychic psychology to a two person interpersonal psychology you see what I mean by two person I got the mother here got the baby there I got the patient here I got the therapist there and between them literally are going back and forth at all periods of time right brain to right brain Communications underneath the conversation so neuroimaging hyperscanning neuroimaging your familiar with hyperscanning another Paradigm shifting thing that is occurring now in neuroimaging for the first time we can now scan two people n IRS EEG whatever you want it while they are in the middle of a basic interpersonal interaction aable interaction between the two of them these Studies have now been done and what they did was that they found is that the two brains especially when they into emotional states and when they are looking at each other face to face and they're concentrating literally on how to empathically be with that person Etc emotions so to speak they they find that the the right brain of one will synchronize with the right brain of the other and the part of the right brain that synchronizes with the other is the right temporal parietal Junction a lot of evidence now on the right temporal parietal Junction I said right brain to right brain so now the eyes are coming and remember the eyes are I mean direct eye connection really is the most powerful form of communication I always remind people these are two little bits of brain outside your cranial vault as weird as that might seem they are two bits of brain your retina is central nervous system and you're you're looking at that's about as close as you can get to looking at somebody's brain State as anything well you know this the eyes are being controlled by the autonomic nervous system so you got the you have an autonomic nervous system the ordonomic nervous system synchrony here so to speak but uh but essentially uh what's occurring at this point in time face voice gesture the face is processed in the posterior parts of the right hemisphere that face processing right hemisphere face processing the right the posterior parts of the right hemisphere the sensory areas of the right hemisphere process the voice The Melody of the voice the tone of the voice that's different than the semantics of the voice so this is procity this is this is pro this is what the Italians do so well right right and the and the and the posterior parts of the right hemisphere also will process gesture and tactile okay all of that comes together is integrated together in the right temporal parietal Junction so when two people literally are empathically synchronizing with each other when we are sharing the same emotional state the the patient says at this point in time my God it's rage I never realized it was anger and at that point in time the empathic therapist who's synchronizing we are both literally now in that right temporal parietal Junction but the right temporal parietal Junction is what sends the communications and receives the communications got me here so essentially that's where our linguage is and we are now literally in a right brain to right brain communication and what they found was during a real Psychotherapy situation where the patient comes in and they're there because they have interpersonal relationships problems and emotional problems and they're face to face in their eye to eye and they're tracking each other's like that you'll find that synchronization so the the synchronization between my right Temple parietal and your right Temple parietal is a right brain to right brain communication that rip rain to ripe rain communication is always occurring in that kind of a context and therefore the most important new change in psychoanalysis is that the unconscious just is more than just happening at dreams it's happening at all points because the unconscious we now know is a relational unconscious it communicates with another relational unconscious right brain to right brain and this has really changed so much now in our understanding about what Psychotherapy is about also andly I want to point out the major change mechanism in Psychotherapy now is not inside it's not cognitive Insight it's more the ability to have an emotionally Laden conversation with another human being and to make emotional connections with another human being which is why the therapeutic relationship really is the factor of the change and that's very different than the old days was your unconscious is here the analyst is there I'm now going to interpret what you're doing as you are sinking down into the right and now going but I'm going to stay up left that interpret it that's why there was a real limitation to that and that's why psychoanalysis really changed now now also to a face-to-face contact not just the C the couch also fascinating and makes total sense based on the newer Imaging tools um revealing synchrony Etc I have two questions um that can be asked in parallel music and dogs why music and dogs well some of what you're describing um reminds me of the um State shift that occurred when I hear particular pieces of music for which um I'm not paying attention to the lyrics or in some cases the lyrics matter I'm listening but they don't make any sense like if they were read out as a paragraph it wouldn't make any sense but it feels like there's some fundamental truth there so this is I I could State specific musical preferences but it's highly individual so for some people it's classical music for other people it's music that contains lyrics but there's this feeling like yes like there's a truth there and I feel that truth even though the content of the words let's take couldn't help myself like a Bob Dylan song for instance he's certainly could be considered a poet right you know and if you read the lyrics Just as a paragraph you'd be like this is nonsense but the way that it sung the meaning behind it the tamber in the voice the proy ETC and presumably the emotion that he was feeling at the time when the music was recorded communicates with us and we enter a synchronous State and then in parallel to this I mentioned dogs where um sure they have a for they have a left brain and a right brain um but I think with animals generally um if they're domestic animals and we have a very close relationship to them we we can really feel a resonance with them and presumably them with us and um for anyone that's experienced it you know they some people might be chuckling now but it's nothing short of profound right the extent to which we really feel like they see us and we see them and there's a bond yeah clearly not the same magnitude as a parent child Bond but nonetheless so music and dogs do you think it's tapping in to this same right temporal parietal well I I I think that it's it's first of all the the right temporal parietal Junction is the posterior and the right orbital frontal is the cortex so the whole right brain there so to speak okay so we're going we're basically going from anterior to posterior just there structures the whole way back the orbital frontal is the regulation part of the the the temporal parietal Junction is the communication part of it so the whole key is the communication of emotion and the regulation of emotion where is the surrender switch the surrender is the colosal switch out of the left into the right so not so much paying attention to the content of the words the logic behind them The Logical flaws that might exist the analytic part but rather how the words sound how the words feel literally yes and clearly one of the uh first of all there has been a lot of Neuroscience done on music and incidentally most of that is right brain showing right brain activation in music uh the key here even more than that it's it's particular music to me it has a particular meaning to me your subjectivity and a lot shows that uh music is essentially a mechanism of aect Regulation but I want to suggest to view that pets are also a mechanism of affc Regulation dogs everywhere smiling absolutely you know and and but maybe by the same things I want to suggest I think that the communication between dogs and I've had four dogs myself is that literally it's tactile it's the touch of that animal it's the pro of the voice because literally that dog understands the prity of the voice and also uh you to some extent I think they they can read our our faces but more than that there's one other sense which I haven't brought up which is part of human relationship and that's smell okay and this is overlooked in human relationship but in real intimate contacts between human beings the smell is really a key there you not think about sexual arousal so dogs are really very strong on our smell Etc but if attachment is a reunion after a separation you come home home there's that dog sitting there literally and immediately you're down regulating the day you have now taken off the whole left osphere and our whole stresses of all of that and you're now shifting left into right and we use the mechanisms that is available to do that and music is one of the ways to do that so in some sense music is an auto regulation although music can be live music and then it's more than that so that's the case or playing music with others this is something I'm incapable of because have no musical ability but playing music with others you can see the when we talk about the chemistry of a band it's so incredible to witness that and then to feel it in Mass with thousands maybe of other people yeah there have been studies to show that during a performance uh there is a synchrony there are synchronized States between the performer and and the audience and it's certainly they're all you can have thousands of people literally in that same synchronized State at that point in time here you mentioned uh earlier um Steven porges work um and uh we know that brain and body are connected in both directions and I should know this but uh I don't know if the right brain has preferential um communication with the parasympathetic or sympathetic or other aspects of well Vegas is parasympathetic but I think it's probably both I think the more we discover about about the Vegas it's likely to be mixed sympathetic parasympathetic but I'll catch some heat for that but that's okay but is the you know bodily sensing is a a real thing like there there are ways that our diaphragm and our and our our core relax when we're happy I mean all of this is is obvious to to anyone um but I'm just curious um how right brain uh links up with bodily States the right brain is more connected into the body than the left brain um incidentally I'm going to do you know the name Ian mcgilchrist yes I know the name and many people have commented on our YouTube channel that I need to talk to Ian um um that's all that I have gotten that far but i' I've been busy um get him get him uh great Ian we'll we'll send you an invite yeah I mean the there there has been ongoing dialogue between us for some time but Ian talks about that the right brain literally is much more Connect into the body and incidentally is also more is more dominant for will unconscious will is more important than conscious will which you kind of at the very beginning we were talking about the left versus the right yeah so I'm curious as to you know how people can start to sense these uh right brain left brain shifts we talked about how um paying a little less attention to the content of words and a little bit more to how a conversation is feeling independent of the word content might be part of it um we hear a lot these days about you know how body posture matters you know that you know like if people are closed up with their arms crossed I don't know but sometimes I'm just a little chilly so I'll cross my arms and sometimes I'll cross my arms and lean in and I know that I'm in a much more attuned state so I don't put too much weight on that but maybe I should put more weight on that what are your thoughts yeah there's a classical work on uh by the an analyst by the name of Manuel hammer and he was talking about how to reach the affect and what he suggested is that there are certain moments in the session when literally my body in order to pick up the communications of the patient I lean back I'm not leaning forward into I lean back and let the atmosphere literally come over me so to speak I love this I'm just forgive me for interrupting but I love this because people especially on social media they they take a piece of information like you know if you're lean back you're disengaged you're Lean Forward you're engaged but you could also just turn it right around and say if you're leaned forward you're impending and then the person doesn't have space and so it becomes a frankly becomes a bunch of BS but but notice here what I'm talking about what the therapist is attempting to do is to make an emotional connection an empathic connection and in order to make an empathic connection you're you're leaning back you're leaning back and literally as you lean back all of a sudden you're able to pick up things and hear things that you didn't see see before so to speak and frequently what happens when when you're in an emotional connection like that images will come to your mind images which which really represent the emotional experience that the other is having and at that point in time also what you'll find is that just as you're picking up that person's image he's picking up your person image and what Hammer says is that we have what we have here is something that's alike an affective Wireless between between the two because it's going back and forth between the two of us just like a right brain to right brain communication affected by Freud said the human unconscious acts like a receptor and it picks up the communications of the unconscious of another human being flud said literally human beings can pick up the unconscious without go without it going through the conscious mind so again in that kind of a context you know that all that all makes makes sense the other thing I want to say about all of these behaviors that are going on now when there is an emotional communication the key is spontaneous behaviors spontaneous not thought out behaviors spontaneous behaviors when there are spontaneous behaviors there's more trust in them being SP you know in the first place but there's not a mind that is attempting to present anything and when you have two people revealing their spontaneous behaviors to each other even if they're not sure how they're going to be affected that also is a matter for synchrony in order for there to be synchrony there has to be spontaneous two-way Communications turn-taking Communications and incidentally as we talk about this conversation what is set up in the attachment between the mother and the infant the infant makes a cry the mother response is that they are now taking turns there's turn taking behavior and in a good relationship what you find is more or less smooth turn-taking behaviors and incidentally you and I who have never met before are not doing too badly in these spontaneous turn-taking behaviors between us I appreciate you saying that I feel the same way text messaging has become a dominant mode of communication the these days um I've hosted a few guests expert in emotions in the brain um Lisa Feldman Barrett for instance and and others and she and others have talked about how the emogif of emotions you know just like a smiley face or a crying face or oh goodness or your mind blown these things are convenient as is shorthand text lack of punctuation Etc but today's conversation also you know highlights the extent ENT to which text messaging is pretty much devoid of most everything that you're talking about a green bubble or a blue bubble seen or not seen you know read or not read uh depending on how you you set your settings um the latency the turn-taking it's com sometimes people layer in multiple conversations and you're going back and forth about a couple of different things and then then like your your food order comes I mean sure the human brain can handle this but this seems either not good neutral that is or bad for um building in reinforcing communication I it actually concerns me but of course I'm Now 49 so I can say things like now that I'm 49 I can say things like that you know but it concerns me because I think that you can imagine the young brain and older brain essentially uh not being good at interpersonal Dynamics because of text message I agree I agree um first of all um let me mention that one of uh Ian's ideas is that essentially uh um the left hemisphere is becoming more and more dominant today in in in not only in this country and that he sees that as really as a huge problem because the title of his book is the master and his Emissary and the Emissary which is the left brain betrays the master so he sees that one of the problems we're dealing with right now is that there's the left hemisphere is there and that these right hemispheres even metaphors are you know are problematic so I have a rule I I don't argue over text um I don't I don't like to argue over text I don't like to argue period but I don't you know I'll pick up the phone I'm of the generation where we called one another um I I find text to be completely devoid of what I'm really seeking in terms of connection um and I think that there's an entire I know there's an entire generation of people that grew up communicating mainly through um short message Jonathan hate and the author of The anxious generation has has been encouraging young kids to put away their phones and get out and interact more encouraging parents to let their kids be more what they call free range kids and do this kind of thing arguing that there's far fewer dangers in the physical world than there are in the online world for young brains he makes a convincing argument um for those of us that are um seeking to have U better connection um maybe even do some healing of the right brain circuitry that you talking about today do you think that um there's a hierarchy of Effectiveness such that you know like um text would be perhaps at the bottom uh voice memo maybe next level up I'm thinking here a phone call um you know there was a time when we wrote handwritten letters and those felt very meaningful sure I kept handwritten letters from people that I cared about and that cared about me the handwritten letters are proves that it doesn't have to be a real-time exchange but there's something about handwriting a typewritten letter would by today's standards would also be a significant thing but you know that there really seems to be something special about um a letter um a face Toof face right in in terms of literally the point of the letter and the attempt of the letter literally was to to to make a connection I can remember in my childhood going away to camper and we would write letters back and forth and it it the words that were being used there were literally about making a connection and filling you in which also meant that I had to reflect about myself and what was happening with me and how I felt about that and how and I was sharing all of that uh you know W with with another person that has really gone in into into into the background and things have become much more impersonal but I want to point out that for a certain type of Personality texting fits perfectly these there people that walk around with left brains that are hypertrophied um people you know living living in the left living in the left that's right inally before I just want to point out there are other ways literally of feeding the right brain brain of what it needs and one of the other ways also is going out into the world is traveling is being in nature you know sharing those kinds of things also those are also uh in addition to the you know to the inperson situations here but um yeah we're seeing changes here we're seeing changes here and I'm not so sure uh too many of these are are good let me throw out um I made a little list of the areas which are now being studied which are showing that clearly this is right brain dominance in these activities yeah please share stop me at any point essentially the argument that I'm making in the in this new book on human nature is that the highest levels of human nature are in the right brain so essentially intuition now remember intuition is there for all kinds of professions that one of the things that a fireman G gains over time is literally how to redef fire so intuition purely right brain and and intuition literally is is drawing on Body Sensations also Etc imagery creativity lot of evidence showing creativity the ability to processing something novel and something something new metaphors imagination studies humor music poetry art morality comp passion spirituality and The Best For Last Love that's a spectacular list making the the right brain circuitry at at least among uh the most exciting circuits um certainly important circuits I threw an ad for the next book I love right brain Psychotherapy love love love it I own a hard cover copy um I've owned it for a couple years now um I highly recommend it we'll put links to your your books in the show note caption get the development of the unconscious mind also okay we'll do what are some activities that allow us to quote unquote drop into our right brain circuitry a bit more um one that immediately leap to mind as you mentioned nature and interacting with nature and we were talking about music is uh walking um and earlier we talked about you educated us on rather this notion of wide range attention um this evenly suspended attention that is associated with the right brain this kind of widening of gaze as opposed to narrow gaze and narrow attention that is associated with left brain circuitry when we're out in nature and when we're amb ambulating when we're walking provided we're not looking at our phone one hopes or looking for something specific like a bird that we've spotted we tend to be in panoramic Vision uh I'm a vision scientist so I can't help myself you know what we call magnos Cellar Vision these like big pixels I'm aware yeah taking it all in it's more spherical than um kind of a a cone of attention I would imagine that might be more right brain Associated um what are some things that you if you um suggest to your patients like hey you know until our next session you know do you encourage them to journal free associate journal to listen to music to uh to take walks um or do you you restrict the the activation of this right brain circuitry to the session and then let it just show up as it were yeah yeah so so you let it them sort of just default to to to what what's happening yeah yeah um two uh two two points here first of all on on uh therapy um I think there's been too much of an emphasis on technique in therapy um and really what the r brain research is is showing I is that um um it's it's the right brain process that's the key here more than technique and so um that being the case um due to my own training Psychotherapy has shown to be more effective in making long-term changes uh and even changes after the treatment is over than other forms of therapy like CBT so I think there's been too much on that on the matter of other experiences the r brain is also dominant for processing novel information anytime something new comes up the ride picks it up first and you get a burst of nor adrenaline out of that also so the pursuit of continuing to have a curious mind and an open mind um I think is part of that and seeking new experiences in different parts of the world if I mean there's there's an economic piece to that also but with new challenges br bring up new challenges that we have and to essentially if possible feed curiosity curiosity um Einstein even said something essentially that along those lines there so new experiences with new people new challenges new places to see new you know a travel I think is uh you know one of those and it turned out to be one of the Great fortunate gifts that came from all of this um you know I I was a therapist only for about 45 years and I came into this late I wrote this book in late and literally it's led me into new relationships and new friends who starts making friends at 45 and 50 years old but again Novelties um and sharing that you know I think is is is also another way of doing that plus um you you said this I'll repeat it exercise exercise is a key here um I'm I happen to be interested in energy and in mitochondria and uh um there's a uh scientist navio at San Diego who has written on this and he's talking about the healing process and part of the healing process literally is exercise that's fundamental to healing of whatever physical and mental and also restorative sleep so taking care of our body um one of the things that U we learn early in our in our uh experiences mostly taught through the body is literally how to take care of our bodies and as you're well aware of um you don't see that um in certain pathologies and you also have certain and I'm talking about more than just self-destructive like cutting the But ultimately the the ability to be able to to look Inward and to be able to reflect back upon the self um and to be able to see um even what we want to see and don't want to see now I I I want to just make a quick reference to defenses because um defenses are can be adaptive and maladaptive and they're important and they're there for example we have defenses against overwhelming a dissociation is defense against over overwhelming a but we also have defense like repression which is part of all human beings and repression can be normal and adaptive or it can be maladaptive and it's maladaptive literally when it's when it's when the repression is very strong essentially what you have there is that the left hemisphere is just shutting out anything coming over from the right that's what repression the left hemisphere just shutting that all out so part of this is becoming more aware of those defenses that we have also and I want to make this point also there are certain parts of ourselves which we cannot see we can only see them when we're getting feedback from somebody who knows us and can see those things in us and even if at the time they're uncomfortable but we need that feedback from somebody we trust to be able to see which is why this ability literally to completely change one's psychology is highly problematic because remember what you're attempting to do is to change the right brain which is why Intimate Relationships close relationships um with whom we can share things is really a key there also we are everybody has blind spots and um the way out of that again is is is trusting enough to take in uh negative feedback you know at times also my own feeling is that when something hits me let's say a disappointment hits me and uh one of the things I learned early about my own emotion because in order to study emotion you have to study your own emotion Etc that for me literally when something comes I just let it come and move wherever it's going to go lit and feel it just at at at all of its intensity and strength and even after sharing it literally letting it penetrate down so to speak and ultimately at some point it'll come back into another shape in a form but our emotions are adaptive and again I want to point out one of the major fallacies is that negative emotions are bad and positive emotions are good positive emotions are good manic emotions Etc negative emotions are bad loss you know we are wired for all of these emotions because they have adaptive value and we need to be able to be familiar with all of those different types of emotions you know that that come our way in our lives I have a friend he's a songwriter and he told me that he has this process whereby he writes music every day um but he starts his day by painting or drawing I think he sold some paintings and drawings but that's not not his main vocation but he told me that he he draws in paints as a way to sort of um Grease the gears to songwriting and then I learned that Joanie Mitchell did this too or something similar um and I can't help but Wonder uh whether or not they've uh unconsciously tapped into a mode of bringing right brain circuitry up in terms of its activity yeah um neither of them are known as painters or or uh artists um but of course musical artists and quite accomplished ones at that um is that um tool or technique Mak sense yeah it does essentially it's it's creativity you know which again is the ability to see something novel in a in in a new way to look at the same thing but through new eyes so I I think those are ways of literally artists know literally how to get surrender out of the left and get into the right and you're seeing these mechanisms of surrender but let me share into something else more autobiographical about what you're saying um when I decided to uh I knew that I was going to write something uh you know at a certain point in time and so for 10 years I went into a period of self-study and and literally I went to a library Cal State Library near me and I just went through the stacks you remember it was like to go through the stacks and I started to move into psychology into neurology into into chemistry but then I found myself doing something else I went back to the piano I took piano as as a you know as a teenager it led nowhere but as an adult I went back to the piano we have a piano in the house that was came from my my in-laws because I wanted to know something in my fingers I didn't want to know something in my logic I knew that the way that I usually would understand things would would be rationally and logically but I wanted to be able to play and be able to play again purely so that it was in my fingers and I also wanted to be able to visualize so I got to a point now where I started to be able to now to be able to see a cell and I could visualize mitochondrial moving now up into the dendrites at the cell membr so that visualization capacity as well as the musical capacity was my intuitive way of starting now more and more to get me to lean into the right to be able to learn how to be in the right amazing I I love this and and I'll refrain from sharing my um you know personal uh use of such uh sort of I guess we call them Avenues into the right um but I want to make clear I understand you're in the stacks of books in the library that feels and sounds like a like a cognitive Endeavor a left brain Endeavor but then it just came to you I want to play the piano or um through the the research uh that you were doing this a 10year self research Amazing by the way I'm like so struck by that then did it just come to you in a Flash like I want to play the piano again and was it because it playing the piano contrasted so much with looking through the stacks or they or they were aligned no it just it just those for me that was exploration it was exploration it was all new information and I found that I could Master more than the field that I was trained in let me give you one other experience is that is a lot of evidence to show the AHA experience is right brain also so there are times when literally insights will come quickly and suddenly and they'll seem to come out of nowhere and all of a sudden the Muse is there so that was an aha experience and when I thought about it it just made all kinds of sense I mean there was a purpose to it because again I I needed to get past um doing that let me tell you something else that I decided to do very early on as I was setting off into this 10year period I decided never to memorize anything tell me more it's a lot of effort that gets nowhere literally what I wanted to do as I wanted to understand it in the way that I could understand it so there's a lot of ways wasted time in memorization and that being the case as you can imagine I have a rather enormous memory I know where things are I know where they are I know how to get them I know what's important and I know how to put it into a place where I can get I know where that article is and incidentally when I'm working initial originally I would write everything down and the writing had an effect of putting that more into my memory even now when I'm studying I'll take papers I'll Xerox them and I'll read them at my desk I will not read and study right off the computer in other words I was learning my own technique of learning so important I often get asked you know what's your note taking process how do you prepare a solo EP I do these long solos that you know I have only a few pages of notes but I could describe it but the process is so specific to the way that I learn across the whatever 6 8 10 weeks that it takes me to prepare for one of those sometimes more that um it wouldn't really translate like it doesn't matter no yeah but there's but there's a process of int introspection there about literally how do I learn and you know and how can I how can I literally absorb the information so that it goes in deep the left hemisphere essentially is a Surface hemisphere the right hemisphere is the one of depth so to speak and what goes into the right for example if you have an experience an emotional experience that's really important that goes deep into your autobiographical memory that's much deeper than you're attempting to to memorize something you know at that point in at any point in time given the extreme importance of this right brain circuitry and of this um autonomic um synchrony between mother and typically mother primary caretaker that is and infant what are some things that are known from the literature as critically important about that stage in terms of um you know amount of time spent with uh the child um you know often times parents are working they are nannies or any number of different things there are a lot of different structures nowadays for families and balancing work and family but is there anything known about how to I hate to use the word optimize but maximize the health of the relationship yeah I don't think that this culture compared to other cultures really provides for that kind of time I think that people are stressed uh because of that and now I'm going to talk about maternal leave and paternal leave in other rich countries um um the paternal leave is three months and uh maternal leave is 6 months or more in Scandinavia so uh these other countries have figured out this time of life is critical that if you really want to affect a personality and help shape that personality to be a moral person or you know to have values Etc the time literally that to put in is the earliest years that's when it's there so to speak and without that kind of leave policy in this country most people go back to work at six weeks six weeks is at the beginning of the critical period of the right brain the autonomic nervous system is in a critical period at 6 to 8 weeks the amygdala is coming into a critical period the basil lateral amydala the insula and the singular are in a critical period at that point in time this is before the child has formed an attachment and as or a separation so I see this as literally and um as I'm well aware of there's now talking about this more and more in fact the recent debate there was discussion of this uh also about this this problem the London School of Economics had a a study about what is the best predictor the best childhood predictor of adult satisfaction in life and the best predictor was emotion and the second was the child's conduct and the third and last was the child's IQ we have things upside down here we are focusing too much on Executive of functions that come online at the third year and again what I'm suggesting to you is that the whole foundations of our personality are starting in Udo through the second and the third year and then you know with the father Etc that's where we literally should be putting the money and the money should be there so that it provides the time every other culture has figured this out the uh UNICEF took a poll in 2021 of 36 countries rich countries we came in last in emotional well-being childhood well-being shame it is a shame uh what's wonderful however is that you're highlighting these issues um so many people are hearing about this and um you know I encourage anyone everyone listening to really take in The Ordering of uh importance of of what Dr Shore just shared that IQ third on the list emotion regulation um number one conduct conduct yeah so the the idea that we need to train our kids up as little memorizing computers um is the clearly the wrong idea clearly there's important information that needs to be committed to memory to be a functional human being but that we're missing not just critical knowledge transfer but critical emotional transfer yeah and for that reason and for so many other reasons I really want to thank you for coming in today and having this conversation it's unlike any conversation I've had on this podcast it for several reasons not the least of which is that you have this incredible knowledge of the neurobiology which for me is a delight and I'm sure for the listeners too but also the clinical experience which is so rich and it's clear you've also uh done your own work and exploring these ideas and and you've been here for for and participated in the evolution of this whole right brain left brain thing you know the Advent of neuroimaging and how that's really shed new light and I just love love love the way that you uh you braid all this together in terms of actionable things with patient and therapist but also just in terms of one's understanding of self I I'm certain people are going to take this knowledge um into their lives and into the world and it's been really enriching for me and I'm certain it's going to be immensely enriching for them so thank you for the work you do than thank you for taking the time to come here today and I'm excited about your new book so keep us informed as to when that comes out maybe we'll have you back on for another discussion if you're willing and just um you know just thank you so much for entering this this uh left brain right brain dance and dynamic it's been thoroughly enjoyful absolute pleasure for me too Andrew absolute pleasure thank

Title: How to Safeguard Your Hormone Health & Fertility | Dr. Shanna Swan
Published: 2024-11-04 13:01:00 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. Shanna Swan, Ph.D., professor of environmental medicine and reproductive health at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Dr. Swan is the world’s leading expert on the harmful impact of chemicals in our food, water, cosmetics, and various household and consumer products on our hormones, and the consequences for fertility and overall reproductive health. She explains how exposure to phthalates and other endocrine disruptors adversely impacts fetal development, puberty, and the adult brain and body. We discuss the global decline in human fertility due to disruptive environmental toxins, such as pesticides, and certain foods and beverages we consume.

We discuss practical strategies to minimize exposure to harmful chemicals, such as phthalates, bisphenol A (BPA), BPS, and PFAS. This includes reducing disposable plastic use, making healthier food preparation, consumption, and storage choices, and selecting personal and household products that don’t contain harmful toxins. This episode allows you to assess your risk of exposure to endocrine disruptors accurately and empowers you to take control of your hormone health and fertility.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Shauna Swan Dr Shauna Swan is a professor of environmental medicine and Public Health at the mount siai school of medicine she is a world expert in how exposure to various toxins and compounds in the food and environment impact our reproductive Health she focuses on how these compounds in our air in our food supply in our water supply in cosmetics even in household items impact the developing fetus children and adults at the level of their reproductive biology so things like testosterone and estrogen and the pathways within the brain and body that are impacted by testosterone and estrogen but also how all of those things in our environment and that we put into our body impact our health on a daily basis and our long-term health so during today's discussion you will learn why fertility rates are indeed dramatically dropping from year to year and have been for quite some time now you'll also learn why testosterone levels are dropping why sperm counts are dropping why things like polycystic ovarian syndrome are increasing in women and what we can do about it in fact during much of today's discussion Dr Swan emphasizes the things that you can do every single day and that in fact turn out to be very simple they involve certain things to do and certain things to avoid in order to limit your exposure to these environmental toxins and their impact so by the end of today's episode you will be highly informed by the world expert on endocrine disruptors and environmental toxins and you will also be highly informed in terms of how you can have agency how you can take control of your health in relation to these various compounds before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium in the correct ratios but no sugar we should all know that proper hydration is critical for optimal brain body function in fact even a slight degree of dehydration can diminish your cognitive and physical performance to a considerable degree it's also important that you're not just hydrated but that you get adequate amounts of electrolytes in the right ratios drinking a packet of element dissolved in water makes it very easy to ensure that you're getting adequate amounts of hydration and electrolytes to make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of both I dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning and I drink that basically first thing in the morning I'll also drink a packet of element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise that I'm doing especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot and losing water and electrolytes there are a bunch of different great tasting flavors of element and now that we're entering the winter months at least here in the northern hemisphere element has their chocolate medley flavors back in stock I really like these chocolate flavors especially the chocolate mint when mixed into hot water and of course despite being a bit colder outside hydration is still critically important in fact a lot of people don't realize this but even when it's cold out it's easy to get dehydr ated and that's because the air is dry and so even though you don't notice the accumulation of sweat on your skin you can still be losing a lot of water and electrolytes if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element.com huberman to claim an element sample pack with the purchase of any element drink mix again that's drink element spelled l m NT so it's drink element.com huberman to claim a free sample pack today's episode is also brought To Us by Roka Roa makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are the absolute highest quality I've been wearing Roa readers and sunglasses for years now and I love them they're lightweight they have superb Optics and theyve lots of frames to choose from I'm excited to share that Roa and I have teamed up to create a new style of red lens glasses these red lens glasses are meant to be worn in the evening after the sun goes down they filter out short wavelength light that comes from screens and from LED lights the sorts of LED lights that are most commonly used as overhead and frankly lamp lighting nowadays I want to emphasize Roa red l classes are not traditional blue blockers they're not designed to be worn during the day and to filter out blue light from screen light they're designed to prevent the full range of wavelengths that suppress melatonin secretion at night and that can alter your sleep so by wearing Roa red lens glasses they help you calm down and they improve your transition to sleep most nights I stay up until about 10: p.m. or even midnight and I wake up between 5: and 7: a.m. depending on when I went to sleep now I put my Roa red lens glasses on as soon as it gets dark outside and I've noticed a much easier transition to sleep which makes sense based on everything we know about how filtering out shortwave lengths of light can allow your brain to function correctly Roa red lens glasses also look cool frankly you can wear them out to dinner or to concerts or out with friends so it turns out it is indeed possible to support your biology to be scientific about it and to remain social after all if you'd like to try Roa go to roka.com that's r.com and enter the code huberman to save 20% off

carried out entirely online now I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years in fact I consider doing regular therapy just as important as getting regular exercise including cardiovascular exercise and resistance training exercise which of course I also do every week now there are essentially three things that great therapy provides first it provides a good rapport with somebody that you can really trust and talk to about any and all issues that concern you second of all great therapy provides support in the form of emotional support but also directed Guidance the dos and the not Tod do and third expert therapy can help you arrive at useful insights that you would not have arrived at otherwise with better help they make it very easy to find an expert therapist with whom you can really resonate with and provide you with these three benefits that I described also because better help is carried out entirely online it's very time efficient and easy to fit into a busy schedule with no commuting to a therapist office or sitting in a waiting room or looking for a parking spot so if you'd like to try better help go to betterhelp.com huberman to get 10% off your first

your work for a number of years I've seen some of your appearances on other podcasts and I got to see you speak while we were both in Copenhagen I was in the audience you didn't know I was there but incredible stuff that you've been doing at as a researcher as a public educator as a writer let's kick off by just asking the basic question are there things in our environment including our food that are diminishing our reproductive and overall health and if so which are the ones that you think about and perhaps if you could just mentioned a few of the more Salient um maybe even shocking but Salient results that you've observed over the years like what was what was the the kind of like wo result or results that have really um steered your attention in the last a couple of decades and I'll just say what we were talking about before we were on the microphone which is that you are a skeptic you are not somebody who walks out into the world and looks for things that could be messing up our our biology messing up our health and yet you've found some so if you could just share with us uh what you've observed and what you find really compelling and important for people to know about we can dive in there that was a lot of questions I could probably talk for a long time feel free I won't speak until you're done no but I want to break it up let's break it up so I think the first question about was are there forces chemicals agents in the environment that can affect our reproductive Health yes okay so my answer to that is yes I think there's no question about that the question comes down to when and in whom and uh what dose and so on and so forth but whether there are let's just say broadly things yes of course um the category that I focus on are man made primarily man-made chemicals although I do also include the influence of other factors factors of choice for example sleep exercise that kind of thing we can talk about that but let's just focus here on the on the chemicals because I think that's what led me to do a lot of my research and to write the book that I wrote and um so my um thesis is that chemicals in the environment that's a very broad class so we'll have to say some chemicals in the environment at the right time to the right organism affect fertility okay so and let me just say fertility is one area that I focused on but actually this class of chemicals that I'm primarily interested in are those that affect the body's hormones so those are known as hormone disrupting chemicals or endocrine disrupting chemicals um hormone altering chemicals whatever you know there's a lot of names but that helps you focus on where to look for the effects because if it's hormone altering you can now have something to really ask okay here's a chemical does it affect a hormone which hormone when how and then you start that's almost an you know laying out an experiment right there right so so so focusing in on hormone disrupting chemicals I think is useful absolutely yeah and I think much of what we'll talk about today probably centers on the estrogen and testosterone Pathways as they relate to masculinization or feminization right of the brain and body right and sperm and egg right quality so I'm a reproductive epidemiologist I got there in an indirect path I think probably my work on um oral contraceptives led me there most directly and oral contraceptives are endocrine disrupting chemicals that's what they're designed to do right that's what they're designed to do change your body's hormones your reproductive hormone so it's interesting you know way back when when I worked on the study at Kaiser on oral contraceptives which was the largest study of its kind in the world actually trying to figure out were they adverse effects of oral contraceptives if so you know for whom and when and how much and so on and so this was a very great study and um Coming forward in time um I you know I studied environmental chemicals not so much Pharmaceuticals um for quite a while in when I was at the California Department of Health Services and and then I had an aha moment um I was flying to Japan with my friend John Brock who's a chemist at CDC wonderful chemist and you have long flights we're talking about this and this and he says shaa you should look at thades and I'm going why should I look at thot I never heard of thades right and he said well we can now measure them at the CDC and we see they're in everybody they're in women of reproductive age Fact one fact two colleagues at the ntp have shown something they are calling the phalate syndrome and so he explained what is ntp National toxicology program sorry than for using alphabet super right National toxicology program a governmental you know Research Center and um and their job is to look at chemicals and see what is the toxicity so it could be reproductive it could be carcinogenicity it could be neurotoxicity that's what they do and um so they had signaled out these thids as being reproductively toxic and specifically to males and specifically when exposure is in utero pregnant mom is exposed to phalates and somehow the fetus is disrupted yes if you don't mind I'd like to know um is Mom ingesting phalates in the form of food is she inhaling phalates are they landing on her skin what are the modes of entry into the body of the mom that um let's just assume it goes through the placental barrier into the fetus and is impacting fetal development right so in those experiments it was through food but we are exposed in all those ways you mentioned every way that something can get into our body thies get in there but let's come back to that let me go to the experiment at ntp so what they did at ntp National toxicology program they they fed um mother rats various doses of these various thades and um and what they found was no changes in the females or not that they found at that time they're the female Offspring female Offspring sorry but in the male offspring they found that the genitals were I summarize it by saying incompletely masculinized so I'll explain what that is so for that I have to back up and say um something you know probably know very well but I'll just explain it the genital tract initially is a ridge it's a single Ridge it's the same in males and females it's not sexually dimorphic at the beginning and then under the influence of testosterone in a very specific window called the male programming window in rats its days I think 9 to 12 of gestation so very short window to orient people I think rat mouse gestation is about 21 days or so yeah okay so so so it's for us it'll be early first trimester okay but that comes later so so um at that time if they feed their mother that chemical in her food then her male offspring are born with changes in his genitals or more likely to right and so what they tend to have is a smaller penis um less Descent of the testin is more likely to have unended testicles um there are internal changes that we didn't get into in our human study because we can't look there but um the epidemis there are changes and so on the whole genital tract is altered and the most important measure for me as it turned out and for humans um and perhaps for Animals is something that the scientists animal scientists had studied for a long time for actually 90 plus years but had never been studied in humans and that is the distance from the anus to the genitals this collection of changes in the male genitals was given the name the thallid syndrome now you're a physician and you I challenge you to think of any syndrome aside from alcohol you know they FAL alcohol syndrome of course there's a syndrome but not what syndrome is attached to a chemical class just for um technical purposes I'm a PhD not a clinician but um but but I worked on neural development for many years and and then prior to that some endocrine stuff so I'm I'm um fasile with the general terms um one that comes to mind would be for instance um the thalidomide babies right a miscarriage anti- miscarriage drug that changed limb development that's a very extreme example um I would say for um in um human de normal development what I'm most familiar with are the or early organizing effects of androgens that convert to estrogen on external phenotype which is basically nerd speak for during development the Y chromosome uh produces it leads to the production of a number of genes and eventually proteins through RNA Etc that um are including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone that in the brain organizes the brain male and causes the growth of the penis or organizes meaning it is it sets up the penis to then during puberty when the penis is exposed to testosterone and estrogen and DHT it's a bunch of things not just testosterone the penuts Grows Right so that and lots of other right other things right so so the um the the word soup that I just uh you know put forward is basically saying that there a lot of things in development where hormones set up a uh a potential to respond to other hormones later it's not that testosterone grows the penis during development it does that but more so it establishes a potential for the penis to grow when exposed to things later during puberty do have that right right right as far as the name goes which is the thid syndrome there is thalidomide it's not usually called theide syndrome but it could be so you're right about that but it's extremely rare and I there is no environmentally you know a chemical in the environment uh as opposed to a pharmaceutical that is given a syndrome so this is very very unique and and so I thought wow John's telling me this on the plane right something in the environment that is basically having an endocrine and body disruptive effect at least on par with alcohol fetal alcohol syndrome and phide syndrome right yeah so when well at this point it was only animals right because John was telling me about the ntp study which was in rats and so I thought wow you know I like Puzzles so my first question was is this happening in humans you might ask that you know it's a natural thing to ask great question and then I thought how would we find out and answering that question took me 10 years okay and so if you think about okay thight in the mother changes in the genitals of The Offspring connect them how do we do that right so we have to start with th and the mother so how do we know that well fortunately or not I had stored a lot of urine from pregnant women from a study that I was doing on sperm count I just got the women's urine coincidentally if you will I thought well save it you know it's not expensive and not hard - 80° freezers doesn't take a lot of room put it in there so I had this urine save from pregnant women and then I knew from John that we could look in the urine for thite metabolites so these are products that the body forms when they're exposed to phalates and they you can measure them in urine so I thought okay I could get that urine I could look at the thite metabolites and then I'd know what the mother was exposed to and based on the animal data we have good evidence that it actually makes its way to the fetus so then I thought okay then maybe there's a change in the babies so then I had to get the babies so fortunately I had done this study on pregnant couples pregnant women and their partners and I was able to call them and say would you come in and let us measure your babies's genal right how willing were parents to let you do that that seems they were okay most of them were okay with that yeah yeah well they trusted us you know they had been in a study with us and and you know we were reputable those babies were still um young but not newborn so this was a a while later the the babies that we actually got were on average I think about a month uh 12 months old so not ideal maybe because the rats had been measured at Birth the rat genitals have been but that's what we could do at that time yeah the reason I asked is there's always the potential for ongoing phade exposure to the newborn absolutely so some but I suppose in either case you're able to draw some potential link between or potentially draw a link I have to be careful with my language there um between phade exposure in utero and ex utero and these external biomarkers I mean given that the critical window is quite short and quite early by the way let me just say when the rats they did a lot of work on this critical window and when the rat moms were exposed before Day N it did nothing and when they were exposed after day 12 it did nothing so it was only the exposure during that critical window is very delicate and it's by the way true of the brain as well so there you teasing out what is the critical window is one of the challenges that we have when we work with these chemicals so I wasn't so much worried about exposure in the delivery room and you know in their feed as in the first of life because I knew it was unlikely to change these measures do other things but maybe but not these measures so then the question became kind of what you were asking is what do we measure what do we actually measure and if you think about a newborn r or Mouse their genitals are pretty small and there's not there's it's very difficult to know exactly how that corresponds to the human genital system and what you see at Birth you know when you spread a boal and and so I got a pediatrician at in Los Angeles who worked with me on how to make that translation and how to do do this exam and that took us quite a while because we really wanted to come as close as we could what was clear was that the the anus part of it was easy you go to the center of the anus so that was easy then what's the other landmark what's the the genital Landmark so it turns out there are in males two and in females there are two as well so but let's just talk about males so for males the best place to measure and actually closest to the rat measurement is the place where the tissue changes uh where the scrotum um inserts and that it goes from rugat to smooth tissue and that point is pretty clear pretty easy to measure um the other measure that was the anos scrotal distance and the other measurement we took was the anop penile distance and that was the insertion the anterior insertion of the penis the part closest to the body the closest to the Head yeah closest to the Head yeah and and that was not so obvious because you don't have a change in tissue there so where exactly do you put your caliper and um we had a lot of discussion about do you press down do you what uh you know how where exactly do you make that Mark and actually the anos chronal is the measurement with the least variance because you can measure most precisely but the anop penol is is is another measurement and um and then in you can do something similar in females and we did that but that's we maybe don't have to go into that now so we designed this exam and we did a lot of work to make sure it was repeatable across Examiner and what we finally did was bring the mothers in bring the babies in um and um got three measurements and then on every 10th baby we got an independent examiner to get three measurements so we could look at within and between examiner variation you understand this is the first time this had done been done this way in humans there was a Mexican study that tried to do this and I never learned very much about it and I was excited that they had done this but I'm not sure how it relates to this so I just mentioned that out of honesty you know there's somebody in Mexico did this but um to my knowledge this is the first time it was used as a toxicological measure in humans right so we were um we did that study we related those measurements to what CDC had measured in the urine of our women collected while they were pregnant and we found to Sal Thal syndrome could you explain what the correlation was between phalate metabolite levels which is I believe not not by number because I don't remember it anymore but but there was a significant um let's just take the AGD the AGD of mothers who had higher levels of three the most anti-androgenic phades I'll tell you what those are in a minute had significantly shorter aner gental distance and then I have to say that which I haven't said should have that anal distance is actually dimorphic so it tends to be 50 to 100% longer in males than females that makes sense if you think about what's going in that space there's a lot of real estate in in males between the anus and you know let's say the penis penal insertion much more than in females so it's natur that that will be longer but that that's that's an air and that I began doing some work in other looking at other species and it turns out that that's true in all Maman species except two and one is the hyena all right and one is the elephant so in the hyena I'm just saying this because you be amused by it I think well I you know about hyenas I do I know more about hyena genitalia than I'd like to admit um and I can tell you why after you educate us but I'll make I'll keep my um explanation brief but I'm very familiar with hyena genitalia so I um I have I know Steph Glickman who works with a you might know him too he works in Berkeley with he was my instructor when I was a graduate student at Cal and I used to run in Tien Park I suppose I'll tell it now and there was a colony of wild hyenas but they were behind chain link yes it's actually a favorite hike of mine up the Strawberry Canyon Trail yeah and um I did that trail a good friend of mine uh Brian pgas who's now a professor of the University of Chicago worked on the Prairie vs that were also housed at that facility and um a fun thing to do was to go see the hyenas with Steve um they're brutally dangerous animals um and Steve has tons of stories about them we we should probably resist our temptation to spiral into that may maybe sometime I'll do a little um like evening chat podast cast where I I tell Steve Glickman stories he's a delightful person and um yeah those uh let's just say this the female hyenas have clitorises larger than some of the male hyena penises and those females give birth through those clitorises yes as we both know so you will not be surprised to know that the female HD is longer than the male right because they're heavily androgenized exactly as I recall by andersin Dion as actually I don't know that it became popular during the era uh of steroids in professional baseball because andin diione was being used pretty uh um frequently in baseball at that time anyway we have to be we could go down the spiral of of of uh but also in terms of behavior the female is the alpha right right they eat first yes they're physically and um hierarchically dominant in in hyen so yeah it's really interesting isn't it that they would have a long longer more masculine eneral distance elephants we won't go into now but they're kind of Midway in many things so including they're they're about equal interrenal distance in males and females other than that humans and other species male anal distance is 50 to 100% longer however so three thades DL hexal Thal DP dbal Thal DBP and butal benzil phid bbcp are the most anti-androgenic testosterone lowering phades and those are the ones that were associated with a shorter indal distance in males in human males human males and animal so we we replicated that animal study in humans and then because you know this is how it is in science I had to do it all again right so I started a whole new study um and that study is still going on the children are still being followed I think we started in um 2012 um the paper first paper on en General distance came out in 2005 had a pretty big impact and um so so these are are studies where you're looking at the anogenital distance in um relatively newborn humans then tracking that distance no that's a different tracking is another study okay this is just two studies on demonstrating the Thal syndrome in human males okay so the first one I described the second one the replication and the second one is the one that's going on still so um and whether what it does to their reproductive function we don't know the kids are only 12 years old now so so we we would like to know that and we will know that okay but I have another answer to for you about that so so we started the second study and the second study which is called Tides which is the infant development environment study um by the way these are both in four cities in the United States um and um there we did it right so we got the urine in the first you know early urine because we knew that could be important we didn't have that option in the first one remember those urine samples accidental we got them when we could right and we got repeated urines one in each trimester to look at the effects in different trimesters and then We examined the baby at birth which is what the rats so we came much closer to replicating the the rodent study and we saw it again I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor ag1 ag1 is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink with adaptogens I've been taking ag1 daily since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast the reason I started taking ag1 and the reason I still take ag1 once and often twice a day is because it is the highest quality and most complete foundational nutritional supplement what that means is that ag1 ensures that you're getting all the necessary vitamins minerals and other micronutrients to form a strong foundation for your daily Health ag1 also has probiotics and prebiotics that support a healthy gut microbiome your gut microbiome consists of trillions of microorganisms that line your digestive tract and impact things such as your immune system status your metabolic Health your hormone health and much more so I've consistently found that when I take ag1 daily my digestion is improved my immune system is more robust I rarely get sick and my mood and mental focus are at their best in fact if I could take Just One supplement that supplement would be ag1 if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer for this month only no M 2024 ag1 is giving away one free month supply of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil in addition to the usual welcome kit of five free travel packs and a

exposure equates to Shorter uh anogenital distance in males it it um was approaching the distribution in females um it sounds like that that the distributions moved more closely together yes yes right yes although it wasn't the females that moved sorry the male distribution became more like the female became more uh right femin could say feminized but more female like in it and they but these boys also had smaller penises less Descent of the testes um smaller scrotums so they were smaller you know everything was in their genital area are all the secondary sex characteristics of puberty in males Adams Apple facial growth um thickening of the vocal cords therefore lowering the voice Etc are those all later activating effects of hormones or are there precursors to those that are present in in um in males because in mice as I recall like like I couldn't I couldn't tell you like we call it in the laboratory people always chuckle at this but it's like sexing the animals when you you know look to determine if it's a male or female when they're when they're really young you have to like look carefully at first right and then you get pretty good at it um as they get older it gets easier but when the mice are um uh you know feet down back up you know you can't really you can't really tell you can't really tell right the as the mice get older their testicles become visible in the males from even from above but you know as far as I know there aren't really external markers so you may have found the one truly external biomarker of maless of maless and and so I I I do want to say one thing about females because then that'll lead me to my conclusion about the role of this measure um so if the mother is exposed to more testosterone than expected you might expect that her female offspring would have a more male in a genital dist is that the case yes so it's a bidirectional effect can we also presume that if the mother either secretes or is exposed to more Androgen then the males can become hyper male no we' never I don't know what that would be we never saw anything that would be hyper male um so the the yes I said to you was the result of a study uh where we looked at the girls born to women with PCOS so women with cosos is you know have excess testosterone polycystic sorry polycystic ovari that's good we've talked about it a little bit before in the podcast it's a um It's associated with my understanding is It's associated with um elevated levels of androgens that's right and these women often have facial hair and you know they not just the moms but the the people the women with PC yes have elevated androgens yes not just we're not talking about pregnant moms anymore right um and so in our study population we did a search for women who had diagnosis of PCOS and took that as a marker of higher testosterone exposure and then looked at the girls and yes those girls had a longer quote more masculine interal distance what what age group were you looking at in the INF in the infants oh the PC was at was at diag at pregnancy at the time they were pregnant so presumably people between their like somewhere in their 20s out to their 40s yeah yeah so adult human females who have PCOS tend to we know they have higher levels of androgens but they also have more maleik anogenital distance they do not their daughters do their daughters do thank you for that clarification they're daughters and so put this together this measure is a look inside the womb at the Androgen level that the fetus is exposed to at that time which is amazing because you can't go in there without disturbing you know you can't uh and so this is very early first trimester you can't even get you know flu fluid and so on so this tells you this is like a readout of what was in you know in the fluid at the time so then your next question was what does this mean for later fertility yes yeah what what is the impact of this early Androgen exposure in to female Offspring or um let's just say reduction in functional Androgen exposure to male offspring the reason I'm using this uh you know loop-to-loop language as as you probably know but for the audience not trying to complicate things here but a lot of the mascul izing effects of hormones in fetal development is actually testosterone that's converted into estrogen so it can get pretty tricky right and um but maybe for sake of Simplicity today we'll just stick with Androgen effects on masculinization with the understanding that some of those effects are the consequence of testosterone being converted into estrogen right it's just that people form such strong associations falsely that you know testosterone is male mess that's not true and and and estrogen is femaleness and they both and it just gets really murky but for for the time being um you identified an external biomarker of fetal Androgen AKA masculinization via the mother that's right got it okay so then we asked the question you've asked and many people asked who cares what what why would we worry about a boy having a slightly smaller anog gal distance well I can tell you there are many boys that are probably worried about it right now right they probably got the ruler and the calipers out right now just you know um but I'm going to answer that question right so I told you that our kids are too young they're not producing sperm right now right so we had to go to an adult population right and so we went to a population of college students in Rochester New York and what we did there was make an assumption which is based on animal data it's true in animals we've been following the animal path here all along so in the animals my colleague Earl Gray who did these studies said his name is Earl Gray yeah that's cool yeah um he said a GD is forever anogenital distance is forever now what that means is it's not like your anogenital distance today is what it was when you were born of course you're a bigger person but that means adjusted for body size right so if you assume that AGD is forever if you're born with a short for your size AG then when you're 20 you'll have a short for your size AGD okay can we assume that okay so if we assume that then if we get these college students to come in and we can measure their anogenital distance we're getting a reflection of what it was when they were Bor okay and then we can get their sperm count and then we can see if they're related and that's what we did so we got this population of volunteers paid them $75 and one of the guys said for 75 bucks you can do anything and so what we did was we met measure their anal distance and then we got them to give us seamen sample and complete a questionnaire and things you do in a study we'll link to that study but I have a couple questions about the controls in that study just for sake of people understanding how a study like this would be done I don't expect you recall all the all the details but um you're adjusting for body size and body weight yeah height weight what are the factors that would scale here that would allow you to normalize um in other what you're trying to do is backtrack to what it likely was at at um no we didn't actually try to go back what we let me just tell you what the results were in this group of men if they had a longer anogenital distance they had a higher sperm count got it so you were correlating those two measures right and then if we wanted to say something about we didn't try to say anything about how it was when they were born we just said okay we'll take that assumption that this reflects their early AGD if we want to say something about early AGD and sperm count so it's easy to say AGD is related to sperm count because we measured that we saw that a correlation that's published okay if we want to say their early AGD at Birth and their sperm count that's a leap of faith in some sense because we don't have their early for these guys in Rochester we didn't measure their AG were there conditions of being a participant in the study such as uh refraining from alcohol cannabis Etc in the 90 days prior 90 days being the the duration of spermatogenesis yeah I don't remember that these are college students so presumably some of them are drink okay so but in the end it it was a robust um a robust link and then U Mike Eisenberg who you might know my colleague at Stanford he's been on this podcast good good so he's a colleague of mine too and um he uh looked at um men in infertility clinic and those who had born children and those who had not born children and the men who had born children had a longer in gental distance than men who had never born a child never born but were trying yes right these were not people who opted out these were exactly these were people who were who are who were having challenges with fertility versus success with with uh by the way you know the question of how you measure AG in an adult man is a different question question then how you measure it in a newborn and we did a lot of work on that and Michael helped with that too so it sounds like um oh and may I ask were the sperm counts that were on the let's just say the lower um like the lower cortile where the quote unquote lower sperm counts like functionally lower because I always wonder about this like it's come up in a number of discussions like with Robert spolski with Mike Eisenberg and now I'm asking you you when we hear that sperm counts are going down down are they going down to the point where fertility is is impacted that's really the the one of the I think functional questions so I'm going to let's lay aside the question of AGD right that's an really interesting but let's talk about sperm count okay so um if you there's a a beautiful study um among pregnancy planners out of Denmark um quite a long time ago um and in that study what they did was take couples that were trying to conceive that had never or not recently I can't remember used oral contraceptives and then they saw what the sperm count was and how long it took them to conceive right time to pregnancy in relation to and what they showed is a really interesting curve which has never been correct it to my knowledge it's it's it's what I use and what I think people use which is that if you I wish I could draw it here wish I had a BL you should have a board a white board the problem is a lot of people are listening but maybe we you know we can talk people through it sorry so so just think about um a curve where you go all the way down to zero that would be no sperm um and then as the probability of conceiving is zero so you're looking at sperm count along you know is the x-axis and months to conception um and um what you see is that if you have no sperm you don't have no conception if you go up to around 40 45 there's a steep increase so the more sperm you have 40 45 million million per milliliter and this is million per Mill uh so just pure concentration not number of motile sperm this is just how many sperm we're not talking about quality we're Talk number a number and and when you have 45 to 50 million per Mill and below it matters a lot what your sperm count is you know people say it doesn't matter yeah if you get in this range where the probability of conception is dropping off really rapidly it matters a lot and then they're around 45 to 50 it starts to level off and then after that after certainly after 100 probably 75 it doesn't matter at all so 100 million sperm per milliliter yes of semen yes okay so can you see this okay so it so when people say does sperm count matter for fertility yes it matters a lot if it's low and no it doesn't matter at all if it's high so you just we just have too many sperm I mean I don't but humans you know and there's so nature runs a probability game overproduced sperm right some of those will be high quality some will be low quality depending on their age when they were that is when they were generated or their conditions you know or their conditions how much heat exposure Etc so nature runs a probability game that's right hoping that the the the best quality sperm will fertilize the egg right um so below 45,000 uh excuse me below 45 million milon per milliliter below 45 million sperm per milliliter of semen the sperm count really matters it drops off precipitously that's right once you get up to 75 100 million per Mill of sperm then it's all good to you're good to go right and sperm counts uh range anywhere from you know it could be low 8 n 10 million per Miller in the very low situation it could be zero in some people right all the way up to 400 yeah million there's a huge range that's right and that's a function of age it's a function of genetics it's a function of presumably thied exposure yeah I'd like to take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors function I recently became a function member after searching for the most comprehensive approach to lab testing while I've long been a fan of blood testing I really wanted to find a more in-depth program for analyzing blood urine and saliva to get a full picture of my heart health my hormone status my immune system regulation my metabolic function my vitamin and mineral status and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality function not only provides testing of over 100 biomarkers key to physical and mental health but it also analy IES these results and provides insights from to doctors on your results for example in one of my first tests with function I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood this was totally surprising to me I had no idea prior to taking the test function not only helped me detect this but offered medical doctor informed insights on how to best reduce those mercury levels which included limiting my tuna consumption because I'd been eating a lot of tuna while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens and supplementing with Knack and a cysteine both of which can support glutathione production and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels comprehensive lab testing like this is so important for health and while I've been doing it for years I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive I've been so impressed by function both at the level of ease of use that is getting the tests done as well as how comprehensive and how actionable the tests are that I recently joined their Advisory Board and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast if you'd like to try function go to function function health.com huberman function currently has a weight list of over 250,000 people but they're offering Early Access to huberman lab listeners again that's function health.com huberman to get early access to function we were on to the fact that sperm counts are dropping there's a relationship to anogenital distance and there's a relationship between anogenital distance and Thal exposure yeah and then I asked the question you know okay we're hearing about sperm counts dropping but is it functionally relevant are is that one of the reasons why fertility is dropping and we've also got the female side where we've got women with elevated androgens so we can talk about that a little bit later but um and then of course we have the socio uh the sociobiology uh piece where people are opting out um or it's also economics in some cases um opting out of having kids right um so let's go back to sperm count because we haven't really talked about that it's a kind of a different path and my introduction into phalates was not through sperm count right it was through this question of my colleague ask me you know you should look at this and challenged and I looked at it and that was really really interesting Journey that I went on okay so that but there was a separate for a while Journey that I was on and that started in the late 1990s when um I was asked to join a committee of the National Academy of Sciences and that committee was assembled to look at the question of whether hormonally active chemicals endocrine disrupting chemicals in the environment posed a threat to human health because at that time it was like well yeah we hear about this but should we care right and so that committee wanted to consider a study that had come out of Denmark a few years earlier which claimed that sperm count had dropped 50% in 50 years wow that's a huge drop that's what we're seeing worse than that by the way now so okay they said to me I was the only statistician on the panel would you look at this and see if we need to consider this in our deliberations and as I mentioned I'm skeptical and I looked at it and I thought H I don't think so that was my initial reaction and that was because first of all I didn't know who had written this I just saw it in a journal and and it was not very big and not very many figures not very much data and I thought of it and I thought that's that's a big claim for a little little paper you know um but I'll look at it because it's important and so what I did then was to think about all the fact factors that we epidemiologists call confounders things that might have caused that decline if it wasn't real biologically right and so we could think of some of them together um you know maybe the method of counting sperm had changed so that later methods counted fewer sperm in the same sample that's certainly possible right um but it turned out that wasn't the case cuz they actually had all used the same method um and maybe the men had changed so maybe there's a you can't get a sperm count at random you have to get somebody to volunteer right so who were these men were they very different you know in the early part of the study and the late part of the study in a way that maybe in the late part of the study there were men with lower sperm gut and they were more concerned you know maybe they were more obese that's pretty plausible obesity is related to se sperm Camp fertility um and maybe they smoked more and maybe and so on and so forth right so what I did was to get the 61 studies go through them and try to extract information on all the factors that could explain the decline so I created a multivariable model and ran that model and to my astonishment when I was done the slope of the decline was exactly the same to the first decimal place it had not explained anything and I was like oh my God this looks like it might be real and and for those listening what Dr Swan is describing is being the excellent scientist that she is she went and looked for all the things that could impact the result that were not related to what the main conclusion seemed to be which is that sperm counts were going down over time right right and uh this is really important um to because I think what we're talking about here in parallel to the main conversation is how to do really great science especially in human populations that are out there living you know some of these men probably you know smoke some cannabis I'm not saying that reduces sperm count it might reduce sperm amount mot motility however we covered that in the podcast now that all the Cannabis folks go well uh you know so and so got so and so pregnant when they were doing swing a lot of weed and I always say okay well there are a number of other factors right you know but alcohol there's um frequency of ejaculation right the the requirement to abstain for 48 to 72 to hours to up to five days prior you know Etc all all these these factors that men may or may not Faithfully report but you assume that if some are telling the truth and some aren't that there's an equal distribution of that so all the different things right right this is so very different than looking at for instance um ovarian reserve like the the number of eggs where you use ultrasound and you use amh levels and um sure things can impact that but it's a little different than when taking uh sperm counts so thank you for doing the the studies so carefully and for repeating them so many times I mean many of the studies that you've done are are um you you've done followup on these sperm count studies across multiple years you know as you said the first study was in 1992 then you did one in 2017 then there was one again there was an update I noticed online so you are extremely thorough you and and it probably reflects your um early training in math and statistics and probability Theory you're not somebody to just kind of go in and go oh yeah like in these people that eat a few too much of this then there's a little bit less of that so I just wanted um if today's discussion feels like we're really um we're Laing through this um that's intentional um and it's important for people to hear these these kinds of um claims are not the sort of thing that you could people make them all over all over the board but work like this needs to be done um with an extremely meticulous eye and consideration of all the variables well good scientific method yeah yeah yeah and I would say especially with human epidemiological work because of the number of potential confounding variables right right so so when I saw that and actually did another study to select my own studies and not accept her 61 studies that had been published that Elizabeth Carlson had published uh so new studies came up to more recent times went back further um did it again found exactly the same thing okay so there were three you know three looks at that and I thought okay I'm going to accept this now this is sperm count is declining and why I turned to the why okay because up and down now we hadn't said anything about why we just said is it doing that yes okay if it now we believe it is declining why and so then I thought quite a lot and talked to people and ruled out genetics because it was too fast it's two generations it's too fast 50 years two generations so if it's not genetics then it's environment and so what is it about the environment that could do this so I asked okay in the environment there could be things that are making sperm decline so if you think about how you might look at that you might design the study that I designed next which was another study and by the way this preceded the AGD so it just so we had four cities in the United States that we picked with different environments and then we got men to come in and we used the same equipment at each place we used the same method of selection them selecting the man the tech technicians were trained centrally at UC Davis we had very good quality control so samples were sent around every quarter to make sure that everybody was measuring things the same way we didn't want drift right and then we got their urine um and that's how I had those urine samples so if you wanted to do this study and you wanted to get a representative sample of men where would you go because you can't I can't ask a guy in the street to give me a SE sample right I mean it's not it's not something you get very you know so I thought how can I get a representative sample and which would teach me something about a larger population called the parent population so here's a sample it should represent the parent so how do I ensure that and what I decided was to sample partners of pregnant women because pregnant women all come to Medical Care almost all and if their Partners will give a seaman sample then we have a representative sample and when we know what we're looking at so that's what we did so this is a the Seaman study is the study of Partners of pregnant women and um and of course they'll have slightly higher SE quality because they got their partner pregnant but um and so we had their urine we had their blood and um we looked at their semen quality and then we decided to look at pesti pdes and the reason we look at pesticides um was because there was a lot of gradation across our for centers in pesticide use and what we found was really extraordinary that men who were living in Central Missouri where I was living at the time who were in the middle of a agricultural belt where there was spraying all the time for soybeans and so on um those men had half as many moving sperms as men in Minneapolis whoa whoa huge right and then we went one step further and within Missouri we looked at a sample of men who had very high sperm parameters and very low sperm parameters and showed that five pesticides were significantly higher in the men with the low sperm parameters that include motility morphology you know all app so these are pesticides that are being sprayed in the air on crops you mentioned soybeans what other what other types of crops I don't know okay I don't remember so so plant and fruit crops presum was yeah whatever whatever they were growing in Columbia Missouri at that time and and just to make sure I understand that it's not that the men corn and soybeans corn and soybeans but we're not talking about eating corn and soybeans we're talking about living in an area where pesticides are being used by is it is it still called dust crop yeah we didn't go into how they got these we just looked in their urine and there were the metabolized the metabolists don't get in their urine unless they were exposed exposed through the air or exposed by eating corn and soybeans we don't know we don't know okay we don't know um but this was not a particularly you know we didn't we didn't sample Farmers Only or anything like that so whoever came into the remember how we got these men their wives were pregnant they were having prenatal care at the University of Missouri so that's where we got them whoever happened to come in to the prenatal clinic and agree to be in our study they're the male you know urine M's urine was measured for for these pesticides I'm sure a number of people including myself are wondering in what other products are these five pesticides present um are these commonly used pesticides or is it something about they were they're called the the iine pesticides atrazine is was the most widely used and it's a huge use around the world I mean it's highly you know one of the most the largest commercial pesticides um so these were very big players in the pesticide field a relevant um theme there would be uh maybe we could take a moment and talk about atraid and its effect on uh male sexual behavior in amphibia and we'll come um come back to the the the sperm cies because um when I was a graduate student at UC Berkeley I had the wonderful experience of taking a course from the now I think you mentioned he's Aden there are multiple Deans on campuses Tyrone Hayes is a wonderful researcher um who established a link through his research between atrazine exposure and um male sexual behavior of amphibia yes could you elaborate on that result yeah so Tyrone first caught frogs in the wild uh in environments that were more or less exposed to atrazine and showed effects on development and sexual behavior then he in his lab he actually exposed them so he knew exactly who was exposed and how much and he showed that the and I can't tell you what percent or what you know but a significant number of frogs exposed to this pesticide atrazine chose to mate with other male frogs tried to mate with other male frogs presumably unsuccessfully well they CL they mounted them he has photos of the male males mounting males and so presumably this is a neural change that occurred neuroendocrine change but ultimately neural since mounting behavior is controlled by actually we now know the the um hypothalamic nuclei that control this David Anderson who's been on this podcast has people in his laboratory that including a former graduate student of mine um uh working on on this specific issue of what the what the the circuitry um is um that's a remarkable result it's been kind of um you know used and misused out there in the in the in the media and in popular culture um but if nothing else it suggests that the organization of the neural circuits and neuroendocrine Pathways that control um sexual I don't want to say part like because his mating thing this the frogs aren't monogamous but um uh sexual preference are um significantly impacted by this by this atrazine yes and and it suggests that that there other environmental chemicals can as well and we I don't know how if we'll have time to go there but I did work on neurodevelopmental outcomes in relation to prenatal phid exposure and so I think the overarching idea here is that the brain like the genitals is sexually dimorphic and there's many people by the way who will take offense at that really yeah I think there's I mean going back to the the work of Frank Beach and the psychology department at UC Berkeley I know um showed this in beagles it's been it's been shown in pretty much every species tell but it's not a better worse I think this is what people need to hear like dimorphic does not mean better worse it means different right right and that there and there are for example advantages to spatial um reasoning in a male that which are related to testosterone you right you know that so I mean I think there yeah I mean my understanding of this literature and I'm not an expert in this particular aspect which is the behavioral phenotypes but you know like the meteor preoptic area of the hypothalamus is known to be sexually dimorphic dependent on testosterone converted into estrogen during development etc etc and there's just so much evidence of this um how it links to behaviors is can I think can be reasonably placed into um ethologically relevant um uh evolutionarily logical um arguments when talking about rodents or beagles or even reesus macak monkeys I think where people get um a bit inflamed is when people try and take the sexual dimorphisms have been observed in animal brains or in even in human brains and Tack those to specific abilities or or or lesser abilities I think that's when people sort of go wait a second like I have much better sense of direction than my husband and you go well yeah like you know and then you go well does that mean that she has higher testosterone than him and then maybe and then and pretty soon you're you're in uh almost at no man's land a no person's land of of of comp of confounding variables right but I really appreciate that you raised this and also that you said it and I didn't because I I feel safer that way but look there is a a very simple outdated questionnaire and it's play Behavior it's called the psai it's been used for years have you I don't if Rough and Tumble play yes yeah yes and there are 24 questions on there and they are sexually goric I guess you could say that there you know my child likes to play with dolls my child likes to play dress up my child likes to play rough and tumble uh Etc and we gave that questionnaire to our population um and looked at the answers uh that the mothers gave both in our population by the way and a Swedish population of a colleague there uh Carl borag and Gustav borag and and um what we found higher thite levels these anti-androgenic phics were Expos you know associated with less masculine male typical play in our male boys so this is thid exposure to the to the mom baby is born in the young human child four four yeah four year I think it was four years of age four years of age less Rough and Tumble type play that's right among the boys whose mothers were exposed to Mor phalates during a critical period of development now you can see that's a politically loaded issue now I mean you know yeah well I think we're I mean let's let's let's have some fun with this in in in the scientific sense the the notion of dimorphism is you know okay male and female brains are different right which and male female defined in those almost all those studies as presence of a y chromosome and then people say well there's some there's x y y and then there's XX y okay but most of the time you're talking about XX chromosome or X why chromosomes at Birth forget everything else for the moment these are always distributions this is what I think people need to know we're not talking about these are not this is not uh you know two hills of data separated by a valley these are overlapping distributions right right so you get males with a quote unquote female likee distribution you get females with a quote unquote maleik distribution and I think as long as we acknowledge that then we're just talking statistics right we're not we're not placing any cultural or um any value on it really whatsoever right but but if you you could make the analog to the inter gental distance it's kind of similar you know you have the same exposure salid exposure you have something changed statistically we don't see huge differences in the boys genitals uh and and we don't see huge I don't we know these kids have not been scan so we don't know how their brains look but based on their answers we don't see huge differences we see tenant we see they are more likely if they had been exposed to these stots to want to play dress up and have tea parties more likely doesn't mean that they're all going to but that's the direction and so on so I think we have to just think about more likely not absolute yeah and of course there are also the the sociobiological variables such as um if a young boy has a sibling that's a sister there's more lik be dressed as right she's if he has two older brothers there might be more Rough and Tumble play happening in the house and I have some friends that are women who have older brothers and those women are uh you know some of them roll Jiu-Jitsu or do you know and I know some women who are only children who do martial arts and and and fight right you know so so I think that um none of this is deterministic right as we know I but but let me just add we did control for the sex of The Sibling older sibling and we also asked about the parents attitude just toward same-sex play so what would how would you feel if your child your male child played with dolls would you be discouraging would you encourage because it has a lot to do with what's in the house you know if you say did your child play with dolls well what what if there were no dolls this is super interesting to me I I don't want to reveal too much but I um just because it's not it's just an N of one but I grew up in a household where I have a sister but then after a certain age I received very strong messages about what sorts of um play were um were gender appropriate um and I think I also just naturally defaulted to there were a bunch of boys that lived in my neighborhood they had older sisters so all the sisters hung out together it's kind of interesting and all the the younger brothers pretty much hung out together and the the guys that weren't didn't have siblings or had Brothers for siblings so there was a really strong Divergence but I grew up in the SE that was in the 70s and early ' 80s when things were let's just say culture was more dimorphic then clearly right I mean there were television shows like All in the Family which the entire basis of the show was the wife going back to work and the husband being confused about I mean nowadays people will go like what that's wild I have to ask because I know people are wondering and I'm wondering what are some non-pesticide sources of phalates that um we have agency over that we can take control over right so let me ju correct you it's not that sources of phalates necessarily pesticides there are phalates in pesticides um but that's not the worst player in um the in the story if you look at the different classes of exposures that are hormonally active right pesticides are phalates are bisphenols like bisphenol a BPA BPA certain metals are there's a posos chemicals there's all these different classes right and if we want to go excuse me into what in our daily life exposes us to these things that's another story that um we we can talk about but they're going to be different depending on the class right so let's um throw our arms around all of those for the moment and I'll just ask you given that you're an expert in this area what are the top three to five sources of endocrine disruptors that we have agency over and let's forget about pregnancy for the moment since we're all out of the womb if we're listening to this um some people will be pregnant as they listen to it but um would you say it's you know drinking out of plastic bottles is it laundry detergent um is it you know rubber tires that are cascading down on us through the air and we're in ing them I mean presumably all of the above but what are which ones that we have agency over do you think are the most let's just say concerning where people could make better choices um I would say foodborn exposures exposures in the food in the food packaging in the food storage in the food in the cooking of utensils um we can go through the various things but um we're doing that all the time you know we're eating all the time we're getting food into into us and these are bringing in in a very you know in a way that we have some control over some agency over uh you know we can make changes in our Foods um very close to that is drink you know food and beverage um so I first of all I've talked about this a lot I've written about it in my book I'm also as you know involved in a movie where in the movie that might be a good time to talk about that what what we do in the movie the movie is about six couples that are infertile okay they haven't been able to conceive in 12 months that's the definition and um then a company that I work with a million marker out of Berkeley has a trained staff that interviews them not only them but anyone who signs into to this company interviews them and ask them what they use what do they use for their faal facial care what do they use for their shampoo what do they use for their cleaning products and their laundry detergent and their what do they store their food in and on and on and on so this's this long inventory that they take of all products that people are aware of using okay and um based on that we identify likely bad players in the list so how we do that is another you know we can talk about that later but um then in the film and in this little It's actually an experiment that I designed and we're called an intervention and we are then intervening in their exposures by changing out these things that they told us so we will tell them you know don't use any product with fragrance for example that's a major source of exposure to Thad any product any fragrance product if fragrance is no perfume no lotions soap with fragrance right even essential oil fragrances like essal oil is a tricky right it's a mix it's a mix yeah so I I'm I'm going to that's guarded but but anything you know spray deodorants roll on deodorant laundry detergent yep in shamp and any if you can smell it it's probably affecting your hormones I'm so happy about this answer not because I have any steak in any company related to fragrance free stuff but I I I've a very strong sense of smell and I um either love or hate smells and I hate synthetic smells like going through the dutyfree especially in a European airport where with all the perfumes and I'm just I was going to hold my breath it it feels like I'm breathing poison I know um uh well well you are actually yeah yeah yeah in some sense most soaps right yeah um super interesting so that's your primary intervention is to tell them get rid of anything with fragrances no it's only one thing we get rid of so then we we talk about how the Plastics that they use to store their food food storage containers try to get them to get rid of those if they're made of plastic we try to get them to get rid of their um non-stick pans because of the posos chemicals that are in those and and so on and so forth so we go through all steps of their life and try to tell them how to make changes that will reduce their exposure but presumably also um changes like if if uh the man is obese for instance you might have him walking a bit more no you don't touch any of that well you see Andrew if we did that we would be mixing up two interventions we would be mixing up an obesity intervention I see this is a study I I'm sorry I thought that this group is uh is missioned with um helping couples get pregnant no no this is how this is a study to look at what happens if you make these product related changes great just product related changes exactly exactly we would love to do and probably will do another study separate one on Obesity and you know a lot of these chemicals just to let you know are obesogens they increase obesity there's a book out called obesogens you can read about them and so you know it'll be it's very you know there is some overlap so by reducing some of these chemicals that are in your food storage containers you're also reducing obesogens so it's not a clear you know yes no we gave them a box each couple I went to their house six couples around the United say with a big box and in this box are these alternative products and um so you know straws and and and bamboo spoons and you know $500 per box I think it was approximately it had to do with their personal you know exposure and and then they made these changes now unlike another study that you reported they are at the end quite happy to keep doing this by the way they love this they love doing this it was so gratifying to see that they felt in many many ways their life got better you know I'm not a I'm I'm pretty careful in what I so I I hesitate to say this because the data is not hard but the impression is that they are happy happier they're sleeping better they report more energy and so on and so forth uh having made these changes we need to follow that up with hard data I'm not writing that I'm not you know but that they but I can say and I can write that they felt very positive and are we're going to go back and see if they did continue we need to do that but at the end of the six of the 3 months they and hopefully in six months they will they are still making these changes in their lives did um you collect data on whether or not they were able to conceive after having made these changes yes we did but I actually can't talk about that can't talk about until the babies are born just kidding um um and and we did get their sperm count at the beginning and the end and and had some very interesting data on that which too early to report to too too early let me ask you this then and um I appreciate that the not wanting to share specific uh results until this the all the data are in and it's published um if somebody listening uh were having trouble conceiving um for 12 months or more um are the sorts of replacement intervention product interventions that you're talking about here things that you would um at least feel comfortable saying um would might be a good place to start or to explore absolutely absolutely there's no harm you know we we're not none of the changes are putting people at risk or doing anything that could be harmful them I'm sure of that very careful and some are are going to be cost-saving um I think that's where like drinking out of uh plastic bottles far less if at all like I um just for reasons related to wanting to reduce waste I I use a mason jar or use these or ceramic although you'll probably tell me that the lining on the ceramic mug might have endocrine disruptors no I okay great okay well then I'll keep drinking um but it's very reassuring to me that there are things that we can do in terms of cost-saving elimination or replacement of of consumables buying in bulk that can improve endocrine status maybe fertility buy in bulk um bring a container to the store and fill it up a glass jar instead of buying something in plastic you're winning on both ends because those bulk products are cheaper MH um one of the things I did with the couples was go shop with them and we went around and we looked at various products and for example we looked at the produce and there was option to buy freestanding Bunches of lettuce heads of lettuce or wrapped up in plastic Bunches of lettuce and I said let's compare the price I actually didn't know until we did it but the freestanding unwrapped lettuce was cheaper and I think that's you know because that makes sense because there's a work involved in wrapping it up and in the container and so on and so not only are you getting something that's more toxic but it's more expensive when it comes to reducing PA exposure and some of these forever chemicals um that you mentioned um seems like reducing uh fluid intake from plastic vessels is going to be number one the primary source of BPA is in the lining of cans so any drink or soup or anything that comes in a can is going to be um any can all can any can unless it's a high-end you know Elite company that's made the change from BPA to an alternative lining and they'll say that so and by the way BPA has some bad relatives um such as BPS and BPF and and maybe you're be interested in this story so when it came out that BPA was um estrogenic which is what it is um and by the way it's kind of the evil twin of phalates because phalates are anti-androgenic and B is estrogenic and phalates make plastic soft and BPA makes plastic hard you don't want either okay so when this came out that this was a bad thing um the manufacturer started selling things that say BPA free I'm sure you've seen that the trick is that instead of BPA they use BPS sneaky rat and BPF and these are chemicals these are lookalikes they're analoges and they're just as harmful sneaky sneaky sneaky so I'm not a conspiracy theorist but it's just so dirty it's so dirty it's like it's um you know right now is a really important time to be having this discussion because there's been a lot of movement on Capitol Hill and there's been a lot of movement on social media about trying to call attention to metabolic syndromes and highly processed foods and and issues like this and it's become unfortunately politicized I mean I hear this stuff and I just think to myself the only good faith um that we can really trust is our own desire to be healthier and um to have our families and friends be healthier and to try and consume and not consume things on the basis of that that my belief is that we can't trust any any larger agency to either protect or harm us it's like it's not it's it's like they're going to do what they're going to do we just have to be informed as opposed to trying to like dismantle the systems that led to this which just seems like infinitely complicated um maybe you can do that but I'm far less optimistic and now that I'm 49 years old I can say things like now that I'm 49 I feel like um but what you're saying is really important if I look at a can it says BPA free doesn't mean anything it could have bps's or other uh endocrine disruptors right so drinking out of glass vessels um drinking out of um ceramic vessels um metal metal but not cans not metal cans not aluminum cans right not cans no good but okay you know you can get a a metal water bottle that's not lined with BPA steel steel yeah steel yeah and um is it true that microwave safe means it just means that the plastic won't melt in the microwave but it's do never never put plastic in a microwave so here's the story The BPA phids plasticizers are added to the plastic but they're not chemically bound to it okay so if you put anything in a container that has these chemical in it they will and then put it in a hot environment they will come out of the plastic and go into the food so if you in a microwave or you put your bottle in the car and the Sun comes in it warms up the bottle and then the stuff goes into your water you don't want to mix these chemical and your food but if you do the worst thing is to do it in a heated environment I think about all the the food that was consumed in college in the in the 90s and 2000s like uh the cup of noodles with the styrofoam the um you know things in packaging stuff like that is pretty straightforward to eliminate once one understands and decides then we start getting into the more nuanced thing of like okay you can buy a really nice tasting anyway grass-fed grass finish steak but it's wrapped in plastic well or you can go to the butcher but most people don't have time to go to the butcher or you can get um strawberries at the farmers market blueberries at the farmers market which is what I try to do but sometimes I buy strawberries at the market and they have those plastic flip top things and of course I recycle the plastic how bad is it if you know you rinse the strawberries off with good clean water that were in the plastic container are you we have to do that experiment I don't know yeah so I guess so it sounds to me like um not drinking out of cans not drinking out of plastic bottles it's going to be not microwaving plastic ever and in general just avoiding avoiding plastic intake if you can afford it buy organic so you're going to avoid the pesticides and then phalates are actually added to pesticides and they're added because they increase absorption so you know the you want your pesticides to get into the plant right and to kill the bad stuff and and insects and and um so the same property of phalates that makes them good for pesticides also makes them good for our hand cream just mentioning absorption absorption anything that's absorbed in the body is going to have phades in it and it also holds scent and color so it's added to those scents and it's also added to your lipstick and to your colored you know whatever you put on face and so on anything that holds scent and color that's going to be th um sorry I've been accused on line and uh of being a sunscreen truther I'm not a sunscreen truther I'm going to keep repeating this as many times as I can I I understand that UV damage to the skin can cause certain cancers I get that um I agree with that um the data are pretty clear to me based on having researched this pretty extensively and talked to many many people including Derm oncologists that mineral-based sunscreens like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide but certainly zinc oxide are safer than the chemical sunscreens a lot of people get upset when I say that and they say well in Europe there's tons of evidence that the chemical based sunscreens are safe okay fine you use them I'm not going to the point being that UV damage is bad there are ways to prect protect ourselves from the Sun including physical barriers like clothing hats Etc um but pretty much all sunscreen that I'm aware of is designed to be absorbed so what do we do if we want to get some UV protection from whatever kind of sunscreen we deem safe for ourselves but we want to avoid these exposures to these other things what what do we do do we have to hunt really carefully for the right sunscreen uh yeah I I think that's a good idea um are you familiar with environmental working group uh is another one out of the Bay Area no oh okay I don't know actually where they are they're pretty big sounds sounds familiar but I'm not I can't say I'm familiar with they have Consumer Guides and in those consumer so environmental working group I'm not part of them I'm you know but I like their work and in these Consumer Guides you can put in the product and they have categories you can put sunscreen if we had time we could do it right now but and then you can put the name of your sunscreen and it'll give you a number and then if the number is less than 10 it'll tell you why are they in independent of any like funding of that question will probably come up for you too um uh people will say where did she get her funding you know people people get very suspicious about this I can tell you yeah that would be great yeah so I uh am a a tenure professor at Mount Si get some salary there because I'm only part-time and I have a funer one funer who funds found funded my um sperm decline uh second sperm decline analysis and the publicity of my book so he's a he's a it's a foundation I won't says philanthropy yes philanthropy yeah and it's actually not a lot of money so no And so there's no reason to think that anything that you're telling us is um linked to like the food industry or an alternative product or anything I'm very very careful not to endorse any product because I don't want that complication yeah thanks for clarifying that I wasn't I wasn't suspicious but um but I think nowadays people have just been taught to you know appropriately so they've been taught to say well wait where does this funding come from because a lot of the studies about the that led to the F food pyramid for instance people were under the impression that somehow that was biased by by companies that were funding the work and I don't know I haven't done the forensics on that I don't have the time or the energy um all I know is that um when it comes to what people eat what it comes when it comes to what people put on their body it becomes a very personal thing and it's woven in with a lot of um psychological and emotional issues yeah yeah okay um what are a few things that you do Andor avoid in light of what you know about these endocrine disruptors and by the way it goes without saying that you're in spectacular cognitive and physical shape uh for any age but it's it's really remarkable I I feel comtable sharing this because someone else published it online recently you are soon to enjoy your what birthday 89th 89th birthday amazing and um with all the talk about longevity cognitive and physical longevity everyone's thinking including me like what does she do well she avoids all these endocrine disruptors um and she has a wonderfully rich life of curiosity and other things um but yeah what are some other things that you do uh and and avoid in light of what you know for which there may or may not be a control old study but I think we're all just curious we'll frame this as what you do so water our water I worry about the water I studied water for a long time in my past life so we actually distill our water so we have a tabletop distiller um my husband Steven cleans it out there's a lot of gunk in it by the way even though it's San Francisco that has clean water at the end of the day after you've distilled the water there's a lot of gun so you distill the water so this is not reverse osmosis distilling okay yeah so it's steamed distilled and then it condenses in a glass container and then we put that in glass containers in the fridge and so and it tastes really good by the way really really somebody was just over and and he said this tastes like melted snow I thought it was lovely and you use that for drinking for coffee for tea for cooking too if you make rice you're using distill actually no no but for ice cubes and you know whenever I can think about it we can't use too much cuz you be too busy always but he does it once a day that it's just the two of us so water is important um we try to leave our shoes at the door tell me about that one well dust that you bring in um contains a lot of the particularly the posos chemicals and uh so that's actually um I'm not 100% good on that but we try try to do that um and I'm careful with the products I put on my face I check them out the way I suggested you know environmental working group um and I go to the farmers market I always buy organic always buy organic um but I know that's a cost issue for some people um and an availability issue for some people but I in San Francisco you can do that um some areas where I don't do more of what I should I think I'm starting to be aware of the um chemicals and clothing we haven't talked about that but um there's a turns out there's a lot of particularly in it's a problem for workout wear because you're absorbing so much you're sweaty you're hot and you're bringing these chemicals into your body and that may be one of the interventions that we do uh get a bunch of athletes to use um safe clothing and and traditional clothing and see what their body burden is that's how you know so um airing toward cotton as AO as opposed to synthetic material right right and the dyes are important so you you don't want you want maybe plant-based dyes it's not my area of expertise I have a colleague who I work with on this and I'll go with her advice but but um I'm just saying that's another area that I think people will soon be paying attention to um there's also the area that is much more difficult which is what's in building materials and Furniture but um a lot of these posos and the tens are in our furniture and in our building materials and trying to think about how to build I was asked about safety in a new Village that's being built in California by the way and um it's really challenging to think about if you were going to do this right and you were going to build a town that was toxic free how would you do that I'm thinking about that I'm thinking about the opener of The Simpsons and doing the exact opposite where like in the opener of the The Simpsons there's like a three-eyed fish and there's the the chemical plant and I'm just thinking you just look at the opener of The Simpsons you do the inverse of everything that's there the inverse of everything that's there including alcohol intake um uh you know which is um robust on The Simpsons um yeah right but it interesting so and when it comes to food sourcing like of but non-fruit non-vegetable food sourcing is there anything we can do I mean it's so hard for people to get eggs from farms I mean you can if you go to a farmers's market but this stuff can get pretty tricky pretty expensive and most people listening are not not going to be you know living in somoma where they might have a a neighbor that has chickens or something yeah um it's it's it's a hard problem it is a hard problem and and I think maybe people asking for it more would help I don't know I mean in San Francisco I'm lucky because I can just get you know just on the phone fresh direct order the and I know it's okay um but um I know that's not the case everywhere so um I think being aware honestly is a really big step if you're aware that this is something you want to change you will find ways to change it it's interesting because a few years back there was a lot of discussion about dyes in uh children's toys in particular toys um from overseas right remember kids are not you know babies are always gnawing on stuff and teeing and and and there was a lot of attention like hey like what's in these sippy cups and my understanding is uh toys and sippy cups and my understanding is that bpas were banned from sippy cups thit excuse me based on my work based on your work thank you so much thank you for the clarification truly and and for and for the work that led to that um we we have this um innate thankfully uh innate reflex to protect our young as does every most every species um thank goodness and we know that baby skin is more absorbent than older skin we know and so there there are literally laws in place and restrictions in place to make sure that some this stuff is minimized in young kids but then we sort of after age 12 we're kind of like okay well it's a free-for-all it depends on your budget where you go and so we we can't rely on governing bodies to to do this um but I think it's a useful conversation especially given your relationship to um Scandinavia which is a fun one to elaborate on to illustrate some of the discrepancy between the US and Europe what sorts of chemicals are banned in Europe in food in lotion Etc that you're aware of that are prominent here in the US maybe that's a good filter to to place some of this Choice making through Europe has a has had a policy called reach and under reach you have to show that a chemical is safe before it's put into the marketplace not so what the way our system is here is put in the marketplace and then if somebody gets worried about it they might do a study they might find harm remember how long it took me to find that thide connection it was 10 years two studies 10 years $10 million by the way so if you're going to wait for that I don't know what you know given the number of chemicals out there 80,000 or more um forget it you know so so I think the reach policy of testing before something's put in the market is making a big difference in Europe and that's I think that's one reason why they're much better off are those are those animal tests um or animal and human tests that they're doing over there whatever defin safety it depends on the chemical it depends on you know what the product is I I can't answer that in general but so that be a good Avenue for changing legislature here right to to install something similar to reach absolutely but it's not going to happen I don't think no no because there's too many forces against that it's very very hard for manufacturers to make changes I I'll give you one example um so you know that you might not know but should know that thids are very prevalent in the hospital setting there're if you think of a tube you know to to dialysis to chemotherapy to IV that's all PL that's all phids right and that's going into your body and there was a recently um a bill passed in California that DP could not be in IV bags it's fantastic success in the actual bag yes the bags could not contain these endocrine disruptors yes DP specifically dehp diyl hexalite the most anti-androgenic Thal so so that was a great step for for but that's like one chemical right in one product and that was a battle so you see how hard it is to do this extremely hard there's a company bbrw which makes Hospital products and they are very forward-thinking and they set up a a factory in Florida to make alternative IV bags out of another product um poly oan and and the problem is that we're not sure about the safety of polyphant so it's a it gets really difficult you know you can say remove dhp but now we scientists have to say what does it mean for a chemical to be safe and we don't know that I don't mean to dissolution you and your your listen you know that's a that's a huge challenge that we're up against we know it's safer we know it's safer and we know what the Bad actors are and we know things we don't want to be exposed to but we have to be careful when we think about what do we want to put in instead is that yeah yeah I I'm thinking about this a former um president of Stamford who was also happen to be a family friend years ago um he since passed Don Kennedy when he retired as president Stanford went in my understanding is that he went and directed the FDA and I was just thinking to myself like um when did thisen happen um because I know he was super into Health he was like an avid Runner he was very fit well into his 70s yeah hit replacement kept running or maybe it was knee replacement I don't know the guy was obsessed with health and so I don't think that um there's there's a lack of interest in health at the level of things like the FDA and um but there's clearly a problem and I'm just trying to think of solutions and it seems to all boil down to what we can take control of in our home like when we go to a restaurant it's challenging to know like what they're doing in the kitchen and and and at some point it becomes neurotic to you know although I know people that won't go to restaurants where they use seed oils there's this whole new thing cropping up about avoiding seed oils um but maybe uh they they're more significant issues who knows um the seed oil crowd is pretty pretty intense um and I like olive oil anyway so I air to that but I think if people are interested Ed in limiting their exposure to these endocrine disruptors one of the key questions that's going to come up again and again especially in light of PCOS and sperm counts is we can't control what happened to us during pregnancy right but once we have some sense of agency over what we put into our body and how we put it into our body do you think that there's a that there's um plasticity and resilience to this system so you know God forbid if somebody was exposed to a lot of these things early on can they you know by making changes can they can they rescue themselves to any degree no so it's really just dependent on what your parents did yes that's not to say that your own exposure cannot change things further and make things worse but here here's a here's a fact if a male's mother smokes when he's in the womb then he has a this is a Danish study by the way 50% reduction in sperm count if his mother smoke while he was in the womb how much smoking are we talking I don't know I don't remember but the the the reason I bring this up is because there's nothing he can do to change that okay if he smokes as an adult he has I think a similar reduction the sperm count he can stop and his sperm will be res restored he can get a sperm Health back but whatever happened in the womb stays in the womb if you will it's developmental it's not going to you know it's going to be be there for life and that's true of the brain as well so um I think anybody who's thinking of conceiving a pregnancy or pregnant has a responsibility to really learn how to reduce their exposure because these things are by the way passed on for several Generations it's your child and your child's child because this germ cells for your grandchild are going to be carried in within your child so germ cell are um not germs as in infectious germs it's the cells that will produce the egg and sperm that germinate hence hence the word germ right so it's a huge responsibility and I think people should take it very seriously um that they have you know they're going to be affecting the health of subsequent gener some Labs say it's seven generations I don't know if that's true but certainly three generations um are affected and um so I should mention my book can I mention please I'll mention yeah I believe I mentioned it in my introduction but yeah please so in in uh countdown uh two words by the way because if you say countdown one word you won't find it but countdown um we have two chapters on things you can do you very practical things you can do and also websites you can go to and links you can go to now this came out in um a while ago so 21 so there are many more things now but I think it's a good start how lonely are you in this expedition of identifying endocrine disruptors in food in pesticides in um in the sorts of things you're talking about like is there a whole field of this of of excellent people are you are you a small team of of of people that are against the grain I I mean I confess I don't know many people doing the sorts of work that you're doing but I you know you're the the most public facing and prominent and um I I my question is like is the NIH funding a lot of this sort of thing absolutely it's we're an army and it's not and it's International and there is now um a global um Plastics treaty under negotiation by the way tell us about the Plastics treaty people are trying to create get ped by various countries um an international Plastics treaty I can't I don't want to talk a lot about it I'm not involved in that process but in the process you they you could see if you looked into there hundreds of scientists and concerned citizens and activists and you know people in legislation who are working to specifically on the chemicals and plastic now plastic is really a bad actor I I but it is not the only bad actor so I want to just mention that plastic is really important but you know pesticides are not plastic and and and so on so there are many other classes that you have to worry about but certainly controlling our exposure to plastic is huge and um though you asked about scientists in this area yes there's huge amount of science going on for this in this there's um and it's funded by NIH and it's funded by um the EU and um primarily I think those are the two two funders of Scandinavia has funding within you know in Scandinavian countries so there's a lot of work and a lot of very good people working really hard but it's a huge problem and it's been here since well plastic started to rise in popularity in 1950 so we have like 75 years to battle against and it's not going down anytime soon lifespan is increasing pretty significantly presumably in large part because of the red ction and smoking um and control of Infectious Disease and Control of infectious diseases um but lifespan is definitely increasing um whereas the use of plastics has clearly increased um and so uh I guess one could argue that we're living longer but we are less robust than we were less um reproductively competent is that uh the people that are reflected in that longer lifespan were not necessarily exposed early in life which is when it's most critical so you know I was born in 1936 there was no plastic then there was no you know um and there were other things of course but it not as they are today so um I don't think that you can make the inference that because we're living longer plastic growth you know the growth of the Plastics industry is somehow driving that longevity absolutely not absolutely not I think what it's driving is decrease in fertility and what's happening is that the shift in populations is pretty dramatic we're getting you know the pyramid used to be like this I'm I'm making a triangle with my arms showing very few people on top and a lot of people on the bottom but what's happening is that that's getting inverted so we're getting more and more people on top and fewer and fewer people on the bottom birth rates are way down birth rats are way down and and so this is a an enormous problem for societies because the people in that small support group at the bottom can't drive the society to support the L the large growth on top you see what saying is this true in other countries as well yes absolutely absolutely it's all over the world and and the decline in fertility in my mind is probably well one of the biggest challenges we're facing now because um it's everywhere it's very acute and there's only limited things we can do to to to counter it um there's a wonderful website called it's by the World Bank put out by the World Bank it's called fertility data and if you go in there you can see what is the fertility rate every year but you can put in you know plug in a country or a year or you and see what the f fertility rate in each country in the world each year and you can see that and what you see is that um a decline about the same rate as sperm decline by the way about 50% in 50 years and um the critical point for fertility is two so what's that mean that's called replacement and that's two people replace themselves with a total fertility rate of two actually 2.1 because you have a little bit of loss but 2.1 you're good to go Society when you fall below that you're shrinking and there are many countries in the world that are below that including the United States and for example the worst I've seen is actually South Korea which is at 0.78 wow Japan is at one wow so large parts of the world are just not replacing themselves and why that is is maybe another discussion but or we can talk about it I don't know if you want to go go into that but um it's not just sperm count for sure yeah along those lines let's talk about egg count and quality uh you mentioned the PCOS results earlier um before we were on Mike uh you mentioned an interesting study that you did about the use of electric blankets um and assessing whether or not the use of electric blankets had impacted um egg number or quality in women and the answer was it actually what we looked at in women I'm sorry to correct you but was their the outcome of their pregnancy their fertility and and what if they got pregnant how how did that turn out excuse me so thank you for that clarification but but um I'm sure there' be a lot of other studies that have looked at that you know I I just have been away from that field for a long time but so far I don't see convincing evidence that the use of cell phones or um you know other exposures to electromagnetic radiation are affecting our pregnancies and our fertility that's not to say it's not happening but I have not looked at it and I don't like to make statements about things I haven't looked at my understanding of the cell phone data uh for sperm uh count and motility AKA quality um is I discussed amended analysis uh covering this on the podcast previously is that there are some heat effects of cell phone use and keeping the phone in the pocket that may that may I want to be careful here impact um sperm count and and motility uh quality but um Direct effects of of emfs on sperm there's no evidence that it is disrupting sperm at least to my knowledge I honestly I have to say just going to say I don't know but I do know that um heat is related to fertility and sperm count right and um you can look at the birth rates as a function of the month of conception and you can see that for example in war months in war climates uh there's less yeah so there he he does play a role but how much that's tied to cell phone use I I think that's something that's now under investigation by a lot of groups and um we'll see what they find yeah the data on sitting more than a few hours a day on um having legs that are very large as a consequence of obesity or even just legs that are large uh heating the the scrotom and th those data are fairly um I would say solid in terms of the relationship to reducing sperm count um heat is not good for sperm which is why the scrotum has its um the features that it does to move the the testicles further or um closer to the body um getting back to egg um egg count and quality there's some evidence that um girls are entering puberty earlier um but that uh women are also undergoing perimenopause menopause earlier earlier um do we do we know what that is the consequence of there are several new papers actually on the menopausal age showing relation to a number of chemicals but I can't quote them to you right now I don't remember which class it was that they looked at but um I think that's right I think there is growing evidence that earlier you know fewer it's also called premature ovarian failure um so that women are just not producing the eggs as long as they used to yeah but um [Music] um the I just want to say something about the fertility can we go back to fertility please um so when this comes up and there I'm sure you've seen the literature there's a lot of literature on this that say fertility is going down you know fewer children are being born a people say well that's a good thing because it's less of a load on the planet which is an another discussion and then they say well this is due to choice that people are choosing to have fewer children and they're choosing to um delay childbearing till they're no longer as fertile uh they're using more contraception women are more educated they're entering the workforce all of these social factors are given as the reason for decline in fertility and um I just need to point out whenever I hear this that it's not just human fertility that's declining um the number of species that are becoming extinct is increasing rapidly and there is there have been for at least 40 years evidence that those pesticides that affect us are affecting animals as well and um so the decline in fertility in non-human species cannot be attributed to delayed childbearing or use of contraception right right and it's interesting because um we hear we usually hear first about species that are about to go extinct that are badly endangered I don't know what the proper language is but is about to go distinct um like the Florida panther right or you know we we hear that you know there the species of like there's a very small subset of them left uh the blackf footed ferrets in Montana I think one feret his name is um Scarface SED something like 300 lit that then led to the EV they started out outbreeding because if you do too much inbreeding obviously it's not good and but then they were able to at least partially recover maybe fully recover the those populations and people forget the the domino effect of these ecosystems when one species is compromised like when the black-footed ferrets I know it might sound kind of silly but um were compromised in terms of their populations the prairie dog population went up the grasses were getting eaten far more and then there's all these Downstream consequences you on bugs and you know and I'm not an expert in this but one doesn't have to be an expert to understand like you you move one pin here and and the whole web moves and um and so or you move one node and the and the whole web uh reconfigures and um and that's what Nature has been doing for millions of years right but um at some point it is conceivable no pun intended that we are going to be the species on the endangered species list right I mean that's that's not like a an outrageous sci-fi movie like right like at some point humans might be added to the endangered species with the exception that we have we're very clever and so we found a lot of ways to do medically assisted you know conception right ixie the the the literally you Gentle grabbing of one sperm and forcing it to con to uh to um fertilize the egg um is something we've covered on this podcast in our fertility episode with Natalie Crawford in a Solo episode that I did um there are questions that people have reasonable questions about whether or not the um The Offspring of those types of scenarios are the same as the right the the genetic um probability experiment as you mentioned before of having you know 200 million sperm and then letting Nature Select the one that is most um robust in that environment yeah and and you know the number of Technologies is increasing we're very clever species and and um for example I don't know if you've heard of gam Genesis so it is now possible to create um an embryo from a a sperm cell from a skin cell skin cell can produce um uh a sperm cell and an egg cell and you give it the right transcription factors and you can you can um so this is kind of interesting exciting and scary right this is like the the um what is it I think the vulture vultures the females uh there's some way in which two female vultures or maybe a single female vulture can um create Offspring in the absence of a male there's also a three-party IVF I don't know if you're aware of this where this was um developed where there's a mitochondrial disease you can take the uh two eggs one from the intended mother you take the nucleus so you get the DNA you put it into an egg of somebody that um where the DNA has been removed but where the spindles which are rich with mitochondria are from a typically a much younger host and then he use a sperm so it's actually three parents it's the spindle of one mom the DNA of another mom and a sperm they do this in the UK for mitochondrial disease it's still illegal in the United States as far as I understand and it's done in other countries um and in theory legal issues must be yeah but and but in theory this would allow women of any age provided they can they still have eggs um to have their DNA propagated forward because they could the DNA can be put into a younger egg that is um has the spindle quality that allows for um you know the production of more cells I mean this is this Canon has been done in humans yeah yeah so we're I mean you and I won't think of all the things that will be developed you know in the next 10 20 years to CH you know to meet the challenge of declining fertility by ordinary conception I mean I think that's that's how we're going to solve this problem for us we're going to just be smarter and smarter about how to do a medically assisted um conception and and and then the question is going to be and it'll take time to know this is whether there are effects in The Offspring adverse effects in The Offspring um it's it's a little tricky because for example if you use the sperm of an infertile couple and you see let's say say the sun is is subfertile that's born that way um but you do it you know in a test tube or whatever and then you can say well maybe um that's because the father was infertile and he's got inheritance from his father from that you know you know what I'm saying so you can't know whether the if you see an adverse effect in in an offspring you have to be very careful that it's not something that they've gotten because of problems that led the couple to seek assisted reproduction you see you follow me yep y yeah um super challenging fascinating problem so in anticipation of this sitdown together uh I put a question out on X formerly known as Twitter um I let people know that I was hosting an expert in endocrine disruptors in phalates and pesticides rep productive uh implications Etc and I asked for questions and they came up with a huge number of excellent questions many of which you've already answered things like um is tap water safe what can we do to our tap water you mentioned you distill water my understanding is that reverse osmosis provided there's re mineral remineralization excuse me difficult word to say can also be effective Etc um there were a lot of questions about um cosmetics and laundry Det detergents um I don't know if we discussed laundry detergents what do you use in terms of laundry detergent um or that is presumably one can find I don't even remember okay don't go by my product okay for one thing I'm not going to be pregnant anytime soon no um the uh I I believe there are some solutions um related to the uh like instead of bleach people can use um hydrogen peroxide can't speak about specific products actually um you know I can tell you who can you might like to talk to her so you remember I mentioned million marker the company that did the inventory not the comp well they are a company but um so they look at million marker I think you'd be interested okay yeah and and and the person who runs at Genoa is a Chinese American um who uh and a friend of mine and we're going to be writing a grant together um and she participated in the film so our participants send their so what if you go to million marker you log on and if you agree to pay whatever it is $199 I think you send your urine in they give you a kit you send your urine in and they test it for all these things in your urine so you know what's in your body you might want to think about it might be interesting and and then if you pay another 100 I think you get these this counseling and so blah BL you can see the different levels of but she knows all about products I don't know about product because it's a moving Target I don't and also I don't like to talk about product names because it sounds like I'm endorsing them so um right and we won't um expect you to give product names and um I'll follow your recommendation that you just gave um somebody asked about food dyes just generally the dieses in Foods I saw an incredible study recently that Science magazine covered so Science magazine very reputable of course yellow number five I forget what the precise name is but the thing that makes Cheetos really bright they put it on the bellies of adult mice and it literally makes them translucent oh yeah I saw you can see the organs saw that it's wild it's so scary I sent it to Rogan and he uh I won't he was like whoa his his version of wo um I was like I also said wo he probably said holy right um no he no no I'm not going to say what it said but it was he didn't curse there were a number of questions about household items again not looking for specific products but for instance soaps body wash cleaning sprays floor cleaners laundry related cleaners do any or all of these contain endocrine disruptors unless one is careful to to find the ones that don't okay um receipts how serious is it should we be concerned about the bpas and other end endocrine disruptors on receipts yes so and my suggestion is just ask for an electronic receipt MH and then you don't have to deal with it yeah but they're definitely absorbed you know into your body any impact of um endocrine disruptors of the sort we've talked about today on the thyroid system yes presumably in the in the bad Direction not yeah I mean this is an interesting point let me just say another word about it so um the there was a ongoing study in the Pharaoh Islands off Denmark and they studied posos chemicals and showed that um people who fished there there were Fisher people and they they ate the fish and they were getting high levels of posos in their body and had um this is published um effects on their um immune response so my concern and I don't know if anyone's looked at this is given everyone's vaccination like our our is our response to vaccination now altered by these chemicals I don't know but I think it's a really interesting question but there there is a whole field of the effect of these chemicals on the thyroid system and there's a lot of evidence that it's adverse can these endocrine disruptors be detoxed from the body is there anything that we can do what's the quickest ways um things like sweating um are there ways to improve liver clearance of these endocrine disruptors that the answer to that depends on the class of chemicals so the chemicals that are water soluble in particular the photes and the bisphenols leave the body in a matter of hours you don't have to do anything you just have to stop taking them in right the forever chemicals the um posos chemicals pesticides are and though but so it has to do with how they're handled by the body are they put into the you know if they're water soluble you pee them out if they're fat Sol soluble they're going to be around for a long time so it just depends on the chemical structure of the chemic of the the compound there was a question about non-stick pans you covered that earlier if someone had to pick between non-stick coated pans versus seasoned iron pans no question iron there's no risk associated with SE seasoned iron panss a number of other questions such as why does Europe have such more stringent laws Etc um lots of questions about atrazine questions about ointments and fragrances you've covered and I I must say that um as I scroll through these hundreds of questions if not more um you've done an amazing job at um clarifying for us what's known what is not known and essentially where it's a probably should avoid definitely avoid and look we just we just don't know right um and well you know there I have to distinguish between we don't just don't know and I just don't know it's not I mean there are many things that I don't know sure it's a huge field so you know maybe with some you know ask the question of chat gpg yeah we we'll be certain to um ask chat GPT and we will be certain to ask um uh other experts in in these areas but um I just want to make very clear I and everyone listening and watching truly appreciate the work that you've been doing in this area for a number of years we're so grateful that you took that Airline flight with your this chemist um that you mentioned um that you stored the urine of those pregnant women that you analyzed it and that you've gone down this path of of exploring you know things that are really disruptive to our health and potentially to the existence of our species as um you know as we talked about earlier there is the possibility that we go extinct um not because of a meteor but because we fail to replace ourselves um and that we fail to replace ourselves because we destroy our biological ability to replace ourselves I think it's hard for people to um internalize that very real possibility because we feel ourselves sitting in traffic with thousands of other people and go there's too many people right this kind of thing but um I want to thank you for the work that you've been doing and continue to do for your willingness to write books and to educate the public on podcasts like this and others because um these are topics that are pretty emotionally loaded for people I don't think anything gets people quite as inflamed as the idea that what they've been been ingesting and exposed to um especially in terms of consumables that they've spent their hard-earned money on have been um harming them harming them and their offspring and generations to follow that there's something that really lands deep in in that way but you you've also offered us a lot of um possibility and a sense of agency over these these things and I love um that you weave your math and statistics and probability uh Theory background into all of this because what comes through is um intense curiosity intense rigor and a real desire to do good so thank you so much for joining us and please come back again as you make more discoveries it's been really fun thank you for joining me for today's discussion with Dr shaa Swan to learn more about her work and to find a link to her excellent books on these topics please see the links in the show note captions

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Bill Eddie Bill Eddie is a practicing lawyer a professional mediator a licensed therapist and on the faculty of the School of Law at Pepperdine University he is a world expert in conflict resolution in particular how to resolve conflicts with what are called high conflict personalities I should be very clear that these high conflict personalities as you'll learn today are not in a category of so-called personality disorders now it is the case that people with high conflict personalities often also have borderline personality disorder narcissistic personality disorder or suffer from bipolar depression however as you'll soon learn people who have this high conflict personality type could fall into any one of those three different categories any combination of them or none of them at all these high conflict personalities essentially come in two flavors some are very outwardly combative they like to argue they like to generate conflict in a way that's very overt very obvious the others which comprise about 50% of high confli personality types are very passive they play the victim or they leverage other people so-called negative advocates in order to achieve their goal of creating a lot of conflict where they always appear as the victim during today's discussion you'll learn how to identify these high conflict personality types based on some very simple questions that you can ask yourself about them he also explains how to deal with these people in the workplace setting in relationships and importantly of course how to disengage from these people not just in the short term but permanently now across today's discussion you'll realize that bill Eddie is very sensitive both to the suffering that high conflict personalities cause for other people and therefore how to identify them avoid them in engage from them but he also makes it a point not to demonize these high conflict personality types instead as a mediator as a lawyer and as a therapist he is really most interested in helping people resolve their conflicts with these people and find the best most peaceful path forward for conflict resolution Dr Bill Eddie is the author of several important books related to this topic and related topics such as five types of people that can ruin your life it's an excellent book I've read it and I highly recommend it for everyone one he's also written books about adult bullies which are becoming increasingly common online and in real life and about mediating conflict resolution and separations and things like divorce and in Family Court situations where he spent a lot of his professional career as a lawyer by the end of today's episode you will have a lot of New Practical tools for being able to identify these high conflict personality types and learning how to navigate forward and frankly away from them in the best way possible before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Maui neui venison Maui Nei venison is 100% wild harvested venison from the island of Maui and it is the most nutrient dense and delicious red meat available I've spoken before on this podcast about the fact that most of us should be consuming about one gram of quality protein per pound of body weight every day that protein provides critical building blocks for things like muscle repair and synthesis but it also promotes overall health given the importance of muscle tissue as an organ eating enough quality protein each day is also a terrific way to Stave off hunger one of the key things however is to make sure that you're getting enough quality protein without ingesting excess calories Maui NY venison has an extremely high quality protein per calorie ratio so that getting 1 gram of quality protein per pound of body weight is both easy and doesn't cause you to ingest an excess of calories also mauii venison is absolutely delicious they have venison steaks ground venison and venison bone broth I personally like all of those in fact I probably eat a Maui Nei venin Burger pretty much every day and occasionally I'll swap that for a Maui Nei steak and if you're traveling a lot or you're simply on the go they have Maui Nei venison sticks which have 10 gram of protein per stick at just 55 calories and they're extremely convenient you can can pretty much take them anywhere if you'd like to try Maui Nei venison you can go to mauii venison docomo to get 20% off your membership or first order again that's Maui venison docomo today's episode is also brought To Us by expressvpn expressvpn is a virtual private Network that keeps your data secure and private it does that by routing your internet activity through their servers and encrypting it so that no one can see or sell your data now I'm familiar with the effects of not securing my data well enough several years ago I had one of my bank accounts hacked and it was a terrible amount of work to have that reversed and for the account to be secured when that happened I talked to my friends in the tech community and what they told me was that even though you think your internet connection may be secure oft times it's not especially if you're using Wi-Fi networks such as those on planes in hotels at coffee shops and other public places surprisingly even at home your data might not be as secure as you think to make sure that what I described before would never happen to me again I started using expressvpn the great thing about expressvpn is that I don't even notice that it's running since the connection it provides is so fast I have it on my computer and on my phone and I keep it on whenever I'm connected to the internet with expressvpn I know everything is secure my web browsing all my passwords all my data and of course anything that's behind an account wall like a bank account it can't be tracked and no one can access or steal your data which is terrific if you'd like to start protecting your internet activity using expressvpn you can go to expressvpn / huberman and you can get an extra 3 months free again that's expressvpn.com huberman to get an extra 3 months free and now for my discussion with Bill Eddie Bill Eddie welcome thanks so much for having me I'm excited to discuss this with you I've read your books I learned about them from perhaps one of the smartest people I know she said you should check out this book called five types of people that can ruin your life I said well that's an impressive title and I tore through the book um learned a ton you have a number of other books I mentioned them in my introduction and I suppose it's appropriate to say that you are an expert in conflict conflict resolution and in particular how to deal with people that are high conflict so maybe you could just tell us what a high-c conflict person is how common are these people and how does this overlap with some of the more traditional quote unquote diagnosis of personality disorders yeah it's fascinating because I started out as a clinical social worker working with children and families and psychiatric hospitals outpatient clinics but I really like conflict resolution so I went to law school to get a law degree so I could do mediation other conflict resol olution and I practiced family law and when I started in Family Court I noticed right away that a lot of the conflicts seem to be driven by people's personalities rather than the legal issue because I was also doing mediation in my office I go to court in the morning do mediation in the afternoon same exact issues in the morning people were stuck for two or three years in the afternoon two or three mediation sessions shook hands went separate ways so in Family Court a lot of people aren't familiar with this but since the 1980s there's been the use of the term high conflict families and Family Court Lawyers judges mediators therapists identified high conflict families as repeatedly coming to court to make decisions as having a lot of hostility of just seeming driven in One Direction unable to be flexible and in many ways unable to truly have empathy for their kids so they'd fight over their kids and so high conflict families was a term when I became a lawyer in 1993 I was like wait a minute these aren't high conflict families these have maybe one maybe two people with high conflict personalities or traits of personality disorder which I knew about since 1980 and working in hospitals and outpatient clinics because you're also a clinical psychologist clinical social worker clinical social worker so I got a master's in social work in 1981 then I became I got licensed to do therapy on my own so I'm a licensed clinical social worker in California I can diagnose disorders I can do treatment without supervision I went through that and that's how I became licensed so when I came into Family Court I go this is the same patterns when I was working say with people in the psychiatric hospital who had addictions depression all these problems and my job as the hospital social worker was to help them with their outside problem their family problem so I did family counseling for the patients um with their job maybe their employer wanted to fire them because of their behavior and I tried to help keep their job um um maybe they were getting evicted their landlord couldn't stand their behavior and I'd solve one problem and I go I'm I've got you into marriage counseling and your your husband or wife's committed to working on the relationship and I'd go yay I accomplished something next day Bill my landlord wants to kick me out okay I'd convince their landlord to give them one more chance yay Bill my job wants to fire me can you help what they have is a pattern of conflict behavior that doesn't get resolved and that's the high conflict families that I saw in family court so that's where that connection came from which I would not have arrived at if I hadn't been a therapist and also a lawyer my understanding from reading your book is that this high conflict personality phenotype is equally distributed between men and women what is the percentage of people that have this high conflict phenotype and then maybe we can drill into a little bit of how that shows up it's different forms of expression yeah well let me say a little bit about the difference between high conflict personalities and personality disorders because we have a lot of research on personality disorders including statistics which I'll give you we don't have a lot of research on high conflict personalities people have talked about it like I said since the 1980s in family court and my own observations with thousands of cases um of high conflict personalities is it's pretty much men and women my law practice I represented pretty much 50/50 uh men and women mostly custody disputes mothers and fathers so I got a good impression personality disorders there's a lot of research on and and I mentioned in the book some statistics and they came from the personality disorder research so what they found they studied the 10 personality disorders in the early 2000s a big study National Institutes of Health um the alcoholism subdivision of NIH they wanted to see how prevalent personality disorders were with substance abuse with domestic conflicts with criminal Behavior behavior and workplace conflicts and so this study they looked at all 10 personalities came up with numbers for each five of them seem prone to high conflict Behavior so these five I can give you statistics on and I can give you breakdown male and female all from 20 years ago big study because it hasn't been repeated since so basically cluster B that's uh narcissistic borderline antisocial histrionic but we see a lot of paranoid in legal disputes and some research says paranoid personality disorder is the most likely to sue their employer of the personality disorders so that's gotten attention to so here's some numbers first of all narcissistic personality disorder they found found was about 6% of adults in the United States they found the statistics on that was 38% female and 62% male so that's more heavily male 20 years ago could be different now because of environmental influences borderline also about 6% this was 53% female 47% male almost 50/50 and that shocked the mental health world because we've always thought of borderline as a female disor but Marshall lahan the big name in treatment for borderline says she agrees she thinks that's true and I think that's true as a family lawyer because a lot of the men that we see engaged in demestic violence seem to have the borderline personality pattern and the domestic violence is much more male than female then um antisocial it's around 4% and that's about 75% male 25% female histrionic it's about 2% and they found this is about 5050 which again surprised people because you think drama center of attention all of that but and this may be very much environmental influence our culture today teaches especially young men to try to get attention do you know ride your skateboard behind a car or jump off a building do all these dramatic things to get attention or social media and social Medi really encourage that everyone wants attention and now you kind of have to fight for it in our culture and so men as well as women are getting out there often in dramatic ways so it came out about 50/50 paranoid it's about 4% came out uh I think it was 57 to 43% somewhere right around that a little more heavily female but not all that far apart altogether it's really roughly 5050 very interesting and how does this high conflict personality cut through all these personality disorder phenotypes um because oh and I should also ask I could imagine that some people who are borderline perhaps are also histrionic is that possible to fall into multiple categories okay and and the study actually broke down some of that so in the research they particularly one that I remember is borderline and narcissis and it came out around 38% overlap so and I teach people who are borderline also can often be narciss have narcissistic personality disorder I see and so this is personality disorder overlap now there's a whole Continuum here so many people have traits but don't have a disorder the current DSM says the total personality disorders is around 10% now that's taking an average of studies from around the world the study I quoted earlier in the US said 15% have a personality disorder so in in in the US we're seeing that's that significant that's the one that said 38% overlap Border Lines and narcissists I think that's that it fits for me because when I teach lawyers from my own experience I can say you have a client that comes on like a narcissist they're very self-centered and putting you down saying they're Superior here's some tips to deal with them but they also may have wide mood swings which is more associated with borderline so you need to butter up their ego honestly not you know praise them for something that's real that they did but also they really need empathy they have white mood swings that's someone that needs a lot of empathy and say wow I can see how upset you are this is so important and they calm down so you have to use both sets of responses to deal with someone that has that com combination you mentioned borderline and hisonic there's a lot of similarities so we see over overlap with that but I've seen every combination but what I don't know in family court is is it the disorder or just traits and the disorder doesn't matter to me it's the pattern that matters because if i' see this pattern I know I should do that that's the key I can imagine that in family court it's especially complicated given that some of these things not all but some of these have a genetic component certainly a situational component so you could potentially be dealing with um trying to work out a situation for the benefit of children that have some of the same personality disorders as their parents could be uh really tricky well what's interesting and it's very rewarding work when things can go well when the lawyers get it the judge gets it the uh everyone gets it what's happening they can make orders that fit the situation and help protect children from bad behavior and help get parents some help so like substance abuse is is a bigger issue in Family Court than personality disorders but almost neck and neck we talk about substance abuse all the time openly there's treatment everyone recognizes the signs we don't talk about personality disorders in our culture and that's like flying under the radar so AR I'm just going to pause you for a second there I think it's such a key Point um you know in a very interesting paper that you sent me which by the way I'll provide a link to in our show note captions great it essentially kicks off by saying that you know the um the movement toward explaining to people what alcoh I think they now call it alcohol use disorder alcoholism right was is in the 1970s and 80s was a crucial move forward for the judicial system yes and I think nowadays people generally understand that addiction is not just a lack of willpower right that there are brain circuits that become hijacked by substances or behaviors that these brain circuits were designed to promote our adaptive Evolution but they can be hijacked by behaviors and substances that render people really um just unable to control their their addictive behavior I think nowadays that that box is checked and it's wonderful that the judicial system understands that right because then it can work with that um I don't think that the general public has yet come to the full appreciation of these personality disorders and these high conflict personalities and how pervasive they are um probably because of their prevalence it's just sort of all around us and in all sorts of interactions and here's the question high conflict interactions tend to be quote unquote dramatic yeah and there tends to be a almost a reward for dramatic Behavior as you said online in politics in the media the more dramatic the more salience the more salience the more people click the more people watch and then the algorithms are designed to look at you know like dwell time which is nerd speak for how long people look at stuff and so you could see how this stuff could be fed in the same way that for nearly you know 75 years leading up to the 1970s alcohol use disorder was sort of fed by the culture you have your 5:00 p.m. happy hour yeah coming up in science I would go to Scientific meetings and it was like okay five o'clock hits let's all drink and I always thought this is kind of crazy especially given that there was also a lot of concern about the kinds of interactions that drinking can create in the work environment it needs to high conflict Behavior exactly so anyway I don't want to riff too long on this but first of all this is just Laing the important work that you're doing second how should we think about this high conflict personality phenotype should we be calling PE people out like you know hey that's a narcissist hey that's a uh you know that's a borderline histrionic person or is there a more um I guess something that Embraces a little bit more of the humanity and the and the real issue at hand I think that's what you're trying to do yeah absolutely and you may have seen me shaking my head no and said should we point this out to people that's the last thing you want to do in fact don't do that and the reason why is is personality disorders oh oh let me just quickly distinguish between personality disorders high conflict personalities the difference is and there's a chart in the beginning of the book with two circles overlapping a lot of overlap but the main thing about personality disorders is they're stuck in a narrow range of interpersonal Behavior so some aren't high conflict people some are thing about high conflict people is that they're preoccupied with blame that blaming others is a big part of their life so when you're dealing with a high conflict person who's blaming and has a personality disorder you get a stuck pattern of behavior you get high conflict personalities or high conflict people so they're persistent in acting that way that's the overlap with personality disorders is they don't reflect they don't change they just keep blame as everybody out there so recognizing that difference and similarity so about half of people I think with personality disorders and this is just my estimate have high conflict personalities and about half don't I've worked with Border Lines in the psych Hospital narcissist that don't blame other people narcissists that are just self-centered but and borderlines who are more frustrated with themselves than anybody else so that that's an important distinction you beautifully distinguish between high conflict personalities and these personality disorders and I just want to make sure um everyone hears again that about half of people with personality disorders would fall into this high conflict personality in my estimation I don't have research yet um and the the distinguishing feature seems to be that high conflict personalities are often or constantly casting blame on others for the difficulties of their life essentially and that's why they have conflicts that's why and they escalate instead of getting worked on and resolved so I can imagine that the high conflict person doesn't always appear as high conflict in fact this is something that you've alluded to many times already in this conversation and certainly in your book that sometimes these high conflict personalities come in kind of under the radar and that can be confusing to people or they can go undetected for a long time yeah so part of it goes with the specific personality so high conflict people with borderline personality traits or histrionic personality traits are often more openly dramatic and so they they might really shock you that suddenly they start yelling screaming uh throwing things just because you're having an average conversation very disproportionate but some and it tends to be more of the antisocial personalities some narcissistic personalities can look really reasonable on the surface and they've actually had a lifetime of experience at looking good which kind of covers up all the stuff under the surface and I think of of a couple examples so for example and I deal sometimes with domestic violence cases so let's say an abuser says in court says oh well I was helping her because she was so upset I took her keys away and I held her down on the bed cuz I was afraid she would leave and get into a car crash well there may be rare occasions where that's true but that's a common story that we get from domestic abusers um or in court I've seen this uh where there'll be a very reasonable person kind of explaining the situation and their partner more often a woman is just emotional is a mess maybe even in tears and people don't realize about 80% of divorces in court today people represent themselves and so there's these conversations and the judge is like well this guy's being really reasonable and This Woman's a mess I mean you know I'm I'm going to go with what he's saying and so a lot of stuff slips under the radar that way but gender wise it could be the reverse and a lot of relationships people get into people make themselves look look really good and then the negative stuff comes out weeks months maybe a year later so that's why we say wait a year until you decide to commit because nowadays who knows you may have someone that really is good at covering their bad behavior yeah let's hover on that one particular point because this is perhaps one of the most important takeaways from your work um could you just um spell out this first year principle um and perhaps it's useful for us to also acknowledge that yes there are a great many truly great stories about people who met one weekend two weeks later got married and then we're hearing the story 50 years later when they've got grandkids and great grandkids they thrived or people me met got engaged three months later or you know some cases got pregnant 3 months later and they have this wonderful marriage and family story to tell we hear these stories and they're really wonderful stories right I mean they they sort of uh affirm your belief in humanity when you hear those stories and they are powerful but in discussing a little bit of this with you offline you probably have witnessed more cases where people rushed and the rushing to uh commit or to create led to more problems than it did good yes and that's many many of the highight conflict divorce es that I've worked on as a lawyer and before that as a therapist and sometimes as a mediator are in my mind kind of the bad luck stories got a decent person usually my client of course but something happened they got together too fast and then all this stuff came out and I really believe in today's world that it it is a matter of luck and that's why you should take a year to find out am I did I draw the Short Straw in this relationship because I got this perfect looking person um great record all these good things but close relationships is where personality disorders come out interpersonal difficulty and the high conflict behaviors mostly close relationships so they might everyone might like them at work but when you're home alone with them they could be really terrible yelling hitting doing all of this stuff so that's why we say wait a year i' I've had a lot of cases where people tell me we just just fell in love it was beautiful and everything was wonderful for about six months and then when I committed to get married all this stuff started showing up but I got married anyway because I figured well time and love will heal everything only it didn't so in today's world there there's a higher risk of getting a high conflict relationship I must say and the description you gave is what people often tell me they say my grandparents got married a week after they met and they just celebrated their 60th anniversary they're still in love everything's wonderful your grandparents tended to know who they were marrying in today's world not only don't you know you don't have a history but high conflict people have learned to cover up the full range of who they are and they're not bad people and that's something I want to emphasize they just have a different personality and they may have been born this way but they don't come with with markings you know they don't come with the music like of Jaws do do do they look good and anybody I think is at risk of falling into a relationship like this I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 by now many of you have heard me say that if I could take Just One supplement that supplement would be ag1 the reason for that is ag1 is the highest quality and most complete of the foundational nutritional supplements available what that means is that it contains not just vitamins and minerals but also probiotics prebiotics and adaptogens to cover any gaps you may have in your diet and provide support for a demanding life for me even if I eat mostly Whole Foods and minimally processed foods which I do for most of my food intake it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits and vegetables vitamins and minerals micronutrients and adaptogens from food alone for that reason I've been taking ag1 daily since 2012 and often twice a day once in the morning or midm morning and again in the afternoon or evening when I do that it clearly bolsters my energy my immune system and my gut microbiome these are all critical to brain function mood physical performance and much more if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim their special offer right now they're giving away five free travel packs plus a year Supply a vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman to claim that special offer I definitely want to come back to this point that you made that you're not demonizing these people right you're talking about how to behave with them or how to not behave with them in some cases in order to um try and create the smoothest possible interactions in some cases no interaction but if we could um hover still a bit more on this first year idea my understanding is that no getting engaged or for that matter married no conceiving children and no moving in together in year one is are those the critical except for the last one is it's really don't commit like getting married within the first year sometimes moving in together is a good way to find out what it's like up close with this person yeah you learn a lot by living with somebody that's right that's right and personality disorders part of the definition is interpersonal dysfunction and that's close that's close relationship so if you haven't had that close relationship you don't see what happens when you leave your socks out or the Caps off the toothpaste and some little thing is some huge storm or when somebody's sleep deprived I always say you can you learn a lot about somebody after a bad night's sleep you end that right right you know but the key is patterns of behavior so one thing I want to say is everybody gets angry sometimes that's that's fine everybody yells sometimes everybody you know criticizes sometimes but if they have a pattern like their life had pattern of relationship is to yell and scream and criticize and all that whoa this pattern is probably going to keep going and as I mentioned earlier I believe with person ality disorders it's a narrower pattern of behavior so it's more pattern driven in several different settings family maybe at work when it's close maybe in the community when it's close so these are recognizable patterns as recognizable as alcoholism and addiction once people learn so that's the key give yourself some time see if this stuff comes to the surface think you're raising a really interesting point which is that although nowadays we have more information about people Available To Us by way of the internet and social media you made the comparison with our grandparents era I'm 49 years old so my grandparents actually my grandparents knew each other from the time they were like in the eth grade they eloped when they turned 18 uhuh Bo when and got married I think to the dismay of one or side or the other side of parents but then we're married more than 50 years yeah and grandkids obviously I'm one of them Etc and so you have these stories and and we we love these kinds of stories yeah but as you point out they knew each other very very well and had for a long time nowadays one can quote unquote do their research um go online and and look for things but would you argue that that's not complete information right I think it can be helpful um you know I tell people Google your partner and find out you know if there's some there that may impact you but don't don't believe that's sufficient what I say what you really want to talk to is relatives and Friends of this person and what you really want to do is see them in action with relatives and Friends Rel relatives and Friends yes CU that's close relationships that's the key this is all about close relationships and that's what catches people by surpris they say this person looks good at work some people have worked together for 10 years and maybe they were in other relationships and they both got divorced commiserated with each other they get together and it's like we've known each other for 10 years you know we're going to have a great relationship and they find out this is like a stranger almost because it's a close relationship now and that's the difference how people behave in a close relationship often triggers like personality disordered stuff fear of Abandonment fear of looking inferior fear of being dominated fear of of not getting enough attention the personality disorders seem to have excessive fears in these areas is it fair to say that if somebody has a lot of stable friendships over you know long periods of time that that's uh a good indication um that they can maintain close relationships but it seems to me you'd also want to know like what is a close friend to that person do they actually spend time with them you know um do and likewise with co-workers because some work environments that I've been in are necessarily very um uh non-personal you don't share much right whereas other environments like I know the partners of everyone I work with now at the podcast that wasn't true for my academic colleagues I knew some of my academic colleagues families I would have dinner with them Etc but some of them less so so context matters a lot yes right and and i' say you mentioned the word stability and that's really a key so if they have close friends they've had for 10 20 30 years that's a really good sign um bad signs are I don't want you talking to my family they're evil people they'll say terrible things about me you can't trust them they'll end up they'll turn on you they'll hate you all this stuff you can't even ever talk to my I can't even let you know who my family is and what their emails and phone numbers are oh goodness that's a warning sign yeah definite warning sign because everyone has conflict with family members at some level but you would hope that one could um would feel comfortable allowing you to like interact with their family yeah and if you if your family is really difficult introduce your partner to your family and let them see this is a difficult family and this is why I had to distance from them because a lot of people to be healthy do have to get some more distance but it's that secretiveness it's the um just secrets in general are not a good thing for relationships you that's that's the biggest piece that's missing in a way compared to 50 years ago when people knew all there it was hard to have family secrets 50 years ago now even though people may be all over the Internet you might really know their secrets and that's what you need to find out what about advocates so you know I'm familiar with some high conflict individuals um some are more of the combative type others are more of the kind of um what did you call it sort of quiet manipulative victim playing type and um both seem to be pretty good at generating Advocates um I guess you call these negative Advocates people that will fight for them yes right by the way this is all sounding a lot like modern politics um uh and uh we'll get into that a little bit um because it is an important reflection on what we're talking about but what about these negative Advocates if somebody has a lot of um friends or Advocates that they are kind of like on their side against that are also in a blame mode yes is that a red flag yes what's interesting and and I I I'd like to tomed day learn more the Neuroscience behind this but high conflict people have heightened emotions the cluster B personality disorders are known as dramatic emotional and erratic that's the dsm5 TR says that the manual for mental health professionals and so their heightened emotions are contagious and in general what I've learned about this work a lot is emotions are contagious and high conflict emotions are highly contagious so what happens and I see this so much as as a lawyer and with other lawyers and with therapists is the high conflict person comes into your office and says I've been terribly treated by let's say my ex you know man or woman because it happens to both been terribly treated and you've got to save me you've got to protect me you've got to win you've got to sometimes they say you have to destroy the other party that's always a Warner something when their goal is to destroy the other party it's not a good sign but they're so emotional you say my goodness this person's been through so much now I have the emotions and what I teach in my seminars is I understand has a lot to do with the amydala that the amydala catches the intense fear intense anger that those are heightened and so now mine's going oh Bill you've got to do something I'm I'm like my body wants me to take action and I want to save this person from their evil uh co-parent for example and so what we see with negative Advocates is they're emotionally hooked but uninformed they don't really know what's going on and I'll give you an example a court case with a high conflict person um brought their whole family and and I had a case with false allegations terrible allegations my client happened to be the father the mother was making false allegations of child sexual abuse and I've had all types of true cases false cases so this is a real problem a real issue but there also were false allegations in this case that's what was happening so the the mother brings her whole family and the judge realizes what's going on in the case because of the evidence presented and sanctions the mother for knowingly false allegations what is that equate to in the legal system so my client the father spent like 40 about $40,000 getting a psychological evaluation having a trial doing all of this attorney's fees and so the court made her pay $110,000 of his attorney's fees and costs so that's what the sanction is and there's a Code section that said knowingly false allegations of child abuse are a basis to make one party pay the other party's fees so she's order pay she never paid it by the way and she owned no property we weren't able to get it because she had property and other people's names but the idea was that she brought her whole family there she brought her mother mother's boyfriend she brought her roommate who was a psychology grad student who was like encouraging her oh your daughter's being abused you've got to do something these were all negative Advocates and when the judge made her ruling and spelled out the information that was very clear I mean we caught the mother lying she persuaded other people to lie for her we caught them in lie so it was a really surprisingly open case and and the family started yelling at the judge I said this is this is a crime and this is a shame and blah blah blah the judge said you take yourselves out of here immediately or I will have the BFFs take you out and that they stood up and left and shouted this is an Abomination or something like that these were the negative Advocates they didn't know what the full picture was they believed their family member who was a skilled liar I believe and this is very interesting I got to talk to her therapist a therapist she had I was released to talk to her and the therapist it was in the open was she has borderline personality disorder and that was an open thing and and the therapist said and there's something else and I said antisocial personality disorder and she said I can't say but I wouldn't disagree with you which is effectively a yes yeah and with antisocial that's where you get a lot of lying and stuff like that it's a rare case but since I have the social work background and I've had many true cases of child sexual abuse especially as a therapist I can see the difference whereas a lot of lawyers don't know what to look for but this was an exceptional case antisocial and borderline personality disorder she had a lot of traits and at first the judge was very critical of my client and us and he would had supervised contact but the supervisor said this is fascinating when the child would be exchanged the girl would like kind of walk kind of tentatively towards the father the mother dropped her and left superviser brought her to the father she was like kind of tenative she'd see the father and she'd look the mother's out of sight she jump on him laugh and have a wonderful time I do have um one uh question it's not a a litmus test qu question but do you recall from um the particular case you were just describing whether the relationship had started very quickly had they uh moved in together quickly uh decid excuse me had they decided to have children together quickly married quickly in other words um was your client oblivious um because of the rate at which he were moving and the the analogy that comes to mind is if you're moving very fast it's hard hard to read the the road signs I think he did and and what's interesting is they got together when they were quite young I think maybe she was 18 he was 20 something like that he pretty young by today's standards yeah and so excitement new all of that I'm pretty sure they did and what's interesting is they they had gotten divorced that the issue I described was an after divorce custody issue but they had gotten divorced maybe four or five years into their marriage and she assaulted him and he had the scars and all of this so he had actually custody of this girl who was 8 years old when the story I just told you happened which is also helpful because she was verbal she could describe she actually described how her mother coerced her to say things that weren't true but yeah so they got together young I think quick then they got to divorced but the patterns continued and that's one thing we see a lot of high conflict divorces keep going even after the divorce the actual divorce date is like a speed bump in the lifetime of high conflict if they have children together hence the uh weight to have children with somebody yes uh if possible yes uh you asked about emotional contagion and you made reference to the science um if I may I'll just share something that might might be of interest to you and to the listeners um you're certainly right that the amydala is a central hub for threat detection um what a lot of people don't know because it's just not discussed enough in the popular coverage of neurosciences that the amydala can learn in the sense that it's highly prone to context dependent plasticity so you know this idea that getting emotionally charged is either negative veilance like fear or positive veence like Oh I like that that's true to an extent but over time the brain changes to in some cases like the feeling of adrenaline to get a an Associated dopamine released with that but a really interesting set of brain structures that um aren't discussed enough I'll just mention because they're um because you asked about Neuroscience I had a postdoc in my laboratory by the name of hiong jong a fantastic postdoc who was looking at emotional contagion we were interested in human subjects but these were animal studies you know by one by one uh member of a species is observed and then mimicked by the another member of the species a very powerful aspect of human and non-human uh behavior and there's a structure in the brain called the claustrum most people don't know about it which seems to be critical for this and um and she did a beautiful set of experiments of showing that um when animals observed other animals either in a positive or a fear state but in this case a fear State they would or a threatened State their own clrm to anterior singulate cortex circuitry and of course amigdala etc those would light up as if they were in the experience but not to the same degree but over time what one could see was a kind of a heightening a plasticity of these circuits so that smaller um threats started to create larger internal responses that's both combining he Young's work and and other work that's come out since so um what it says is that our brains are very tuned to the emotional states of others this is good empathy for instance um but that over time we can our brains change to actually um require a lower stimulus to activate that that kind of um negative Advocate Part of ourselves yes and and so perhaps this is a good segue into a discussion about what we're observing societally now not just in terms of politics but you know it's one thing to be recruited to a camp but then once you're in the camp it turns out if you if we think about through the lens of this work it seems that it requires less um negative stuff in order to stay in that camp but want to fight more and more um strident in order to protect a cause does that make sense I think exactly and as I mentioned in my book about bullies I think polarization really demonstrates that so once you're in your group and you see the other group as not only having a different point of view but as the enemy then your brain doesn't need to work on it anymore that's case close they're the enemy the only question is what do we do now and the the research saying that when you when you talk to the people in your group rather than coming together you move farther apart and to me what's fascinating in terms of legal cases and especially in family law is you have like the family I described you have the family talking to each other you pull a lawyer into that the lawyer talks to them the lawyer gets heightened uh anger maybe or commitment to save this person and maybe you get a therapist into the picture and they all just talk to themselves they pull farther and farther apart and that's often when we have our high conflict court case they come back to court every 6 to 12 months sometimes for years I have cases where people have been in court like every year for eight or nine years and and these are cases where the divorce was done long ago what people don't realize is the worst custody disputes tend to happen after the divorce is over and I think it's because people are spending more and more time talking to their own team to their own group and that pulls them farther apart their view of the other side is worse and worse and worse and that's why I think the structure really matters so so I think politically we have we have these two different universes that not necessarily talk to each other and they really create a sense of community people are looking for community and they find it but it's fed by I think the media ecosystem everyone has their own media and so we have these two universes talking to themselves growing farther and farther apart and that's why elections don't seem to have made a difference in any of this CU elections kind of decides who does government but they don't resolve the adversarial communities and they get a lot of attention and sad to say I think our culture has shifted from government uh that Politics as about government and the details in nitty-gritty and the values of government are what's good for our group good for our country Unity citizenship we should be together in this that politics have shifted to entertainment the values of entertainment are be extreme be emotional um and entertainment's driven by drama you know for thousands of years and drama is opposing us against them and as I mentioned in the bullies book there's a terrible crisis there's an evil villain and there's a superhero and if if you have someone tell that story to their Community they will love that person so now we have two communities in politics loving themselves and hating the other and the elections don't resolve that that's a speed bump on the road to high conflict and that's not a good sign and we have to find ways to bridge the gaps and there are ways you get people onetoone talk to each other there's a lot of groups trying to say let's let's connect rather than separate and if we get too far out of balance we going to have bigger and bigger high conflict problems so we have to the more people's eyes are open to this pattern the more they can say hey I seem to be part of this group but I want to you know my neighbors think differently I'm going to listen to them it's listening that's missing I'd like to take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors function I recently became a function member after searching for the most comprehensive approach to lab testing while I've long been a fan of blood testing I really wanted to find a more in-depth program for analyzing blood urine and saliva to get a full picture of my heart health my hormone status my immune system regulation my metabolic function my vitamin and mineral status and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality function not only provides testing of over a 100 biomarkers key to physical and mental health but it also analyzes these results and provides insights from from Top Doctors on your results for example in one of my first tests with function I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood this was totally surprising to me I had no idea prior to taking the test function not only helped me detect this but offered medical doctor informed insights on how to best reduce those mercury levels which included limiting my tuna consumption because i' had been eating a lot of tuna while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens and supplementing with Knack and acetylcysteine both of which can support glut production and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels comprehensive lab testing like this is so important for health and while I've been doing it for years I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive I've been so impressed by function both at the level of ease of use that is getting the tests done as well as how comprehensive and how actionable the tests are that I recently joined their Advisory Board and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast if you'd like to try function go to function health.com huberman function currently has a weight list of over 250,000 people but they're offering Early Access to hubman lab listeners again that's function health.com huberman to get early access to function today's episode is also brought To Us by David David makes a protein bar unlike any other it has 28 gram of protein only 150 calories and 0 gram of sugar that's right 28 g of protein and 75% of its calories come from protein this is 50% higher than the next closest protein bar These Bars from David also taste incredible my favorite bar is the cake flavored one but then again I also like the chocolate flavored one and I like the berry flavored one basically I like all the flavors they're all incredibly delicious now for me personally I try to get most of my calories from Whole Foods however when I'm in a rush or I'm away from home or I'm just looking for a quick afternoon snack I often find that I'm looking for a high quality protein source and with David I'm able to get 28 gram of high quality protein with the calories of a snack which makes it very easy to hit my protein goals of 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight and it allows me to do so without taking on an excess of calories as I mentioned before they are incredibly delicious in fact they're surprisingly delicious even the consistency is great it's more like a cookie consistency kind of a chewy cookie consistency which is unlike other bars which I tend to kind of saturate on I was never a big fan of bars until I discovered David bars if you give them a try you'll know what I mean so if you'd like to try David you can go to david.com huberman again the link is davidpro docomo on the uh suggestion of my friend and former guest on this podcast two-time guest Rick Rubin um I started watching a documentary about the history of professional wrestling which everyone agrees is made up so let's just acknowledge that I recognize that um but it's a remarkable portal into some of the things that you're talking about because um it all hinges on being able to create emot responses in the crowd and just a very brief history of it as I understand and I'm by no means an expert but I took notes on this documentary as I do um take notes on most everything um they used to have good guys and bad guys good gals and bad gals yeah you know um because it's men and women's wrestling um typically not against each other although sometimes in any case there was a transition that occurred at some point where they couldn't get more excitement and um literally couldn't get more attention to the sport by having good good guys and bad guys good gals and bad gals so what they ended up doing was making everybody bad and the ratings just skyrocketed everybody bad right the the underlying premise being that both teams are cheating and so therefore they had to to behave poorly also and it created this whole era of just just bad people doing bad things generating even greater emotional responses yeah and this fits very much with the Neuroscience of emotion yeah um emotions like awe Happiness joy meaning pleasure these are powerful emotions and I will not say because there's no data to support the idea that fear anger um being threatened Etc are more powerful emotions but they tend to drive more Behavior to in other words people will do more this is well known in the field of Behavioral economics too people will do more to avoid losing something right than they will to gain something sadly but this is how our species is wired for Meaningful reasons so the point being that I think societally and perhaps interpersonally because the two things M mimic each other at every level individuals on all the way up to to culture seem to be engaged in this like increasingly Amplified emotional states and now it just seems like combat is the rule of the day and and it's so sad and you kind of have to wonder where it goes next but it does seem like it rewards these high conflict personalities because they go undetected right so now the the coworker who's super angry about something they saw on the news and is trying to engage people or something or create an issue around something that like is this really an issue I mean there's some real issues in the workplace and at school like is this really an issue like that person 10 years ago everyone would have been like this is a problem person and would have backed away now it just kind of um because the the the mean has shifted I think it goes it's no longer signal above the noise it's as we say in science within the noise right well what we're seeing is the the these kind of media systems I call them are attracted to high conflict personalities and high-conflict personalities are attracted to attention they want attention so there's this almost marriage of of media exposure and high conflict personalities and so that's what what what pulls people together there's like I think everyone's looking for Community these days and it used to be around work like a shared task but now we do so much of our work alone or tiny groups and so you get a real sense of community people used to get it from from church or synagogue or mosque wherever and that's weakened and so we get that now a lot the intense emotional Community from politics and so there's a community for you and there's a community for you so they pull themselves together they get that that I don't know dopamine hit or whatever it is um and strengthens them so what's happening is we're pulling apart but to me the answer is exposing the patterns and understanding our brains is recognize what's happening this person's probably exaggerating when they say that you know those people are evil this person's probably exaggerating when they say those people are stupid whatever it is that we have to realize okay don't don't buy that completely and what's fascinating to me I don't know how it happened but I get text message solicitations to contribute to campaigns from conservatives and liberals I get both and guess what they look like each other and they're like the end of the world is coming you've got to give $10 or $100 to save the world and the end of the world's coming because of them it's all fear-based and it's fear-based but it hooks your emotions I know this stuff so I can get okay swipe swipe swipe swipe away but a lot of people don't know that this is happening they don't understand how emotions are contagious and how I think high conflict emotions are more contagious so to me it's educating people about these Dynamics so you don't engage so much with them like I won't watch more than half an hour of TV news but you can have 247 TV news and since 1995 1996 when they allowed um um they they gave you licenses for radio and television that didn't have to tell the other side of the story before that you used to the the fairness doct you have to say what the other side is you're for a candidate you have to hear from the other side you didn't have to after 1995 96 so we had like MSNBC and Fox News slightly off center slightly conservative slightly liberal well now we've had 30 years of that much farther apart and communities around each of these and yet if you go okay I'm probably hearing some exaggerations here so I can check myself and this person's trying to be a hero and demonize those people I'm not going to do that so I'm not one for government regulation what I want is for everyone to be able to say okay I see what's happening I'm not going to get my emotions hooked and I think to me that's one of the goals is for people to learn I don't have to absorb the emotions because that's where the problem is people are emotionally hooked and uninformed formed what are some of the signs of a high conflict personality um because in an Ideal World we avoid these people and again we're not trying to say that they're bad people some of them are bad people some of them aren't but um since I'm not a clinical psychologist you are you can make the assessment um uh certainly better than I can what what are some of the ways to avoid these circumstances besides the first year rule um and then let's talk about some ways to disentangle from these people right um based on their unique uh phenotypes so is there a question or set of questions one should ask themselves when they are potentially um dating someone potentially becoming friends with somebody potentially becoming co-workers with somebody and so on yeah so what's interesting is often your gut feeling tells you something up here like the person suddenly has a shocking opinion of somebody else they say you know you know that person's a total jerk and yet you know that person and they're not a total jerk they suddenly something's disproportionate I think disproportionate um emotions is often a trigger I put I put in in a lot of my books now what I call the web method is pay attention to their words your emotions and their behavior so starting with words do they use a lot of blaming words words you know it's all that person's fault um is do they use All or Nothing words they seem to see things through a narrow lens that you know there's all good there's all bad um unmanaged emotions which they may or may not show like I explained some people are good at hiding all that even though it drives them inside and the extreme behaviors do they do things 90% of people would never do and I'll give an example here and this is um I I won't say the city but there was a mayor there was someone who worked who was a congress person and they decided to run for mayor in their City instead of flying to go to Congress but when they were flying to go to Congress back and forth this is in California I'll say that much people can easily research this so this person flying back and forth one day one night standing you know there was a line to get your bags at the airport after you got off the plane and and he was told to wait in line to get his bags and he said don't you know who I am and he pushed his way to the front of the line and had an argument with the person behind the counter said don't you know who I am I want my bag right now and she said we don't have it now can't have it right now and he pushed her and knocked her over he shoved this this Airline worker behind the counter and knocked her over this was a mayor of a major not yet he wasn't mayor yet he was a congress person anyway so that means he's sorry no no knock I know some some very decent Congress people but like okay um well in any case right this person could be any number of different professions like yes yeah this is antisocial Behavior but this is a high high a uh profile person so this is in the all over the news the next day this is um 20 years ago maybe 15 years ago something like that goodness anyway so it's in the newspaper the next day and newspaper says Congressman so and so gets into physical altercation with uh Airline worker knocks her over half the people said that's terrible and the other half people said wait wait he was sleep deprived he was flying across country you have to understand that he was stressed and here's where my web method comes in 90% of people would not have done that even if they were sleep deprived and I fly back and forth a lot and I'm not I'm I don't do that I I would like to think 99% of people do that I think you're right 99% get physical with an airline person over a b The Cutting to the front of the line is is egregious the the shoving the airline person is like Beyond The Pale yeah exactly so this is so anyway so he's running for mayor and I'm going this guy's a high conflict person if he gets elected he's not going to be a very good mayor he's going to have a lot of trouble with the people close to him and so guess what happened he gets elected within I think a eight months he is and this is before the me too movement got started but people are reporting he's harassing women sexually harassing women women come into his office to meet with him professional experienced important and he's like wanting to touch them a lot inappropriately think they don't want to be touched um anyway so women start complaining about him word kind of gets out yeah this happened with a lot of different people that he's he's not sexually assaulting them but he's he's treating them badly so it cuts across domains it's like in so so it's it's not just in the office it's it's it's there but it's also at the airport it's it's basically anytime he's not getting what he wants he he throws a tantrum and and that's the thing with with personality disorders is a narrower range of behavior that's repeated in a variety of settings so he's fitting all of that so which personality just s I'm not going to diagnose him but it Narrows down to one or two so it's not context dependent it it is right it's pervasive pervasive and that word is in the diagnostic manual that it's pervasive across I think several settings I think that's the words but let me let me just finish so because the end of the story the end of the story is he's also um got committees and people that are supposed to accomplish things he doesn't want them to think he wants them to he wants to do the thinking and tell them what to do so he goes around alienating a lot of people within eight months he's out of office because enough people were upset and the way he got out of office is some of the heads of government told him uh I think it was the City attorney or something if you quit now we'll help you with with your legal expenses cuz he's starting to get sued for some of this stuff suing the city suing him we help you with your legal expenses if you quit now and there was starting to be a petition movement for some I don't know the mechanics like a special election or something to get rid of him anyway within eight months he was out of the office and now you don't hear about him in that City it's a very interesting uh literally high-profile although still Anonymous based on this conversation case um I wonder if on a more um subtle or typical level the following is informative or not I'm not looking for a validation of the example I'm about to give but I've been um very surprised at times how um if a person who I'm with for the first time out on a meal will behave towards the weight staff yes not explicitly disparaging of them but sometimes mildly disparaging of them or um feeling as if uh the amount of of liquid poured into their glass was somehow an indication of how the waiter felt about them or didn't feel about them like read like reading into these things where you're just thinking to yourself like whoa life must be really tough for you like who's paying attention to this stuff and um and so that that's that's one that I've noticed in in people um and it's and it's proved informative it's really a useful thing to see that's part of what you see their behavior and their behavior towards other people this was it was a brilliant thing I don't remember the name of of the program but there was a guy who was head of a company and he used to when he was interviewing people for highlevel jobs he pretended he was a taxi driver or something would pick them up at the airport as as the taxi driver and see they treated him as the taxi driver and then he gets in the interview room and he's the guy interviewing them and in some cases people treated him really disrespectfully and it's like now I know this is not someone I want clever I made the decision to not work for um somebody years ago um when I was on the different very different stage of my career based on how that person treated a janitor yeah and it was amazing because it was one very brief interaction and it wasn't like this person yelled at the janitor yeah it was the kind of dismissiveness yeah um and I remember it was this your web approach it was um it was his I guess I just just revealed it was his words towards the janitor it was my emotional response was s of like I felt like i' had been kind of kicked in the stomach I was like Hey like that was like it just felt like a like a a very un what I would call like the football play unnecessary roughness yes it was mild from the perspective of like no no one got physical or called anyone names but it was but I remember thinking like oh like that sucked right and then their behavior was just to just go right back to what they were talking about and I I knew in that moment I was really crestfallen because in that moment I knew oh my goodness I can't work for this person yeah like I just can't and I made the decision not to and actually their response to my deciding not to for a variety of other reasons too confirmed everything that I suspected in that one little interaction yes but it's interesting because we're trained to um collect data rather you know carefully you know and we don't want to we don't want to make snap judgment somebody could truly be having a bad day but in this case it was it was the right decision to not work for them thank goodness I thank my lucky stars make some really bad decisions about people in my life that was a really good decision uh I never spent a day regretting it and I went to work for someone else who was terrific instead so but as you said these things sometimes hit at a at a somatic level as opposed to some sort of um wait did you know some like very cerebral analytic thing it it kind of hits at a what must be a very primitive circuit I can't help the neuroscientist in me wants to say like it's got to be something at the level of the body where we go wait that was messed up yeah and and you can't really point to a specific word and then you start to question yourself that's the problem you you wonder was well maybe their tone wasn't maybe it's my own perception but I don't know maybe maybe the body doesn't lie maybe it knows I think the body is like a first responder and that we should pay attention to that and especially with high conflict personalities especially the con artists which is part of antisocial personality and the ones I've dealt with are very good at this is their words are just right and your brain is like soothed by them you go this person get it and I'm totally comfortable they're Charming all of that and your gut goes wait there's they're out of sync I have this cold feeling why do I have this cold feeling and I think that they're they're aimed at your your cerebral thinking and that your guts kind of gets it because they're in a way predatory like antisocial tend to be predatory those people have dead eyes I've known a few yeah known a few men and women and their eyes are I can only describe and I'm a vision neuroscientist that's like what my the career has been and those are two little pieces of brain right there and there's something about the the deadness and and I don't have a science to support what I'm about to say there's something about the deadness in their eyes maybe their pupils don't change shape with levels of arousal the same way other pupils do because we know that happens in in healthy people with an healthy autonomic nervous system but there's something lacking yeah um and people make up all sorts of theories online like I'm not a big blinker um I don't BL when I'm concentrating blinks break up my flow and and this is actually a way I can remember things people have these theories about blinking non- blink the research doesn't support any relationship between blink frequency and personality they had this whole theory about Zuck too like he doesn't blink therefore he's whatever he's a robot none of that holds up what does hold up however is this mismatch between words and the affect that it creates in US yeah it's like it sounds right but it doesn't feel right I wish we understood more about this at the level of science there are a lot of theories not a lot of not a lot of tools someday I think yeah yeah the tools for measuring the stuff are getting better um I want to to ask you about other ways of of just knowing if you're interacting with a high conflict person um when the cues are more subtle are there other things um or examples of the web method that that come to mind well for me of course dealing like with cord especially there's a lot of stuff in writing and so being able to look at what's written and lot of blame words the All or Nothing words she did this and she did that and disparaging words she's stupid or whatever or He's a Bully he's this and that which triggers for me maybe he is or maybe the person saying it is but it heightens my attention yeah how do you disambiguate between projection and a real thing like online now I mean one of the most pop one of the fastest ways to get a popular social media account is for somebody to give advice about how to avoid bad people you know name calling gaslighting narcissist sociopath psychopath um hist onic like these these are clinical terms that now the general public can leverages to like you know sort of amplify community and then in part I understand from talking to people on the tech side is that social media is social right the accounts that grow fastest are the ones where you don't need much language to convey what you're trying to convey like a a sport or dance or an animal that and among the others that grow very quickly um and therefore rewarding to people are ones where there's um where you're recruiting these negative Advocates first of all I want to make sure that I get this point across and that is there's a lot of Temptation to label people with like the mental disorders the personality disorders and it's absolutely essential that people don't do that if you think somebody might be a narcissist or might have borderline personality or be antisocial keep that to yourself and adapt how you work with them to be more effective or be more cautious whatever but the worst thing I think is people say oh and and everyone agrees that person's a narcissist so we kind of gang up on that person that's not helpful the goal is not rejecting people the goal is adapting what you do to either manage the relationship decide okay that's not someone I'm going to get close to but you know I can still work with them or have them as neighbors or whatever so I want to emphasize that because I think you're right there's a lot of that today and people come to me with that concern say Bill you teach about personality disorders yes so people understand patterns of behavior and how to adapt your own behavior I'm not teaching people to label other people so that's real important um yeah people go to school for many years and do 3,000 plus clinical hours to learn how to do that uh to do that properly it's like saying uh it's like diagnosing anything right I mean a dermatologist might be able to help diagnose a a a skin patch for potential cancer um but we're taught that we're not supposed to do that ourselves right so we have to be cautious but on the other hand aware and the more you're aware of patterns like like being aware of someone with an alcohol abuse issue is to go okay I'm not going to be serving him alcohol with dinner it's a great person but I'm just going to leave that out of the evening meal adapt what we do rather than judging them and I don't see people with personality disorders as lesser beings I see them as having a different set of behaviors that they acquire pretty much in childhood so I don't hold it against them I may dislike their patterns of behavior but I I really don't hate people like that I've been a therapist with clients like that so I think our awareness needs to be there so we adapt how we work with people but I think the the gut feeling is is so important and as a therapist I was trained pay attention to your gut because that's going to help you with your clients and that's why the web method their words their behavior but how I feel often gives me tips you mentioned before and I think it's really important to highlight that people's patterns of interactions across a lot of different domains with the teachers in the school with close family members with the people that know them best at work that these different types of relationships reveal a pattern and one of the things just speaking from my own experience is that uh I've tended to where I've gone wrong I've tended to overemphasize the importance of like a credential for instance um some of my past uh romantic uh relationships have been uh with people who are Highly Educated some less High higher education all extremely smart people some more formal some less formal education but I think that I and other people sometimes will look at the CV of somebody um and of course that's not the only uh indication of of their uh you know their their values Etc but and to overemphasize like oh well they you know did difficult things in a difficult setting and therefore must be a a good person like so would you say that these high conflict personalities exist more or less in high competition venues versus low competition venues um I don't want to make this about socioeconomic status those things correlate but um but you know all too often we tend to do the kind of good on paper analysis yeah and forget the like how do they actually measure up in real life yeah I I would say first of all that we see high conflict people in every occupation in every culture and every Community every economic status I think that I don't think there's research on this but I think that health care and higher education are two Fields where there's a slightly higher incidence higher of high conflict people because there's a higher to oh also I would say churches and we get consultations with churches sometimes there's a high tolerance for behavior that that's outside the norm because so you said higher education and Healthcare in particular so you talk about are you talking about Physicians and universities yes yes so students and faculty and staff yes both administrators sometimes and I believe it's because of the higher tolerance administrators just kidding I've blessed with good administrators we we have been blessed with great administrators let me yeah let me mention I do a lot of cons consultation and one of the things that people come to me about is is people with little power bases like department heads in universities um I remember one University I did a consultation with about a department head and they were a medical school and they had a high conflict uh person high up in the structure who was really um I was told damaging some of the students careers because they didn't they looked at them crosy or something like that so they wouldn't write the kind of recommendation that they needed and how can we deal with this person because they're embedded in their position so gave them variety of tips but that's that's why I think people do need to have their eyes open in these fields and and I want to add since I'm talking about occupations we see this a little bit more in nonprofits and nonprofit administrators because again nonprofits are good people doing good things but they have this higher tolerance for administrators of bad behavior because they're good people and that blinds people to because of the Assumption they're good people or because they're or because the mission is good the mission is good and they're invested in this Mission so they must be good do you think that's part of what got them there yes and and the the thing that's so tricky is is it everybody's somewhat unique but also these are some recognizable patterns of behavior once you know to look for them and this is something we're doing much more in the workplace now and employers want to know we want to promote this person is that a good or bad idea well let's look at the patterns of behavior because once you put them in an embedded position things are going to be harder I've been approached by City councils they say we've got somebody on our city council that's a high conflict person what do we do do we confront them do we publicly talk about them all that stuff I say neither of those is good learn how to manage them until they move on and they often do because people slowly go we don't like working with this person it's really interesting uh you know when I was a graduate student there was a department chair in that department big Personality yeah like big Personality yeah and um I very quickly came to realize also because I listened to the faculty that were under this person that despite having this like big like Larger than Life personality that you might initially like Place into a category of you know like diagnosis or something yeah that this person was an incredibly strong advocate for the faculty yeah and they loved that and he was really beloved MH and I think rightfully so you know and um you know at a at a surface level might have rubbed a few people the wrong way I think as students we were like oh whoa like you know it was almost like I didn't quite know how to how to like respond respond to it but you very quickly got the sense of like a real kind of paternal nature in this person so I point this out because sometimes these big personalities are really truly benevolent now I'm not saying he was a perfect human being how could I know that I don't know that I didn't know him in All domains of his life although I did know his family and and he seemed to have a great strong family too um but then by contrast I'm thinking of the person I alluded to earlier different department different University who was kind of like More Meek like like certainly as more of the the stereotypical lab scientist but then um you know there was this like interaction that I observed and I thought like w like that's really Dreadful at least that's not an environment I want to be in so sometimes these things don't match our initial Impressions I raise this because sometimes we think big personality AKA high conflict personality sometimes we think hey kind of you know quieter um nerdy type and they're actually quite Dreadful yeah so it doesn't always fit it's it's and and I think the problem with the internet social media version of this the typical version because there's some great social media internet stuff podcast Etc uh is that we we default to what we see yeah and what we hear but we we don't really have the data and we can get manipulated that way that's that's what's tricky but but you raised several important points I want to respond to them all if I can remember them the the first is that this is in many ways quite nuan the key thing to look out for with high conflict people a preoccupation with blaming other others and not taking responsibility so you might have a big personality that's that's not a high conflict person you might have a me quiet person who is a high conflict person so you can't go by what your eyes see and your ears hear it's really a question of evidence and that's why I think maybe I got into this after I became a lawyer that there's no way to quickly know although you may quickly suspect and then want to look deeper but I want to give an example because now that I seem to have criticized department heads and and well I cited at least one that that is really wonderful I've known some other great department heads I mean there's some chairs that are just like these are first of all as a department head sometimes there's a slight salary increase usually it's trivial yeah these people don't do it for the money I have a good friend who's also been on this podcast who's a chair of neurosurgery at a major I mean these are people who they work their butts off to try and make conditions better for patients for professors for clinicians for staff I mean I'm not I'm not just saying this I have no incentive for saying it you know right these people don't control my life anymore well I suppose my my chair of opy who's a wonderful person um it does um Etc but the point is that there are some people that step up to the plate to lead that are really great leaders and these are just not the people that we're focusing on today right right and so the thing I want to emphasize my my favorite example is Steve Jobs Steve Jobs I would say hands down was a high conflict person famous for there was a guy in Silicon Valley wrote a book The no a-hole Rule and he talked about Steve Jobs in there because he knew Steve Jobs he was in Silicon Valley so I remember reading his biography like thousand Pages or whatever and what stood out to me was that he blamed people sometimes let all or nothing thinking they talked about his uh Distortion reality Distortion reality Distortion field and that's exactly what high conflict people do they all or nothing thinking you got to do this you can do this people say that's not possible it's physically impossible Steve you can't do this and then he would push them and one example that stood out to me was touch screen glass that you touch and it knows where you are I think and I may have it wrong but from reading his autobiography that he har ranged a corning wear Glass Company Corning company something like that to create that and they said you can't do it it's not physically possible he says do it and do it in the next 90 days and they did they invented this thing that they probably would not have done unless he pushed them so high conflict person but I don't think he had a personality disorder people say oh is he an incredible narcissist but personality disorder is characterized by lack of change lack of self-awareness lack of flexibility and and they shoot themselves in the foot and it interferes with their success he I think was close to that but he had enough flexibility and he picked a team that pushed back on him and he liked that so he's an example to me of high conflict person probably not personality disorder and successful because he probably had some traits of these personalities so what I see is you totally have to look for the evidence that you can't make an assumption but if your gut says maybe something's off here pay attention to that but look for the facts talk to other people that know this person see them in other situations because there's incredible people like him that that that accomplish a lot of really good stuff that you don't want to say oh we can't have him Apple fired him in the 1990s and he seemed to learn from that he seemed to grow from that people with personality disorders don't seem to grow and change and that's that's their problem they're stuck high conflict people they blame others if they have some traits maybe you can do a workaround so there's many people in position surgeons are one group I want to mention briefly because as a clinical social worker I worked in hospitals and dealt with doctors a lot as a lawyer I've represented doctors and their divorces several I think are high conflict people but most aren't and that's what I want to say most departments heads aren't high conflict people most surgeons aren't high conflict people even though they get a reputation for that um police is another area military is another area probably slightly higher incidents because they're in a position where they can Dominate and control people but most police aren't like that most people in the military aren't high conflict people they're professional people they like their job they know their job they have empathy they work with people so even though some of these occupations there's a higher incidence and that's certainly true for lawyers I think but most people most lawyers aren't like that most lawyers I know are really committed to their work really want to help their clients so I I want to kind of be clear that this is nuanced stuff but when you're hiring people when you're getting into a dating relationship you want to watch more closely because it's the close relationships where high conflict Behavior comes out more so the web method seems like a very good method um as well as paying attention to um and maybe getting some information from other people close to that person in different domains of their life that that seems like a very like Sage way to approach this exactly and because when you hear from different people the same problem then that should raise your antenna okay a lot of people say yeah but this person can be really irritable and you go okay oh they're IR itable in different settings I'm going to think about that what about when somebody is already involved with a high conflict person and they want to disentangle um I could imagine a couple different scenarios let's um say disentangle from a professional relationship disentangle from a personal relationship probably some overlap there but slightly different let's assume the high conflict person is a high conflict um uh victim type then let's compare that to if the high conflict person is more of a combative type maybe we'll start with a combative type so if you're dealing with a combative maybe even dare we say narcissistic type I don't know that we should diagnose but but the The Stereotype that comes to mind somebody that that gets angry when you don't fulfill their expectations um and blames others does not take responsibility and it's time you decide to uh like the Homer Simpson meme kind of drift back into the Hedge um is that the way to do it or do you lay a clear line and say listen um I'm not going to tolerate this anymore I'm out it's really somewhat dependent on the nature of relationship I do a lot of consultation we do a lot of training with high conflict Institute so we get you know married people getting divorced we get business port Partnerships where there's one partner that they going we got to deal with this we have employees trying to get away from from a high conflict supervisor and we have supervisors trying to deal with a high conflict employee so the slightly different um settings you know that the most common situation is going to be where somebody has a friend or a romantic partner um or a business professional partner they want to get get out of so I suppose any of those a close so a partner kind of relationship something where the person expects to hear from you yeah on a fairly regular basis expects things from you could be professional things could be personal things but where there's an ongoing expectation that you show up emotionally physically financially whatever yeah so first of all we strongly recommend against the Direct Hit is don't tell the person look you do this this and this and that's terrible and I don't want to be I don't want to work with you I don't want to be in a relationship with you I don't want to be close to you because of your behavior that high conflict people puts them through the roof they will defend themselves and for the next months or years they may put you in litigation they may uh stalk you depending on your relationship ship they they they will hate you for that they'll blame you they will blame you and that fulfills their picture that it's all your fault and now look you've you have violated the most basic thing is that you will never blame me so don't blame them second thing is don't blame yourself because that reinforces to them like if you say you know I just can't you know I'm a sensitive person and I just can't um you know keep up with you um I know I'm defective and I know I'm I'm no good at this this and this and so I I just have to end this relationship and I I so much apologize it's all my fault you know I it's I do everything wrong and I'm going to go really look at myself and get some therapy and I'm so sorry but I just can't you know keep up with you you're such a a really good this this and this and and I just can't keep up with that well they're GNA blame you for that and you're depending on their personality if they tend to have borderline traits they're going to feel abandoned by you they have narcissistic traits they're going to feel um put down by you they're going to because you're supposed to see them as Superior if they have antisocial traits they're going to feel like wait a minute you know you're supposed to be submissive to me and and yet you're walking away so you don't want to blame yourself so you're going to go well what's left what's left is we aren't a good fit um our goals have gone in different directions um I'm really ready for a career change um I want to go back to school or you know I just realized I'm I'm not ready for a committed relationship so it's not about you and it's not about them it's not about blame you want to try to keep it away from blame now some people say it's dishonest to to not tell them everything and let's talk about brutal honesty high conflict people really love brutal honesty and they'll tell you I'm just being honest you're stupid or a jerk or whatever that's high conflict people reasonable people don't tell everybody every negative thing they think that's just not healthy for relationships so it's okay to say you know we seem to be going in different directions or I have different plans I've realized I want to change so those are basic principles um the worst thing in ending a relationship or reducing contact is to go back and forth um the worst thing is to pour out your feelings to the person I have this people getting divorced and they tell I'm so sorry and I love you so much and that pouring out your feelings to someone brings them closer to you so you want to start holding back some and the other person say well let's work let's go to counseling let's do this and if you're not sure go to counseling I recommend that but if you're sure just say you know I'm I'm kind of not there anymore I really need to be more on my own so don't go back and forth because that really makes it raw and sometimes pre- sages violence um in divorces is the a high conflict person especially with some of the personality disorder traits can't hle the opening and closing opening and closing so but the other thing is I say do it in steps so the person can adjust uh you might say you know I'm I'm thinking about making a career change or I'm thinking that maybe this relationship isn't the right one for me anymore um so the person gets used to the idea this may be coming to an end and then um I'd like to move out and um have more time alone to think and then you're at a safe distance and you say I've thought about it and and we really need to get divorced and let's go to a divorce mediator I want to be amicable you know I don't hate you in many ways I still love you but we're just not meant to be a couple anymore um if there's kids involved then you know I really want us to have a supportive relationship for them if there aren't then maybe this really is the end but it's it's step by step so this person can adjust to the fact that you really are leaving but not too long and not too many steps because then their expectations are raised oh maybe you're not really leaving so these are general principles depends a lot on the specifics yeah that was very helpful um in reference to the high conflict person especially not placing blame on them I mean I suppose in your own mind you can hold all the the Litany of reasons why they they are a terrible choice or I guess more typically if we're realistic yeah it's not going to be all black and white right I mean one would hope that at the first sight of really egregious Behavior people like I'm done but typically it's a mix right I mean this is you know professionally personally it's it's often a mix yes and um you know I've certainly observed this professionally where people you know wanted to collect the degree or they were three years into a degree and like leaving was it's it's always an option and yet sometimes it's not an option they have you know plans and financial obligations and you know sunk cost is a real thing people always talk about sunk cost like oh that's just sunk cost sunk cost is a real thing so I think um okay so with the high conflict person I think you you beautifully Illustrated how to um not blame them not blame yourself internally you can hold any reasonable understanding that you come to but you don't have to share all that and then you don't want to at in decision but that perhaps things um some staging of the exit um not staging a theatrically uh rather staging meaning uh in stages uh um increments would be a better word what about with the high conflict victim playing person that seems like it's a little trickier um let me back up a minute cuz I want to say there's sometimes where you just need to get out and do it all at once right and don't um ease yourself out serious physical or emotional risk yes so you may need to get away before you hint that I no longer want to be married to you and I've I've worked with people consulted with them on established you know moving out when the other person isn't there they and the kids go to a safe place they've got their lawyer and then they tell this person that I'm getting divorced from you because people get killed when they SE operate with certain high conflict domestic violence people so also in the workplace sometimes they're going to destroy they're going to send emails they're going to be really destructive they may you might say I'm going to leave in a month and and they're so angry that they're going to really destroy your business well this is why in the professional setting they're they're uh forgive the word because it's associated with this podcast often but there are um protocols for this in the in the workplace where if you have to let somebody go um it there's a a sequence of steps and sometimes it involves telling people you know go home we'll ship you your things that's one extreme go home now and there's somebody waiting to escort you out type thing other times it's you know listen you're going to finish out the month but you're going to finish that the month out at home other times it's hey you're welcome to stay and continue to to participate but by X date that's her final day so there's any number of different variations on these themes in the professional setting and it sounds like there's any number of different variations in the personal setting to it's nuanced and that's where getting consultation having a therapist a lawyer a high conflict consultant someone that you kind of walk it through with maybe even practice what you're going to say with a third party Observer seems really key right often just for for peace of mind yes right so yeah so mostly gradual but sometimes fast really depends now you asked about the person who plays the victim and I would suggest that that's very common with high conflict people that when aggressive behavior doesn't work they switch to oh how can you do this to me that I'm so sad and what's interesting the word that I didn't come up with this other people came up with in divorce settings where let's say you're divorcing someone with high conflict personality and they they were like I hate you I hate you don't leave me kind of personality and so you know I'm divorcing you and they're like you know rage at you and then no I'm I'm really leaving then they switch and beg and plead and I've I've got cases where people say and and you know my ex to be just seduced me and some I went along with it CU it felt real good and it's back and forth from the high conflict person and they call it hooing you go hoovering where did that word come from the Hoover vacuum oh what happens is they vacuum they suck you back into the relationship and it's very common with some of the high conflict personalities they can't stand to lose you and when rage doesn't work then they try to seduce you back in and some people have allowed themselves to get back in and that's that's not good you've got to be ready for that don't be surprised by that and don't give into that if you're sure it's over if you're not sure it's over get couples counseling and see where it might go I know a number of people who um let's just say conceived children very in close proximity to the ending of the relationship and therefore there was no end to the relationship until several years later yes I don't know of a single case where that led to a Persistence of the relationship um for better or worse so um this sounds like it falls under the the rubric of of hoovering right people are leaving and then they end up you know one more time or or just to try and make the the pain go away type thing and um and then they're bringing you know more of an attachment I mean obviously a child is is a forever tie as they say um so uh yeah I wouldn't say it's the majority of cases for sure but it's it's a common symptom with high conflict people and you and you hit on it it's like they can't handle the pain and so they really bring the P bring the person back in but if this is the direction you're going you need to let them start coping with the pain either step by step or if it's dangerous all at once but don't go back if you can help it these are very uh helpful um they're not even tips this is very useful information for for everyone listening I'm I'm sure they agree we had a guest on this podcast Jonathan height who's written the book anxious generation the codling of the American mind um and he mentioned some statistics that younger folks so high school and younger have seem to um lost or are losing the capacity to arbitrate among themselves that um now more typically if there's a conflict um and here we're we're assuming not extreme conflict or or anything criminal but where there's a conflict between two kids at school and they bring it to the authorities when I was growing up that was called tattling right you were called a rat and it got you semi- ostracized if you did it you learn quickly don't do it either you learn directly or you learn by observation you don't be a tattletail he claims that nowadays there's more of this um lack of ability to arbitrate and and you know kids you know calling out other kids publicly or publicly and that parents are doing it now too and this seems worrisome in in that it seems like it would Foster these this group segregation and cultivating through emotional contagion you know blaming of others and negative uh NE negative Advocates I mean I I don't want to blame social media for everything because I love social media for certain things I exist on social media for a number of things that I believe are truly benevolent so I'd be a hypocrit if I said I didn't like social media love social media for certain things but are you concerned about this I mean this seems like a real issue I mean that the profession of law exists because of a lack of ability for people to arbitrate among themselves but that's not what we're talking about here we're not talking about people bring in therapists or lawyers to really help mediators we're talking about just people going to the to the authorities are online and trying to create some drama for what to what end yeah I think in some ways to some extent that's high conflict parents who see everything in All or Nothing terms see their kids as as offended by other kids um or they're protecting their children and and I am concerned about it and I also agree it isn't just social media in many ways I've been watching this since families got smaller so I remember growing up most families had several kids the divorces I do now often have one or two kids and that's been true in many ways since the 1970s and a lot of it has to do with birth control so don't just blame social media also blame birth control that when people could decide how large a family they have they decide to have smaller family so birth control pills came out in the 60s and the 70s suddenly we started noticing people are having two kids and by the ' 80s 90s 2000s a lot of people have one kid my most high conflict divorce cases have one kid because it's hard to share one kid it's a little bit easier to share two kids it's a lot easier to share four kids it's like you can have them for the weekend I'm not going to fight with you about that please take them and the small family and this is I think structurally a lot the fall small family structure is feeding parents becoming in messed with their kids some parents and so their kids become their Partners especially in these high conflict divorces now dad's a bad guy mom's a bad woman and the child especially often the oldest child now is my best friend my my kind of Junior your partner in the world and that's where you see a lot of you start getting alienated kids now they hate dad and mom's perfect or they hate Mom and Dad's perfect parental estrangement is growing yes um like crazy as a as a phenomenon we're heading towards the holidays in a few few weeks and months and this is going to come up um I actually did an Instagram live with a a really skilled therapist named Matias Barker um who specializes in among other things um parental estrangement yeah it's so common now people kids just deciding I'm done with my parents right and it's partly the culture is fulfilling that that we're now seeing everything in like opposing terms All or Nothing terms Etc and the big message I want to get across with this with all parents and kids is it's a question of skills that the kids aren't growing up with the skills to manage the nuances and so we teach a lot of our skills and we teach parents teach these to your kids in divorce flexible thinking teach them flexible thinking teach them manage emotions teach them um to ma to moderate their behavior teach them to check themselves wait a minute am I doing something here rather than always you you you and we developed a method we call it new ways for families which was designed high conflict divorce cases for both parents to kind of learn these skills and practice either with a therapist or a coach or just watching online and typing in answers to practice these four we call these the four big skills for life and this is I think what parents need to teach their kids is you can solve that problem tell me what happened okay let's talk about what you could say to Johnny and we teach skills we call ear statements empathy attention and respect statement that shows that and so we teach parents teach your child you know your best friend who just broke up with you might be feeling Hur about something maybe something they said what can you do so we encourage kids to help their kids manage the situation and we encourage them to manage their relationship with the other parent they come back from uh visitation or access from a weekend let's say with Dad and and child says you know Dad didn't look at my drawing I drew a picture and dad didn't look at my drawing high conflict parents say oh your dad's a jerk you know I always hated that about him a reasonable parent says oh that's sad well you know what next time um if he doesn't look at the picture right away maybe wait an and then show him the picture again maybe he got busy maybe this or that teach your child to manage the relationship even with the other parent and those parents don't have high conflict divorces high conflict divorces have the other your dad's a jerk you know forget about him he'll never pay attention to you and that's when you see parents estranged or alienated of the kids alienated from the parents so you think that with increasing number of siblings kids learn how to work things out among themselves that's another big part of it is you have to find out how to share so I had three siblings and we grew up and and it's fascinating you're one of three or you had three others I'm one of four so I have three that's that's a good siiz kit a brother two sisters so four and what's fascinating for me and I think it helped shape my personality and approach the life is we grew up without television we didn't have something to to watch after school we had to deal with each other so you know we might play kickball in the backyard or we might read or something or other but we had to learn conflict resolution with each other and our parents were like you know you go talk to your brother Bill I don't have time to hear your complaint yeah and so structurally it's shocking going from that to doing people's divorces with one or two children and even two is is better than just one cuz they do learn to share but parents parents feel so guilty today and that's our culture is really not fair to parents I think um to know that you know teach your child ways to deal with it themselves I'll say I have one sibling uh we get along terrifically well we're we're exceedingly close but I can recall when we were kids if we were getting into the scrap my mom or dad would say just sort it out among your ourselves just don't get any blood on the carpet it was like that it was like that but then again my mom's from New Jersey and so it's like a different style right um anyone from New Jersey will understand that was a joke um but the point being that um we learned pretty quickly how to sort things out my sister and I have had a few conflicts over the years but we get along terrifically well we vacation together for our birthdays every year like we're um but both of us had a lot of friends in the neighborhood right I grew up in a neighborhood with a lot of boys my age she grew up in a neighborhood with a lot of girls her age and so I quickly learned in that big pack of boys and then I entered Sports and got involved in things where it was like big packs of boys like that's just kind of how it worked out eventually young men and and then men that you know you you couldn't say certain things or it was you it was going to mean trouble yeah you get punched in the face say that right but nowadays that would be considered like oh goodness and you know like wait obviously not a proponent for violence but there were you learn I probably learned at 14 that there were certain things you didn't say to friends you get into the scrap with them and then you'd remain friends right um and so we arbitrated among each other but also just had a share how to um you know we would um I don't recommend this cuz I'll well whatever we used to do these like dirt CLA Wars where you throw dirt at each other's heads like like you know and um and occasionally someone would throw a rock and cut some kid and then but that kid who threw the rock would get in trouble with us it's not like we turn him into his parents you just kind of knew like he plays dirty and then he wouldn't play dirty again or if he did then he kind of knew it like you got there was just sort of an understanding of of how people sort it out in groups this is and this stuff hearkens back to primitive circuitry that's present in all Old World primates right chimpanzees in particular I always tell people if you want a really good watch and you want to learn about human behavior watch chimp Empire the Netflix series because it's basically the the it's it's the core circuitry of the primate brain in action how people team up how they cooperate how they then all the human behaviors pretty much are there except the technology development those chimps aren't building rockets and and electric cars but they're engaging in all the sorts of of behaviors both hierarchical and non-h hierarchical romantic and professional so to speak chimps have professions too um to to bring about cooperative and non-cooperative behavior and sort it out it's fascinating and The Chimps are our closest relative I think yeah as far as I know I mean I have friends who are like really into the genomics of all this stuff so I want to be careful that's getting but I believe so they are Old World primates we are Old World primates so there's there's a common lineage there for sure yeah yeah but but I I want to really reinforce what you're saying is about the community of learning and kids growing up in the community of learning and it I think it plays a role with with bullies because what happens is the the community of kids figures out who bullies and confronts them with their behavior and people ask me well are adult bullies because my book is about adult bullies were they bullies as kids and I'll say it seems to be pretty universally they were as kids but most kids try bullying at least once and they grow out of it because they get feedback they learn that's not going to work you're not going to have friends um I'm not going to be around so bullies learn to either change their behavior or to Live On The Fringe of the group if they don't change their behavior and so part of why we're seeing more adult bullies today I think is because they used to be on The Fringe because or they they learned how to get along but if they were On The Fringe because nobody liked them and they didn't change their behavior what we're seeing to today is bullies are finding each other and this is one of the negatives of social media I think and I agree there's a lot of good things but this is one of the surprising things when I researched my book bullies are finding a group for themselves and instead of the group teaching them not to be a bully the group reinforces being a bully says you were justified in doing that and one of the shocking things is to find that School shooters have a support system online really that they seem to some of the research says they always have a Social Media Group they have peers that they're trying to somewhat impress and that may actually egg them on and that if they track down they find these folks have and I think they should look for that find out who they've been talking to who they communicate with and so what I think we're seeing is Bully are reinforcing their bad behavior rather than social pressure for them to learn good behavior which is for me I'm I've done a lot of group therapy I've treated people that go to Alcoholics Anonymous Narcotics Anonymous and the group reinforces and teaches them good behavior but bullies are finding other bullies and reinforcing their bad behavior and that's an issue we have to address especially with young men is they we have to get on top of that and redirect them into socially um pro-social activities and most people don't realize that I didn't realize that now that comes as a real surprise to me as well are there um female bullies and male bullies online or is it more typical that there are M groups of male bullies online I haven't heard about female bullies finding each other um well actually actually I should take that back and this is gets into a sensitive area about personality disorders but borderline personality disorder is one of the more treatable personality disorders and people become aware that they have this disorder a lot from internet information but what seems to happen there's a couple stages for them they become aware before they change their behavior and like like DBT dialectical behavior therapy is a really good treatment for that but therapists and and my wife was a DBT therapist said that they become aware of it before they change their behavior so they do self-sabotaging things even though they shouldn't they I know I shouldn't do this but and then finally they learn to change their behavior well some people are discovering their borderline and finding other people online and reinforcing their borderline view of the world there's evil people and good people and occasionally they write reviews of my books and say how awful a person I am because I talk about personality disorders even though I say don't identify anybody and I believe personality disorders in most cases could be helped if they're open to that so I think there's some degree of of say female people with that personality finding each other and reinforcing that behavior but what I what I read was and I I cited in my book in the uh uh I'm trying to remember I don't remember which chapter but that that some researcher at a university said look for their social media connections and you'll find that there was a reinforcement of this Behavior rather than people saying hey you can't do that you've got to cut it out one of the best pieces of advice a colleague gave me was when I um started teaching in the university to undergraduates this was prior to my arriving at Stanford where I am now um I had this big class and uh this colleague who's a neuroscientist very esteemed neuroscientist but also trained as a psychiatrist he's an MD he said Just remember the statistics on uh very psychiatric and personality uh disorders you know you've got one% of the population is schizophrenic you've got 10% at any time that's probably experiencing major depression you've got borderline You' got it and he said so when you look out on your classroom just understand that you that it's a not necessarily representative population but that those um challenges he posed in the right way he was patient oriented those challenges um are present in that population um I mention this now because it's something to keep in mind anytime one goes onto social media and reads comments yeah you're you you have to run those comments through the filter of what we know about the frequency of of those of those challenges for people so um which is not to say that every negative comment is coming from somebody that's borderline or right sociopathic but there's a there's a high probability that that if somebody is is um is continuously doing that especially in the blame game type scenario that um that that's what's going on there something I want to fit in here and that is that uh we need to understand that people with personality dis ERS didn't choose to have them and so I have a lot of compassion for people like that and I have I've so I I have a lot of students over the years and and they write reflective journals and occasionally they put in their Journal I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and I remember this one woman said so when you talked about borderline personality disorder was a little uncomfortable for me but I found it helpful and she was actually one of the better students in the class and so she had that level of awareness but she was still working on working on herself to manage you know the emotional roller coaster and such and so what's important to me is some people with borderline personality disorder may be angry with me because I talk about it because they're early stage with this but other people say thank you Bill that was helpful and so so there's kind of a range there but I also want to say three basic reasons I think people develop personality disorders the first is genetic Tendencies and various researchers say like 20 to 80% may be the genetic tendency depending on the person that early childhood first five years of life maybe attachment difficulties may be a driving Factor but also cultural environment um some people say the um a researcher in San Diego wrote the narcissism epidemic and she says from her research um that the decade you're born in influences your personality development as much as your family fascinating I don't agree with that because she's not a therapist and looked at the mental health she looked at Big surveys college students especially but I think that's more significant than we realize and more significant than I used to think and so part of what you're saying is today's culture is reinforcing not taking responsibility whereas in the past you had to solve problems yourself on the positive side always good too um it seems that even though family structures have changed quite a lot yeah um even though culture is changing quite a lot um there's this wonderful feature of social media and the internet now um which is in you know what we're doing right now which is the opportunity for experts like yourself to come on and and educate and I think that as we started off talking about it's probably about 90% of people do not fall into this high conflict personality category and what we're talking about what you're educating us on is how to interact with this 10% in a way that brings about um more functionality for everybody more effective professional personal familial interactions for everyone it's not about just ostracizing those with challenges so keeping with that you know what should most people you know do if they are feeling frustrated with um someone that they feel well for instance the the you know 80% of your problems come from 20% of people and this case where I guess we're saying you know like 90% of problems come from these 10% of of people but really it behooves us all to try and figure out how best to interact with others and so you've spelled out a number of ways that we can do that today um if you were to kind of highlight I never want to pressure but you know highlight you know one or two things to just keep in mind as one moves through the world um the web tool seems especially effective yeah um is there anything else that you recommend that we just hold in mind as we navigate forward because it's a it's a it's quite a landscape out there yeah several things then I can be brief with each of them first there's what I call the four forget about it is forget about trying to give the person insight into how they're behaving that blows up the person you know just like I said don't blame them for you ending the relationship so just forget about giving them Insight instead talk about what we can do now talk about options talk about don't don't go inward with them go outward with them so when you go inward you escalate their defensiveness so don't try to give them insight into themselves and a lot of people say how can I make him see that what he's doing is so wrong or how can I make her understand that she's she's creating the problem we're trying to solve just forget about that talk about okay here's what our options are let's talk about what to do second is don't emphasize the past and people argue forever with high conflict people about the past and you never resolve the past with a high conflict person and I'll tell you in a minute why that may be focus on what to do now and the future future Focus not past Focus maybe you need some information to understand a problem but then emphasize the future the third is don't FOC focus on emotions and especially don't yell at them don't burst into tears don't tell them how frustrating they are all of that and this is what I'm going to tell you now is a theory that I hope someone figures out and that is people with personality disorders and high conflict personalities don't seem to go through the five stages of The Grieving and healing process denial anger bargaining depression sadness and acceptance they seem to get stuck at denial and anger so what happens is they don't resolve things they don't quotes get over things they don't get over the divorce they don't get over the job loss they don't get over having to sell their house because they didn't they couldn't pay the mortgage they don't experience the normal human healing and grieving process so they're stuck and so a lot of situations with them turn to anger they're angry but they're not resolved so high conflict people are constantly talking about the past and how aggrieved they are they shouldn't have done that to me I was right to have done this and people start not when I say that like students in my class oh yeah that's what I see they keep repeating themselves and they go to as many people as they can and tell the story I believe they're trying trying to grieve and heal but they don't have the mechanism and I don't know exactly why so I'm hoping someday Neuroscience will figure out what connection is missing and can we give people that so that they can grieve and heal well what that means is if you focus on emotions you're focusing on an area that's unresolved and has a lot of hurt and so if you say well how do you feel about that they almost always say I feel terrible I suggest not saying how you doing today because the answer I get is terrible you know what she did yesterday you know what he did last week so instead do small talk do it about anything except about how are you feeling today so don't ask how you're feeling focus on thinking and doing and an example I teach lawyers and mediators is don't say how do you feel about that proposal say what do you think about that could you picture doing that how could you do that how could that work for you CU if you focus how do you feel I feel insulted I feel abandoned and then they they drown in that and next thing you know you've lost them so avoid Emotions Don't focus on emotions but acknowledge emotions say I can see your frustration now here's how I can help you today the fourth is don't use names don't label people don't say you're a high conflict person and lawyers do that to motivate their clients it doesn't work don't say you have a personality disorder you may be wrong and that never motivates anybody so that's the four forget about it so that's key stuff for people to avoid so that was a long answer but when you're ready I have four simple tips for things to do was a great answer um would love to hear the four simple tips for people to pay attention to okay I'm so glad you asked that question so we have what I call the cars method and we've actually trademarked this cars method connecting analyzing responding and setting limits first is connect with the person so someone's angry with you or you're trying to help somebody with their problem is connect with them by giving them a statement that shows empathy attention Andor respect you know I can see how hard this is um I see your disappointment I hear your frustration I can understand by saying I can I'm showing I see them as an equal rather than looking down on them so that's the empathy rather than sympathy pay attention say I'll pay attention tell tell me more I want to understand your situation and and listen some and so what I see all the time as people say it's like oh good because I'm going to listen to them they don't have to prove they don't have to fight to get my attention and high conflict people often are fighting to get attention because they've turned everybody off and that's why I teach lawyers and therapists that they're going to come to you as much as anything else to get your attention so let them tell their story listen to them acknowledge the emotion so empathy attention and respect find something you respect about them you respect the kind of work they do you respect their relationship with their son or daughter or you respect their commitment to resolving this dispute so use those words and what's fascinating is I teach this to people like who I consult with and then they come back and say I did that and it really worked the person calmed down I had one woman who said um my boss was giving me a hard time and so I'd run into my office to try not to interact with her and I said next time especially like Monday morning or something is go up to her and say like you know how was your weekend and say or say you know I appreciated the presentation you gave last week give her some empathy attention and or respect you don't have to do all three of these just any one of these often calms the relationship and I remember checking back with this woman a month later and she says guess what bill now I'm her favorite employee but she's picking on somebody else so I gave somebody else your book but the idea is connect with people so empathy attention and respect and ear statements we call it and people say they really remember that because you can use that with anybody anywhere even with your kids genuine respect right has to be honest yeah you're you're not puffing them up yes think about that now if you don't respect them and you don't have empathy for them tell them you'll pay attention and listen and often you'll start developing some empathy or or respect for them but you can always pay attention and listen so that's connecting the second area and these aren't exactly steps but these are four areas high conflict people have difficulty the second is emotions kind of cloud their thinking so we want to help them think so you want to move to analyzing give them an a way to think so you're kind of calming the emotions and now you're saying let's think about this so present problems as a choice you know could do this now or do this tomorrow um or here's the options I see there's three ways you could approach this problem so you're getting people thinking about the problem rather than reacting and when you give a choice it kind of forces them into logical problem solving so one way you can do this is especially if you have a professional relationship like employer employee therapist client stuff like that is have them write a list they're talking they saying this is wrong and that's wrong and that's wrong you say whoa whoa whoa write write a list of these problems so I get a clearer picture when you write a list you calm down and I've had this over and over again angry people when they're writing a list calm down they start thinking about I've done this with with like like a doctor once he was having trouble with the nurses and it was like they're doing everything well all right right list of all the things they're doing wrong and pretty soon you start thinking you know there's this other thing they do but it's not so bad actually and I want them to do this on the leftand side of the page because on the right hand page side we're going to start looking at what are possible solutions and you really calm people down I've done this as a media I've had both people okay I want you to write two lists like business partners now say you're trying to decide whether to split up or keep the Business Partnership so I want you both to write a list what you would do if you split up wind down the partnership the steps you'd have to take and another list what the steps would be if you could make it work between you so let's meet in a week and we'll look at your list come back a week later they say you know what we both wrote our list we immediately called each other and realized we should terminate the partnership but we have one last big project we want to do together and we realize now we can go our separate ways in peace we really have different goals it's not her fault it's not her fault this was two women who work together and so writing a list helps this is all under analyzing the a of the carus method having the person make a proposal say make me a proposal I tell managers as soon as you can tell your employees that now that I'm your manager whenever you bring me a problem and I want you to bring me problems when they're small because conflicts that are small much easier to resolve always bring a solution to the problem I want to hear your proposed solution because you know the problem better than I do you're getting them to think so high conflict people I believe have a bandwidth for problem solving and some are brilliant heads of companies um inventors all that stuff they got a big bandwidth for conflict but they also have a bandwidth for problem solving you want to aim at that and bring that out so that's analyzing R is for responding high conflict people because they blame so much are always saying you should have done this you didn't do that our tendency is to argue with high conflict people and that's a forget about it you're trying to give them Insight it's not going to work so instead give them what we call a Biff response that's brief informative just straight information don't tell them you're wrong just tell them what the information is and do it in a friendly Manner and have it be firm have it end the discussion most commonly Biff responses are in writing and we teach this as an email method and we estimate there's about a million people doing Biff now because we taught it to about half a million people professionals and individuals we've got four little Biff books we've got brief informative friendly and firm firm and those four things friendly is is a immaterial well a touch of friendliness so what I say like like someone writes to you and say you know you're doing everything wrong and you're right back and you say thank you for telling me your concerns here's some information you may not like say someone tells me Bill your methods are never going to work and I could instantly defensive and so thank you for telling me your concerns um you may not be aware but about a million people are using this method now and um I wish you well something like that so A Touch of friendliness doesn't have to be a lot and firm doesn't mean harsh it just means try to end the Hostile conversation so don't respond to their distortions maybe even when they say you've done this or misinformation or hostility is just give them a Biff response and I tell that sometimes to business owners sometimes public figures is they might say like politicians sometimes terrible things are said about them and they go but they're not true and they're going to go well I'm going to ignore that cuz no one will believe that but then people believe it a great example Domino's Pizza about 10 years ago this is a great story I love it and I also eat Domino's Pizza I won't get into the details but somebody said something that grossed people out and their stock just dropped two employees did did something to the pizza within so first they were going we're going to ignore that everyone's going to realize that was a dumb thing two employees did well their stock dropped like 10% or something like that so two days later the head of Domino's Pizza puts out a 90 second video and it gets spread around and what he says is two former employees did this gross thing and that doesn't represent us and most important to us is our customers we're totally dedicated to you this is never going to happen again we've done everything to blah blah blah blah blah so they bounced right back and in my mind 90 second video didn't do a 20 minute explanation of how we do this that just 90 second video head of the company put it out there bounced right back and to me that was a Biff response even though we never heard of it brief informative friendly and firm so that's uh cars c a that's R that's the responding what's uh s the S is setting limits and this may be the most important with high conflict people because they one of their biggest problems is they don't stop themselves they keep going in areas where most people stop themselves they keep talking they talk a lot they create a problem and keep creating the problem they don't stop and so people around them have to stop them and we're not used to stopping other people's behavior most people manage themselves and part of writing my books is I believe today that we have more high conflict behavior and everyone needs to learn skills to set limits on on bullies on high conflict people's behavior it's all about Behavior they're not bad people but they don't have the self-restraint so setting limits and key things here don't blame them don't blame yourself say there's a policy there's a rule there's a law how it looks to people is do this instead of doing that so that behavior and if you keep doing that behavior here's what the consequence is so I I have a method I call slick so everything I've got initials got acronyms that's all right scientists have acronyms military science and apparently Bill Ed high conflict methods so slick is setting limits and imposing consequences so with high conflict people you might set the limit like you say you know I'll give an example as a lawyer I represented a woman victim of domestic violence her ex-husband to be didn't have a lawyer so that means he's allowed to talk to me I have to talk to him negotiate solve problems so he calls me up and he says we've got to solve this problem you tell that blankety blank blank wife of mine I said hold on you can't talk about my client that way he said I'll talk about her anyway I want to she's a blankety blank blank or whatever so he didn't respect my limit at all so then I said if you keep talking like that I'm going to hang up and so it's up to you says I'll talk about her any way I want keeps talking like that say okay you've chosen for me to hang up I'm hanging up now call me when you're ready to be civil so end the call next morning he calls me back he says Mr ready we have to solve this problem my blankety blank blank wife and I say hang on remember I'm going to hang up if you talk like that he says oh no no no don't hang up we have to solve this problem I'll try not to say those words and he doesn't say those words we get to address the problem so the consequence is what stopped him not the limit and I think it's a brain thing that they're so absorbed in the emotions of the moment that they can't picture that their behavior has a consequence so if the people around them point out there's a consequence if you do that is kind of a jolt to them oh I don't want that consequence and so with high conflict people you often have to tell them the consequence when you set the limit and be ready to impose the consequence so that's setting limits imposing consequences they have to go together with high conflict people love it and I know that those listening and watching really appreciate this I mean these are incredibly valuable tools I mean I can say from my own life and I know observing the experiences of others and what people have shared with me that um here I have to be careful because I don't want to place blame let me phrase this correctly that um the ability to navigate interactions with high conflict personalities well can lead to a dramatic Improvement in people's lives both for the non- high conflict personalities and the high conflict personalities and that a failure to do that does exactly the opposite so look uh really want to thank you for doing the work that you do as a lawyer as a therapist the research that you've done you're you're incredibly well researched and thorough sent me papers in advance of this in addition to having written all these books that we'll provide links to in the show note captions I've read several of them but I plan to read the others as well you have a a book um specifically on relationships um you have uh books on bullies you have a book about uh five types of people that can ruin your life um and several others as well so we'll put um links to those as well as some other resources related to your work and also just want to thank you for you know being a contributor to public education I mean that's what this podcast is um people listen to this podcast in hopes of gleaning information that they can really apply and that they can pass on to others and you're doing incredible work you're also teaching in the University system later today so you're quite quite busy and we're deeply appreciative that you took the time to come educate us so on behalf of myself and everyone listening and watching I just want to extend you know a deep gratitude thank you're trying to make the world a better place and you are making the world a better place thank you so much I appreciate the chance to speak with you and get this out great well come back again and um tell us more about bullies and the rest there's a lot more to cover we'd love to have you back thank you for joining me for today's discussion with Bill Eddie I hope you found it to be as interesting and practically informative as I did to learn more about Bill Ed's work and to find links

Title: The Effects of Microplastics on Your Health & How to Reduce Them
Published: 2024-10-21 12:01:14 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I explain what microplastics are, their prevalence in the human body and environment, and their common sources, as well as their potential negative health impacts. I provide practical strategies for limiting exposure to microplastics, nanoplastics, and endocrine disruptors such as bisphenol-A (BPA), bisphenol-S (BPS), phthalates, and PFAS ("forever chemicals"). Additionally, I discuss methods to enhance the body's detoxification and excretion of microplastics.

By the end of this episode, you will have a clear understanding of the modern science of microplastics and their impact on human biology, along with actionable steps to minimize exposure and accumulation in the brain and body.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today we are discussing microplastics microplastics are an extremely interesting and important topic that everyone should know about and the reason is microplastics are indeed everywhere they are in the air they are in beverages we consume they are lining the inside of Soup cans they are lining the inside of paper cups made to hold hot water coffee and tea and there are a lot of animal data and indeed some human data showing that microplastics which consist of particles of different sizes can be very detrimental to our health at the same time it's important to realize that as of now we don't have any causal data linking microplastics to spefic specific human diseases that said there's a lot of correlative data and today we are going to review those correlative data and most importantly we are going to discuss the various things that we can each and all do to limit our exposure to microplastics or at least to facilitate the removal of microplastics from our body because as we'll soon discuss you have microplastics in essentially every organ and tissue of your body right now and you are constantly being bombarded with microplastics so the challenge for me and indeed for you as well is to frame this topic of microplastics accurately it's important that we understand they are out there they are in us and indeed they can cause serious issues for our health however we also need to take agency we need to understand how we can limit What's called the bioaccumulation of microplastics in our organs and tissues and I don't want to be alarmist today's episode is not about getting you to be petrified or about developing some sort of hypoc assis about microplastics it's designed to inform you about what they are where they exist where they exist in particularly high amounts and the things that you can do to limit their impact on your biology because I think it's fair to say that we are not going to rid the Earth of microplastics they are just too pervasive now the one caveat is that there are certain populations of people in particular people that are pregnant or people that have young children and those young children themselves that should really strive to limit their exposure to microplastics so by the end of today's episode you can be confident that you'll understand a lot about what microplastics are the impact that they are currently having some of the potential impact that people are starting to investigate and ways that you can limit their negative impact on your brain and bodily Health before you begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the General Public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium in the correct ratios but no sugar now I and others on the podcast have talked a lot about the critical importance of hydration for proper brain and bodily function research shows that even a slight degree of dehydration can really diminish cognitive and physical performance it's also important that you get adequate electrolytes in order for your body and brain to function at their best the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium are critical for the functioning of all the cells in your body especially your neurons or nerve cells to make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of hydration and electrolytes I dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning and I drink that basically first thing in the morning I also drink element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing especially on hot days if I'm sweating a lot and losing water and electrolytes element has a lot of different great tasting flavors element my favorite is the watermelon although I also confess I like the raspberry and the Citrus basically I like all the flavors of element if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element.com huberman spelled drink lnt.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with the purchase of any element drink mix again that's drink element.com huberman to claim a free sample pack today's episode is also brought To Us by betterhelp betterhelp offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out out entirely online now I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years initially I didn't have a choice it was a condition of being allowed to stay in high school but pretty soon I realized that therapy is an extremely important component to overall health in fact I consider doing regular therapy just as important as getting regular exercise including cardiovascular exercise and resistance training exercise which of course I also do every week now there are essentially three things that great therapy provides first it provides a good rapport with somebody that you can really trust and talk to about any and all issues that concern you second of all great therapy provides support in the form of emotional support but also directed Guidance the dos and the not todos and third expert therapy can help you arrive at useful insights that you would not have arrived at otherwise insights that allow you to do better not just in your emotional life in your relationship life but also the relationship to yourself and your professional life and to all sorts of career goals with better help they make it very easy to find an expert therapist with whom you can really resonate with and provide you with these three benefits that I described if you'd like to try betterhelp go to betterhelp.com huberman to get 10% off your first month again that's betterhelp.com slh huberman okay let's talk about microplastics what are microplastics microplastics as the name suggests are little itty bitty bits of plastic how itty bitty well microplastics range in size from one micron which is 1 1,000th of a millimeter all the way up to 5 millim in diameter okay so anything in that size range is considered a microplastic anything smaller than that so anything smaller than one micron in diameter 1 1,000th of a millimeter in diameter is considered a nanoplastic and indeed there are lots of microplastics floating around in the air there are lots of nanoplastics floating around in the air there's lots of both of those things in the ocean there a lot of those things in food especially packaged food there are a lot of those things lining cups there are a lot of those things in everything that we consume essentially so what does it mean to have all these microplastics and nanoplastics floating around in our environment and going into our body through fluids and Foods Etc well there is some serious concern because these microplastics potentially can disrupt cellular Health organ health and could potentially lead to certain forms of disease we'll talk about the ways they could potentially do that however I want to also emphasize that your body is incredibly good at dealing with for foreign Invaders it's very good at getting rid of stuff that isn't good for it however microplastics and nanoplastics have been shown to Lodge within specific tissues and stay there for long periods of time so you'll notice during today's episode I'm going to go back and forth between the stuff that's really scary and then reassuring you that we're not sure whether or not we need to be that scared about these microplastics and nanoplastics yet okay what I want to do is give you the evidence so you can decide how much effort you put into limiting your exposure to these microplastics and nanoplastics and how much effort you put into trying to rid your body of them okay I'm not here to paint the picture one way or the other because frankly the data just don't line up with one argument or the other that they're extremely dangerous or that they're nothing to worry about let me give you an example of something that you might have heard in the media and on recent podcasts out there that's very scary the argument based on what seem to be a pretty high quality publication that you may have heard is that every single week we ingest up to a credit card's worth of microplastics and nanoplastics okay you might have seen that in headlines and in other podcasts and indeed there was a paper arguing that however a more recent paper looked at the quantitative analysis they used used a different quantitative analysis and claimed that they vastly overestimated the amount of plastic that we ingest every week what do I mean by vastly overestimated this newer analysis of the same data claims that the credit card's worth of plastic that it was argued we can consume every week well that was an overestimate by a millionfold and in fact it would take 23,000 years to consume enough plastic to lead to that credit card's worth of plastic in our bodies okay so now we have very discrepant data or rather we have very discrepant analyses of the same data so you're starting to get a picture of just how confusing this whole field is but we're going to parse it a little bit further by saying that it's also very clear that microplastics and nanoplastics Plastics are everywhere okay they're just everywhere you look in fact if I were a PhD adviser for somebody in toxicology or a PhD adviser for somebody in environmental science and they needed to have a Sure Fire publication I'd probably suggest that they work on microplastics and go out there and try and find yet another source of microplastics and use a better analysis for instance okay doing a graduate thesis isn't just about getting a publication but what I'm trying to refer to here is that wherever people look for microplastic they find them this is true in our environment and this is true in food this is true in water and this is also true for our tissues so in the last couple of years there's been an explosion in the number of scientific studies exploring which tissues of the human body so not just animal models but the human body contain microplastics and nanoplastics okay so by examining postmortem tissues that is tissues from people who are deceased it's been discovered that there are microplastics and nanoplastics lodged in the brain so if you take the brain of a deceased adult human what you find is that they have about 05% of the total weight of the brain from microplastic so this is about a teaspoon of salt or sugars worth of microplastics might not seem like much but if you think about how little neurons are um a typical neuron will have a cell body this is the area that contains the nucleus with all the DNA and so forth uh that cell bodies of neurons vary in size tremendously ly they can be as small as you know five to eight microns across to as much as gosh I've seen some neurons down the microscope that are um you know 50 microns I've seen some that are 100 microns across it depends where you look in the nervous system okay so if you start to think about a half teaspoon of powder of microplastics and nanoplastics that's a lot of microplastics and nanoplastics that could be distributed in lots of different places in the brain and a little bit later we'll talk about what the potential impact is of these microplastics and nanoplastics on the function of particular types of neurons that may impact things like neurodevelopmental trajectories okay the argument has been made I'm not making this argument but the argument has been made that microplastics and nanoplastics may correlate with things like autism May correlate with things like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder I don't actually believe that the data there are strong enough to make those arguments at all however I will tell you that the presence of microp Plastics and nanoplastics in the brains that is postmortem tissue okay so decease people taking the brain chopping up the brain looking at down the microscope and seeing microplastics and then quantifying the amount of microplastics in different compartments of the brain and distribute it across the brain that is concerning to me in the sense that there's enough of it in there and the function of neurons in the nervous system is precise enough that you could imagine given that these microplastics and nanoplastics are lodged in particular categories of neurons that do in fact impact things like reward and motivation things like movement Etc that they could be impacting the function of the nervous system but there's no direct causal relationship at least not in humans there's some interesting data in animal models we'll get back to that a little bit later so there's microplastics and nanoplastics in brain you'll find microplastics and nanoplastics in other tissues that have a blood organ barrier what do I mean by that well the brain is encapsulated in the so-called BBB the blood brain barrier and that's because your brain tissue because it doesn't turn over across the lifespan you don't produce many new neurons there are a few places you produce new neurons like the olfactory bulb the dentate gyus of the hippocampus a few places but these are far and few between most of your brain tissue that you're born with is the brain tissue that you're going to die with provided you don't lose that brain tissue through the course of your lifespan through a head injury or something like that the neurons you have when you are born actually are far more numerous than the neurons you have at the time when you die this is important and it's one of the reasons we have a bloodb brain barrier nature is very smart IT designed a barrier so that molecules that might be dangerous to the brain can't enter the brain and that's what the BBB is for microplastics and nanoplastics are making it from the bloodstream into the brain okay this is what I mean when I say they can cross the blood brain barrier then if we take a step back and we ask ourselves what are some other tissues in the body that have a very robust barrier from the blood because a lot of things get into the blood and that's not necessarily good but it's not necessarily bad if you can excrete those things right we have a lot of detoxification mechanisms that include our liver detoxification Etc but if these particles are getting from the blood into the brain what are some other tissues that they're getting into that have these thick barriers or these very stringent barriers as you can imagine two other tissues that have very stringent blood to organ barriers are the blood testicular barrier why would that be okay why would you protect brain Well it can't renew you don't want those neurons to get contaminated with things so you put a BB be in a blood brain barrier you also put a blood testicular barrier in males why well that's where the DNA are that's where the so-called germ cells are so you don't want things getting into the testicle and mutating the DNA there because then those mutated DNA could be passed on to offspring guess what microplastics and nanoplastics can cross the blood testicular barrier and in fact there was a lot of press this last year about microplastics and nanoplastics being present in every human testicle that was analyzed in or I should say from postmortem tissue likewise there's a blood follicle barrier in females okay this is where the eggs come from and microplastics and nanoplastics can cross the blood follicular barrier so this is why people are starting to get concerned right I suppose we shouldn't be so surprised that we're inhaling microplastics given that they are everywhere I should mention that you know there wasn't much plastic around or in use prior to the 1950s if any of you have ever seen the movie The Graduate with Dustin Hoffman this is the only time you'll see somebody driving Eastward across the bay bridge all right toward from San Francisco toward Berkeley on the top deck it actually runs in the other direction they shut down the baybridge that's in The Graduate and the other thing that's in The Graduate is this famous scene if you're old enough like me to Remember the movie The Graduate Dustin Hoffman's lying in the pool it's after his graduation he's lying in the pool he doesn't really know what he's going to do with his life and this guy comes up to him and he says you know the future is Plastics and it became this kind of famous line or pseudo famous line now that movie takes place at at a time when Plastics were really booming as an industry and indeed polyethylene polyurethane these plastic materials were developed because they were very durable they were long lasting in fact they are not biodegradable they're not broken down very easily if at all and certainly not within biological tissues these Plastics went from essentially non-existent in the 1940s and prior to in pretty much everything involved in manufacturing okay even in different aspects of uh surgical implants and things of that sort so Plastics are indeed everywhere and that started in the 1950s hence that line from The Graduate so it's not surprising that microplastics and nanoplastics would get into our body right if they're everywhere in our environment and we're inhaling them all day then of course they'll get into our lungs and then they're small enough they can get into our bloodstream but as I mentioned the body has these cleansing systems these detoxification systems to remove things but they're not removing the microplastics or at least not all of them from brain testicle and follicle and I should point out that microplastics and nanoplastics are also found in all the other tissues of the body in fact I don't think there's a single investigation of human tissue or animal tissue for microplastics or nanoplastics where they didn't get a positive result meaning where they didn't find them in the tissue you can find them in not just the upper lungs but in the lower lungs so they're getting deposited in the lower lungs you can find them in the bloodstream from from a blood draw you can find them in human placenta and you can find them in What's called the meconium which is the first stool that a baby takes this is typically taken within the or the stool is given given taken it's taken by the doctor it's actually analyzed for various things it contains bile and a bunch of other things it's actually an important indicator of the health of the child um it turns out that this first stool that happens in the first 24 hours or so after birth when that's been analyzed for microplastics there too you find microplastics and nanoplastics and that's really got people concerned because what this means is that microplastics and nanop Plastics that mothers are ingesting or that they somehow have lodged in their bodies are making their way to the fetus now you could say well is it really a problem well a few years ago is it was at least concerning enough that bpas and we'll talk more about bpas bisphenol a which is a component of microplastics this is a known endocrine disruptor it disrupts certain estrogen-like Pathways we'll get into this in a few minutes bisphenol a and bpas were banned from sippy cups and kids and from any food containers for young kids so the FDA in the United States and there are European countries as well had enough date on this or enough concern about this to say listen we are going to make it illegal to have BPA line sippy cups or food containers for young kids in part because the BPA is correlated with microplastics and nanoplastics so what I'm saying here is that the government has taken pretty avid measures to restrict the amount of BPA exposure through microplastics and nanoplastics to young kids and yet the fetus clearly is being exposed to microplastics and nanoplastics this is why at the beginning I mentioned if you are pregnant or you have young kids or if you are a young kid you want to go out of your way to limit your exposure to these microplastics and nanoplastics but if you're an older adult you probably want to do the same and we'll talk about ways that you can do that so I could go on and on about the various tissues besides placenta in your bloodstream brain testes follicle lower lungs you can find nanoplastics in the liver you can find microplastics and nanoplastics in pretty much every tissue that you look for them the real question is how detrimental are these microplastics and nanoplastics and then of course we can talk about where they're coming from specifically in ways that you can control and limit and when I say control and limit what we're really talking about here is yes trying to limit your exposure to these things if I were to w rattle off the different sources of microplastics and nanoplastics you would go wide-eyed and you would probably also just say okay I Surrender they're truly everywhere in fact I'll do that okay I can't help but do that but keep in mind you do have some control uh in terms of the end result of these microplastics and nanoplastics on your health so here I go plastic bags storage containers bottle caps rope gear strapping utensils cups floats coolers containers rope fishing nets textiles sorry I'm not laughing because it's funny I'm laughing CU it's just pretty much everywhere latex paint Coatings medical devices Automotive Parts tires on the road degrading giving off little microplastics into the air microplastics raining down from the sky literally pipe film containers laminated safety glass car windshield oh great even the car windshield drinking bottles textile fibers resins paints varnish construction Automotive Parts okay so basically everywhere right these things are everywhere huh so what are we to do well what we are to do is to limit the long-term accumulation of microplastics and nanoplastics in our system there are ways that we can limit their introduction to our system but as long as you're breathing as long as you're walking around as long as you're near a road you are exposed to microplastics so until there's a huge movement to make better tires that don't degrade as quickly or to create filters in our home environments that remove the microplastics which frankly I think both of those things are not reasonable expectations at least not in this lifetime well until then what you can do is you can try and limit their entry and accumulation into your body so rather than list off all the ways that you can limit so-called bio accumulation of microplastics and nanoplastics at the beginning or at the end of today's episode I'm going to intersperse them at times that are relevant to what I just discussed about how microplastics get into our system and the tissues they are lodged in so I'll tell you right now that a few ways that you can really do your a service in limiting your exposure to microplastics is to limit your consumption of water from plastic bottles okay that might seem kind of obvious but check out these data this is pretty wild there was an analysis of the number of microplastic and nanoplastic particles in bottled water and it was estimated that there were about 30,000 of these particles per liter of water okay and those data stood for quite a long time then Imaging techniques for measuring the number of these different particles in particular the really small Nano particles the ones that are less than one micron in diameter the Imaging tools for those improved okay and I'll explain a little bit about that in a moment and there was a paper published in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2024 that showed that the amount of nanoplastic in particular but microplastic and nanoplastics that are present in bottled water was actually vastly underestimated in that previous study rather than 30,000 particles per liter the reanalysis with better methods showed that it was anywhere from 110 all the way up to 400,000 particles per liter and the average was 240,000 particles per liter so that means that the amount of microplastics and nanoplastics in bottled water is actually much much higher than we initially thought and a very simple way to limit your exposure to microplastics and nanoplastics is to avoid drinking water from plastic bottles in particular plastic bottles that have been heated up now you might say well I don't heat up my plastic water bottles right but you don't know what happened to those plastic water bottles and root to the store you bought them at or and root to your refrigerator right they could have sat in the back of a hot truck they could have sat in the back of a loading dock any number of different things now this is not to say that if you drink the occasional water out of a plastic bottle that you're going to harm your health I'm absolutely not saying that however it's pretty clear that there's a lot of microplastics and nanoplastics that are completely avoidable at least avoidable in terms of your ingestion of them in plastic water bottles so it makes sense to me why you would want to avoid those also as a consumable that's not very reusable I suppose you could reuse those plastic bottles but most people don't at least they don't use them for very long they get pretty flimsy pretty quickly you're much better off having either a stainless steel bottle or some sort of ceramic mug or or using glass or using some other vessel for water that is reusable and of course that is not made of plastic and then of course the question arises how much microplastic and nanoplastic is in tap water and it turns out there's quite a lot of it now it varies according to location but there are ways that you can get those microplastics and nanoplastics out of your tap water the best way turns out to be a little bit expensive admittedly and that's to use a reverse osmosis filter so reverse osmosis filters will get rid of all the microplastics nanoplastics of course it will also remove some key minerals from the water so you'll have to remineralize that water if one looks at the price of reverse osmosis filtration systems they're not cheap uh they can range anywhere from 300 to 500 or even $600 for a home unit and many of those units will remineralize the water so basically it takes the water cleans out the microplastics nanoplastics and a bunch of other bad stuff that you don't want and then it's going to remineralize the water so that you're getting enough minerals your water now if you look at the cost of a reverse osmosis filter I like you kind of go a little wide-eyed like that's a lot of money for water but if one thinks about the total amount of money one spends in a given year on plastic bottled water that we consume and then you know throw away essentially the bottles or even bottled water from glass bottles I've in the habit of trying to drink water from glass bottles and when you go out and you buy those you feel better that you're not consuming a lot of microplastics and nanoplastics but they are very expensive so the costs probably line up pretty well and when I did that analysis I realized well actually the home reverse osmosis filter with remineralization actually will save on costs provided that one is good about filling glass bottles or stainless steel bottles with that water and making sure to you know when you leave the house to take those bottles with you again I don't think it's possible for everyone to avoid all consumption of water from plastic bottles that's just not reasonable to expect right you don't want to be that person that's carrying around water everywhere you go to friends houses at dinner Etc I don't think we need to be that concerned about the amount of microplastic and nanoplastic in water sources it's certainly you wouldn't want to avoid drinking water from plastic bottles to the point where you dehydrate yourself or put yourself at risk I'm not trying to create that kind of concern here what I'm trying to say is if you are concerned about microplastics and nanoplastics and you really want to limit your exposure one of the best ways to do that is to limit your consumption of water from plastic bottles and because microplastics and nanoplastics are present in tap water you're going to need some way to remove those microplastics and nanoplastics from your tap water if you're very concerned about them I'm not here to say everyone should do this I'm certainly not saying that I'm saying that if you are concerned about microplastics and nanoplastics and we'll talk about some of the reasons one might want to be concerned about them well then installing a reverse osmosis filtration system on your home water might be a good idea and it's likely to save you costs if you look at it in comparison to buying disposable bottles of water now there are a lot of other other ways besides drinking water from plastic bottles that microplastics and nanoplastics make their way into our system and I can list off many of them but I'm trying to create a hierarchy here of the things that are potentially the major sources and the ones that we can most easily avoid and that are likely to save us costs overall so one thing that's very clear is that there's a lot of microplastics and nanoplastics in sea salt who would have thought but then you think about it and it's like well this stuff is getting out into the ocean there's a lot of plastic in the ocean it's a super depressing scene when one sees the pictures of all the plastic floating out there in fact there's a book that I read in preparation for this episode gosh it was so depressing but important for me to read uh maybe you want to read it as well it's quite good although it it will be a bit of a downer uh the title of the book is a poison like no other how microplastics corrupted our planet and our bodies by Matt Simon and I listened to this book and gosh it really convinces you that there's microplastics every where both on land in the air and in the ocean unfortunately and of course sea salt comes from the ocean so a simple solution to this is if you're going to use salt and I'm a big fan of salt not overdoing it but salt has its role right it's a wonderful substance both for sake of taste and for sake of Health I did an episode about salt again don't over consume salt don't blast your blood pressure don't blow a gasket but many people would do well to have a little bit more salt especially if you're eating a really clean diet especially if you're hydrating very well focus on something like pink Himalayan salt or salt that comes from a nonmarine source okay it's very simple to do it's some of the best salt out there it's not terribly expensive and you would do well to avoid sea salt and get your salt from those other sources in doing so you're going to lower your exposure to microplastics and nanoplastics there's some pretty scary pictures of sea salt under the microscope and all the little bits of plas IC that are in there and you only have to see those pictures once or just hear it from me to make the shift to Himalayan sea salt or in the pink salt is pretty it looks nice it tastes great so that's an easy very lowcost shift that you can make I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens ag1 is designed to cover all of your foundational nutritional needs and it tastes great now I've been drinking ag1 since 2012 and I start started doing that at a time when my budget for supplements was really Limited in fact I only had enough money back then to purchase one supplement and I'm so glad that I made that supplement ag1 the reason for that is even though I strive to eat most of my foods from Whole Foods and minimally processed foods it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits vegetables vitamins and minerals micronutrients and adaptogens from food alone and I need to do that in order to ensure that I have enough energy throughout the day I sleep well at night and keep my immune system strong but when I take ag1 daily I find that all aspects of my health my physical health my mental health and my performance both cognitive and physical are better I know that because I've had lapses when I didn't take ag1 and I certainly felt the difference I also notice and this makes perfect sense given the relationship between the gut microbiome and the brain that when I regularly take ag1 which for me means a serving in the morning or mid- morning and again later in the afternoon or evening that I have more mental Clarity and more mental energy if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com / huberman to claim a special offer right now they're giving away five free travel packs and a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman to claim that special offer Okay so we've talked about bottled watered sources and filtering your water we talked about sea salt another major source of these microplastics that was very surprising to me is from the lining of canned soup I don't think I'm ever going to eat canned soup again unless I absolutely need to sorry cannn soup companies but there was a study the study was entitled canned soup consumption and urinary bisphenol a a randomized crossover trial I'll describe a little bit more about what bisphenol a is a little bit later but bisphenol a is a known endocrine disruptor it mimics estrogen in ways that can activate or block estrogenic Pathways so it messes up hormone Pathways either by activating them or blocking them it can also bind to Androgen receptors potentially and cause some issues there bisphenol a or BPA is not a good thing turns out there's lots of it in the lining of Soup cans the reason is soup tends to be a little bit fatty so even if you get the non-fat soup it tends to have some lipid in there and it also has some acidity to it and the lining helps maintain the flavor and the freshness of the soup in those cans in this study what they did is they gave people either fresh soup or canned soup for 5 days then they did a so-called two-day wash out where they took a break from soup and then they reversed the conditions I'll cut to the chase here because the conclusion of this study is wild what they found was that consumption of one serving of canned soup daily over the course of 5 days here I'm quoting by the way was associated with more than a th% increase in urinary BPA in bisphenol a now that's urinary BPA so people are excreting it I want to emphasize that but a thousandfold increase in BPA from canned soup I don't know I'm not alarmist but I only have to read this once think about my love of can soup not that great done I'm not eating canned soup again unless I'm absolutely starving and I need some soup very very badly my suggestion would be unless you have a powerful reason to consume canned soup don't consume canned soup the one caveat being that if you can find canned soup that does not have any BPA that is it says no bpas on the container well then go at it have as much canned soup as you want but I should be very clear that a lot of canned products now say no BPA but they contain other endocrine disruptors and the amount of microplastics and nanoplastics in those soups is still unknown so part of my hidden motivation of this episode and perhaps the motivation of other podcasters in the health space that are talking about microplastics now and by the way Dr Ronda Patrick did a really wonderful podcast about microplastics just recently we didn't coordinate that's why we both ended up doing it roughly at the same time we talked about it afterwards and chuckled about that I guess you know we're both interested in some of the same themes of course one of the perhaps hidden agendas is that some of these food manufacturing companies and beverage manufacturing companies will start to include more thorough descriptions on their labeling of what is and is not contained in the various products such as canned soup and water Etc not just no bpas but hopefully some of the other things that are problematic that we'll talk about in a moment such as BPS which is another endocrine disruptor so if you see no BPA sometimes there's still BPS in there okay we'll talk about BPS as well as phalates which are something that make plastic and other containers more durable and more flexible and phalates have been discussed by people like Dr Shaina Swan who will soon be a guest on this podcast and has shown up on other podcasts talking about how phalates are known endocrine disruptors in development and likely in adulthood as well so I guess my push for you to never consume canned soup again might be a little bit harsh that's just my decision here's what I'll do I'll make a bargain with the canned soup companies if you all start putting a more thorough description about what is and is not contained in those Soup cans all right not just no BPA but is there truly also no BPS are there no Fates Etc then maybe I'll make the move back to canned soup and of course most of you have probably heard that that you're not supposed to microwave plastic containers now you'll see microwave safe on a number of different containers that just means that it's not going to melt in the microwave it does not mean that you aren't being exposed to microplastics and nanoplastics and bpas BPS phalates Etc so in general it's a good idea to avoid putting any kind of plastic into the microwave at least if you're going to microwave food and then consume that food the other surprising at least to me source of bpas and bps's so these endocrine disruptors and microplastics and nanoplastics that's very robust is paper cups goodness gracious I would have thought paper cups are safe but you know those paper cups that you put hot liquids into and that often have a plastic lid well even if they don't have a plastic lid on them the lining of the paper cup which makes those cups durable when you put hot liquids in there like hot coffee or hot tea well that contains typically unless it says no BPA and no BPS it contains lots of BPA and bps's microplastics nanoplastics and so putting hot liquid in there actually there was an analysis that showed that if liquid that's heated up to 100° f is put in those containers it starts to leech out it starts to pull those microplastics nanoplastics bpas and BPS from the cup Linings so the other day I went across the street and bought a cup of coffee of course they sold it to me in a paper cup and I thought oh goodness I forgot to bring my mug and my my travel mug my stainless steel mug or my ceramic mug did I not purchase the coffee no I had already ordered the coffee I didn't walk back what I did is as soon as I got back I took the coffee and I poured it into a ceramic mug so I'm not extremist I'm not somebody who's going to completely avoid these things but in the future I'll try and remember to bring my mug over some places even give you a little discount on your coffee so again these are cost-saving approaches you're certainly limiting or reducing the amount of waste that you're creating in the world so that can only be a good thing okay and the plastic Lids probably a good idea to avoid drinking through those plastic Lids too often again I want to emphasize I'm not one of these people that's going to freak out about drinking a hot liquid through a plastic lid these microplastics and nanoplastics are everywhere we're consuming them all the time we can remove them from our body and later we'll talk about ways that you can accelerate or increase the amount of removal of them from your body but if we're just a little bit more conscious about how they get into our body and we're a little bit more conscious about the elevated cost and the elevated amount of trash that's going to recycle into landfill and so on probably a good idea to just bring your mug with you your travel mug with you try and make those mugs and travel mugs ceramic stainless steel or some other vessel that doesn't contain bpas or bps's before we move on to talk about what happens when microplastics and nanoplastics make it into say the testicle or the brain like what the consequences of that is and are I want to just briefly return to something that I flew past a while ago and that's the analysis of microplastics and nanoplastic particles that are in bottled water remember initially it was thought to be 30,000 particles per liter then later it was discovered using better techniques that it's actually more like 240,000 on average particles per liter how did that huge discrepancy in data arise now I realize this is not a data analysis discussion but I want to talk about this just briefly because it illustrates for you something really important about science which is as tools for measurement get better so does our understanding about what's going on in our brains and bodies and it's a very simple and kind of cool thing related to light so you could imagine that the first paper was looking under the microscope at a drop of water taken from a bottle that was plastic and then imaged the number of little plastic particles in there you'd say well there's a particle and there's a particle and there's a particle and there are tools that can count those particles well what if you have two particles that are really close together right if you recall microplastics are anywhere from one micron in diameter all the way up to 5 millimet in diameter but nanoplastics are less than one micron in diameter so how do you know that when you see a clump of stuff under the microscope in that drop of water that you're looking at one big piece of plastic versus thousands and thousands of little pieces of nanoplastic or even just much smaller pieces of microplastic well it has to do with What's called the point spread function and I don't really want to get into this in too much detail but basically when you shine light on something you get uh kind of a little Hill of light if you will there's a Peak at the center and then it had drops off with distance the reason why the numbers jumped from 30,000 to 240,000 is not because the researchers got much better it's because the tools got much better okay there are new Imaging techniques and I'll put a reference to this for those of you that into this kind of stuff entitled rapid single particle chemical Imaging of nanoplastics by SRS microscopy okay pretty nerdy stuff but it's fun if you're interested in light and how light can illuminate things and show detail or not detail but basically what we're realizing is that there are a lot more particles of plastic in different tissues in different things that we're ingesting Etc because we're getting better and better ways of separating those clumps of light into lots of little clumps of light and realizing oh that looked like one particle right remember it's particles per liter it's not one particle it's 10,000 particles now you might say okay well what's the difference between a bunch of little particles and one big particle ah there's a big difference what's the big difference little particles can make it across barriers that big particles can't these little nanop particles of plastic are especially concerning because those are the ones that you find in greatest abundance or I should say among the Plastics that you find in different tissues the ones that are in greatest abundance in the brain the testes and the follicle again these tissues that nature and evolution have gone out of their way to protect with these very stringent barriers like the blood brain barrier like the blood testicular barrier like the blood follicle barrier those are the ones that are getting across because they're very very small they can sneak through the little holes in those biological fences they're getting deposited in those tissues brain testicle and follicle and they're staying there at least until people die which in the case of the analysis of postmortem tissue is many many decades later okay so I'm not just raising this discussion about ways to disambiguate large particles from small particles just to be nerdy and Technical it turns out to be a really important issue with real biological implications okay so lots of itty bitty little pieces of plastic getting their way into tissues like brain follicle testes liver lung Etc what are some of the implications of this now there are a lot of animal data data in fish data in mice Etc that have explored how microplastics and nanoplastics can disrupt any number of different biological functions but it's probably worth looking at how nanoplastic and microplastic accumulation in specific tissues is correlated with specific Health detriments in humans even though the data are correlative right it's much harder to get causal data from Human studies because the animal studies frankly are hard to translate to humans in this case in particular because a lot of the features of animal biology while similar to human biology humans are animals but you get the point they don't correspond so easily when looking at microplastics and nanoplastics for the following reason let's say you have a little fish that fish is a couple centimeters long and it turns out there's uh I don't know about an aspirin size of microplastics and nanoplastics in that fish when that fish is analyzed postmortem you say okay well that's kind of a lot right an aspirin's worth in a or an aspirin siiz batch of microplastics and nanoplastics in that little fish and then you look in humans and you realize okay well there's more microplastics and nanoplastics but not that much more how much of a detriment is there really going to be can you look at the study in the fish seeing for instance and this has been demonstrated that you have disruption in neurological Pathways the formation of those Pathways like brain development is altered reproductive function is altered Etc it's hard to translate we don't really know what it means in terms of humans so we'll turn to the correlative data in humans and I'll look to the strongest data at least that I could find out there and there kind of three major cases that I think are worth highlighting the first one is that there was a study done in humans this is published in 2021 it was published in the Journal of environmental science and technology that found much higher levels of microplastics in the stool samples of people that were diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome okay irritable bowel syndrome is very disruptive to people's well-being there isn't an obvious cure for irritable bowel syndrome although some people find Relief by improving their gut microbiota by limiting body-wide and gut inflammation through any number of different things improving sleep and eating a low- inflammation diet Etc this is something that I'll probably cover in a future episode of the hubman podcast gastrointestinal challenges that is so I want to be very clear there was no direct causation established but it was clear that there were higher levels of microplastics found in the stool tissue coming from people who had irritable bowel syndrome than in individuals who did not have irritable bowel syndrome and while no study is perfect they included a number of important controls in the experiment to control for age range and some other features so it's reasonable to assume that the accumulation of microplastics in the gut or somewhere along the GI tract had somehow led to or related to irritable bowel syndrome okay now you could also Imagine the reverse this is very important to understand you could also imagine that people who had irritable bowel syndrome perhaps are less good at filtering microplastics and nanoplastics from the food and liquids they consume than are people who don't have irritable bowel syndrome so the causality if it exists at all could run in either direction or both nonetheless I think it's an interesting study and if you're somebody who suffers from gastrointestinal distress such as irritable bowel syndrome or otherwise I think you'd be wise indeed all people would be wise but I think you'd be especially wise to take into consideration some of the to-dos and not to-dos that I'm covering during today's episode such as avoiding consuming water from plastic bottles some of the stuff we talked about earlier avoiding canned soup and other BPA BPS containing containers and things of that sort or things that come from those containers the other area where there was some really interesting correlative data relates to reproductive function and Hormone Health and this is where we can start to get into a bit more detail about bpas and bps's and phalates and some of their roles in disrupting endocrine that is hormone Pathways so there's a study I'll put a link to in the show note captions that's entitled the urinary phalate metabolites are associated with decreased serum testosterone so that's in blood in men women and children okay this is an interesting study for a number of reasons first of all it emphasizes something that everybody should know which is that testosterone plays key roles in men women and kids okay it is not the case that testosterone is just present in men and boys it's also present in women and girls and it plays an important role in everybody okay it's involved of course in some of the things that we normally associate with testosterone such as muscle mass bone density strength Etc but testosterone can be converted to estrogen testosterone is involved in libido in both men and women it's involved in brain development in boys and girls in genitalia development and on and on so it's an important hormone and it was clear from this study that elevated levels of phalates that is phalate metabolites are associated with lower testosterone levels in all those populations they point out quote that the strongest and most consistent inverse relationships between level of phalates and testosterone that is elevated phalate metabolites lower testosterone were found among women ages 40 to 60 years this is very important if you saw the episode that we did with Dr Mary Clair Haver on per menopause menopause she emphasized that per menopause menopause which typically sets in somewhere between one's late 40s and 6s okay there's huge variation there sometimes as early as one's 30s that would be early however more often in one's 40s and 50s sometimes as late as 60s involves reductions in estrogen but also in testosterone and this has major implications for creating less feelings of vigor lowered libido less recovery from exercise and other life stressors and things of that sort now the study also interestingly shows that in quote adult men the only significant or suggestive inverse association between phalate metabolites and testosterone were observed among men 40 to 60 years old now there are a number of different ways that we could interpret those data one is that men younger than 40 have high enough levels of testosterone that or the ranges ofest testosterone are great enough in that sample of younger than 40 years old that somehow that was able to swamp out any reductions in testosterone that were caused by phalate metabolites or rather that once men get from 40 to 60 years old that there's somehow a vulnerability of the testosterone Pathways to phalates or and none of these are mutually exclusive of course that the phalates had built up in those men's system over a number of years and then we're having their major effects on those men between 40 and 60 years old I do find it interesting that the major effects were observed in both men and women 40 to 60 years old and the interpretation of those data that makes the most sense to me at least is that there's a cumulative effect of these phalates over time that reveals itself at least statistically in men and women once they reach 40 to 60 years so what are these thades well these thades are things that are included in Plastics that house liquids and foods that we eat or that we cook with or that simply exist in our environment and are getting broken down and that we're inhaling and then are making their way across the blood testes barrier blood follicle barrier or into any number of other tissues those phalates are there of course to make plastic more flexible and durable but they are known endocrine disruptors Dr Shaina swan has done beautiful work showing that young animals and potentially humans who are exposed to phalates from things like pesticides in particular can actually have a fairly major disruption in What's called the anogenital distance okay withhold your Chuckles the distance between the penis and the anus uh in people that have been exposed to phalates or mothers of boys that have been exposed to phalates those boys are born with a shorter penile to anal distance okay typically it's of a certain distance and there's a correlation with reduced anogenital distance that is a external marker okay it's not that that itself is necessarily A Bad Thing that's not what we're saying here but that's an external marker that can be measured in mice and there are some studies that are exploring that in humans as well that correlates with a number of other things including lower sperm counts reduced sperm motility and things of that sort likewise bpas the bisphenol A and BPS are known endocrine disruptors I talked about this a little bit earlier they're known to bind estrogen receptors so they mimic estrogen sometimes they activate those estrogen receptor dependent Pathways so they literally mimic estrogen sometimes they block those estrogen receptors so the estrogen cannot have the normal role of docking in those receptors and causing their normal functions and BPA and to some extent BPS and potentially phalates can dock to Androgen receptors as well sometimes referred to as testosterone receptors Androgen receptors so the point is that bpas bps's and phalates are not good for endocrine function and they are present in basically all Plastics unless it says no BPA or all phalates removed they're present in herbicides Etc and they are of real concern and it's very clear as I mentioned earlier that you can detect microplastics in human testes and I didn't mention this earlier and in semen and it is now very clear that that's correlated with reduced sperm counts and lower sperm motility now I also want to be very clear remember I'm not an alarmist I want to be clear that just because sperm counts are significantly lower and people that have a certain amount of microplastics and nanoplastics potentially in their testes or that they've been exposed to does not necessarily mean that they're infertile it is true that total sperm count and sperm motility forward motility being an important indicator of sperm Health are correlated with one's ability to fertilize an egg okay this was covered in a quite long but quite detailed episode that I did about fertility in both males and females there a number of things one can do to increase sperm counts or to at least limit sperm count depletion there number of things that one can do to improve sperm motility I encourage you to check out that episode I'll provide a link to it in the show note captions in fact I'll link to the specific time stamp in the show note captions that gets to those uh particular strategies but the point here is that microplastics and nanoplastics are found in human testes and that's correlated with reductions in sperm count and reductions in sperm motility I'd like to take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors function I recently became a function member after searching for the most comprehensive approach to lab testing while I've long been a fan of blood testing I really wanted to find a more in-depth program for analyzing blood urine and saliva to get a full picture of my heart health my hormone status my immune system regulation my metabolic function my vitamin and mineral status and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality function not only provides testing of over 100 biomarkers key to physical and mental health but it also analyzes these results and provides insights from to doctors on your results for example in one of my first tests with function I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood this was totally surprising to me I had no idea prior to taking the test function not only helped me detect this but offered medical doctor informed insights on how to best reduce those mercury levels which included limiting my tuna consumption because I'd been eating a lot of tuna while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens and supplementing with Knack and acetylcysteine both of which can support glutathione production and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels comprehensive lab testing like this is so important for health and while I've been doing it for years I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive I've been so impressed by function both at the level of ease of use that is getting the test done as well as how comprehensive and how actionable the tests are that I recently joined their Advisory Board and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast if you'd like to try function go to function health.com huberman function currently has a weight list of over 250,000 people but they're offering offering Early Access to hubman lab listeners again that's function health.com huberman to get early access to function today's episode is also brought To Us by eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity now I've spoken many times before on this podcast about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts of quality sleep each night that's truly the foundation of all mental health physical health and performance and one of the best ways to ensure that you get a great night's sleep is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's because in in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3° and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase about 1 to 3° eight sleep makes it incredibly easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment by allowing you to control the temperature of your mattress cover at the beginning middle and end of the night I've been sleeping on an eight Sleep mattress cover for nearly 4 years now and it has completely transformed and improved the quality of my sleep eight sleep has now launched their newest generation of the Pod cover the pod 4 ultra the Pod 4 ultra has improved

EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com huberman another study that got people's attention that I think is worth mentioning which relates to microplastics nanoplastics and cardiovascular disease this was a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2024 so this is a a fabulously good journal and what it found was that polyethylene which is a component of many Plastics out there were detected in the cored artery plaques of in this case 150 patients which is approximately 58% of the ones that were included in the study and they also found using a technique called electron microscopy today's fun because we get to talk about different types of microscopy electron microscopy allows you to look at things that are smaller than a micron you can look all the way down into the nanometer range right you can start breaking up that 1 1,000th of a millimeter into nanometers and you can start to see things that are really really small and in this study electron microscopy showed that there were these little Jagged Edge foreign particles among the plaque macras of the cardiovascular plaques okay macrofagos are part of the immune system these are cells that go in and try and eat things up they're kind of like little ambulances later we're going to talk about microa which are the brain's resident microphases or microphages depending on where you live and how you like to pronounce it but the point here is that when using a technique like electron microscopy that allows you to look at really really small stuff it was very clear that the plaques that form these you know basically occlusions within the arteries these are not good um this is one of the reasons you want to eat properly and do cardiovascular exercise and take great care of yourself Etc electron microscopy made very clear that there were little plastic foreign Jagged particles deposited in some of these plaques now were they the cause of these plaques did they contribute to some of the occlusion caused by those plaques unclear but it's reasonable to assume that they form part of the physical substrate that could ude blood flow through these arteries which of course leads to cardiovascular events which of course are not good so I'll put a link to the study in the show note captions again these are correlative studies in humans correlative studies are only that they're just correlative but I'm trying to provide a patchwork of things that suggest that it would indeed be a good idea to try and limit your ingestion or at least facilitate the removal of microplastics and nanoplastics from your system another reason to do that relates to the so-called peases okay these are a group of chemicals sometimes referred to as the quote unquote forever chemicals because they are very longstanding once they get into your system these things have names other than pasas which is an acronym things like perlu alkal things like polyl alkaly I don't know how good my pronunciation of those is but um if you look up the pases you'll see that these things are known to cause liver damage they can damage the immune system they are considered forever chemicals because they are not broken down they last forever then again some of the other components of microplastics and nanoplastic Plastics are also known to last forever so you're starting to get a picture of these little tiny bits of plastic some tinier than others depositing themselves in our tissues they're everywhere out there they are most prominent in certain sources but they're going to get into our system now does that mean that we can't get rid of them no we absolutely can get rid of them in fact we have a number of different ways that we get rid of toxins and foreign Invaders in our body some of those include the immune system right even if you have just some sort of foreign object like a Splinter your immune system has a reaction to that typically you get some puss around it some inflammation and that pus and inflammation is part of the process of isolating that forign Intruder that splinter and then eventually creating some tissues that extrude it or allow you to extrude it you of course also have what's called your adaptive immune system which doesn't just react to the presence of something foreign but creates antibodies which can combat that and so on and so forth so your body has these frankly miraculous ways of dealing with foreign Intruders of different sorts but it does seem that microplastics and nanoplastics can deposit themselves in their tissues and stay there does that mean that you don't have any chance of getting them out no you have a liver your liver yes contains microplastics and nanoplastics very likely if you've been alive for any amount of time but it also has what's called phase one and phase two detoxification processes that allow you to break down and get rid of certain foreign products including microplastics and nanoplastics so let's talk about liver Det detoxification and some of the things that can facilitate liver detoxification that you actually have control over Okay so let's talk about liver detoxification the liver is such a cool organ it does so many cool things it's not just about detoxification by the way it does all sorts of things related to blood clotting it's just an amazing amazing organ we should probably do an entire episode about the liver and not just eating liver I'm not a fan of eating liver I do it every once in a while um because I'm told it's nutritious but let's talk about the living functioning liver there are two types of liver detoxification processes okay so this is not about detoxing your liver you may hear about detoxing your liver that's a whole other discussion I don't want to get into at least not here there's type one and type two liver detoxification okay there's type one so calleded phase one liver detoxification is also called the oxidation phase it involves something called cytochrome p450 enzymes okay so enzymes are involved in the breakdown of different things it converts toxins into less harmful components that ideally are excreted from the body okay type two or phase two liver detoxification again this is not detoxification of your liver this is detoxification by your liver is also called the conjugation phase of detoxification it involves enzymes that attach molecules to toxins okay it makes those toxins water soluble and easier to excrete from the body in the form of urine okay it neutralizes reactive intermediates from phase one okay so phase one and phase two detoxification work together during phase two of liver control detoxification is where toxins are broken down and those broken down components are prepared to be removed from the body okay it is thought that the liver plays a primary role in the removal of microplastics and nanoplastics bpas and bps's and by the way I realize I didn't say this earlier and I should have these bpas and bps's are sometimes chemical components within the microplastics and nanoplastics they sometimes attach themselves to the microplastics and nanoplastics I should have said that earlier forgive me the microplastics and nanoplastics can act as what are called vectors or carriers of things like bpas bps's phalates and forever chemicals okay I should have mentioned that earlier so type two that is phase two of liver control detoxification is where these toxins that are in the body and potentially these microplastics themselves and nanoplastics themselves are not necessarily broken down because some of those things can't be broken down but where they are prepared to be excreted from the body and we have some degree of control over phase two of liver controlled detoxification again I'm calling it liver controlled detoxification so that this doesn't get misconstrued as detoxing your liver which frankly is a very controversial topic and may not be possible at all although simply by saying that I'm probably going to get attacked but here we're just talking about your liver's ability to break down and remove things from your body that you frankly don't want in your body one way that you can enhance Phase 2 liver control detoxification processes is by increasing your intake of something called sulphoraphane which is present in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower now is there enough sulphoraphane in cruciferous vegetables such that you could eat reasonable amounts that you wouldn't have to overeat cruciferous vegetables in order to get this enhancement of phase 2 liver detoxification processes potentially yes the animal studies that were carried out so this would be in rodents like rats used supplemented suhane at dosages that were comparable to the amounts of sulphoraphane that a human might ingest from a large serving of broccoli or a large serving of cauliflour so this could be a few cups of raw broccoli or raw cauliflower although frankly if you're like me that basically translates to gastrointestinal distress I can't tell you how many times I've gone to a party and there's some like you know broccoli and cauliflower maybe with some dip or something like that I usually avoid the dip because I'm not really into dips but we'll have a few pieces of broccoli and boy does that disrupt my gut I don't know about you um and most things don't disrupt my gut that's not something that I uh struggle with I prefer to cook broccoli and to cook cauliflower if you cook broccoli and cauliflower lightly okay so you don't just you know turn into a complete Mash you don't boil it such that a lot of the nutrients are leeched out out into the water around it so if you do sort of a light boil or a steam or something like that or you pan pan cook it maybe in some olive oil this is making me hungry by the way you'll still maintain the sulphoraphane in those cruciferous vegetables meaning it'll still be beneficial to you now some people including me don't tend to eat that many cruciferous vegetables I don't know why I just somehow don't make it a point to shop for them enough I ought to for people like me or perhaps you're in the same boat you can supplement with sulphoraphane and what you'll find is that sold by various companies and it's available at a quite wide range of dosages you'll see for instance two products similarly priced one product will contain 50 milligrams of sulphoraphane the other product will contain 225 milligrams of sulphoraphane now if you go to what I consider a really excellent website for thinking about and evaluating this kind of stuff which is examine.com I've talked a lot about this um site on the podcast before on examine.com they talk about the translation of the rodent studies to humans and here's what they say they say supplementation of .1 to.5 mg per kilogram of sulphoraphane in rats has been noted to be bioactive okay just bioactive they're not getting specifically at removal microplastics or nanoplastics and they translate that to a human dose of okay if you're 150 PB person then that's going to be anywhere from 1.1 to 5.5 milligram for that 150 lb person if you're a 200 lb person that's approximately my weight I think right now I'm sitting somewhere around 215 so about 100 kg 215 I don't know somewhere in there hav't uh stood on a scale in a while it's 1.5 to 7.2 milligrams for a 200 lb person now then you think about the typical dosages that are found in supplements of 50 milligrams per serving versus 225 milligrams per serving and in either case you realize that that's much much higher than what's being discussed here so what that says to me is that I would probably go with the lower dosage although according to examine.com they say quote these low quantities are likely attainable through raw broccoli or cruciferous vegetable products so that's great what this means is that you don't need to supplement with sulphoraphane if you're willing to eat raw broccoli they're specifically saying raw broccoli or other cruciferous vegetable products while higher dosages may be further beneficial so this is still a bit of a vague space I realize there's some discrepancies in what I'm describing here I said you could like L cook the broccoli or cauliflower that's my read and understanding of sorane that it's not broken down at low temperatures but perhaps you just decide to eat it raw if you can bear it I can't so I don't you could supplement it if you choose what dosage well that depends on your weight and it seems that in any case most supplements are going to more than cover the amount of sulphoraphane that's described here translated from the rat studies so in my case after researching this episode I opted to start taking 50 milligram 5 milligrams of sulphoraphane per day I'm going to see how that goes um I guess it's fair to say that I'm sufficiently concerned about uh microplastics and nanoplastics given that I'm 49 years old all my biomarkers seem fine but hey I'm always interested in doing something for my health or to promote my health that is if I can and it's pretty clear to me that if one's thinking about liver control detoxification both for sake of offsetting or removing bpas bps's but also other potentially toxic metabolites from microplastics nanoplastics and other environmental factors that taking 50 milligrams of sulphoraphane per day perhaps can be beneficial so I don't think it's necessary for everybody in fact I think everybody should probably be getting some cruciferous vegetables in their diet anyway at least once a week or a couple times a week so if you're not interested in supplementing that would be the route to go if you are interested in supplementing I'll provide a link to this particular location in the examine.com agage so that you can translate some of these dosages to your potential sources of supplemental forms of sulphoraphane the other way that microplastics and nanoplastics can be excreted from the body is in the bowel and one way to potentially increase the amount of microplastics and nanoplastics bpas bps's phalates and forever chemicals those pf's from your body is to make sure that you're getting enough dietary fiber now most people can do that simply by eating a fair amount of fruits and vegetables which I always make a point to do I also ingest starches okay so I'm not pure carnivore I things like rice like oatmeal I like uh fresh pastas although it's mainly rice and oatmeal for me these days in terms of starches plenty of fruits and vegetables that's something I just really make it a point to do why is fiber good at doing this well it can bind lipophilic molecules okay it can bind molecules that are able to cross cell membranes and earlier we were talking about the fact that BPA and bps's mimic estrogen and combine to estrogen receptors and potentially to Androgen receptors as well keep in mind that one of the reasons why those so-called steroid hormone Pathways I know people hear the word steroid and they think performance-enhancing steroids but no turns out that testosterone and estrogen are both steroid hormones one of the reasons those are interesting is that because of their structure they're able to bind cell surface receptors and have effects on those cells they are also able to pass through okay the hormones okay here I'm not talking about bpas and bps's but the hormones testosterone estrogen can actually get to the nucleus of cells and can control gene expression these steroid hormones testosterone and estrogen work in a very coordinated fashion to create what we call secondary sex characteristics which are the characteristics of the external body and brain changes and internal changes all over the place right ovaries testes Etc that are what underly what we call puberty and that's because these molecules can actually control gene expression so when we talk about these molecules like bpas and BPS is impacting these Pathways like estrogen and androgen Pathways this is serious stuff because what you're doing is you're potentially activating or blocking Pathways that are involved not just in the function of those cells but actually the genes that those particular cells Express and this is particularly concerning for any kind of hormone dependent cancers right it's perhaps not surprising to you but based on what you now know about how hormones work with gene expression Etc that many tissues that turn over cells a lot such as the testes right producing sperm pretty much throughout the lifespan the follicle and eggs right breast tissue right these are common sites of cancer okay there are other cancers that can form of course in other tissues like the pancreas and brain Etc but tissues that turn over quite a bit because of the involvement of the cell cycle and because cancer is among other things the disregulation the cell cycle and an overproduction of cells that we call tumors those are Pathways that are particularly vulnerable to endocrine or hormone disruption and this is why there's additional concern about microplastics and nanoplastics perhaps increasing cancer rates in particular in tissues like the ovary in particular the testes in particular any tissue where there's a lot of cellular turnover so the point here is that eating broccoli eating cauliflower potentially supplementing with sulphoraphane here I'm summarizing a bit what I talked about earlier avoiding drinking water from plastic bottles maybe getting a reverse osmosis filter avoiding those diabolical canned soups I had no idea about these canned soups or ensuring that the canned soups that you're eating are safe in the ways that we discussed earlier avoiding sea salts avoiding I'm throwing a few other things in here that I haven't mentioned yet avoiding non-stick pans trying to cook mainly with cast iron or ceramic and making sure that those are BPA BPS and past free just look at the packaging do a little bit of homework there and get this one this is a really surprising one or at least was surprising to me carbonated water okay mineral Waters a few years ago there was an analysis of different popular forms of carbonate water which is sold in glass containers okay it turned out that Topo Chico which I happened past tense happened to love Topo Chico had 9.76 particles per trillion of these pases these forever chemicals okay that was an analysis done in 2020 perier 1.1 San pelo 0.31 so we're comparing 9.76 versus 1.1 versus. 31 which tells me I'm avoiding topoo I might even avoid perer I'll probably drink San pelegrino I'm probably buy a perryer and drink a perer every once in a while I'm not crazy about carbonated water by the way this was an analysis by consumer reports and it caught some attention such that the Coca-Cola company which makes Topo Chico said that they were going to fixed this problem and they claimed okay I don't know if they've done this all right I don't want to get the folks at Coca-Cola angry with me Coca-Cola claimed that by 2023 they were going to cut the amount of these particles in half but that would still make them 4.5 parts per trillion still much higher at least four times higher than any of the other brands so I have to be direct I'm speaking from my own experience and choices until I see data that Topo Chico has reduced the amount of these foreign contaminants to basically less than 0.31 I'm going with San peligrino or perer okay I don't tend to drink a lot of mineral water but given that you're ordering it in the glass in a glass container that is given that these things are not particularly cheap right and that you have choices you could either decide to avoid carbonate water altogether or if you're going to be smart about it you probably want to avoid the ones that contain more of these foreign contaminants because of their ability to get lodged in different tissues in your body so that was very surprising to me that you would have these forever chemicals in carbonated water what it tells us is that the water going into those products contains either microplastics nanoplastics Paces from other sources or something and so I think that we should all be aware of this if you're going to drink carbonate water probably go going with a perer or S pelino would be better than going with Topo Chico because even though they've haved the amount of these forever chemicals in there it's still quite High okay so I've mentioned some todos to reduce your microplastic nanoplastic BPA BPS and past exposure such as ingesting cruciferous vegetables potentially supplementing with Sil forane trying to avoid drinking out of plastic water bottles there a few other things I'll just list off here to keep it relatively short talked about making sure you're getting enough dietary fiber I talked before about using a glass or steel vessel and reverse osmosis water using Himalayan salt avoiding sea salt the other thing that you can do oh and I mentioned using cast iron and ceramic as opposed to non-stick cookware whenever you can and if you're going to microwave food making sure that you're doing that on plates or in containers that does not or do not contain plastic of any kind even if it says microwave safe the other thing is to sweat okay we vastly underestimate or downgrade the power of sweating sweating is an incredible mechanism now I realize that as soon as somebody says sweating is a great way to remove toxins from the body that a bunch of people out there get really inflamed pun intended I'm not saying that what I am saying is that there are a number of different ways for foreign products to leave the body including urine feces but including sweat okay so I'm not saying that's going to detox you completely that's not what I'm saying okay I don't fall into that camp however there are a number of beneficial aspects to sweating and also there are a number of beneficial aspects to doing the things that make you sweat so I've done entire episodes about deliberate heat exposure so things like sauna done anywhere from once a week to four times a week pretty impressive data in terms of reducing all cause mortality improving cardiovascular function it's also for most people pretty Pleasant to sit in a sauna if you don't have access to a sauna taking a hot bath not so hot that you burn yourself but a hot bath that also will activate some of these same Pathways things like hot yoga things like going out for a run in a hoodie trying to get your body to sweat pretty robustly at least once a week is a good idea for all sorts of reasons also just your ability to Thermo regulate by the way for those of you that don't sweat much sweating is actually something that you can get better at that's right you can get better at sweating by what by sweating by exposing yourself in safe ways to heat and I talk about that in the deliberate heat exposure episode we also have a newsletter on deliberate heat exposure I'll put links to those in the show note captions and those explain safe ways uh to encourage sweating why am I talking about this well sweating may help remove some of the things that are attached to microplastics and nanoplastics that can act as endocrine disruptors it's very very unlikely that the microplastics and nanoplastics would actually be removed as whole particles in sweat I think that that's very unlikely frankly what's more likely is that the microplastics and nanoplastics aren't really getting removed from or broken down within our body at all they're getting lodged into these different tissues but the stuff that's on them and in them is potentially causing some of the biological harms that we've talked about and so removing those more robustly is what sweating is about it's what consuming cruciferous vegetables is about and so on and so forth so those are a few more todos the other to don'ts or I should say don'ts are things like avoiding consumption of packaged food or food that's packaged in plastic now this is tough to do you know I love berries for instance I love blueberries I'm what you call a driveby blueberry eater if there's blueberries in a bowl I just kind like sweep them up like by the fist full so if they're blueberries on the counter you're probably not getting very many um I'm getting most of them I love blueberries but I noticed that I was starting to accumulate and of course I recycle those blueberry containers that are those plastic containers one way that you can avoid plastic packaging is go to farmers markets bring your own bags bring your own baskets I love that the farmers markets they have those cardboard containers of course some of you may be shouting wait but those are colored green and the coloration is a problem and they have the microfibers with the true but probably better than plastic containers that they use now in the grocery store for pretty much every fruit and vegetable okay so solution is either farmers markets or trying to bring your own bags to the grocery store I know this is starting to sound kind of you know hippie dippy but you know these little things make a big difference over time you're reducing your plastic waste you're reducing the amount of plastic exposure of the fruits and vegetables you eat this can correspond to a real difference in the number of microplastics and nanoplastics and the bad stuff that comes with them that you ingest and again most of the time these things are going to save you cost as opposed to introduce new costs the other don'ts that we haven't talked so much about are to reduce the number of clothes that you purchase I know this might seem like oh my God what where's this all going but it turns out that one of the major sources of microplastics and nanoplastics are the microfibers on clothing that come off in washing machines that then get distributed into the oceans through the water or that get Escape into the air there are a number of ways that you can trap those they the things like the guppy bag that you can I love the name the guppy bag that you can buy at pretty low cost you find those easily online that will trap some of that stuff there are filters that you can put within specific washing machines some places actually require this now that capture those microfibers these microfibers when I first heard about them I thought oh goodness we're really talking about microfibers and clothing well just I don't know wear 100% cotton clothing but then you find out because I read this book this um scary book and it is scary it does kind of bum you out when you start reading this stuff that when you read a poison like no other how microplastics corrupted our planet and our bodies you find out that so much of the waste that exists in landfills is clothing that people have discarded and there was nothing wrong with that clothing clothing has dyes it has little microfibers the stuff gets into the environment gets into the oceans here's the simple solution to all this it turns out that we replace far more clothing than we need to okay this is actually a great relief to me because I love few things more in terms of clothing anyway the feeling of a t-shirt that I've worn many many times and it's really really soft and kind of worn down that kind of distressed look t-shirt even though that might be fashionable to some people to some people it's not I love the feeling of a really worn down soft t-shirt even the ones that have a little bit of you know sort of uh Jagged toothing along the collar now some people might loath that they only want the pristine t-shirt that you know is super Crisp that's not me I I know I own a few of these black button- down shirts and indeed the same ones I use them over and over again I do own a fair number of them but I use the same ones over and over again and I think that's in keeping with this other recommendation which this book a poison like no other said could make a major dent in the amount of microplastics and nanoplastics that are out there in the environment that we end up ingesting and that the other animals on the planet who are so very important end up ingesting and potentially suffering from and that's to simply not buy or replace so much of our clothing but to reuse our clothing now the argument has been made and they counter it in the book well then you're just going to wash the same clothing over and over you're going to break down those microfibers and introduce those dyes and things into the ocean Etc into the air but it turns out that when you reuse the same clothing and wash it over and over again you actually see a diminishment in the amount of microfibers and the amount of dyes and things that you extract from those clothing over time okay so now in some odd way we're talking about clothing purchases or non-p purchases in this case on the hubman Lab podcast but you know in researching this episode I discovered that these are a major source if not the major source of microplastic and nanoplastic particles in the environment and landfill Ocean Air Etc so while none of us I believe none of us are going to go out there and create a tire that doesn't degrade as quickly as current tires right most of us don't have the capacity to do that let's face it we got to get around in vehicles all those tires breaking down not a whole lot we can do about that we're inhaling all that stuff but we can make the decision to use the clothing that we've got for longer periods of time is it really necessary to keep buying more and more clothes and replacing the old clothes throwing out the old clothes or even donating those old clothes who knows I'm all for donating clothing after you're done with it but now I have justification for just keeping the t-shirts that I have making them softer and softer and softer over time and I should mention that of course when you wear clothing that is shedding these microfiber particles you're ingesting or rather you're inhaling more typically the microfibers and the microplastics and the nanoplastics and all the bad goodies that go with them you know as I say that I think we need to be fair about what that means and what it doesn't mean I personally just don't see myself going around and looking at labels finding only 100% cotton with no microfiber shedding uh no dyes Etc I mean there are a lot of things that are now introduced to even 100% cotton clothing that make them a little bit more water and stain resistant it's very very difficult to find such sources of clothing right I know they're out there but they're very difficult to find and they're quite costly in many cases if you happen to know of some true lowcost versions of those things please put those in the comment section on YouTube but I think we have to be realistic here Plastics were introduced in the 1950s they are everywhere they are in our clothing they are in tires they are in medical devices they're just everywhere the point of this discussion today is not to try and eliminate Plastics I don't think that's reasonable I don't even think that would be useful relative to the incredibly powerful use of Plastics in just about every industry there's always a trade-off with these sorts of things and I acknowledge that what I'm talking about is trying to limmit your exposure and trying to buffer yourself against this bioaccumulation in ways that can protect your endocrine system protect your brain protect your cardiovascular system protect your liver protect the organs and tissue systems of your body so that you can Thrive as much as possible so there are some other not todos or things to avoid microwave popcorn turns out to be a major source of these things basically any bag or container can bag or plastic that has a lining that prevents oily stuff from staining it and getting through such as microwave popcorn very likely is a source or I should say a rich source of microplastics nanoplastics and endocrine disruptors does that mean that if you have some microwave popcorn every once in a while that's going to screw up your estrogen or testosterone system and make you infertile no I don't believe that these things are all a matter of dosage exposure over time and so on toothpaste and plastic tubing another rich source of microplastics nanoplastics that people ingest of course because you're putting in your mouth when I did the oral health episode I talked about some tooth tablets I've become quite fond of these I have no Financial relationship to the company that makes these but these are tooth tablets that um include something called hydroxy appetite which is great for the remineralization of teeth because it turns out your teeth can fill in little cavities that start to form and overall tooth Health it's also great for travel because first of all these things come in a glass jar so no plastic you take the tooth tablets you just chew them up and then you brush your teeth uh it's great because you don't have to worry about how many ounces is going through the uh you know the screening process is the airport because it's not a a liquid it's not a paste it's a tablet they're super convenient I love those we'll probably link to those in the show note captions even though I have no relationship to the company I'm just big fan of of that sort of thing the convenience and the fact that it's housed in glass but as I say all this stuff right avoiding drinking out of plastic don't turn over your clothing so much wash your clothes but don't purchase and throw away clothing too much or more than is necessary avoiding sea salt these kinds of things these are all just choices for you in the buffet of options of ways to reduce your microplastic nanoplastic ingestion and exposure and the bioaccumulation of those things over time and to increase in the case of things like Sul forane and sweating Etc and to increase the detoxification and removal of some of the more harmful products attached to or Within These microplastics and nanoplastics right I certainly don't expect anyone including myself to start living Life free of microplastics and nanoplastics to do that you'd probably have to leave planet Earth I know certain people are developing plans to enable us to do that even if we're not astronauts and frankly when you get out to Mars or you get it into outer space those microplastics and nanoplastics based on everything I've learned and how incredibly sneaky small and pervasive they are well they're probably in outer space as well now the final thing I want to touch on is the potential role of microplastics nanoplastics bpas bps's and forever chem on the developing brain this is an area that I'm very familiar with because much of my career I've focused on brain development neural development and one can find a lot of papers out there about the potential neurotoxicity of micro and nanoplastics certainly the established neurotoxicity of microplastics and nanoplastics in animal models and the potential neurotoxicity of those things in human tissues now of course because this animal literature and some correlative human literature have been out there for a while the media and some people in particular have become concerned about and have mentioned the potential role of microplastics nanoplastics and the bad goodies that attach to them or come from them in potentially causing neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and ADHD I want to be very clear I went into this literature I read this review it's a quite nice review the plastic brain neurotoxicity of micro and nanoplastics and sure there's a lot of animal literature showing for instance that there's a disruption in certain enzymatic Pathways within neurons in particular and this is the one that intrigues me the most A disruption in what's called acetycholine esterase aceto Coline is a neuromodulator involved in neuroplasticity in attention among other things levels of alertness a number of things including control of the so-call neuromuscular Junctions that allow for us to move our limbs acetylcholine esterase is involved in the degradation the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synapse so neurons release acetycholine into the synaps where it can have an effect on muscle or it can have an effect on other neurons if we're talking about within the brain and indeed there's a fair amount of evidence showing that microplastics and nanoplastics are correlated with reductions in or just changes in acolin estras activity now it is true that where acetycholine is released in the brain it can impinge on dopamine circuits that are involved reward Pathways and movement but I want to be clear people have taken some of those findings translated them to the correlative data in humans and have started to link the presence of microplastics and nanoplastics in their words not mine in their words to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and ADHD and while there is some evidence that some of the behavioral components or cognitive components of autism and ADHD May in increase in line with increases in microplastic or nanoplastic exposure the data there are still in my opinion very very weak so in my opinion it's far too early to conclude that microplastics and nanoplastics have any role and certainly not a causal role in the development of autism or ADHD or other neurodevelopmental disorders that said the presence of microplastics and nanoplastics in placenta and in that first stool from babies which shows us that those microplastics and nanop Plastics are getting into the developing fetus well that does I think raise level of concern and it certainly should motivate pregnant women as well as people who have newborn kids or going to have kids to look around their home environment think about the things they're putting into their body or the vessels they're using to ingest liquids to ingest foods and to start limiting microplastic and nanoplastic exposure certainly during but also perhaps before pregnancy and after pregnancy when one is breastfeeding so the point here is that we can't draw a direct relationship between microplastics and nanoplastics and neurodevelopmental disorders I don't think it would be appropriate at all to do that however given that microplastics and nanoplastics have these issues both from their own breakdown their presence right their own structural presence can be a problem the chemicals within them can be a problem the chemicals that attach to them can be a problem potentially I think learning to limit our exposure throughout our lifespan learning to reduce the bio accumulation through detoxification and excretion Pathways using the various approaches that we talked about and certainly to pay extra attention to those things around the time of meaning before during and after pregnancy is especially important because we just don't know all the things that these chemicals and these Plastics are doing but none of them seem to be very good at least not in terms of the ways that they impact our brain and bodily tissues okay so today we've talked a lot about microplastics what they are where they're found how they get into our body where they get lodged within our body what they potentially do in our body none of which is good some might be innocuous some might be bad none of which at least as far as I know is good and some ways both through some todos and some to avoids that we can increase our excretion or our breakdown and removal of the bad stuff on and in microplastics and nanoplastics and I realize that even though we covered a lot of things we also just scratched the surface for instance we know that receipts are rich sources of bpas okay so if you are somebody who handles receipts a lot for your job probably best to use nital gloves okay not latex gloves but nital gloves those are going to protect your hands if you're somebody who purchases things maybe just say no thanks I'll take the electronic receipt or no receipt okay however we need to be reasonable here as well does this mean that if you touch a receipt that you're going to screw up your testosterone or estrogen no but you probably don't want to be rubbing those receipts and it's very clear that if you use sunscreen or lotions of any kind on your hands you handle receipts it can increase the access of those bpas to your bloodstream and if you're somebody who handles receipts a lot well then probably best to use those nital gloves the point here is that there are a lot of different sources of these bpas bps's PFS so-call forever chemicals microplastics nanoplastics I also would just encourage you to do your research look at the cans that you drink from ensure that they don't include bpas look at the different things that you cook within your kitchen try and cook from cast iron or ceramic and if you don't look at the other pans and cans and things in your environment and see what your likely exposure to these bpas bps's and forever chemicals is and make choices accordingly that's what today's episode and frankly this podcast is about it's about you being informed

Title: Create Your Ideal Future Using Science-Based Protocols | Ari Wallach
Published: 2024-10-14 12:01:00 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Ari Wallach, most recently an adjunct associate professor at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs and host of a new TV series titled A Brief History of the Future. We discuss the importance of learning to project our understanding of ourselves and our goals into the future, both for our own sake and for future generations. We also explore how this fosters a sense of unity and community within our species.

We examine how technology and modern society influence our perception of time and our ability to make decisions in a fast-paced, reward-driven environment that leads to our best possible future. Additionally, we discuss how the dismantling of traditional institutions has altered people's sense of purpose. We outline protocols to cultivate long-term thinking, connect with core values, and define a deep sense of purpose. This episode provides listeners with actionable tools to merge short- and long-term thinking in ways that create a positive, lasting impact on ourselves, society, and the planet.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Ari wallik Ari wallik is an adjunct associate professor at Columbia University's School of International and public affairs he is also the host of a new TV series a brief history of the future today's discussion focuses on perhaps one of the most important questions that any and all of us have to ask ourselves at some point which is how is it that we are preparing this planet for the future not just for our children if we happen to have children or want children but for all people the human brain as we know is capable of orienting its thoughts and its memories to the past to the present or to the future but few people actually take the time to think about the future that they are creating on this planet and in culture within our families etc for the next generation and generations that follow them Ari wallik is an expert in this topic and he has centered his work around what he calls long Path Labs which is a focus on long-term thinking and coordinated Behavior at the individual organizational and societal level in order to best ensure the thriving of our species and while that may sound a bit aspirational it is both aspirational and grounded in specific actions and logic so during today's episode re Wallock spells out for us not just the aspirations not just what we want but how to actually create that positive future and Legacy for ourselves for our families and for Society at large it's an extremely interesting take on how to live now in a way that is positively building toward the future so by the end of today's episode you will have a unique perspective on how your brain works how you frame time perception and indeed how you frame your entire life before you begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is David David makes a protein bar unlike any other it has 28 grams of protein only 150 calories and 0 grams of sugar that's right 28 grams of protein and 75% of its calories come from protein this is 50% higher than the next closest protein bar These Bars from David also taste incredible my favorite bar is the cake flavored one but then again I also like the chocolate flavored one and I like the berry flavored one basically I like all the flavors they're all incredibly delicious now for me personally I try to get most of my calories from Whole Foods however when I'm in a rush or I'm away from home or I'm just looking for a quick afternoon snack I often find that I'm looking for a highquality protein source and with David I'm able to get 28 gam of highquality protein with the calories of a snack which makes it very easy to hit my protein goals of one gram of protein per pound of body weight and it allows me to do so without taking on an excess of calories as I mentioned before they are incredibly delicious in fact they're surprisingly delicious even the consistency is great it's more like a cookie consistency kind of a chewy cookie consistency which is unlike other bars which I tend to kind of saturate on I was never a big fan of bars until I discovered David bars if you give them a try you'll know what I mean so if you'd like to try David you can go to David protein.com huberman again the link is david.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by Helix sleep Helix sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are customized to your unique sleep needs I've spoken many times before on this and other podcast about the fact that getting a great night's sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance now the mattress we sleep on makes an enormous difference in terms of the quality of sleep that we get each night we need a mattress that is matched to our unique sleep needs one that is neither too soft nor too hard for you one that breathes well and that won't be too warm or too cold for you if you go to the Helix website you can take a brief two-minute quiz and it asks you questions such as do you sleep on your back your side or your stomach do you tend to run hot or cold during the night things of that sort maybe you know the answers to those questions maybe you don't either way Helix will match you to the ideal mattress for you for me that turned out to be the dusk mattress D us I've been sleeping on a dusk mattress for gosh now more than four years and the sleep that I've been getting is absolutely phenomenal so if you'd like to try Helix you can go to helixsleep.com huberman take that two-minute sleep quiz and Helix will match you to a mattress that's customized for your unique sleep needs right now Helix is giving up to 25% off all mattress orders again that's helixsleep.com huberman to get up to 25% off today's episode is also brought To Us by Roka Roa makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of different challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly from moment to moment Roa understands all of that and has designed all of their ey glasses and sunglasses with the biology of the visual system in mind Roa eyeglasses and sunglasses were first designed for use in sport in particular for things like running and cycling and as a consequence Roa frames are extremely lightweight so much so that most of the time you don't even remember that you're wearing them and they're also designed so that they don't slip off even if you get sweaty now even though Roa eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed for sport they now have many different frames and styles all of which can be used not just for sport but also for wearing out to dinner to work essentially any time in any setting I wear Roa readers at night or Roa eyeglasses if I'm driving at night and I wear Roa sunglasses in the middle of the day anytime it's too bright for me to see clearly my eyes are somewhat sensitive so I need that I particularly like the hunter 2.0 frames which I have as eyeglasses and now as Sun glasses too if you'd like to try Roa you can go to roka.com huberman to get 20% off your purchase again that's roka.com huberman to get 20% off and now for my discussion with Ari wallik Ari Wallock welcome Andrew hubman thank you for having me you and I go way back and I think that's a good way to frame today's conversation not by talking about our history by any stretch but because really what I want to understand is about time and time perception so without going into a long dialogue the human brain is capable of this amazing thing of being able to think about the past the present or the future or some combination of the three if other animals and insects do that I wouldn't be surprised but we do that and we do it pretty well provided all our mental faculties are intact one of the key aspects to brain function however is to use that ability to try and set goals reach goals and that's a neurochemical process and I would say these days more than ever we operate on short time frame reward schedules meaning we want something we generally have ways of getting it pretty quickly or at least the information about how we might get it pretty quickly and we either get it or we don't and of course it involves dopamine and a bunch of other things as well a lot of your work is focused on linking our perception of what we're doing in the present with knowledge about the past and trying to project our current decision-making into the future to try and create a better future and that's some pretty heavy mental gymnastics especially when many perhaps most but certainly many many people worldwide are just trying to like get through their day without feeling overly anxious without letting their health get out of control without or I should say their illness get out of control uh and on and on so to kick the ball out I've got this long- winded question and it is indeed a question which is how do we navigate this conundrum like if we really care about the future what do we want to do where do we want to place our mental frame and how do we start going about doing that it's a great question or a great series of questions um one of the things that homo sapiens do extremely well is what we call mental time travel we're able to actually take ourselves in the current moment and project out in fact Marty Seligman uh kind of the the father of positive psychology put forth this idea in this great book called homo prospectus that what separates us out from almost every other species as far as we know the ones we can talk to mostly us is that that we do two things extremely well we can do mental time travel towards the future right we can think about different possible outcomes different possible scenarios and we can collaborate to make the ones that we want to see manifest manifest and that involves language that involves social interaction a whole bunch of other things but at the end of the day what we do extremely well as far as we know we're the only ones who do it and I think this is part of the reasons why we're so good at what we do as a dominant on this planet is to project out into Futures that we want we know where this comes from Mostly it's it's it's coming from the hippo campus right which one thing about the campus that's amazing is that it's it's almost atemporal it doesn't actually have a time stamp and so what it does is it takes snapshots of epithetic memories that have happened in the past reassembles them so that we can mentally time travel and then figure out these different future scenarios of what might happen so if we take Ari and Andy 150,000 years ago he calls me Andy folks but Andrew no it's okay just stick with Andy but I'm gonna stick with Andy I'm giving you permission for at least the duration of this episode duration of this episode so uh Andrew now Andy look here's the thing if Arian Andy are out on the serengetti 150,000 years ago right we Homo sapiens about 200,000 years ago about 150,000 years ago we're kind of starting to spread out of the rift valley into Africa and we're now at a point where we're no longer longer singular but we're within a kind of a small tribal structure we want to start hunting larger and larger game we're no longer reactive so if we want to go after that game it's not a foregone conclusion that when we go after something it's going to do what we wanted to do we have to start thinking about different scenarios so that first kind of mental time travel is really coming from our desire for for more protein to exist and to to grow the group and really to feed the super energy intensive thing called the human brain that's where mental time travel starts and hippocampus takes different memories of different ways we've hunted and and been successful in the past or not successful and starts to put together scenarios now fast forward so that's a very long time ago you you you take us you know through through through the Middle East into Europe into Asia 20,000 years ago our ancestors cross Binga which is now the the the bearing straight and we're we're in North America and fast forward to right now on my way in here I get a notification on my phone Ding and I immediately pick up the phone to see and and you've covered this before what what's that new information what is it that I have to react to so we're working on two 300,000 year old Hardware at the same time we have a cultural substrate that is for lack of better words has hacked into that older part of us to make us a want that immediate gratification and B Force us to now react in a way where that mental time travel has closed that temporal Horizon we're now training ourselves no longer to think about the far future but to actually think about the immediate present and I don't mean present in a in a in a in a Buddhist way I mean presentism as in a Hall of Mirrors there is no past there is no future there's only this moment and so it's becoming extremely difficult for us as individuals as societies as civilization to think about the long term in in the way that you and I may have done 150,000 years ago because winter was coming and we were start thinking where are we going to move our family and our tribe or our clan and we we would go to warmer climates we don't even do that anymore right we're so in this moment that it's becoming extremely difficult for us to break out of this presentist moment I really appreciate your answer for a couple of reasons um through the 9s and early 2000s and maybe even until 2020 there was a growing movement within science but also outside of science towards encouraging people to be mindful this whole notion of being present right but what you're describing is actually too much being present what you're calling presentism and of course it depends on what what's happening in the present um but in the 80s in the 90s in the 2000s up to about 2020 of course we're still in the 2000s there was this notion of future tripping like people are future tripping they're spending too much time worrying about the future too much time worrying about the future I feel like the Horizon on our cognition has really come closer in now and as you said we're in this like sort of Hall of Mirrors where it's constant stimulus in response and I don't want today's discussion to be Doom and Gloom we're going to talk about Solutions but I think between what you're saying and what Jonathan height who was on this podcast author of anxious generation codling in the American mind professor at NYU Etc has said I'm starting to really believe that yes the human brain can focus on past present or future or some combination but that something about the architecture of our Technologies and our human interactions because those are so closely interwoven that's taking place now has us really locked in the present in stimulus response and I'm going to um just briefly reference a previous episode of the podcast I did it's it's one of my favorite conversations ever on off microphone was which which was excuse me with Dr James Hollis 84-year-old yian psychoanalyst where he had many important messages there but one of them was we need we absolutely need to take 5 to 10 minutes each day to exit stimulus response mode typically by closing one's eyes and just looking inward it doesn't even have to be called meditation in order to understand what our greater wishes are how to link our current thinking and behavior to the Future and to the past and and I think he's um qualified to say this because he's an analyst that that process actually is a reflection of the unconscious mind so to link these Concepts in in a more coherent way is it possible that we are just overwhelmed with notifications either the traditional type of notifications on your phone but but that we're basically just living in stimulus response all the time now and if so what direction is that taking ourselves at individuals as families as communities and you know as a as a species um I'm basically validating what you just said even though you don't need my validation and just asking like how bad is it to just be focused on managing the dayto day or maybe that's that's a better way to go about life you need to manage the day-to- day there there are people like me who are full-time futurists we tend to be very anxious because what we tend to do is think more in the future and AR as present as we should be that being said if 90% of your day is going about your day dealing with what's right in front of you that's great what what I'm advocating for is what what I call kind of transgenerational empathy it's a mouthful uh so we know empathy you know you've had guess on that transgenerational empathy first and foremost starts with empathy and compassion for yourself then we move into empathy for those who came before which then allows us to build empathy for the future future future Ari future future Andy but then future generations and we we can get into how to do that yeah maybe we could just parse each of those one by one so how do you define empathy for self so empathy for yourself is in many ways it's almost self-compassion it's recognizing you're doing the best you can with what you have part of the issue is we we surround ourselves I and I'm guilty of this of of images and quotes and books of how to live your best life that how how to be amazing and anything below that metric of perfection you start to feel terrible and you start to kind of ruminate over what what you you know you lie in bed at night and you think how could I have done that how could I have done that and you forget that you you're only able to handle what you can at that time and you can't hold yourself up to this idealized yard stick look I Del through this for for a long time we learned my father had stage four cancer I was 18 years old um and from from R he learned to when he passed away it was only four months four months four months and for for for a lot of that time um I was kind of in denial right like I wasn't actually there with him as much as I should have been in fact we're not going to we won't go into this I was actually with you that summer we were working together that that summer um at at a summer camp now for years I beat myself up how could I have done that I should have been home with him it was only going to be four months and then I realized and this is this self-compassion like 18-year-old Ari was only at a place emotionally in psychologically to be able to do what I did and it wasn't the older 30 or 40y old Ari of now being like of having these regrets so empathy for yourself really really centers you it doesn't mean you let yourself off the hook it doesn't mean you can go willy-nilly and treat people terribly it means you recognize that who you were even yesterday is in many ways different than who you are today and and what what you've learned so transgenerational empathy has to start with yourself it has to start with being able to look in the mirror and say I'm not perfect I was born into this world uh into a family into uh you know like my my my my birth family or or or you know family that you choose and they were born into something and you work with what you have but you have to start there because so many times I I I work with people I talk to people and they say oh I want to have empathy and you know for for for the past and for the future but they don't have it for themselves so if you don't start there it becomes very very difficult to to spread out uh first obviously going backwards and then ultimately the goal of my work is to get you to spread that out into the future I love this concept of empathy for self because I've heard it before in other contexts but I haven't heard it operationalized the way that you describe it I think um yeah we uh there's a two two phrases that come to mind uh there's a book uh called a Fighter's Heart by Sam Sheridan and um it's a pretty interesting account of all the different forms of martial arts and fighting and there's an interesting part of the book where he says you know you can't have your 20th birthday until you're 19 which is a big giant duh but it's actually a pretty profound statement and by the way he went to Harvard he's a smart kid his father was a in the SEAL Teams he he has an interesting lineage in his own right and I think what at Harvard he he claims he just um painted and smoked cigarettes so you know bit of a bit of a uh bit of an iconic last in any case I think that statement you can't have your 20th birthday until you're 19 is something that that we forget because of the immense amount of attention that we pay to uh trying to be like others and satisfy external metrics and so I like to think he he was in agreement with you uh if I may the the other um thing that happened to me recently that comes to mine is that um I like many people peruse Instagram I teach on Instagram Etc and there are a lot of these quote accounts like like life inspiration accounts and and I would argue that the halflife of any one of those posts is is pretty short but some are are pretty interesting and and there's a guy I'll put it in the show note captions I don't remember off the top of my head um not a huge account not a small account I think he lives in Austin and he goes through this long discourse about the challenges of the human mind for a lot of the reasons that we're talking about its ability to flit from past to present to Future Etc but then he says you know it basically just SS down to one actionable step per day or per morning um which is at some point if you want to grow and be more functional you have to ask yourself you what am I going to do today to make my day better not to be better than I was yesterday right which is also a fine statement but that one never really resonated for me because like yesterday could have been an amazing day you might not be as good as yesterday right every day is kind of its own unique unit and our biology really does function on these circadian biology units of 24 hours there's no negotiating that so I I like this concept of what what can I do today to make my life and hopefully the lives of others better because it it implies a verb in action step and it's really focused on the unit of the day which is really what we've got um so that resonated so according to your Definition empathy for self starts with understanding that we're always doing the best we can with what we've got but that there's a striving kind of woven into that statement that that there is a need for striving um at what point do we start to develop empathy for others and what does that look like like is empathy for somebody else um feeling what they feel I mean that's the kind of traditional definition yeah I mean look we we start off with kind of cognitive intellectual empathy right so you you kind of think it um but where you really want to be able to be is at a place where your their their feelings are feelings that you can feel and you want to bring if they're if they're feeling bad you want to bring some resolution to that if they're feeling good you can you can be there with them at a fundamental level this is you know mirror neurons and I'm connecting with you and you are connecting with me and there's a genetic adaptive Fitness for that right we all want to kind of be in sync because the tribe that works together flourishes together and thrives together so it makes sense at that level but when I'm feeling empathy for another their state of being can be as important as my own state of being um it can be look it can be taxing don't get me wrong but ultimately that is what self-compassion can give you because it can give you a state of being where those around you you are no longer fundamentally disconnected and I think one of the the great errors of where we have taken this civilization over the past several decades if not centuries is is disconnection disconnection from ourselves disconnection from each other and disconnection from nature in the planet so anything we can do to further that connection is going to benefit us today in the current moment I agree um completely if we were to break that down um into the requirements for empathy and connection uh one it seems like presence like we we need to be present like we're going to appreciate a a fern a beautiful Fern or a dog or a significant other or another human being that we happen to encounter we have to be present we can't if we're going to have empathy we our mind can't be someplace else can't be wandering right can't be in the past can't be in the future or we're not going to be able to really touch into the details and the of the experience so that seems like requirement number one the second is that we need to be able to leave whatever um kind of pressures are on us to to tend to other things right like every neural circuit we know has a push and a pull like in order to get a you need to suppress B and this is the way neural circuits work generally you know flexors and extensors in the muscles are a good analogy uh for uh which by the way you know like if you're going to flex your bicep um your your tricep is essentially relaxing and vice versa in so many so many words the pts are going to dive all over me for that one but in that's sort of how neural circuits in the brain work we we can actually see all around us by virtue of neurons that respond to either increments and decrements in light and their difference is actually what allows us to see boundaries borders visually so um we need to suppress like our thoughts about where we need to be that day or other things that are going on for us and then we need to be able to return to our own you know self atttention in order to to be functional and I think that I think this is where the challenge is and where the next question arises which is on the one hand I could imagine that okay we've got so many pressures upon us every day all day that it's getting much harder to be present to be empathic and to build this idealized future or better future but on the other hand I hear you and other people saying well things are so much better than they were even 50 years ago in terms of health outcomes believe it or not in terms of you know status of uh people having shelter Etc and this is a shock to a lot of people they're like wait a second I didn't see homeless people on the street when I was a kid and now I do well they were the people suffering were elsewhere you didn't perhaps didn't see them so there are a couple levels of question here but the first one is um perhaps are we much better off but we are worse off in the sense that there's so much incoming that we miss the fact that we're better off like you know is it like notifications preventing us from seeing that we actually have so much that we're we're we're you know 100 times better than off than we were as a species 50 years ago because I I feel like a lot of the debates that I see online about climate change about health about longevity it's like it's overwhelming because I feel like people aren't aren't agreeing on the first principles so let's start with with this are are human beings better off in terms of Health and Longevity than we were let's go short scale 50 years ago so look in aggregate because we can find Peaks and valleys right when when we zoom in if we pull back there's no better time to be alive as a homo sapien on planet Earth than right now now someone's going to argue right now and they're going to say no no no no I mean according to what metrics like happiness health infant mortality uh even even as we backslide in this country being a woman um education uh the kind of the calories that we get across the look if you and I go outside and you stepped on a rusty nail 100 years ago good chance you would die right now we just go to the you know to the to the drugstore and put something on it or we even know that we don't have to put anything on it we can just put it underneath high pressure water for 30 seconds and that'll clean out because we now know germ Theory right so net net this is the best time to be alive all the markers you can go to Gap minder if you want and you can see that we are doing better we are progressing the issue is that we are now at an inflection point because the things that we do or do not do across the major issues of our day and how we deal with them climate change artificial intelligence synthetic biology um what we do or do not do will dictate not only the next several years and several decades potentially the next several centuries so so you've hit it we're being bombarded by information most of the information we're attracted to is the negative negativity bias you and I on this we're going to go back to RN Andy 150,000 years ago if we saw this beautiful tree aesthetically and we saw maybe a tree over here that was on fire you and I would zoom in on the tree on fire and focus on the negative because negative things hurt and kill us that being said if you and I run a major Media Company you and I both know that the more negative stories that we put out the more hits we're going to get the more this media not this media company I'm just I'm not getting but all the other way well that I I would argue some of your success comes from the fact that you don't wallow in the negativity and there's a real thirst and a hunger and desire to learn more about who we are and how we can make ourselves better but that negativity bias is still part of us right I think one of the one of the issues that we have to confront as a society is that there are parts of us the the the prefrontal cortex parts of us that are amazing that build microphones that have conversations that stream across the internet and then there are parts of us you know this is Jonathan's elephant and the writer there are parts of us that happen below the surface that have hundreds of thousands if not millions of years of legacy and we often want to either be up here and say oh we're so smart we're so great or we want to wallow in the in the kind of the death and despair and the horrific things that we can do to one another you know my personal past on my father's side is I think some of the darkest moments in Homo Sapien behavior and that was not that long ago so if we want to move in into a place that allows us to ask what I think is the the fundamental question of our time which is how do we become the great ancestors the future needs us to be we need to find a way to both tap into to the to the elephant and the writer which will'll do a better job of me expl in explaining than I will no I love this idea I I mean we could map it to neural circuits but I love this idea of high level Concepts and and then neural circuits that are very um what Dr Paul KY was on this podcast psychiatrist brilliant psychiatrist said you know the the the the lyic system yeah um the emotional system doesn't know or care about the clock or the calendar it just elicits feeling yeah doesn't care about whether or not that feeling is relevant to the past the present or the future it just it just has a job which is just just bring out a particular feeling you're jumping ahead a little bit but that's okay because what what you're jumping into is when we ask and we want to have an empathic connection we want to have empathy with future Generations we don't want it to just be cognitive we don't want it just to be intellectual we actually want it to be emotional so if I ask someone uh what do you want the future to be like for your great grandkids in the in the 2080s and they give me a list of kind of bullet points but they're usually externalized bullet points shelter Health Care yeah and then I follow up and you know we've done this in other people much smarter than me have done this studies we say yako trop at NYU is the one who taught me this um how do you want them to feel that's different right this is damaso's um this is somatic marker hypothesis Theory right where if you really want something to happen it's not just about visualizing it it's about visualizing it and connecting it to the emotional amydala sense of what that is to actually move towards the actions and changing the behaviors that you want Madison Avenue understands this marketing understands this they don't but the general public tends not to sorry I keep interrupt you but also it's way as the kids say sorry not sorry in the sense that I want to make sure that I highlight something um Martha Beck is somebody who I think has done some really brilliant work creating practices where when one is not feeling what they want to feel um you know there's this kind of question like are you supposed to feel your feelings or are you supposed to create new feelings in place of them especially if they're unpleasant it's it's like there's no clear answer to that because it's complicated infinite number of variables but she does have this interesting practice whereby it's it's a bit like a meditation where if you're struggling with something like maybe you're struggling with boredom or not knowing where to go with your life or you're not happy or you just feel some underlying anxiety to think back to a time when you felt particularly blank like a time when you felt particularly empowered or particularly curious um it could be very specific particularly um amused because and the idea is that in anchoring to the emotion State first you call to mind a bunch of potential action steps and the reason I like this um approach is that that is at least one way that quote unquote the brain works which is that the emotion states are linked to a bunch of action step possibilities kind of like a magic Library where if you go into the room called sadness there are a bunch of action steps associated with that go beyond crying it's like curling up in the fetal position Etc you go into the room that's called um Advent you know excitement and and there's all this idea about getting in vehicles and going places and things of that sort so what you're talking about is I believe thinking about the emotional states of others and then from there I think this is where you're going to go cultivating some action steps that you can take to ensure that that future generation can access those emotions yes but with a slight correction because it's not about thinking about their future emotional states it's actually feeling them I see so it's not saying I want my kids to be happy I want them to Fe I want them to have no trauma it's um it's feeling what it would be to have to be happy no trauma yes right because that becomes like that becomes an anchor right that this she's 100% correct what it does is but it places it it's like a cat anchor so if you and I were sailor which we're not we would there's a thing called a CED anchor and a CJ anchor is this anchor that you throw you know 30 40 meters off to the side it hits the bottom and you use the rope to pull yourself there emotions will pull us towards those Futures it will alter the behaviors so time and time again when we intellectualize and we become overly cognitive in terms of Futures that we want to see happen for ourselves future Ari or or future wallik family or future Society or future civil Global planetary civilization if we think about it that's one thing but to actually execute on those goals we have to actually connect the emotional state that we want to be in to drive that function remember look this is one of the things that Marty Selman says that that Freud got it wrong Freud felt as Marty says that emotions were these things that we that happened in the past that we would use to dwell on and that was neurosis and anxiety and depression no no no no emotions are there to help us make better decisions for the future we are future oriented mammals and species so what emotions do it's not meant to be like oh you know I I had this like terrible breakup I feel so terrible uh then I'm going to go to my therapist I'm going to talk about all that stuff that happened in the past that's one way of looking at the other way is your body is telling you in a very very visceral way whatever you just did to that had you in that situation don't do it again because if you do you're going to feel a certain way you know they did this study where they at at a college campus they they found people who had just been in a kind of a quasi longterm relationship that had gone through a breakup quasi long-term fine what I've learned what I've learned in life is it's important to define the relationship it was about six months um and people had gone to the breakup they they gave they gave you know one group of placebo and another group actually just got aaminin got Tylenol and the group that got the acetaminophen actually felt better why because those because em we actually feel emotions we actually feel pain that some of the same circuits are being tripped and so that says to me that emotions are there to guide future action so we can have pro-social emotions awe and empathy and compassion and this this's one we call love as what we're connected to the Future Generations that we want to see how we want to see them flourish we are much more likely to see that happen than if we just have a vision of what tomorrow will look like at an intellectual kind of two-dimensional level I'd like to take a quick break and ackowledge our sponsor ag1 by now many of you have heard me say that if I could take Just One supplement that supplement would be ag1 the reason for that is ag1 is the highest quality and most complete of the foundational nutritional supplements available what that means is that it contains not just vitamins and minerals but also probiotics prebiotics and adaptogens to cover any gaps you may have in your diet and provide support for a demanding life for me even if I eat mostly Whole Foods and minimally processed foods which I do for most of my food intake it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits and vegetables vitamins and minerals micronutrients and adaptogens from food alone for that reason I've been taking ag1 daily since 2012 and often twice a day once in the morning or midm morning and again in the afternoon or evening when I do that it clearly bolsters my energy my immune system and my gut microbiome these are all critical to brain function mood physical performance and much more if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim their special offer right now they're giving away five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that drink a1.com huberman to claim that special offer I really like this because it gets to so many themes that have been discussed on this podcast previously and that exist in the Neuroscience literature of like yes emotions don't know the clock or the calendar yeah and that sounds like a bad thing and oftentimes it's discussed as a bad thing like oh when you're feeling stressed you're not able to access the parts of your brain that can make better decisions we we know that's true except in of what's immediately pressing I mean I would say that stress in the short term makes us much better thinkers and movers for sake of survival yeah um in the long term it's it's problematic but the way that you're describing emotions as a CJ anchor is that what it's called CED with a K yep yeah CJ anchor interesting um as a c anchor to pull us forward also leverages the fact that emotions don't know about the clock or the calendar and that the order of operations here seems to be emotions first then action steps born out of those emotions and then future State hopefully arrived at if it's a you know set along the right path yeah I like that a lot um and again it maps to some of the work that has largely existed at least to my knowledge in popular psychology or whatever you want to call it self-help again I'm a big Martha Beck fan in part because um of an exercise that she's included in I think several if not all her books of this perfect day exercise have you done this exercise it's a very interesting exercise you um you first uh sit with your eyes closed and you imagine like really terrible stuff and you experience it in your body and you experience it in your mind and you just pay attention to how it feels and and it sucks it doesn't feel good um most people don't have too much trouble doing that exercise then you shift over I think you're supposed to take a little break or maybe move around a little bit and then you do a perfect day exercise where no rules you lie down or sit down close your eyes and you can imagine your date includes anything you want you can be anywhere you want you the the room can morph from one country to the next it doesn't matter and you also experience the sensations in your body and in that second exercise it's remarkable I've done it several times now there are Little Seeds of things kind of pop out where you go oh like I didn't realize that would be part of my perfect day and they're not um outside the bounds of reality and those are things that then you write down and that at least in my life have um all borne out so this is something an exercise you do routinely and when I first heard about this I was like okay this seems like like weird self- hypnosis self-help woo stuff like I'm not like come on I'm like I'm a at that time I'm like I'm a neuroscience Professor like I'm not going to like you got to be kidding me and it's a remarkable exercise and um the reason I bring it up now in discussion with you is I think you and Martha arrived at a similar place or a similar Avenue but in your case you're talking about specifically toward building a future that's not necessarily for you to live in but for someone else to live in oh look the the the the core of My Philosophy is is in a story that I heard a very long time ago it comes it comes from the TM mod that being said the story exists in many cultures and so there's a there's a there's a man named Hony walking you know and he comes across a much older man who's planting a carab tree and he says to the older man you know why are you planting a carab tree this how long will it be until this carab tree bears fruit or even has shade and he goes oh it'll be at least 40 years and he goes well why why plant it you know you won't be around for that and the old man says when I was young I played in the shade of a carob tree I ate from the carab tree so it's my job to plant this carab tree now um this is how societies move forward this is how we become great is by planting carab trees whose shade we will never know and look I can give you a bunch of you know the Panama Canal right that was a great you know it another way that we think about this call this Cathedral thinking so now when we know we're we're in California they'll put up a home in 3 or 4 days but back in the day it took a really long time to build great things so you go back two 300 years ago um even further and oftentimes the architect and the original stonemason who would plant the Keystone would not be alive to see this Cathedral or or mosque fully built that's Cathedral thinking it's doing things whose whose fruits you will not be around to to take advantage of to to to to reap and and to have as part of your life and uh and I love it and I love the notion of Cathedral thinking um just the the visual there or mosque thinking I went to the Blue Mosque yeah yeah like I mean I've seen some amazing architecture I love architecture and I was like okay like it'll be a beautiful building and I was like wow that wo that wo that you felt is what we call a yeah and that sense of awe at what they built is what I am advocating for us to build in the world today is so that when our descendants look back and they say what what did Ari what did Andy do they have a it's not because we necessarily built Cathedrals it's because we we took actions both very small and very large to ensure that they would flourish that they would have those carab trees and I think what um what I realize is that I don't know who built the Blue Mosque specifically I don't know who the architect was I should you know and even you know last earlier this year we were in Sydney I went to Sydney Opera house we did a live there it's a beautiful building I learned they had been built over a very long period of time I can tell you that the architect was Danish but I can't remember his name so part of what we're talking about here is giving up um our need for attribution yep giving up our need for credit and gosh this is the opposite of social media right social media it's all about getting credit you know um and yet in science where people care a lot about credit while they're alive and and my scientist colleagues hate this but they know it deeply too it's also the business model of academic science right now right right which is that with the exception of Einstein and a few others most people will not be associated with their incredible discoveries even the textbook discovery 20 years out and I know this cuz my dad's a scientist and I know a lot about the scientists that were ahead of him and he taught me this early on he just said you know with rare exception you know the discoveries are not um you know no one's going to say oh that's the discovery of soand so they talk about the discovery people will build on it so you're part of a process for which you won't get credit in the long run you will get credit in the short run and and that brings me around to perhaps a point that's more relevant to everybody not not just scientists which is that we are all trained to work on these short-term contingencies reward schedules where you know we achieve something we get credit you get an A you get a B you get a trophy we just came from the Olympic track and field trials in uh in Oregon it's like you know Podium you know bronze silver gold and um and so yes you're part of a larger Legacy You're Building toward a larger Legacy in the examples that you give but part of it is understanding that um you're not going to get credit you're not gonna have your name huge on the side of a building I mean I don't want to give too many examples but I work at a university for which there's an endowment the size of a of a country right we're very blessed to have that endowment the buildings have names on the side of them then the reason they have names on the side of them is because people gave money typically gave money to the university to have their name on the side of a building to be immortalized what's interesting be for many reasons both sociopolitical but also other reasons those names change over time so if if people knew that they that they if they gave half their wealth um and their name might be scraped off a building in in 200 years they might feel differently about it so short-term contingencies are important then again we call it Rockefeller Plaza y right um it's it's Lincoln Center named after a Lincoln yeah Pro yeah sure it is you're the New Yorker you know um and so on and so forth so so like if people um how do we get the everyday person and I consider myself an everyday person how how do we get ourselves working on short-term contingencies for a future that we can visualize as better for the next generation and let go of our need for credit great series of of points and questions brought up so part of what you're talking about is egoic Legacy right so you mentioned a building we won't you it could be at any any building at any major university the name is put there on marble you said 200 years you went to Berkeley you went to a bunch of places but um he bounced around folks proof that you can bounce around and still be successful but maybe you should eventually finish we'll talk about that later but Sprout Plaza yes Sprout Plaza see to the Free Speech movement although now you could argue not so free speech movement that's my I said that yes I said that Sprout Plaza like I can't tell you who Sproul was do you know who spra was no exactly I can tell you the Arches I can tell you that it was a free speech movement I can tell you that I saw certain bands play there I can tell you that it's supposed to be a place where you can say anything and be exempt from you know um being put in jail basically anything maybe that's still true but I don't think it is um but I can't tell you who sprawl is the question of legacy is very important so Sprout Plaza let's say 250 years from now that name will probably it may may not be there the plaza but PE the name will maybe it was renamed by someone else um so for Titans of Industry that can put down several million dollars and put their name on the side of a building that's that's one form of Legacy that is not the every every person that being said if you know I I have three children so let's say they continue on at 2.2 children or whatever you know my descendants in 250 years Sprout Plaza may or may not still be called that but in 250 years I will have roughly 50,000 descendants that's a scary from my wife I know it's an exciting thought it's an exciting it's a scary thought so what what is going to impact the future and by the way if you want to keep giving money to put your name on the side of buildings please do so oh yeah no please do that please do so please please do that I should just be very clear philanthropy at universities and elsewhere people think of it as like oh people egoic Legacy sure also pays for hundreds of thousands of scholarships the opportunity for people and research and you need to do it 100% it's vital it's vital it's vital but for the everyday person like you or or me if if I if if if I want to impact the future with which I do cuz remember I'm I'm not the kind of futurist where I'm going to I don't I don't predict the future my job at this point in time I'm manifested in this biological entity called Ari wallik is not to predict the future it's to help folks make better decisions today so that we have better Futures in the in the near-term the medium-term and the far off tomorrows so what's going to impact those 50,000 wallet descendants is not going to be anything that did egoic in terms of getting recognition what's going to impact them and and we know this in many ways from across multiple disciplines what's going to impact them is going to be how I am with my children and my wife and my partner and the behaviors that I model because those become those become the memes right like we Susan Blackmore has meme theory right not not internet memes where you know I watch a lot of those but true memes these Cal units that we hand off both laterally and and and and forward you know to longitudinally to other Generations especially those closest to us if you want to impact the future there's a bunch of things you can do right reduce your carbon footprint give money vote this I want all of those to happen in a positive way but at the end of the day it's monkey see monkey do how you and I interact right now will obviously impact our relationship everyone who's listening or viewing but then everyone who's listening and viewing how they are with the person who hands them the coffee the Barista or they are with their partner how they model those behaviors is going to impact the future in a greater way I will argue than most of the ways we egoic think about having a legacy I totally agree and I I think um you know I'm old enough and frankly I'm excited to be old enough that like I can make statements about being old enough to know that like I believe that our species is for the most part benevolent I feel like most most people if raised in a um low trauma environment um with adequate resources will behave really well there are exceptions and there may be sociopaths that are born with really disrupted neural circuitry that they just have to do evil or feel you know but I think um it's clear that trauma um and challenge can can rewire behavior and certainly brain um to create you know what we see as evil right so but I think most people are good yeah um most people are are of genuine goodness um and I do think that we Model Behavior I think that etiquette is something that I guess as a 49y old person I guess does that make me middle age I'm of middle age I'll probably live hopefully to be about a 100 but we'll see bullet Buster cancer I'm going to give it give it what I got depends on whether or not you read your book fully right that that there's a response to that um that could go either way um the I like to think that reading the book fully will extend life as opposed to shorten life yes but um if nothing else maybe it'll cure insomnia the um the the idea here is that if we're going to invest in in being our best selves one would hope that other people will respond to that the way that you said you know that that we'll kind of mirror each other good behavior breeds good behavior in my life time I've seen a real um increase in the number of rules and regulations and a decrease in Etiquette like and what I would call and I don't this isn't a real term I don't think but like spontaneous etiquette or Genuine etiquette like people being kind just to be kind not because they're afraid of a consequence um and I have a theory um and I'll go through this quickly I I saw a documentary recently about the history of game shows where I learned that the first commercial was during the World Series where when de was making a run on the home run record so they used a sports game that was televised and on the radio to have a first commercial then they had game shows which were basically commercials for the products that's what they were and they used human interaction as a way to make it more interesting between the contestants and the host and then came reality TV shows and then now I would argue that social media is the reality TV show and we're all able to opt in and cast ourselves in it and that the way that people get more um let's just say presence on the show is to do things that are more hyperbolic yeah more outlandish like the like it's very hard I've tried and I think managed to some extent to do so to it's very hard to create a very very popular social media channel in this reality TV show that we are all in on social media by just being super nice to everybody um and being you can but it's much harder than if you you're a high friction uh player because it's less interesting there's less drama um it takes more attention but I do think that there are pockets of that so Lex Freedman used to talk about this like is there a social media platform where people are rewarded for being benevolent for modeling good etiquette because they genuinely like that and um I say social media because I think so much of life now is taking place there and that's the opportunity to reach people across continents and and Far Away um in time as as well right to timestamp down things so here's my question is there a version of social media that is not just on the halflife of like 12 hours what was tweeted Etc what was retweeted because I would argue that and even the highest uh virality social media posts have a halflife of about six months to a year it maybe not even that there are a few memes like the guy looking at the other girl walking the other way those kinds of memes that seem to persist but most of them don't um so is there a time capsule sort of uh version of social media because I look on the internet like on YouTube and I would say there probably three or four YouTube videos namely the Steve Jobs commencement speech at Stanford in 2015 maybe last lecture by Randy P before he died of pancreatic cancer maybe Ben Brown's Ted Talk on vulnerability I'm thinking mainly in the self-help space personal development space here and frankly aside from that and a um most things as popular as they may seem 100 million views 200 million views compared to literature compared to music compared to poetry compared to visual arts it's G to be gone right I like to think that these podcast episodes are going to project forward 30 40 years into the future but if we look at the history of what's on YouTube and we look at the halflife of any social media post it may not be the case in fact it's very likely it's not the case one would hope that they morph into something that lasts but the question here is is there a version of social media that acts as a time capsule to teach the sorts of principles that you're talking about in the show that I just did a brief history of the future one of one of the places I visit um are these caves in the south of Spain 300t below the surface that are extremely rare because what these cave have in them side by side are both kind of hand paintings done by both neanderthals and Homo sapiens it's one of the few places where they exist side by side so before we talk about social media we have to talk about the the the what that really is is storytelling and we're trying to in social media as we know it right now we're trying to tell the world a story about who we are and what I stand for why am I here and why do I matter and notice me my life meant something but we go back to that cave that I stood in where those drawings were from you know 40 50,000 years ago it was these are the animals that are here here's when they come by this is going back to the very beginning of our conversation this is a time of year you should expect to see these animals in this area right and it was what what Nancy bardaki calls Horticultural time versus mechanical time so when you because that's the way we used to think from from 40,000 years to the Agricultural Revolution 12,000 10 12,000 years ago to probably up until a couple hundred years ago we didn't remember the minute hand only existed on the analog clock starting about 200 years ago we just yeah we didn't we didn't think in minutes we barely thought look the the clock as we know it the mechanical clock as we know it only comes about during the Industrial Revolution and especially then when we start to have trains remember the train count sundal then it was it was Stonehedge it was Sundial those Seasons right the way we would think about the future by the way when people say oh AR you're you're a future fut like this is people like you have always existed now the idea of the future that is this thing out there that's going to Roy over us is relatively new because up until a couple hundred years ago Ari and Andy we did exactly what our probably what our fathers did and our kids would do exactly what we did there was no kind of evolution in in social structure but at the Advent as we asess it could be argu I've done a lot of things that my father did he was a scientist and their other domains of life but yeah goes back to modeling Behavior right the the the number one predictor if someone's going to read the newspaper is if their parents read the newspaper yeah some my D who said he'd open the paper and poke it from behind when I wanted his attention well we can talk about that in a second um the the the attention part and so when I look when I look at when I start answering your question about social media I look at it as an anthropologist from Mars that's how I go into every situation I want to say why is it that we're doing what we're doing how did that come about and how might we learn from that so that we can potentially go in a different direction I if we choose all of Storytelling is really a way of doing cultural transmission of memes of ideas of ways of being so that we can flourish and move forward as a species so then if you take that at its at its at its truth what is social media right now but nothing but a kind of a Hall of Mirrors of our culture right now what will they say 200 years from now when they look at these posts with with the likes and things that um the metrics that we use to judge ourselves individually and say what what happened to this species I'd like to take a brief break to thank one of our sponsors element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means the electrolytes sodium magnesium and pottassium in the correct ratios but no sugar now I and others on the podcast have talked a lot about the critical importance of hydration for proper brain and bodily function research shows that even a slight degree of dehydration can really diminish cognitive and physical performance it's also important that you get adequate electrolytes in order for your body and brain to function at their best the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium are critical for the functioning of all the cells in your body especially your neurons or nerve cells to make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of hydration and electrolytes I dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning and I drink that basically first thing in the morning I also drink element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing especially on hot days if I'm sweating a lot and losing water and electrolytes if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element.com huberman spelled drink lnt.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with the purchase of any element drink mix again that's drink element.com huberman to claim a free sample pack I mean one of the reasons I fell in love with Biology is that yes we are evolving as a species but I would argue slowly enough that any fundamental knowledge about biology of the human body is a it's a core truth about us way back when and now and very likely into the future and of course technologies will modify that medicine will modify our biology Etc but it there I get great peace from that um and most of the so-call protocols I describ on the podcast about viewing sunlight Etc circadian rhythmicity Etc has been core to our our biology and our well-being 100,000 years ago and very likely it will be quarter our biology 100,000 years from now I therefore worry about any technology that shortens up our um time scale of um motivation and reward and I use social media so I am not antisocial media by any stretch in fact I'm quite Pro provided it's kept in check all of Jonathan Height's uh ideas I I really like those um but let me put it this way if I go to Los Vegas which I do enjoy doing from time to time I'm not a gambling addict I guess if I say that enough times people are going to say I'm a gambling ad but I enjoy playing a little bit of roulette or a little bit the slots I play all the lowlevel stuff that doesn't require any thinking um and I often do pretty well for whatever reason um because I know when to leave probably um but Vegas is all about short-term thinking and short-term reward contingency it's actually designed in every respect to get you for to forget that there are these other longer time scales and that's why there's no natural light in most casinos lights there's no clocks in many of them um the uh the intermittent random intermittent reward schedule that there is designed to keep you playing um and I would argue that a lot of social media is like that yeah not all of it but a lot of it is like that um reward likes and responses in some cases fighting is what people want they want to fight because they like that emotion that it will the algorithms figure you out so that they shorten up your your temporal window yeah and so when people say oh we're walking around with a little slot machine in our pocket all day long with our smartphone I actually think that's right I think it's right it's more like a casino however where that casino Harbors all sorts of different games and they're going to find the one that you like some people like playing roulette I happen to like playing roulette some people like crap some people like poker some people like to bet on a game where you get to sit the whole game with the possibility of winning a friend of mine who's actually an addiction counselor he said you know the gambling addiction is the absolute worst of all the addictions why because the next time really could change everything unlike alcoholism or drug addiction or other forms of addiction where the next time is just going to take you further down in gambling there is the realistic possibility that the next time could change everything and that destroys lives so if we are walking around with a sort of Casino in our pocket how do we get out of that mindset much less use that tool in order to get into these longer term investments for the future this is what I want to know how do we get into the metaphorical uh you know cave painting scenario because this what it means is that the stories that I'm seeing on social media today probably are meaningless toward my future probably more than likely yes but I need to be informed but you know I saw the debates like how much more do I need to hear about what was happening at the debates from other people probably zero like there's no new information there the only thing that can happen is I can get caught in the little Eddy of the tide poool that uh is the the argu the debate about the debate or the debate about the debate about the debate so I mean it takes a strong strong mind to divorce oneself from all of that much less get into this longer term thinking and maybe this is why David Goggins is always outrunning and hates social media so much even though he's you know used it to good end to to share his message um I mean what is it that we can do to disengage from that short-term contingency reward mindset and behaviors and what in the world can we do instead yep is it go paint like on the side of a cave is it write a book is it um I mean how do we how do we do that and and let's check off the box of like we need to tend our kids we need to tend to our health we need to get our sleep we need to get our let's just assume that we're taking care of the the fundamentals of health and well-being which doesn't leave a whole lot time afterwards anyway what do we do like like what where where are the story where should the stories go where do we put them I I'm I feel really um impassioned by this because you know I devote my life to to this right and I teach biology because I believe it's fundamental and transcends time but I care about the future and and I'm well aware that you know in 30 years the idea that there was a guy on the internet talking about the importance of getting morning sunlight sure that might happen you know but probably no one will will care just like I realized about halfway through my scientific career that sure I was tenured at Stanford won some awards enjoyed the research enjoyed the day-to-day but I realized okay there's some I feel good about the the research contributions we made but that I knew that people weren't going to be like oh huberman discovered this because I had already forgotten the people 32 years ahead and I know the literature really well so like how how do you how do you square these different these different mental frames it's I it's it's it's a conundrum well this is a fundamental question of our time is what is the purpose of our species being here on Earth and for thousands of years that was answered by religion the idea about who we are and why we are here more often than not was answered in the afterlife but that Along Came our friend rationality and logic and and and the Renaissance and the Enlightenment and as nii said I'll give you the full quote God is dead and now we're basically screwed but I don't believe that I mean I believe in God I mean I've I've gone on record saying that before so and there are many people who believe in God in the afterlife but it's still is difficult to navigate the day to-day well because I want to separate out what what scientific rationality and the scientific method did is it didn't actually kill God what it actually did was it killed the structures that arose to intermediate between us and God aka the church and this is not a conversation about theology this is a conversation about structures and about power so science destroyed religion 100% it destroyed the stories that religion told us about our large purpose because what ended up happening look often times folks will say well you know science destroyed destroyed God and destroyed religion because it told us where we came from we didn't we're not coming from seven days right where where God spun the Earth and created the heavens in seven days I think we're at a point now where we're starting to realize that science actually tells us going back 13.7 billion years ago to the Big Bang we can quibble with that number up to today science is told has is telling us how we got to this point what science cannot do and what technology cannot do is tell us where we should be going and so what I'm not and I'm not saying God should be telling what we should be doing or or spirituality what I'm saying is you're not going to you're not going to argue you can tell God God what to tell us no I'm not going to argue but wait but but the but the term you just said that that Science and Technology cannot tell us where we need to go no look here we started off by we started off so the work that I do this this mindset that I am advocating for I call long path long path sits on three pillars these are the kind of the to use your nomenclature there three protocols one transgenerational empathy empathy with yourself empathy with the past and then and then empathy with the future you need those three the second pillar is Futures thinking you'll notice it's future with an S as opposed to the singular future because we often think of the future as a noun the sing that's out there as opposed to what the future really is which is a verb it's something that we do then the final pillar the one that is the most difficult for us to wrap our head around is this idea of Telos ultimate aim ultimate goal what are we here for so we all suffer from what I call a lifespan bias so the most important unit of time to Andrew huberman is from your birth to your death we're all wired that way because that's the literature the science that I grew up with I I grew up and I want to be a geneticist right that's where I started what the literature tells us about us as a biological entity is that the most important unit of time is from my birth to my death but the reality is for our species and it has been going back hundreds of thousands years is that these things actually overlap I come from my parents then I am here and now my children these are not distinct units there's massive overlaps in terms of the culture the the emotional the psychology of what I got from them what I'm giving to my kids but what ends up happening in a lifespan biased Society the one that we exist in right now is we have lost the Telos we have lost the ultimate aim or goal or purpose for our species for our civilization on on this planet I'm not going to tell you what that is what I am going to say is when you don't have that because God is no longer in the picture religion is no longer in the picture we flounder about and we're looking for metrics to judge am I doing the right thing do I matter will people know who I am 200 years from now will my is is my sense of purpose connected to anything larger and without these larger religious structures that we had for thousands of years the answer is no but there are still many people on the planet who believe in God and are religious yes right so more than there are that are religious so does that mean that they're immune from this like like confusion not well no because there's other confusions that come from it right there's other religion as its practice in majority parts of the world and this is where I'm going to get a lot of hate mail is mostly about power and coersion and control not at its Essence not I would say that for every major religion yes I would say for every religion like the the essence of it is is is about love the essence is about love and emancipation from The Human Condition to connect to something larger to connect to the Divine the problem is when the business models get in the way right right like with anything like with anything and so that's true of science too I mean I know a lot about the business model you referenced it earlier right science it's it's no longer uh like you know pure medich type science where you're doing these things and like it's it's published it's Parish there's business models can can we take it from the lab to the can we 100% And that is part of where we are what I'm asking for when we have a conversation about ours is to rise up out of this current moment and say most mammals kind of have about a million years that they exist on Earth from from kind of when they rise up to when they go extinct we're we're in the first third of this ball game right that's reassuring yeah we're in the because I keep hearing about you know the fact that we're almost so we're about a third of the way through we're the bottom we're in the bottom of the third in oh goodness yeah all right well well you finally said something that gives me I'm just kidding lots of things that you've said um give me confidence in our future most notably that you're talking about this sorry to interrupt but I'm going to compliment you so maybe I'll stop talking now um that most notably that um you know I think you're the first person outside of um the subbranch of Neuroscience which is a very small subbranch people that study time perception to really Call to um to people's Consciousness that the human brain can expand or contract its time perception and we do this all day long and high sence high stress High excitement um life and thinking shrinks the aperture right it contracts the aperture and makes us very good at dealing with things in the present get to the next day or the next hour collapse go and continue repeat repeat repeat it's it's the opposite of what the Buddhists that traditionally said which was to be present in order to see uh the timelessness this is why I'm I'm a big fan of the um I I forget the name it's uh Rob we'll have to edit this in the um um the otoma prayer which talks about Release Me From the time-bound nature of Consciousness to timelessness sounds very mystical but what they're really talking about is get me out of the mode of stress into the mode of relaxation that allows me to see how the now links with the past and relates to the Future impossible to do when we're under stress trying to figure out like how we're going to get someplace in traffic to pick up the kids so they're not waiting outside the school alone impossible you you you just can't you the two deep breath and the long exhale like it works to bring your level of autonomic arousal down make you navigate that situation better but it is the hyper rare individual who thinks well look you know this is linked to some larger time scale like when we are stressed The Horizon gets right up close so you're one of the first people to talk about this Dynamic relationship with that Horizon is there a way that we can Leverage The immediacy of our experience that fact to actually create useful tools for the future like so for instance before we started recording we're talking about the notion of time capsules I've been keeping a time capsule for a long time the the first idea for this came when I was a kid we used to build skateboard ramps in the backyard and I'll never forget that right before we put down the first layer of plywood we put a time capsule in there we all like wrote little notes and did things I think um someone put some candy in there or something it's kind of a cool concept right but social media to me does not seem like a time capsule I feel like it's just going to get turned over turned over turned over what are the real time capsules of Human Experience so you said religion religious Doctrine Bible Quran Torah being the big three and there are others of course but those are the big three Bible Karan Torah those are big three time capsules okay then we've got literature music poetry visual art so paintings drawings and sculpture what else do we have so let's let's bring this down uh to the individual like what what what I what my pract what one of my practices is uh or I'll go through a couple of them um and so so one of them if if you come to my home which hopefully you know you'll come over been to your home yeah but you know it's been a while it's been a while that was a complaint that was a you know wait I don't know if I haven't invited you or you just I whatever we'll talk about it afterwards whenever I make it to Manhattan I have a hard time getting out of Manhattan that's true um so we have a Shelf with a bunch of family photos and you know there's photos of my grandparents my parents myself my kids and then to the right of that there's actually and people are always like why didn't you you know take care of this there's always there's a blank photo frame just blank those you know I have three kids they're young but that blank photo frame uh represents my my grandkids or future Generations it's something that I can immediately see when I think about the decisions that's why I said long path there's a mindset there's all these complicated things and it's also a mantra so when I get into an argument with my wife or or I have a conversation with you or anything like that and I and I immediately have the stimulus arousal response where I want to act in the short term but I actually me want to see the bigger picture and again this is highly self-referential I understand that I'll just say long path I'll say like what what are we really trying to do here what is this actually all about and that because I've been doing this long enough brings me back so when I see that third empty picture frame it always reminds me that I'm here for this one segment there was a segment before and there's a segment coming after me and so how I am in my daily interactions is going to impact that how far so just a few questions more specifically about you because I think what you're doing here is you're concretizing a process a protocol if you will that anyone can use and I I would argue that the shift from printed photos largely from printed photos to electronic photos has made this problematic you know um I mean it's made certain things simpler like if you change relationships you can just delete a folder as opposed to having to actually take photographs from a previous relationship and make sure they're none around in case your next relationship would understandably take issue with that I'm not speaking from experience here um but how far back do your photos go it's interesting the the the the photos of my grandparents who both perished in the Holocaust were saved by my father who was in World War III fought with the Jewish underground made his way through Europe to Cuba to Mexico where he eventually met my mom and I was born um the photos that we have he had kept in his wallet for several decades and and he had them kind of reconstructed and turned in that's as far back as we go so grandparents yeah okay and then you're married you have three kids um and then you have this this empty photo frame empty photo frame and um you're same age as me your 50 or 49 49 49 thank you uh but you seem to be in good health yes um and seemingly young right yeah you have energy you've always had a lot of energy you used to you used to call yourself Ari Ferrari you said you're like a Ferrari that's why they I don't think this know each other since we were little kids um he's always had a ton of energy actually he hurt himself when he was younger and he was in full traction like cast of his whole lower body and he would dance on the floor on his arms kind of like David Goggins will treadmill um on his hands even when he can't move his legs okay so chances are you'll meet your grandkids hopefully yeah God willing you'll meet your grandkids um and but probably not your great grandkids probably not okay well I have a different tool but let me say something I will not probably meet them biologically like in in the sense that this this big lump of cells will probably not meet my great-grandchildren but we will meet them I'm 100% sure of is the way that I've modeled being in the world to Partners be they my wife my children business colleagues that modeling my kids will be in the room sometimes when I'm on work calls right you know nothing confidential and they you know they'll hear they'll hear in the background they'll hear how I interact how I am in the current human moment they are learning they are receiving that is how I'm going to meet my great-grandkids that's how I will be in the room with them how I have been is going to impact 30 or 40 Generations out that that 50,000 descendants that I talked about earlier 250 years from now I will meet them I will be with them they may not know my name who I am but hopefully the way they treat a stranger or they interact with their Partners um comes about how I did it that modeled behavior that transmission yeah I get it and um it's interesting because I think that well and you're on the internet so people will see you on the internet probably at at least you know I think 30 50 years out if you Google your name or whatever it's called at that point Googling you know I get in trouble when I say Googling people go why don't you talk about difference because that's the one everyone uses yeah unless you use Duck Duck Go because you're afraid what people so um when someone comes up with a like a truly better one maybe it'll get replace but meanwhile Google um so they'll get to your great grandkids could possibly know you there they could hear this conversation yeah this very conversation I think that's part of the reason why people go on social media not just to be consumers but they want they want to leave something they're probably not thinking about it consciously but they want to leave something for the future I use a tool um that I learned from a friend he has this um your life in in uh your life in weeks I think it's called and it's this you know you fill-in chart where you you put your birthday you put your predicted lifespan so for me I put a 100 it feels good to me I'm not interested in living much past 100 unless there's some technology that would allow me to do that with a lot of vigor and my friends would be around so and you mark off the the that you fill in these little squares and um I did this morning actually and you know I'm not quite halfway through but I'm about halfway through and it it's a it's an interesting thing to see your life in that representation you go oh wow it can inspire better decision- making because we can lose track of where we are in time and some of us including me are not very good at tracking time people that have ever waited for me on an appointment know this I don't I track I'm very oriented in space not well oriented in time so um the the problem with these charts is that or photos on the Shelf I would argue um is they have great utility but the problem is that they're not in the Forefront of our Consciousness throughout the day right like I filled out that chart I didn't even think about it again until now and when we are pressed with a decision in some cases we have the opportunity to step back and say okay look in the bigger Arc of things I got to go left here even though I want to go right this is the the right thing for my bigger picture the bigger picture bigger pict path yes so you know is there a way is there maybe a technology that actually serves us to Anchor us to best decision-making um for a given uh best time bin we would call it in Neuroscience best time binning mode of time binning for a given decision I think you need ask yourself a question when when you're facing a you know not should I have turkey or chicken for lunch but maybe a slightly or maybe that question too just ask yourself am I being a great ancestor what will allow me to be a great ancestor how will descendants look back on this decision go left or right that's going to elevate you look I talked about that you talked about you know deleting photos and and stuff like that so I'll tell you about the work one of my on my Advisory Board is a guy named Hal herfield smart great guy to UCLA um who does a lot of future you work and so what he did was and I'll do the short version of this like a bunch of people into an fmri functional MRI to see kind of where the flow is and he asked them he did a series of questions where it's like think about yourself right now and one part of your brain lit up and then he goes okay I want you to think about this celebrity I think he used Matt Damon and L Lee Portman and another part of their brain lit up and he said I want you to think about yourself 10 years from now and guess what the part of the brain that lit up for the celebrities Natalie and Matt was the same part that Lit Up When thinking about you 10 years from now so you had a vague idea of who future Ari was but you weren't totally connected to them right it was like a stranger to you pulled them out one group did nothing another group he took a photo of them and he you know took a photo ages them and then puts them into a 3D you know uh virtual reality and you're in a room and at one point you don't know this is going to happen as you walk across the room you see a mirror and you look at yourself in the mirror and it's a photo of you but age 10 years so you're seeing an older version of you yikes so I mean and cool very cool does this intervention pulls them out brings them back I think two weeks later and he h he has them hypothetically put money away for savings account you know exactly what happens the people who saw a version of their age self put more money away for a future retirement account than the folks that didn't so the question is not only are we discount connected from the future my you know my future descendants I'm disconnected from My Future Self so what I've done and you you you'll see this in the show it's it's it's scary CLE look just like my dad and you'll always look like your dad when you do this is even though look a lot like my mom we've been we've been bagging on social media you you can go on Snap or other places where that'll AG you right it'll make you look 10 15 years older and you can send it to your partner everybody laughs so I I I took a screenshot and I everybody laughs as opposed to saying you great no no no everyone's like oh my God and so so I I once I read about this house research many years ago I printed that out you know my little home printer cut it out and it's on my bathroom mirror and every day I spend two or three seconds staring at Future older Ari in his 70s that's how I make better decisions today and those better decisions aren't just about putting money for retirement it's about also how do I take care you know do I floss or not you know you you get end of of the night you want to just brush your teeth and go to bed huh no you need to floss at night you need to floss at night we did an episode on noral health and I learned from the from the dentist the most important the most important way to take care of future self is flossing by the way just to be clear I've learned this from many people um he's it's actually true it's so key for brain and body unbelievably key the dentists are going to thank you but we don't do it but if you look at your mouth 20 years from now staring at you as you're smiling with the older version of Andy with you you know a little bit less hair a little bit more wrinkles um you're going to do it this is what howw work has showed so that's another thing that I've done is just look at that look at that image of future you and and connect with it um that's about having compassion for yourself that's part of this kind of transgenerational uh empathy component the one thing I want to Circle back on because we could we could quickly fly past it is this idea of Futures thinking versus the the singular future yeah I definitely want to touch on that can I just ask you a question real quickly before here of course this notion of of um let's say a protocol for imagining future self or actually visualizing future self not as a way to scare yourself into better health habits although if it works great but as a way to um you know really get your mind into the reality that if you survive you're going to get older by definition and that person needs care and in an environment and your kids are going to grow up too we know this okay that's all obvious um I feel like barring accident or injury or disease most people have a kind of intuitive sense of how long they're going to live and the reason I say this is um you know I remember when Steve Jobs was alive because I was a postto in paloalto then and would see him occasionally around paloalto um there and then you know read the Walter Isaacson biography about him and it seemed like he had a very clear sense that someday he would die and he lived his life essentially according to that principle and and in some sense may have Justified being a little bit outrageous at times and a little bit you know High friction at times um through this sense of urgency like it was important to get things done and get them done right and to discard with a lot of kind of like popular convention and he's kind of celebrated for it I'm sure few people dislike him I think most people celebrate him for it um I guess he had some sense of how long he was going to live and then at one point maybe that sense was inflated and then boom your dad died very when you were very young do you think that that gave you a perspective that you know at any moment you could be four months out you get the four month's notice that you're going to be dead in four months like like do it shape your thinking about the about the future I mean my dad's now I'm not not saying this as a I mean no it's it's interesting that there may been a distinct advantage of course not to his dying of course but to the idea that it it really creates the sense of urgency about not just the present but the future I remember we were very young you're like I want to have kids you got going on a family like I think first among all of us y really early and for those whose parents you know are still alive and and you know and seem to be vigorous maybe they feel less of a sense of urgency right which sounds wonderful parents are alive vigorous okay that's a blessing but if it prevents you from living your life in a way that's really linked to your your futures that's not good so do you think that we have an intuitive sense or or an unconscious sense of how long we are likely to live like a kind of a range cuz kind of argued that in some of his writings and speaking so look the let's talk about death so it's my contention that one of the things that keeps us from thinking about the far future and acting and behaving in a way that will will alter it for the better is the fact that to truly think and feel yourself into the far future means that you're going to have to think about a moment where you no longer exist 1972 Ernest Becker wrote a book which you'll know all about the book based on the title called the denial of death he won the pillar surprise for it and Becker's contention was that we the only species that at a very early age recognizes that we are only here for a short period of time but more than anything at one point in time we will die we will cease to exist and it was Becker's contention further that everything religion culture uh laptops convertibles everything that we create is our way of pushing back the the very understanding that at one point we will cease to exist and it horrifies us I could not agree more and I'm so so grateful that you mention this book be and this idea from Becker because I would argue that every addiction every single addiction is based in a fear of death and an attempt to shorten the time scale of thinking shorten the time scale of rewards shorten the time scale of everything to avoid that reality and it's a reality that we learn of at a very early age intuitive because we see death around us more and more now in America especially in the Western World we push back from Death we do everything we can to to to avoid even just even old people that you know we we we put them in old age homes it used to be we Liv together right in these in these multigenerational homes because older people I would argue remind us of death remind us of our own mortality and so until we can reconcile ourselves truly at an individual maybe even at a collective level that we will cease to exist it becomes extremely and is extremely difficult to Future to Future properly to Future in the way that I'm advocating for which is about being a great ancestor to Future descendants and generations and so in the work that I've done and in in the show that I did I did something people were very confused like you know the show about the future brief history of the future everyone's like oh you're going to go see all this cool technology blah blah blah blah that's part of what we do but in the middle of the show in episode four I go to the high mountain desert in we travel all over the world but I go to the high mountain desert outside of Tucson and I sit with the Lua Arthur a death duela and what she does you know you know mostly the time when we think of a doula we think of someone helping birth a a child into the world what a death Doula does is help us and help our loved ones exit this world and she does something extraordinary other cultures some religions have this she does something called a death meditation and in the show I do it and then you you can find these online where you literally go through a medit a guided meditation where you go from breathing to sensation of breath to literally just becoming one with the soil it's a very intense thing to go through but I went through a version of the death meditation as you've alluded to when I was 18 years old cuz I literally am the one who picked up the phone from the hospital at 2 in the morning I was home from college and I picked it up I didn't even I didn't even say hello I picked up the phone I said this is his son cuz who else was calling it to in the morning and it was a charge nurse and she goes I want to bring you up to speed he Rel late stage of cancer your father is not responding we've been doing CPR there are no orders on what to do what do you want us to do so I made that call because it was obvious of where it was going that was my way of confronting the salience of my of his mortality and my own mortality very very abruptly um other people have their own early brushes with death I would argue that there is a certain level and you touched on this of of emancipation when you've come close you don't you don't want to wish it on anyone but when you have come close to seeing what that looks and feels like you all of a sudden become free from the burdens that society places on you in the in the earnest bararan way of trying to push back mortality because you no longer give a because you've now you now know where it's all going to go and you've seen it um as a society in the West in America we do the exact opposite of that we inject things into our body into our everything we can to push it back because we want more quantity but we don't think about the quality of the life that we want now that being said you go to Japan uh 90% of the companies that are over a thousand years old on planet Earth right now are in Japan so part of it is our culture part of it is different cultures of how they think and respect elders and death and they understand that we don't need to exist within this own lifespan bias but we're actually part of a chain a great chain of being those who came before the pros and cons of that the baggage of that and then it's my role to decide what I want to keep and what I want to let go and then what I want to transmit to the Next Generation that larger purpose that larger Telos is what's missing right now that I think we need back in Western Society not just so that we're grounded and happy that's yes and more content but because we need to be able to do that as we confront what we do or do not do about climate change what we do or do not do about synthetic biology what we do or do not do about artificial intelligence because right now especially on the last two the technology is telling us what to do and we don't need more smartness we need more wisdom and part of that wisdom is going to come about by us integrating the fact that you alluded to that at one point we won't be here how do we do this I mean like we can do it conceptually like you want to set the stage for that whoever ends up in that empty frame um to have a better life but it's it's hard to do like I think most people assume once it's lights out who knows what happens next but it's very hard to get them working for something that they don't have the ability to imagine and the people that they don't even know so in other words if we have a hard enough time imagining ourselves in the future you gave us a tool look at the Aged version of yourself I love that and if there's a website that we'll do that we can put a link to it the show note captions put a reminder that you will get older you are getting older in the in this very moment and try and live for that the well-being of that person and the people around them and look at it so that that creates a protocol for the self how do we protocol the the future setting um the Futures approach the verbing of the future or into the future for people around us and for people that we don't even really know and that we probably will never even meet great question um before we go on that let's let's double click on the on the individual incentive so we talked about the Aging photo that you can do uh there's also another thing you can do that's very powerful you touched on this earlier which is writing a letter to your future self um so you know you can do this at at longpath org you can find Future me websit you have a you have a yeah yeah it's the number one tool that we use so when I when I give when I give talks I give shockingly people have me come and talk to large groups not shockingly come on what what I say to them is you know we'll kind of go through a version of a different conversation like this um I'll say now what I want you to do is I want you to write a letter to your future self it's going to be delivered in five years from now and I thought this was a common practice because I've been doing it from a very early age but apparently it's not to write a letter to your future self yeah I can't I mean maybe once or twice we did it and so I'll let you in a little secret the the this is um the change occurs not when you receive the letter but when you actually write it because you're actually thinking in a way about future you in a way that you normally don't which is who's going to receive this letter where do I want them to be um and what I find more often than not is people come after me come come up to me afterwards and I go to write I'd never even thought who do I want to be in five or 10 years like what's that Arc of what I want to kind of connect to what am I optimizing four how do I make myself better in that way so I want I want to make sure people understand that if you can't look at a photo of yourself age the very least write a letter to your future self and what does the letter include dear Andy dear Ari and then whatever you want to put in right this is a onetoone private conversation with your future self what are your hopes what are your dreams what are your desires what are you afraid of what do you want to see happen because until you put out there uh you know you can't be it if you can't see it right you have to actually visualize what that is and putting in not not the negative but what you really want to see aspirationally in that letter now starts creating a a road map to getting there because at the very at the very kind of bottom of the Pyramid of what that road map is is visualizing what that success looks like right so I was um in high school I ran track and I started off by doing you know the The 100 uh very kind of in in individual Sport and then eventually um as I went forward I started running the 4X 100 which is a relay race and what I learned from my coach coach Ted tilan um was that the 4X 100 it's very important that all four runners run very very fast obviously but where that race is one or lost is in the transition zone is in the passing of the Baton and so when you write a letter to your future self yes you're connecting to your future but what it's really also helping you do is realize that life is not a 100 yard dash it's actually a relay and you're carrying a bon that was handed to you that you are now going to hand off and I'm arguing that we right now what I call we're in this intertial moment between kind of what was and what will be as a as a planetary civilization we are in this transition zone and what we do or do not do in this intertitle in this transition zone with the Baton that is homo sapen planetary flourishing culture and um is going to matter much more than we think it does in the current moment of social media pings so that that's that's touch it on the individual let's go up to that Collective we have to decide as individuals which some of these protocols will help you do but we have to decide as a society that we want to actually tackle the question of to what end because in the Erasure of God in the Erasure of the afterlife in that in in what was given to us by religion for hundred thousands of years some sort of guarantee that we would go on to heaven or hell now that that is no longer there for a lot of people for some it still is and it still helps them make better decisions I would argue in the day-to-day but for those who no longer have that we have to decide that and this can be from an egoic level that the decisions that we make or do not make are either going to hook up in a great way future Generations or or or not be we can be in those three categories we can be one or two it doesn't matter who cares I'm just going to you know like YOLO or we can say we want to be part of a much larger project um I talk about this a lot like the the kind of you can tell my bias here like I don't say human like the homo sapien project I think like I said we're kind of at the bottom or the top of the third we have at least several hundred thousand more years to go I am not as focused as to whether or not we leave Earth and we go to Mars and we become an Interstellar species I'm focus on who we are cuz I've met like you I've met Great Hearts and minds and I think that as a society if we take care of everyone's basic needs if we look at kind of the best of humanity the best of the humans that we've met we can all rise to that level so instead of there being like a hundred great heroes in the world who are just so heartfelt you know like the dolly llama or or Mother Teresa or even Einstein that that could actually be are those three still in t they've been canceled yet no they're still they're still with us they're still with me with me but look even when you get into their look you asked one of the ways how how do you build transgenerational empathy with the past read people's biographies especially autobiographies and you see they had it really tough and they're not as perfect and as saintly as we think they are and those right and the autobiographies are of course through their own lens through their own l so the biographies give you or or you read their letters to their lovers or to their Partners like this kind that person's kind of an right like but but at the end of the day if we as a society want to find ourselves where more of us than less of us are at this heightened sense of kind of intellectual and spiritual and emotional activation that's not going to happen overnight but if we say that's the goal that we want we want to see people will argue 9 billion 7 Bill billion three billion whatever the population of homos sapiens is on planet over the next several centuries or Millennia if we want to see them flourishing in a way that's beyond what science fiction has ever even showed us if we make that decision that your life what what Andy Andrew huberman is doing his work when Ari walk is contributing to that that gives you a sense of purpose that I think religion used to give us that we are now sorely lacking in a social media uh world of instant buying of crap that we don't need on the internet yeah or that we do need and it's just a shorter time scale reward thing like I'm I don't believe that everything that happens on social media that we buy or the pleasure that we get in our our lifespan or day is bad I don't think you know I'm a capitalist too what I what I think is that it's just one it is but one time window of of kind of operations just I just think it's good to have flexibility right it's sort of like in in nutrition they talk about metabolic fle flexibility it's it's all about balances about Harmony how are we in harmony with with the future that that that is that is what I'm advocating for so I love it and I I also know that a lot of people love it even if they don't know they love it meaning um they perhaps haven't heard it framed the way that you describe it in your book on your show and today but I think a lot of people just are hoping that the super high Achievers right the Steve Jobs's the Elon the um I don't know how people feel about politicians nowadays but you know but the people building Technologies who to really care about the future I mean say what you want about Elon but the guy is building stuff for the now and for the future y I mean he's doing it um that they will take care of it for next Generations right just like there were those the Edison and the Einstein and the you know the you have to be careful with names these days because almost everyone has something associate with them where you're going to trigger someone but I'll just be you know um relaxed about it and say like would even say like uh you know even like a Jane Goodall like the appreciation of our relationship with animals and what they have to contribute to to our own understanding of ourselves and our planet that kind of thing so um you know those people ushered in the the life that I've had and um and I feel pretty great about that um so many people are probably saying okay make sense for my family but you know what do I have to contribute um and you gave the example of the fact that children are always observing they carry forward the patterns and the and the traits um and certainly the responses that they observe in their parents what's okay what's not okay you know starting in the 80s and in the 90s in this country there were many more divorces in fractured homes than uh there were previously um as a consequence there's also been a fracturing of the kind of collective celebration of of holidays like the things that have anchored us through time are happening less frequently now many of these have been become commercialized but that was always the case you know people were getting Christmas presents one way or another so um you know do you think that the the kind of fracturing of the family unit has contributed to some of this lack of of um let's just call it longer path um thinking and decision- making look I I I think it's the the fracturing of the institutions that have been with us the past several hundred years that is leading to uh an exponential rise in short-term Behavior okay so you mentioned religion uh maybe for a moment we could just talk about universities yeah these days in part because of the distrust of Science and in part because of the distrust of in government and in part because of the distrust in traditional media um there's more and more uh ideas being kicked around that you know formal education is not as valuable as it used to be and people always cite the examples of the Mark Zuckerberg's and uh others who didn't finish college but I would argue they got in and chose to leave they took leave of absence they didn't drop out and they are rare individuals Ryan holiday said it best I think if you are struggling in college you're absolutely the kind of person that needs to stay in college um with rare exception unless there's like a mental health issue or some a physical health issue that needs to be tended to because nowhere else in life except perhaps the military is there such a clear designated set of steps that take you from um you know point A to point B with a credential that you can leverage in the real world for for builds um and I completely agree with that but I would also argue that academic institutions and financial institutions have changed political institutions have changed and there's a there's a deep distrust so we we are having a harder time relying on them to make good decisions I you saw a lot of presidents of University major universities fired recently um including Stanford there I said it it happened um but also Harvard and other places for different reasons and and fired might be not the correct term they decide to resign whatever it was they're no longer there they have new ones in um and so there's a lot of distrust so what can we rely on like if it's not if if people are having less faith in religion less faith in academic institutions less faith in like what do we got we got really good in academ at least on the social sciences side of saying what was wrong with the systems but not about what the systems we wanted them to be because going back several hundred years ago coming you know through the Enlighten especially well Renaissance into the enlightenment the enlightenment gave us back this idea of a new meta narrative based on on on rationality and logos and and the ability to kind of understand the World by breaking it down into its component parts of that science um fast forward several hundred years and we're at the point now where we're really good at saying what doesn't work but very very bad about saying what does work and what we do want because by saying what we do want means that we have to put forth some sort of meta narrative some thread some official future that we can hang ourselves on and it tells us a lot about it's sort of like Declaration of values it's one thing to say um which is scary uh for a lot of people because it's one thing to say that doesn't work that's no good that's no good it's easy to be a Critic what you're describing has incredible par to what to health like you know when I started the podcast and even before when I was posting on social media it was during the lockdowns and it was like all this fear about everything and I said listen like I I can't solve this larger issue related to what may or may not be going on but what's obvious people are stressed stress is bad when it's chronic people aren't sleeping that's bad especially when it's chronic and I've got some some potential Solutions some tools some zero cost tools so a lot of the the backbone of the hubman Lab podcast is about the things you do more so than the things you don't do so what you're describing is essentially a field that consists of like breaking things down but isn't offering Solutions so it sounds very similar and I think that um people love potential Solutions even if one acknowledges look this might not solve every sleep issue it very well could make you know positive ground towards some of it or make it 50% better 20% better in some cases 100% better and of course there are those For Whom the the tools don't work and they need to go to through more to more Extreme Measures but um I hear you saying that religion provided the solutions not just pointing to problems people are not looking at that as much anymore the uh big institutions like AC academic institutions political institutions let's face it regardless of where one sits on one side of the aisle or the other they're constantly fighting it's like 12- hour news cycle designed you just point fingers so that nobody actually has to say what they really believe in a clear tangible way there are those that do that a bit more than others but it's it's a it's a mess and then in terms of the family unit this is what I was alluding to before I feel like family units and values and structures are becoming more rare at least in the traditional view of the family um let let let's remember two parents kids Etc which is not by no means a requirement to call something a family but so like where so are you saying that we all have to look as like it obviously starts with the individual but that every that part of the work of being a human being now in going forward is to learn this Futures approach we have to be future conscious we but again this goes back to the transgenerational component we have to critically assess where we came from and why we're at this point so we talk let's talk about the nuclear family let's um the idea that your children would be quote unquote sleep trained and put into another room is relatively new that's from the Victorian era right where you would put your kids in another room because if you go back to most indigenous cultures everyone together and this happened for thousands of years and the kids pile yeah or in one big room or or in a long house huh I don't know if they were like piglets but they definitely all s together look the the my and look everyone can look I'm going to say this in a non-judgmental way but it's going to sound very judgmental I walk down the street sometimes and I see kids in strollers being pushed by a seemingly healthy adult right the kid is detached and they're in this kind of this buggy which comes from 17 18th century England but if you look at most cultures around the world for thousands of years what they did was they wore their babies for what we call the fourth trimester usually the mother so a bunch of patriarchal reasons for that but they literally would have a wrap on and the baby would be wrapped and be held very close to them this is the baby beorn thing well the baby beorn you put the baby on front of you but it's facing out when you really wrap them with like a 20 yard WP it's skin to skin right and and and look and there's a reason like like everything there's a reason for everything you know B for for a human baby to come out of the mother as cognitively intellectually and physically ready as a baby chimpanzee would take 18 months of gestation but we only do nine you know why right we we do it because our brains got so big because of all that protein because of AR and Andy were hunting together using our prospection earlier on this story that the baby has to come out at 9 months because when we from walking on all fours to being bipedal the female pelvis closes and there's only so much room for that baby to come out so they come out early yeah the brain had completed development internally the you'd have only stillborn I mean presumably there was a branch of our earlier version of species that many mothers and and uh babies died in child birth because of this they were deselected but that's not the we found we found the optimal balance of 9 months roughly right but what that means is the baby has to be attached and close to the because it's totally helpless um the point is that so much of what we do we don't critically examine so you're talking about you know the breakdown of the family structure I would argue that breakdown isn't happening now that breakdown happened when we decided to move from you know tribes and clans of raising children and move into a Victorian area mindset where we we take the grandparent you know there there's very few species on planet Earth that after the female um goes through menopause they still live basically elephants whales and humans right why because those are the species where you need others Elders to help care for the young because of the a for mentioned early early uh birthing but maybe it's also the the propagation of of story as you said earlier that can inform better decisions so we we need stories wisdom is like spoken cave paintings basically yeah and so we need so those stories about what does it mean to have a proper family structure as you know whether it's a nuclear family of four or five 20 of aunts and uncles and around look we did pretty well for the first couple hundred thousand years and then there was all these things that religion disrupted right taking the children away from the mom these all come from puritanical beliefs now we're at this point in this intertitle moment where we have to critically examine why is it we do what we do what are the things that we want to keep and what are the things we want to let go of and how do we move forward and your question was well why do they want to do that what is it what is it what's the incentive structure and I'm arguing that the incentive structure for us to do that because because we actually care about where we take our species where we move forward in the universe given the fact that so much had to go right to get us to this point right I'm I'm often asked this question you know um God how do we how do we get so messed up and what is it going to look like wait are are we so messed up because you said we're about a third of the way through our our things are better than yeah so I get I get the I get the question like how is it that we messed up and I always say we didn't mess up we're actually doing much better look I I walk into my daughter's room and I look at their bookshelf 15-year-old twin daughters and every piece of fiction that takes place somewhat in the future is dystopian all the Futures they know are the Hunger Games are the hund are the Maze Runner a world that has gone bad um I understand the we talked about this earlier that's the negativity bias people going to be attracted to reading about those things kids read that stuff now oh my those are the best sellers the best sellers are all the these dystopian there's always a love interest in a teenage thing but it's always the backdrop is always dystopia and we're attracted to that in the same way we're attracted to a dumpster fire because we want to see the things that dystopias can act as dystopian stories can act as an early warning system if you keep doing this one thing that you're doing and extrapolate out a few decades it'll look like this what we're missing and you just you hit the nail on the head are the stories about what if we get it right what what we call protopia so you know you Utopia is this perfect world that always collapses on itself it's really dystopia a size dystopia we talked about is a terrible terrible World a protopia this idea put forth by Kevin Kelly is a better tomorrow not perfect but one we're making progress so it's unbelievably important and this is how I'm answering your question from a few minutes ago that we start setting stories in protopia in better tomorrow in tomorrows where not everything is perfect but where we have made significant progress now it won't be perfect there'll still be divorces and maybe murders and Mayhem but if we start will say okay that all sounds great like I I for one say you know that the shift from the notion of building a better future through self-sacrifice rather you can make it a almost like pro- self and others Endeavor the way you've described it empathy for self empathy for others getting some control over the um you know contraction dilation of your time window making sure that you know what you you take good care of yourself but you take care of the the future Generations as well like for the that empty frame the now empty frame um and then moving from dystopia to protopia that that all sounds great but I think a lot of people might think okay well at best I could do that for myself and the people that um that I know it's going to be hard to do that as as a greater good for the greater good and you could say well that does contribute to the greater good this is actually very similar to what we tell um graduate students when they're uh they get their first round of data you go okay well the data often times not always but often times you you say well the data are cool like if it continues this way that' be an interesting story and they get the sense and you already have the sense because you have the experience to know like the best case scenario is is a nice solid paper MH that your three reviewers and maybe 20 other people will read and you're going to spend the next five years of your life on this thing maybe three but probably five years of your life and you'll get your PhD and there's always this question like do you ditch that project and go for something else or do you stay with that project in other words what you're saying is you get to put your brick on the wall but it's a brick whereas you know there are other projects you go whoa like that's you know that's like One Wing of the cathedral and and it's a rare instance where that happens and a lot of it's luck and it's doesn't always work out anyway but you know what we're saying here is you know how hard people are willing to work is often related to what they feel the potential payoff will be if they can sense the payoff and by the way I love the protocols that you offered the empty frame the journaling to future self this notion of time capsuling your your present thinking into the future um the Aging of self these are these are very actionable things I plan to do them um and I think they're very valuable but if I understand correctly you are interested in creating a movement of sorts um where many if not everybody is thinking this this way because the other model is okay well the Elon will take care of it for us and I'm um or the uh you know the or the system's so broken and like there's nothing I can do I'm just trying to make ends meet so how does one create a like a like a reward system or a social media platform or you know how does one you know join up with other people who are trying to do this so the question you're getting at is in in a lot of the work that I've read and listened to on this podcast often times it's about how do we you know obviously how do we how do we optimize the self and I mean that in a good way not in a selfish way um how do we make ourselves better right that's where you have to start I'm advocating for for how do we optimize Society how do we optimize civilization and this is a clear case where unlike when think of scale being you know make more widgets at a cheaper price this is really a one plus one plus one plus one at Infinity so if at infinum if we think about just for example how many listeners and viewers there are of this podcast Millions right um and how many people they interact with within their within their closest sphere and you go out right so right now that your listeners have the potential to live and act long paath and in this way where they're doing something for a greater they're thinking about their purpose in the world as nested within the larger purpose of our species to to allow for more mass flourishing in the future uh for generations to come if you think about your listeners and how they interact and how they Model Behavior your potenti and in their spheres you're at 30 40 50 million people right that's a very very large number um and what we know about social emotional contagion is that these things are contagious they are memes this is Susan Blackmore's work um that's how it scales it actually is one of those things where you're not going to you know just add powder um and it all of a sudden will will create this this optimal future for everyone because only one person that does it like we all have a role to play in it it's like literally what what I would want is anyone who's listening or watching this uh when they're done it um take a few minutes and think about what what kind of Futures do I want for myself for my family for the generations to come and what is my role in that great play what do I have to do and yes you need the protocols to kind of bring you back into there right for me it's easy because I wrote the book I did the show I can just think long path I can do it for others this is going to be the first time they're thinking about this or maybe they've been thinking about it for years even in their smallest interactions they start doing it and we you know this is this gets into kind of the Santa Fe Institute and complexity Theory this stuff starts to actually reverberate that's how we do it you know there's not we don't need to March for long-termism right we don't we don't we don't need bumper stickers thank you there will be no bumper stickers there bumper stickers there will be no bumper stickers it's about placing our very essence and our actions within the realm of possibility for the Futures that we want and our role in that and then the purpose I don't care if you're a barista if you're a surfing instructor if you're a you know brilliant podcaster um whatever it is that you do do it with the intention and recognition that you're modeling a way of being in the world that has ramifications and reverberations Beyond this current moment I you said earlier well you know who knows if anyone will listen to your podcast what I can tell you with certainty because I'm sure it's probably already happened is a large language model an llm some you know what we call AI right now is already or it will at some point ingest the hubman Lab podcast yeah we have one we have a hubman lab AI there you go we haven't advertise it very heavily but it's there you can ask me questions it's pretty good it sounds a bit like me the jokes are dry they're dry and not funny I say mostly funny but you'll get I'll give you some more um but eventually that will pull that will percolate out so at the speed of things are going three or four years from now this very conversation how we're model what what I learned in school discourse ethics how we talk to one another that is teaching these machines how to think and act and who and what we are and how to become the best of or the worst of ourselves what we put out there the kind of the public facing content is going to become what these machines think of as how they should be and we're modeling it for for for them um and going back to the higher education example for a second I think higher education like many institutions as as AI what we call that fully comes online is going to radically radically change and it will be you know a Cambridge or an Oxford tutor in everyone's ear and higher education this idea that you kind of come together um to receive information will start to dissipate from higher education but what higher education will start to do and I think what I need to focus on is not just the intellectual and and and the cognitive but also the psychological and the emotional uh core of who you are and helping you develop that well aen to that uh you know there was a former guest on this podcast uh or there was a guest on this podcast previously uh Dr Wendy Suzuki's professor at NYU I think now she's the dean of of um Arts and Sciences I think is the correct title and you know she's trying to bring some of her Laboratories data on the value of even very brief meditations to Stress Management in college first to kind of to help students manage the stress that is college and being in your early 20s um but I think there's a larger theme there which is to try and teach emotional development to teach self-regulation um because many people don't get that I mean you know that or they get it but then there are big gaps um and I I love the way that you're describing this basically it's it's a it's a lens I if I if I may it's it's a lens into Human Experience that's very Dynamic um um and is really in concert with the fact that the human brain has the capacity for this dynamic repres presentation of time like focus on like solve for the now there will be parts of your day no doubt today where you just have to solve for the now you're not thinking about the great or good um and then the ability to dilate your your Consciousness um in in the temporal sense and and to solve for things that are more longterm make these Investments towards the future um I wonder though you know how can we incentivize people to be good to do good um and how can we incentivize people to do this on a backdrop of a lot of short-term carrots and short-term Horizons um I think you've given us some answers um and they're very powerful ones such as the Aging self image exercise um journaling into the future writing to Future Self the empty um frame the empty frame uh exercise linking up with our ancestors and thinking about where we're at now and where we want to go is there anything else that you want to add meaning is there anything that we should all be doing should we all be reading more biography should we um if I look back through history it's both dark and light um like what is there anything else that you really encourage people to do to be the best version of themselves for this life and the the ones that come come next I've touched on this we we we need to examine in ourselves why is it we do and are the way that we are right do you know why in this country we vote on Tuesday I don't have any idea so most advanced democracies vote over the weekend or a couple of weekends in America we vote on Tuesday because that was the time that was necessary for someone to leave church on Sunday ride on Horseback into the big city vote on Tuesday and ride back before Market Day on Wednesday I'm so glad you're going to tell me it's not because um then can still watch Monday Night Football no this is long before Monday Night Football and so I think why we vote on Tuesday um it's a metaphor for so much of who we are and have become as individuals and as a society um I'm a big fan of cognitive behavioral therapy of CBT I think partially because what it does is it it has us look at what of those what are those negative stories that we tell ourselves but then because you can't just say stop doing something you can't just extinguish a behavior you have to add and put in a positive story what I've tried to do with some of our time here today and what I want people to partially take away more than partially to really take away and bring in is examine the you know the why Tuesdays what are those stories that you've inherited some of them are going to be macrosocial like you are defined by this Society by what you own by the badge on your car that says how successful you are that's a story it's a story that's been fed to us there are other stories are very personal these are stories that can sometimes be very private and go back Generations within a family and then to understand some of those stories serve us some of those stories don't serve us but after Discerning that we then have to write a new story we have to write a new story for oursel who am I why am I here isn't going to be answered by a religion or a God or a book or a podcast or a futurist it's going to be answered by looking and searching inside of yourself about how does you got here what really matters and where you want to contribute and help move us forward as a as a species on spaceship earth you know as not as not as a passenger but as crew on this vessel and how we're going to move forward so the stories have served us well and they have not served us well and to move forward forward it's okay now to say I'm going to write these stories that serve me I'm going to see the future not as a now not as this thing that I'm heading towards or that's going to Tumble over me but that I'm going to create and those stories may be very in in in intrapersonal they may be interpersonal they may be political they may be business they may be what you buy what you consume but you have to have agency you have to instill a sense of hope into your own life and a sense of awe and a sense of really just empathy for who you are and where we are if we want to collectively move forward into the Futures that will allow our descendants to look back on us and say they they were great ancestors I love it and I also um just want to highlight the importance of um recordkeeping of of putting things down on paper or maybe in electronic form creating time capsules for the future Generations because I think a lot of what people probably are thinking or worried about a little bit is like okay I can do all this stuff to try and make things better and even give up the desire for any kind of credit but um you know not feeling like it will be of any significance but what I've learned from you today is that you know it starts with the self and then it radiates out to um the people we know and that maybe we um cohabitate with but even if we don't cohabitate with anybody it radiates out from us and that it is important to get a sort of Time Capsule going so that um people can feel like they have um some significance in the future that they may not ever have immediate experience of but to really like send those ripples forward and get the sense that those ripples are moving forward so for that reason and especially given the nature of this podcast for the reason that you gave these very concrete protocols if you will um that we've highlighted in the in the time stamps of course as tools as as protocols um I really want to thank you because oftentimes discussions about past present and future can get a bit abstract and a bit vague for people and um you've done us all a great service by making them very concrete and actionable that's so much of what this podcast is about it's one part information one part option for Action right we don't tell people what to do but we give them the option for Action I'm certainly going to adopt some of the these protocols and also for taking the time to come to talk with us today um share your wisdom and share what you're doing and in many ways well it is not in many ways it is absolutely part of what you're describing which is um putting your best self toward how things can be better now and in the future it's also you know a great pleasure to sit down with somebody I've known for so many years and uh and uh learn from you so it's a it's a real honor and a privilege and I know um everyone else listening to and watching this feels the same way so thank you so much thank you for having me thank you for joining me for today's

Title: Peptide & Hormone Therapies for Health, Performance & Longevity | Dr. Craig Koniver
Published: 2024-10-07 12:01:15 UTC
Description:
In this episode, Dr. Craig Koniver, M.D., a board-certified physician trained at Brown University and Thomas Jefferson University, discusses the therapeutic application of peptides and hormones for enhancing physical and mental health and performance.

We explore GLP-1 analogs for weight loss, BPC-157 for wound healing and reducing inflammation, as well as peptides that increase growth hormone, improve REM sleep, and enhance cognitive function. We also cover testosterone therapy, NAD, NMN, and NR supplementation, methylene blue for mitochondrial health, stem cell therapies, and supplements such as CoEnzyme Q10 and methylated B vitamins.

Additionally, we discuss effective dosages, sourcing, safety considerations, and the importance of working with knowledgeable physicians. Whether you're currently using peptides or exogenous hormones, or simply curious about their potential benefits and risks, this episode provides the scientific rationale behind how peptides function, their potential to enhance mental and physical health, and how they can optimize performance.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Craig conver Dr Craig conver is a medical doctor who did his training at Brown University and Thomas Jefferson University he is a world expert in what he refers to as performance medicine which involves the use of peptides and other therapies for improving mental health physical health and performance now many of you have perhaps heard of peptide therapies perhaps some of you have not a peptide is simply a small protein so insulin is a peptide we have many different thousands of peptides in our brain and body and they perform a variety of different roles Dr conover's expertise is in the use of exogenous that is peptides that one takes exogenous peptides for activating multiple Pathways in the brain and body to augment health now of course peptides such as insulin have been used for many years now to treat things like diabetes but today we talk about novel peptides including glp1 so these are glucagon likee peptide analoges things like OIC and monjaro which I realize are a bit controversial however today we talk about the micro doing of those peptides we talk about those peptides combined with other peptides as well as behavioral practices to offset the muscle loss associated with them and then we dive into some lesser known peptides but ones that are growing in in use for instance bpc157 or body protection compound 157 which is used to treat inflammation to accelerate wound healing and a variety of other things then we discuss the use of peptides specifically to increase growth hormone secretion during sleep as well as some peptides that can actually increase rapid eye movement sleep dramatically today we also discuss testosterone therapies Not Just For Men but for women these are growing increasingly popular as well as things like NAD as well as specific supplements Dr Conover as he will soon tell you is not a huge proponent of supplements but he does mention several that he feels are of particular use including things like co-enzyme Q10 and some of the methylated B vitamins and he explains why he takes that stance so today's discussion is really for anybody interested in mental health physical health and performance and the reason I say that is that even if you aren't considering taking peptides or already taking peptides peptides and some of these other compounds I've mentioned sit somewhere between doing nothing except diet and exercise supplements which I sort of see is the next step up the ladder in terms of augmenting your health approaches and then of course there are a number of prescription drugs including hormone therapies such as growth hormone therapies testosterone therapies and a number of other things that yes can modify those hormone Pathways they are in fact hormones but they actually can shut down one's natural production of those hormone Pathways peptide therapies sit somewhere between doing nothing and supplementation and those more advanced hormone therapies and that's why peptide therapies I believe are growing in popularity they can augment specific hormone Pathways they can augment specific in fact multiple processes within the brain and body to augment Health but they don't tend to operate in that negative feedback cycle by shutting down one's own endogenous production now that doesn't mean that they aren't without some safety concerns and today we of course discuss the potential side effects and safety concerns of peptides as well as the critical issue of sourcing clean peptides and working with a board-certified physician if one is going to pursue peptide use so by the end of today's discussion you will be right there on the Cutting Edge of what's happening and where things are going with peptides and in keeping with that you'll notice that during today's discussion we talk a fair amount about what the FDA currently allows in terms of prescription peptides what the FDA has recently removed from the market in terms of peptides and as a very recent update just prior to the release of this episode I learned that three peptides cjc-1295 epom morelan both of which are in the growth hormone secretagogue family meaning they promote the release of growth hormone as well as thymosin beta Alpha which is in the sort of anti-inflammatory and tissue repair pathway those three are now reallowed for prescription in the United States so at the time of recording this episode we discussed some of those as being recently banned by the FDA they are now approved again for use in humans by the FDA so there's a brief and very recent update so just to summarize this admittedly long introduction today you're going to learn about this incredible area of science called peptide biology and how it can augment mental health physical health and performance and you're going to do so from one of the world's leading clinical experts before you begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is ju ju makes medical grade red light therapy devices now if there's one thing that I have consistently emphasized on this podcast it is the incredible impact that light can have on our biology now in addition to sunlight red light and near infrared light sources have been shown to have positive effects on improving numerous aspects of Cellar and organ Health including faster Muscle Recovery improved skin health and wound healing improvements in acne reduced pain and inflammation even mitochondrial function and improving Vision itself what sets Tu lights apart and why they're my preferred red light therapy device is that they use clinically proven wavelengths meaning specific wavelengths of red light and near infrared light in combination to trigger the optimal seller adaptations personally I use the juv whole body panel about three to four times a week and I use the juv handheld light both at home and when I travel if you'd like to try juv you can go to ju spelled jv.com huberman juv is offering an exclusive discount to all hubman lab listeners with up to $400 off ju products again that's ju spelled jv.com huberman to get up to $400 off today's episode is also brought To Us by betterhelp betterhelp offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online therapy is an extremely important component to overall health in fact I consider doing regular therapy just as important as getting regular exercise including cardiovascular exercise and resistance training exercise now there are essentially three things that great therapy provides first it provides a good rapport with somebody that you can really trust and talk to about any and all issues that concern you second of all great therapy provides support in the form of emotional support but also directed Guidance the do and the not todos and third expert therapy can help you arrive at useful insights that you would not have arrived at otherwise insights that allow you to do better not just in your emotional life in your relationship life but also the relationship to yourself and your professional life and all sorts of career goals with better help they make it very easy to find an expert therapist with whom you can really resonate with and provide you with these three benefits that I described also because better help is carried out entirely online it's very time efficient and easy to fit into a busy schedule with no commuting to a therapist's office or sitting in a waiting room or looking

conver Dr Craig Conover welcome thank you Andrew I appreciate the invitation to be here I'm thrilled that you're here we are going to launch ourselves into the space that is called pep tiddes yeah and it's a it's an interesting space for sure because I think um most people probably don't know what a pepti is they should feel no guilt or Shame about that I'm sure you'll you'll tell us but this area of medicine that people broadly refer to as peptides is picking up a lot of momentum even though it's been around for a long time and I find it particularly interesting because um there are many people using peptides for very specific purposes but most people haven't really heard of the various peptides that are out there right and and if anything we can be sure that in the years to come peptides are going to be increasingly popular and totally agree and there's of course the incredibly popular peptide of glp1 Agonist um for sure taking over so to drop into this um and make sure everyone's on the same page uh what is a peptide yeah I mean just from a very Elementary level peptides are just chains of amino acids so so amino acids all naturally occurring molecules we call it a peptide if it's 40 amino acids or less call it a protein if it's 41 amino acids or more the body makes I think last I read 300,000 peptides so it's a massive number uh we've probably therapeutically are using closer to 150 over the years which is obviously tiny compared to that so to your point this is blossoming we've been using peptides for about 8 years a long time um but still very early in in our understanding of how best to use peptides and how clinically we're going to get the most out of them so it's exciting maybe just to orient ourselves we should talk about glp1 first um not because it's necessarily the uh category of peptides that um I think uh people would want to consider for themselves um but because most people have probably heard of uh semaglutide and U monjaro and things like that sure so um how long ago was it that humans started injecting glp1 Agonist in order to lose weight I think the weight loss aspect has only been a couple years I mean it's been tremendous how it's accelerated to like literally becoming the number one prescribed in America uh you know semi Glu OIC was approved longer than that for four type 2 diabetics helping with you know glucose control and helping with glucose utilization uh and what they found you know as a side effect was that these people were losing weight and then that word caught on and you know what's interesting and I don't think most people understand this most of the medicines prescribed particularly in America are prescribed off label meaning they've never ever been approved for what they're used so is that right yeah the vast majority yeah are never approved so as a physician I'm allowed to prescribe any drug for any reason I want as long as it's been approved for something right as long as we're safe right we don't want to be cavaliere about this and Renegade and do all these things that are not that are out out of bounds but that is the truth so that seml is a great example being used for helping people diabetics type two diabetics lower their blood sugar and then it got to well now let's help diabetics lose weight right because diabetics struggle with weight the insulin resistance and then it became well even if you're not a diabetic could you benefit from losing weight well heck yeah right I mean look at the amount of obesity and people who are overweight and having trouble maintaining healthy weight it's exorbitant in this country and certainly worldwide so then it spread it did eventually get uh FDA approval specifically for weight loss but you know at first no it's been just for type two diabetics to help with glucose utilization and you know we've been using primarily tepati which is like semi glutide version 2.0 mostly for the past two years have learned a tremendous amount and my opinion's actually changed from working with people yeah what is your opinion my understanding is that um well there's sort of two camps on this it seems yeah at least two camps one Camp seems really bullish on this um they seem very excited about this drug the other Camp seems to point to the fact that one may be creating a drug dependency um that it's very expensive um and they point to the also potency of Lifestyle factors like exercise and caloric restriction um eating mostly non-processed Foods Etc as a quote unquote better alternative I'm not necessarily saying that I think that both have their place it's to me it seems very contextual but as a clinician I'm curious what you think yeah I I agree both have their place um My Philosophy is I want everyone have to have access to things that are number one safe that propel them to look feel and perform their best and if that means right if it was just about if I can exercise my way out of this eat my way out of this meaning lose weight change my body composition why do we have an epidemic you know of so many people who struggle with that because it's really hard right we don't totally understand it I'm not saying that yeah the processed food thing is a massive problem you I mean I know that's come to light recently with people pushing for us to take a look at food companies and the quality of our food which is amazing but if people aren't interested in doing better for themselves and you know this is may not make sense but I think it does the analogy I use is I like to help people win the race first which then helps them motivate to train for the next race right and this kind of goes against the grain of conventional medicine which is you know if you want to train for the race you have to you know run a certain number of miles you have to sleep a certain way you have to eat a certain way you have to do all the things struggle to get there right and losing weight is a struggle and and the way I look at if I can help people lose weight first literally by using something like tepati semaglutide and I've seen this they're now excited I mean I met with a client yesterday here in Los Angeles and she literally looked at me and said you've changed my life she goes I am a super successful woman in my company with my family with my kids everything's great but now I love my life my workouts are better I look better my clothes fit better I am super excited about waking up every morning like she is there and that is what it's about right and so for people if you can help them achieve their goal first then they're going to be motivated the light bulb turns on they're going to be like wow I want more of this and that's the Ala moment that I love helping people with so at first I was like oh we got to be really cautious with this same thinking like I don't want people to lose too much weight like this is a problem are they going to be dependent I like the notion that you have to take something the rest of your life and I'm not saying it has to be the rest of your life but when something works and as far as I can tell it's very safe I think I think it's worth discussing and I I like people having those options at least yeah it sounds like from the uh story you just told us that it's not just about um an aesthetic change that motivates people to lean into other aspects of their health and life when they lose some weight that it's also just the the sheer literal weight and also that adapost tissue fat tissue you know produces a lot of hormones that we know impact the brain and um brain function which is not to say that there aren't people out there with a lot of adapost tissues who aren't extremely bright and motivated Etc but many people who are carrying excess body fat don't feel good they report brain fog Etc and I think now thanks to Chris Palmer and actually at Stanford there's also a program in metabolic Psychiatry we're starting to see um or understand and appreciate the link between adapost tissue and brain health or lack of brain health in most cases sure so in the um in the case of glp1 yeah um people have criticized it saying that a fair percentage of the weight uh that's lost is lean body mass muscle loss but it seems to me that can be remedied pretty easily if people just do some resistance training I I think part of that yeah resistance train the other think I would say is from what we've seen is when people are using the conventional dosages um they're losing weight too quickly and so what we do is we get uh both semaglutide mostly tepati compounded and that allows us to use basically micro dosages and start very low in terms of dosage and go slowly with people and what we found is as long as people are losing less 2 lounds or less a week they're not losing the muscle mass we certainly encourage adequate protein intake you know resistance training but that micro doing has been a GameChanger like literal Game Changer because then people don't feel like oh my and I've seen it where we when we started people were losing you know 15 pounds in three weeks goodness right and then they're like excited but then they're not cuz then they come off of it and they just gain it right back or they lose a lot of weight and they' lose that fat in their face they look like skeletons we've seen those called OIC faces we don't like the way that looks and that fat takes a while to come back so if we just go slowly with this and we can really dial it in and Nuance it that has had a tremendous impact and now beyond the weight loss you know we're seeing cognitive benefits we're seeing you know inflammation benefits a lot of people with autoimmune disease who their inflammation markers are coming down and that's the only thing we can think is working is that a direct effect of um OIC on the immune system and Pathways related to inflammation or is it indirect through the loss of adapost tissue body fat which then lowers uh lowers inflammation great question or or I could say is it the positive thoughts that come from looking yourself in the mirror and feeling good right which transcends to you feeling better about yourself and that feeds forward to the momentum that you put forth in the world all of those things I think it's all of the above you know I think that's going to be hard to dissect but it's real I mean I have a patient she's 50 she has Hashimoto thyroiditis meaning she attacks her thyroid she doesn't you know make enough thyroid hormones so she takes thyroid hormone well one of the challenges with that is they make a lot of thyroid antibodies this antibody called thyroid peroxidase antibody and when you have an elevated thyroid proxy andbody you don't feel good you feel inflamed your joints hurt you get rashes life is just not easy and it's a challenge to get that number down I mean certainly a challenge for me you know you traditionally use probiotics a lot of to help bolster the immune system well now we're starting to use the gp1s and we're seeing that those antibody levels come down and I I don't have a great way of explaining it but there's something going on that's very positive very interesting well I suppose moving from uh most widely known um peptides are still fairly unknown to most people even the concept but that's why you're here uh you're changing that right now um but moving from things like gp1 to what I would probably call the second most popular peptide the one that we're hearing more and more about all the time um and that's bpc 157 body protection compound 157 um which to my understanding they're are a lot of animal data very few if any clinical studies on humans but a lot of people now taking bpc in various forms yeah um what are some known uses for bpc let's just say within your clinic sure um and then we'll get around to the fact that bpc has let's hope temporarily been taken off Market y um and what some of the alternatives are but um what is bpc what instances where people have you found it useful for so many so I think with bpc for me kind of the most utilized peptide that we've used so we'd like to use bpc almost with every patient it is very anti-inflammatory right and so just from a very general perspective you know most people walking around who are adults you know they're stiff they're sore as they get older they work out we work with uh athletes of all levels there's that element of inflammation maybe they have some chronic disease diabetes heart disease autoimmune disease inflammation is Paramount we understand that and bpc I you know observed with so many patients we're talking thousands upon thousands of patients where their inflammation comes down so they feel better they're not as stiff they're not as store their knee doesn't hurt as much their shoulder improved so we've learned you know that we start with the dose you know based upon these like you said animal studies um which is conservative make sure it's safe and then we've seen over time that we can get to higher and higher dosages and have even more of an impact you know and I think so for people understanding using bpc we started with a dose of like 500 micrograms a day we got up to 5,000 micrograms a day you know U and we'd like a protocol 5 days on two days off and that's been very helpful for a variety of things from post viral you know with the pandemic had a lot of success with bpc to again you name it honestly almost everyone I could think of particular as people are engaging more Fitness related lives they're working out more I would argue that anyone who's working out on a regular basis bpc is going to benefit it's going to help you know improve the inflammatory status but also help with recovery and it doesn't seem to be one of these agents that's going to be detrimental like we we were talking earlier Rob and I for the starter like you know they found that people were working out hard taking antioxidants that there seems to be a negative consequence to that because you don't allow the body to kind of repair itself I don't think that's happening with bpc that's interesting because my understanding is also that um part of the specific and General Adaptation of exercise is triggered by inflammation yeah this is why indeed it is true that doing ice bath or really cold water immersion cold shower seems fine but cold water imers ver in the you know 4 to 8 hours after resistance training can limit some of the hypertrophy and strength gains from resistance training because what you're inducing when you actually go into the gym is the that leads to the hypertrophy and strength training is an inflammation response that triggers the compensation right or um or the hyper compensation so um it's interesting you're saying that bpc by the way I must say this because then uh forgive the editorial but that is not to say that cold plunges and cold immersion is bad it's just in the hours following resistance training specifically for hypertrophy and strength training if those are your goals probably best to do it outside of that window other times has some tremendous benefits be safe but there okay back to the topic at hand forgive me but this can set it can set off a a complicated um storm of sorts if if I'm not if I'm not Ultra clear about the details um bpc157 strongly anti-inflammatory yes my understanding is it also May upregulate growth hormone receptors it does right and so works well if you're you know we'll get into taking a growth hormone releasing peptide it pairs very well with that because then you're working both sides of the equation meaning if you're using a growth hormone releasing peptide like semelin or ellin ghrp6 whatever you're helping your pituitary put out more growth hormone well if you combine it with bpc which upregulates the growth hormone receptor you make the process of growth hormon binding more efficient so you get more out of it then you can use less of the growth hormon releasing peptide with the same result got it yeah BP c57 um comes in many different forms or it used to when it was allow when it was FDA uh not disallowed um so I could imagine how the oral forms would allow for a just general um anti-inflammatory response it's a gut peptide so we don't have to worry about it being destroyed by the gut most peptides that go into the gut are broken down and corre but this peptide when it's naturally occurring occurs in the gut so it survives in the gut so if somebody body is taking bpc157 orally through a capsule or tablet form right um my guess is that has a general anti-inflammation response I think it can what we've observed is it's more limited to the gut so people with any sort of you know gastrointestinal issue whether that's inflammatory bow disease like Crohn's or uler of colitis you know irritable bowel you name it leaky gut I think oral bpc is more effective there has it been shown to be effective for those conditions or have you observed that clinically Ober that clinically but interestingly I've observed a better clinical response when people inject it even for gastrointestinal related things so I think injecting and then so people injecting subq which is right under the skin we use the tiniest of needles like an insulin needle 30 or 31 gauge we're talking super small um and so I know a lot of people like I'm never injecting is less painful than a um than a Texas mosquito bite there you go super easy once you do it once or twice it's really easy and we we walk people how to do how to do that but interestingly I we started thinking okay if you've got something going on in your gut you should take oral PPC cuz it's going to Target it right then and I found now if we're injecting it actually works better than the oral and uh and then they came up what if I've got an elbow injury should I inject it in my elbow and we found actually don't it's going to work systemically you can inject it in your abdomen or your rear end you're still going to get benefit in your elbow but now you're going to get benefit in all your joints all over your body systemically how do you think that's working and my understanding is bpc157 can initiate fiberblast migration some of the cells that that make up the the various connective tissues that um when injured or sore other things can make us injured or sore of course but when injured or sore that they those need repair um so it always was um perplexing to me why one could put bpc 157 in such a small volume Under the Skin you know just a few uh centimeters off the belly button and it would somehow um seek out the the injury site in an elbow or an Achilles and there all these wild anecdotes Tales of you know lore of let's just say uh there was this Olympic Athlete not this last Olympics but the previous Summer Olympics that had a torn Achilles who came back a few weeks later and everyone was and meddled people were talking about you know took Podium um uh that is and people were talking about bpc 157 there was kind of this you know and who knows that's just uh chatter and fog as they say but um kind of wild the idea that you could just inject something systemically put it into the systemic circulation into the bloodstream and it would faret out the location in which the injury took place and initiate a recovery response but we've seen it with not to get off top it we've seen it with with stem cells so they've taken stem cells they've tagged them radiographically so you can see them um in the study I read which I can find for you someone had a wrist broken wrist and they gave them intravenous stem cells and 24 hours later when they visualized radiographically those stem cells had AGG at at the sight of the fracture so there's a lot you know about our bodies obviously we don't know there's a kind of innate human like design and intelligence which I believe in um I see it because we we've done a lot of IV Therapy over the years and you you know it's interesting when you give some something intravenously you're getting in the bloodstream and you can feel some of these different compounds we're just talking about vitamins working within seconds and it shows you how quickly things circulate people don't understand like how quickly we move our circulation it's massively fast if one has ever gone into the hospital for a surgery and and got a a cold saline infusion yeah you realize how quickly it hits your your toes you know they're putting it in at your elbow almost instant yeah within a few seconds it also uh makes one appreciate how we're all generally a little bit dehydrated when you start getting a real proper saline infusion all of a sudden you feel yourself come to life in a way that oh this is what it feels like to have just the right amount of salt in my blam exactly so going back to bpc where I think it shines is in these ligaments and tendons right I think this is where most of these injuries happen is where muscle is connecting to the Bone um you know and there's you know people you know grow their muscle but we don't stretch the tendons and ligaments well and that's where we get pull sometimes strain and Sprain and tearing and I think that's where bpc shine that's certainly where it's been studied in animal studies and I know that because we can inject it directly into tendons which is unlike steroids we would never inject steroids into a tendon you damage the tendon bpc we mix with things like PRP prf which is play Rich fiber and a little bit different than PRP and you'll get healing within days like it's awesome wow super safe uh and it's amazing for people bpc is definitely shorthand for BBC 157 that is is certainly in widespread use I have been concerned just personally about um gray Market sources that um contain contaminants and the fact that um many people are obtaining bpc 157 not from a physician not from a compounded Pharmacy but just kind of on quote unquote on the internet sure uh you're a physician um I'm guessing that until the recent ban by the FDA you were able to prescribe clean bpc as it were what's the story with bpc now and maybe we could talk about gray Market sure versus um I think it's a great question you know versus prescribed and made it a compounding pharmacy versus uh pharmaceutical company uh pharmaceutical so um and then of course there's black market but let's just leave that out um you know there are people that are going to tell you know tell you hey this is bpc and sell it to you that's obviously bad and dangerous well we see that with the anabolic steroids right like so anabolic steroids are in the Black Market you can't really I mean there's one anabolic steroid which is nandrolone which is DECA which can be officially prescribed we use it you can combine it with testosterone all in the up and up Totally Above table the rest things like trend balone others you you can't get them from a physici in fact you very hard to get them from a reputable website in the United States so as long as we're we're here by understanding is deadin and uh testosterone cypionate are can be prescribed or testosterone and Nate things like that by by physicians that's that's because it's been FDA approved for the treatment of various things hypoc canatal syndromes corre uh testosterone replacement therapy in both men and women correct Etc so th those categories of testosterone um like compounds right um cypionate and anate Etc and deadin which is basically like is it similar to DHT is it uh a little bit yeah I mean it's uh the generic name is nandrolone yeah I mean it has the flavor of helping with joints I think uh it works synergistically with things like testosterone different you know whether it's testosterone cpen anate um and and I like it for people who particularly people who have been on testosterone men been on testosterone replacement for a long time which is many men um they tend to get less out of testosterone becomes less potent like anything right if you use something for a long time you're going to get less out of it over time anything you expose yourself to continually doesn't work as well um and so you know like to make this really real I had a patient who was a uh in the uh Marines and served a secret service for several uh white houses and he had a lot of you know osteoporosis osteopenia you know bone loss and you know this is where I learned about using something like nerone because we combine nerone with testosterone it changed his life you know this guy in his 80s who was had to use a cane who came back to life who started you know becoming super mobile and working out again and synergistically I think it works really well not to get too far off topic but it's interesting and I think uh another sort of brief editorial for me if I may um you mentioned this patient was in their 80s I think nowadays unfortunately a lot of younger males in in particular guys in their gosh even teens but 20s and 30s even early 40s think that they need to look to um synthetic testosterones in order to uh look a certain way um perform a certain way um in the gym libido Etc and I I'll go on record again and again and again saying that it's absolutely not necessary for most people of those ages provided that they um are taking good care to sleep well eat well take care now but I I realize that there are a growing number of use cases where people for whatever reason aren't able to recover from exercise they're struggling this a little bit like the OIC conversation right where that there are things that can help move the needle in the right direction pun intended um but here with testosterones syn synthetic testosterones in Deca there's a real concern about loss of fertility totally right I I think it brings up a larger point which is and obviously unbiased but I think it's super helpful for people to have a physician help them in this course particularly with testosterone it is just known that people get it from their trainers they're Bros from the gym right who were saying oh you got to use this I mean I have so many patients who were started using testosterone in their late teens early 20s goodness yeah that's I mean not goodness meaning Badness that does not seem like a good idea still very common like gracious still very common and you know one in particular this is probably 10 years ago came to see me he's 25 he got married and to your point he said I'm ready to have kids I have zero sperm left right and that's a real thing and so he had been using and I would say abusing both testosterone and growth hormone for years now what he told me was and I get it he was Superman he could wake up do a hard workout you know crush it wake up the next morning was not sore crush it again and just kept going kept going it was super fit super happy in that regard and how he looked how he felt how he performed but then he got to a point where he's a little bit wiser mature and he was like oh my goodness now there's a repercussion for this and I've seen that time and time again and the repercussion is Big you're not making any sperm or the sperm quality is super poor now what do you do well now you got to come off testost you got to rebuild your system which we can do you know we can use things like chopine en chopine HCG lots of different agents to help in that regard even certain peptides but I think it brings up the large Point even getting into peptides which is having a physician who's knowledgeable to me is super helpful the challenge for people is they don't know where to get the right information right and they're getting it from websites and they're getting it from people saying oh just try this peptide and I've had lots of people talking about the you know websites or whatever not to name any names who've had anaphylactic reactions to research type peptides which are not for human consumption and I'm not saying that there's bad companies or whatever you just got to be careful you got to be selective at least right well what brought us on to the uh conversation about testosterone was this black market issue there's also what I would call this um dark dark gray Market issue which is that there are a number of companies that will sell all sorts of things but peptides in particular sure and listed on their website it'll say not for human or animal consumption for research purposes only right and one of the major issues is that the um potency and cleanliness so to speak of Purity yes of those um compounds is not established um and many of them have LPS Lippy polysaccharide in them which is inflammatory and earlier before we started recording you mentioned um that you have heard of or interacted with not your patients but people who have come to you saying that they had like really serious life-threatening um consequences for using these black market certainly but um dark gray Market uh peptides yeah and so to to tell the story story further is back in October of 2023 the FDA uh put many peptides bpc and we can name them out on what's called a category 2 list meaning they are no longer allowed to be compounded right now that excludes then research companies who are not under the purview of the FDA but these compounding pharmacies it's been a huge blow because they've been told they cannot use these agents and the compounding pharmacies are distinct from these other um black and dark gray um sources um in that they actually can establish Purity they are designed to be injected into humans and they have a totally different standard right so they and I think it's confusing for people when they hear compounding pharmacy they thought friend they're not friende they're FDA regulator they're Board of Pharmacy regulated in every state they are monitored they are inspected all the time I've worked with compounding pharmacies my whole career which is going on you know close to 25 years now just like anything there's some amazing compounding pharmacies and there's some not so amazing compounding pharmacies which cut Corners the ones we work with don't cut any corners and I know that because they're inspected all the time right and it's a big deal to them and they want to do it right with Purity with processing and making sure that anything they make especially a sterile compound which is going to be anything injected you know eye drops things you inject in yourself whether it's IV subq or intramuscular they're considered sterile um they have to then be tested by an outside lab to make sure Purity make sure that there's no endotoxins things like that it's it's highly regulated and it's a big deal for them and it's a big deal for the Physicians who you know prescribe with them which I appreciate because the advantage of a compounding pharmacy is we can tweak the dosage we don't have to use a standard set dosage we can combine things synergistically to get you know 1 plus 1 doesn't equal two now it equals four and that to me is a huge Advantage just like we were talking about the gp1 semaglutide and tpdes we get those compounded so that you know we have a a the compounding pharmacy we're using now we're making a unique combination of tepati and saralin right which will address some of this muscle loss that people are getting so we can combine to stimulate growth hormone release offset some of the muscle loss from exactly toeside yeah yeah and and so you can do things like that with a compounding pharmacy but again just to make sure people understand compounding pharmacies are highly regulated highly regulated um again there's always going to be bad apples but uh you know Physicians who know how to work with compounding pharmacies I think provide access to things that these conventional both Pharmaceuticals and conventional pharmacies can't I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens ag1 is designed to cover all of your foundational nutritional needs and it tastes great now I've been drinking ag1 since 2012 and I started doing that at a time when my budget for supplements was really Limited in fact I only had enough money back then to purchase one supplement and I'm so glad that I made that supplement ag1 the reason for that is even though I strive to eat most of my foods from Whole Foods and minimally processed foods it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits vegetables vitamins and minerals micronutrients and adaptogens from food alone and I need to do that in order to ensure that I have enough energy throughout the day I sleep well at night and keep my immune system strong but when I take ag1 daily I find that all aspects of my health my physical health my mental health and my performance both cognitive and physical are better I know that because I've had lapses when I didn't take ag1 and I certainly felt the difference I also notice and this makes perfect sense given the relationship between the gut microbiome and the brain that when I regularly take ag1 which for me means a serving in the morning or midm morning and again later in the afternoon or evening that I have more mental Clarity and more mental energy if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer right now they're giving away five free travel packs and a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman to claim that special offer so is it fair to say that if one is interested in exploring the use of peptides for what you refer to as performance medicine um mental physical health and performance yes um Falls underneath that to essentially only put peptides into their body um maybe even on their body surface that they're obtaining from a physician who's obtained the peptides from a compounding pharmacy yeah and who's developing a relationship so we for any peptide that we use we meet with the patient we make sure they're a good fit we make sure that there's no contraindications we also can recommend and specifically dial it up or down whatever it is come up with this is what we think you should use based upon your life experience the medicines you're taking are not taking the conditions you're treating or not treating right I think that's really important again I'm biased being a physician my whole goal is to get to know patients that's why I'm here is to kind of walk that walk and help people in that regard and you know if someone's out there on the internet doing it themselves they're they're walking in you know kind of you know on their own and so you know not to make it like everything bad is going to happen but when you're when you have the help of someone who has experience that goes a long way I think particularly with something like this yeah I agree and um and it worries me very much that people are buying PPC from um gray Mark dark gray Market or uh uh Black Market sources I mean anything that says on it not for animal or human use for research purposes only you can pretty much guarantee the endotoxin the lipip polysaccharide at least has not been removed and that could be really atic especially since my understanding is that that can be cumulative over time it's not that one injection causes somebody to go into anaphylactic shock it's that some of this LPS can build up an inflammatory response over time and then you don't know where the Tipping Point is and then somebody can have a really terrible reaction well and then taking a step further you know getting away from just peptides but any I remember this was I don't know 15 years ago someone was taking advice from a very famous doctor on TV about taking an oral compound to lose weight and they called me up and they said H I'm having terrible headaches terrible headaches for days they came in their blood pressure was through the roof you know like I don't remember the specific numbers but let's just say 220 over 140 and normally it's 120 over 80 well did you take anything different yeah this doctor recommended I take this weight loss compound right so the problem is people have access to all this information but if they're not under the guidance of a doctor to help clean up the mess and we clean up the mess not that there's always mess but this is what we enjoy doing you know is as a physician like we've seen the darkest of dark you know we're able to help people when things don't go perfectly planned and uh I think that's a big deal you know particularly when there's lots of these tools and they're exciting tools and they're great tools and um fortunately for me I've been in this space longer than most that I've just you know built up a large repertoire of experience of observing people and working with people and seeing we got to tweak this we got to Nuance this or sometimes we don't ever want to use this again yeah this is not for most people so given that bpc 157 has been effectively removed from the um legitimate Market uh what are people's Alternatives again uh working with the the uh caveat that um people should work with a physician yeah um where can Physicians get something similar enough to bpc 157 so there's a new compound newer uh peptide called uh the shortened for PDA pentad DEA arginate it's basically the same molecular structure as bpc except they've swapped out an acetate for arginate one amino acid substitution corre one amino acid substitution um and so we're using that and having really good results um I certainly it's early in the game of using PDA but it seems very close to bpc in the clinical responses we're getting from our patients who are reporting back decrease in inflammation all these wonderful things that we used to see with BP C so and I and I think uh I surmise that this is going how it's going to be with all of these peptides right because again peptides are just chains of amino acids you know certainly a lot of people smarter than me trying to figure out how do we then create other types of amino acid combinations you know I.E peptides that do similar actions to bpc to thymus and Alpha to epimone to tb500 on and on and on so I'm hopeful in that regard um and I and I also you know some of my patients work at the very highest level of the US government they are well aware of this and who have assured me they're going to look at this that this is serious you know because they're they've been using peptides and they're concerned that oh my goodness the FDA came in and changed the game very it's been a huge setback for all of us I definitely want to Circle back as to what the motivation was by the FDA for doing that um at some point I think um in the meantime however I think um there's a lot of interest in BBC 157 a lot of use of bpc157 the sources of bpc157 are now drying up Y and that's why I'm personally concerned that people are going to start going to the dark gray market and black market I'm excited about the uh pentad DEA arginate yes um so let's put that on people's um ear map um brain map pentad DEA arginate may be a good uh physici prescribed substitution for people that can benefit from bpc157 and a good starting dose so to make it really clear for people helpful 250 micrograms to 500 micrograms we're using 500 micrograms injected daily again we like Monday through Friday take the weekends off that's a good dosing schedule we'll we'll see how that goes we probably can use larger dosages that's conservative um but that's a good starting point for people and thus far you haven't mentioned any side effects of bpc 157 or pentad dea arginate it's that's kind of remarkable it's been tremendous yeah and we were using bpc intravenously as well you know patients would come in and you know oh tweaked my knee tore my ACL tore my you know meniscus whatever um you can give them bpc essentially as a bolus intravenously my goodness that made a difference now that using something intravenously from the pharmacokinetic standpoint it's not going to last in the system very more it's more of a spark whereas if you use an agent subcutaneously you're going to get more of a long lasting you know again not terribly long-lasting with peptides but longer than using something intravenously kind of The Sweet Spot was C certainly using both we could use something as a spark to initiate that anti-inflammatory Cascade then follow up with a subcutaneous dose yeah and even though earlier we were talking a little bit about um some hormone replacement therapies um before that off microphone um you mentioned that you prefer peptides to direct hormone manipulations in most cases so I think um while peptides can be hormones there are things like uh um uh oxytocin is sometimes called a peptide in people think about hormone therapies thinking testosterone estrogen prone uh you know thyroid Etc it it sounds to me like much of your practice is built up around the the notion that there are things that one can use peptides to kind of um push and pull on these various systems without getting into them directly my understanding is the advantage of that is you don't get the negative feedback you don't gain the shutting down of natural production yeah you know and testosterone is a great example um um because like we were saying I don't ever want to manipulate hormones you know growth hormon is another example I don't ever want to manipulate that meaning you know providing it to people more than they would get in nature this is why I actually don't a little bit off topic like when people use testosterone pellets or any sort of pellet therapy because you're exposing people to a concentration of hormones we would never ever see in nature I would prefer people inject it where you're going to get some variation in dose on a day-to-day basis which we're humans so we do get some day day to-day variation or topically or under the tongue or something um peptid same thing I don't want to manipulate the hormones right I want to just stick within kind of the the highways or the lanes swim lanes for how they should operate and and then take advantage of that and that's been a safe way to do it as opposed to and I've seen it you know talking about another peptide which is eper marelin a growth hormon releasing peptide uh eper marelin you inject Under the Skin travels up to the pituitary the posterior pituitary in the brain which is respons we're putting out growth hormone that growth hormone then leaves the pituitary enters the bloodstream travels to the liver where we make insulin like growth factor one which then enters the circulation is very anabolic meaning growth healing mending you know as we get older we make less growth hormone as we get older we wear down obviously we get you know degenerative conditions part of that uh I don't know what part it for everyone's a little bit different is because of our hormonal Decline and so when you can give something like epin and we can talk about others you're actually helping not only push out a little bit of growth hormone for people but you're directing when you push it out right we we think so why it's important for people to be asleep by 10 p.m. between 10: p.m. and 2: a.m. because you think that's the B largest pulse of growth hormone during the 24-hour period is that right it so I've um long wondered whether or not the um the tale I was told when I was growing up which is that every hour before midnight is worth two hours of sleep post midnight um that feels true to me um then again feels true as as often misleading but feels true to me um but it makes perfect sense if the the largest pulse and growth hormone is occurring in the in the couple of hours before midnight yeah I mean that's that's how I learned it um I agree with you it feels true to me as well um but taking advantage then of you know injecting something like I morelan at bedtime then you're going to you know within a few minutes and with I morelan it's interesting because people will get a little flushing tingling at times um and what I've seen with the point of making is uh there are some Physicians and some pharmacies which you know the the dosage of velin and most of these growth home releasing peptides should be 100 micrograms that's the max dose uh for to bind the receptor and you know what I've seen is with eelin rare but some people do get Anil axis and it's happened and I think that happens when people are pushing it and giving more than they should and I've heard of that they're giving 200 300 400 micrograms at a time which is a big dose now what they're getting is the client the patient is like oh my gosh I feel this amazing flushing it must be working but then you could spiral into oh my goodness I don't feel good so good in your you know circulation system collapsing so yeah using side effects as a as a uh indicator of whether or not something's working just seems like a terrible idea but um it's very common you know um I tend to be very conservative about these things and by the way um I've tried various peptides for short periods of time because I like to experiment um very safely um and some things like surel and we'll talk about other growth hormones secretagogues uh for me uh for whatever reason you know gave me great sleep but only in the first part of the night it nuked my rapid eye movement sleep in the second half of the night it um spiked my prostate specific antigen it was a very consistent effect I came off it and it went back down and it went back on it it went back up and so I just found I couldn't take it and it didn't take me very long to figure that out but I know that there are some people who love Sur morelan and don't see any of the same issues so it seems like it can be very idual I agree with that I agree with that and that's why I think it's again helpful to work with a physician who has experience who can kind of you know I think of these peptides as having flavors particularly the growth hormone releasing peptides iiron very clean you know as long as you stay within 100 micrograms or less people are going to lean out a little bit sleep a little bit better there's no no real side effects they take it pre- sleep pre- sleep at bedtime without carbohydrates ingested in the previous two hours correct yeah or 45 minutes technically yeah but that's right and then there's saying like growth hormone releasing peptide 6 ghrp6 which is also going to bind so I think of iin being the most specific for the growth hormone receptor but the weakest so when you inject it you will get growth hormone to come out an only growth hormone but it's not going to be a big burst of growth hormone you inject ghrp6 now you may bind some prolactin now you may bind some ACT which is going to have your adrenals put out cortisol now you're going to get a hunger response right and maybe even have trouble sleeping if you're getting may have trouble sleeping but where where that's beneficial before is if you're looking to put on mass or get strong ghrp6 is your go-to right because you will increase your appetite and if you're smart you'll eat a lot more protein you know and and the building of muscle is not necessarily complicated right it's resistance training sufficient protein which is where I think most people fall off and then having some anabolic kind of hormone in the background like growth hormone or testosterone are both helps that process that's where ghrp6 can shine I mean within weeks people will get big and strong increase their press whatever stuff flat out works but you got to know how to use it and and understand the flavor so the point of making is these different peptides have different flavors and to your point there's individual responses that's that can be a good thing I think for most of our audience um the interest in growth hormon SEC creogs probably relates to the better sleep and the overall feelings of Vitality and probably uh most people are seeking to not Spike their appetite or put on muscle really these days we're hearing more and more from people both and women who want to be strong without being big yeah and they prefer to be lean as opposed to not lean which I think is a great goal frankly that's my goal at this stage of life I just turned 49 yesterday and I oh thank you thank you yeah thanks for coming out to the the birthday oh yeah that was a lot of fun mini bash the other day that was a lot of fun um you know I I yeah I want to be strong and capable I also want to be able to run and have cardiovascular fitness but I don't want to be large I don't want to take up a lot of space I'm not interested in taking up a lot oface space um and I think most people fall into that category so if ghrp6 can Spike appetite which for a subset of people might be useful um but probably most people will want to avoid it epom morelan I've always been calling it ipamorelin but epom morelan at 100 micrograms um dosage or less perite sounds like it's an interesting tool what are some of the other growth hormone secretagogues and I should just brief I'll I'll take the liberty of defining the these are peptides that stimulate the release of your own endogenous growth hormone this is not taking growth hormone right yeah yeah um two other main ones that we use one would be tesalan U which is similar to saralin and that it also is going to work on the growth hormone releasing hormone aspect a little bit higher up in the you know chain of how these hormones are released so both searon and tesone um you you don't necessarily need to add anything else to it classically with ion hexone ghrp6 we would add this other compound cjc-1295 which is going to work on the ghrh which allows the peptide and then the growth hormone to stay in your system a little bit longer the growth hormone releasing hormon correct yeah but we can almost set aside CJC now because CJC 129 the FDA just came in and uh one let's just say one acronym took out another there go the FDA took out CJC okay nbpc nbpc um people are probably getting a little dizzy with these acronyms but I think we're were uh doing a good job of guiding people uh uh along so cellin um and tesamorelin are similar enough similar in that regard testelin again talking about flavors testelin works on visceral fat reduction so fat around the organs and it's been FDA approved for that purpose yeah with HIV patients having this lipodystrophy which is you know you know abnormal accumulation of fat in particular visceral fat around organs so testelin works well for that my observation from using it for with lots and lots of people seems to work better in females than males or does it get lead to this um feeling of enhanced sleep as well yeah so I think any of the growth hormone releasing peptides anytime you're going to make growth hormone more active in your world that's how I think about it better sleep better skin tone texture right you're more resilient I think growth hormone is a resiliency hormone durability you know people find that oh I do a hard workout but it takes me days to recover I sprain my ankle takes me a week to recover I cut my skin takes me forever to heal they've got a durability issue and that's how I think about where growth hormone can shine not that you got to go all the way to growth hormone but these peptides can be a really nice push and this is taken before sleep no food within 45 minutes of the of the injection and then what and then the kind of the magic and what we do is you know when we first started about 8 years ago we'd use one peptide at a time and then what we learned is let's combine these peptides let's stack peptides and that's how we do it add lower dosages sometimes lower dosages um but for example we had a great combination BP PC epin and testelin all together um taking at bedtime and you're going to get subcutaneous fat reduction from the EP maralin visceral fat reduction from the test maralin uppr regulation of the growth hormone receptor from the bpc it was a wonderful peptide we we kind of labeled it as a fat loss peptide but people would put on lean muscle mass they'd sleep better their skin would be better they'd be more durable their thought process would be better awesome stuff and and that's where I think that's where we enjoy it is stacking these peptides together so it's not again just one peptide at a time but able to do it and that's why again working with a compounding pharmacy we can put these together so you're only doing one shot a day you may be doing three to seven peptides but it's still one shot got it and um if one is combining A tes morelan or Sur morelan uh epom morelan and well not bpc anymore but Penta arginate instead because you can't get bpc 157 compounded um is that done every night 5 days a week three days a week what's the rationale of this 5 days on two days off five days on two days off I came up with because of how we would dose growth hormone so the traditional growth hormone dosing cycle would be 5 days on two days off taking at bedtime yeah and that's where it came up and then I I personally with patients and myself I like to take breaks so even with supplements I won't take them on the weekends right because I think you we you know again anything you expose yourself to on a regular basis is going to decrease the potency we see that with exercise we see that with food if you're eating the same food every day it seems to become less valuable for you right like change it up like we we have to you know throw on the crazy switch every now and then but change it up and so then you're going to make it more potent for you I do the same thing with supplements so that you know just resonates with me with people to take a break from stuff I'd like to take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors function I recently became a function member after searching for the most comprehensive approach to lab testing while I've long been a fan of blood testing I really wanted to find a more in-depth program for analyzing blood urine and saliva to get a full picture of my heart health my hormone status my immune system regulation my metabolic function my vitamin and mineral status and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality function not only provides testing of over 100 biomarkers key to physical and mental health but it also analyzes these results and provides insights from Top Doctors on your results for example in one of my first tests with function I learned that had two high levels of mercury in my blood this was totally surprising to me I had no idea prior to taking the test function not only helped me detect this but offered medical doctor informed insights on how to best reduce those mercury levels which included limiting my tuna consumption because I'd been eating a lot of tuna while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens and supplementing with Knack and acetal cysteine both of which can support glutathione production and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels comprehensive lab testing like this is so important for health and while I've been doing it for years I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive I've been so impressed by function both at the level of ease of use that is getting the tests done as well as how comprehensive and how actionable the tests are that I recently joined their Advisory Board and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast if you'd like to try function go to function health.com huberman function currently has a weight list of over 250,000 people but they're offering Early Access to hubman lab listeners again that's function health.com huberman to get early access to function today's episode is also brought To Us by eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity now I've spoken many times before on this podcast about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts of quality sleep each night that's truly the foundation of all mental health physical health and performance and one of the best ways to ensure that you get a great night's sleep is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's because in order to fall and stay deep asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3° and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase about 1 to 3° eight sleep makes it incredibly easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment by allowing you to control the temperature of your mattress cover at the beginning middle and end of the night I've been sleeping on an eight Sleep mattress cover for nearly 4 years now and it has completely transformed and improved the quality of my sleep eight sleep has now launched their newest generation of the Pod cover the Pod 4 ultra the Pod 4 ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity higher Fidelity sleep tracking technology and even has snoring detection that will automatically lift your head a few degrees to improve your air flow and stop your snoring if you'd like to try an eights Sleep mattress cover go to 8sleep.com huberman to save up to $350 off their pod 4 ultra eight sleep currently ships in the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com huberman before we start recording uh you mentioned that you're actually not a huge fan of taking massive amounts of supplements that you are a big fan of taking CoQ10 coin Q10 200 milligrams per day in the morning I also take CoQ10 um I think I I started taking it for uh quote unquote General mitochondrial health I don't know that I thought very carefully about exactly what I was trying to accomplish with it um but what what is the rationale of taking CoQ10 so if I can break it down try to keep it simple if we people are familiar with the mitochondria it's the battery of the cell these little organel inside each cell um and they're responsible for you know doing many things but primarily making ATP chemical energy and so how do we make energy well there's three main ways the body uses it right or makes it first is glycolysis we take glucose which is a six carbon molecule we break it in half to make two pyruvates right that when we do that we make a little bit of ATP that pyruvate then is converted to something called a cetal COA we run that through the kreb cycle where we're also making ATP but we then we're making these intermediate products one of those intermediate products and the main one is something called nadh that nadh is then shuttled to the mitochondrial membrane for you know this is the magic where we make the most ATP and there's five different hubs or we call cytochromes right and this is how I think about it because I just like to simplify cytochrome one is where we use NAD and um what the what the different hubs are doing is we're exchanging electrons for protons and that's a kind of an electrical process we're exchanging electrons for protons going down an assembly line to eventually turn this wheel the ATP wheel to make ATP the way I understand it is the five different hubs different nutrients hit them so cytochrome 1 is NAD cytochrome 2 is ribo flave and vitamin B2 and succinic acid cytochrome 3 is CoQ10 vitamin K2 cytochrome 4 is methylene blue which we can talk about and then cytochrome 5 are things like magnesium vitamin A and copper so if you're thinking about mitochondrial Health if you include any or better all of those you're going to maximize how your mitochondria can work and make energy it's the strongest way to do it and it's again not necessarily complicated so when I think of cq1 and again we use a lot of NAD which we can talk about where I think most people the the traffic congestion happens on cyto Chrome one right and so when we give people upregulate their NAD production it's essentially we're allowing for more electron flow at cytochrome 1 which has a downstream effect on the other cytochromes so the traffic jam opens up and now you can move electrons to exchange for protons and make way more ATP and if you're and but that's not true for everyone and so some people it could be at cytochrom 3 with CoQ10 it could be at cytochrome 2 a lot of people at cytochrome 4 which is again cytochrome we call it cytochrom C oxidase which where methylene blue binds but that's just a simplistic view we just people we run into traffic jams right these electron flow gets stuck we're just trying to open up the traffic jam so 200 milligrams a day of co-enzyme Q10 can be um Can facilitate some of that Cy for sure and cyan's been studied very safe up to 2400 milligrams a day no harmful yep no harmful effects sometimes I'll take more like I was telling you earlier it's been dramatic for me with migraine headaches and you basically reducing them to zero you know as people are hearing this they're probably thinking okay well these are just you know this is what I call anic data or whatever I I you know I don't have to remind people that you're a board certified physician I think that what was what still ringing in the back of my mind this entire conversation even though I'm paying very careful attention is that most of the drugs that are prescribed in this country are off label I think that just like I I don't think I've ever heard that stated out loud yeah it's wild yeah yeah right so the idea that people would take something that wasn't um shown in a uh clinical trial to be effective for purpose a um that they would but it gets that it gets approved for purpose a but then can be prescribed by doctors for purpose B C D or E I mean you're not telling me this is common place you're telling me this is the majority of prescription drug but it makes sense if you think about it right so if you took an antibiotic right like we can just an antibiotic is going to be very specific what it gets approved for in terms of like working against a specific bacteria but then through clinical use and just experience you know we learn that oh I can use doxycycl or zpac aiyin or whatever it is for a variety of bacterial infections that extend well beyond just with a proof for well that makes sense and and does that ever cycle back to the uh clinical trials or no this just becomes physician understanding and lower like hey yeah you know I've got patients that you know they get on on aiyin and their their acne clears up by the way I'm not saying that folks I'm not a physician but um but for instance exactly what happened with semaglutide and OIC right approved for helping glucose utilization or lowering you know blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes and they found through use only people were losing weight and now it's become Blockbuster and it's and we see it with you know things like you know repurposing drugs for cancer right there's there's there's a lot of that going on a lot of the repurposing so you know doxy cycl is a very common one that's used in cancer therapies I think by sophisticated oncologists I don't treat cancer but by sophisticated oncologists to use things like doxycyclin metformin mendol which is an antiparasitic drug right um to help with cancer that's amazing so interesting it is amazing I think also um you know I'm I'm reminded that um you know medicine as beautiful a uh field as it is I have tremendous respect for it um of course uh is a field of of Fairly siloed training um and I love the idea that now thanks to public education efforts like this one um that you're providing us that Physicians learn from each other in a much broader way and can potentially hear about what drugs can be useful for this or that the other thing um and this is not editorial this is this is a real uh uh observation pharmaceutical companies are very interested in the other uses of already approved drugs sure the research and development process for a drug the safety uh evaluation is incredibly expensive so they want nothing more than to take a drug that's already been approved for one purpose and to take that already safety approved drug and find other use say how are they not circling back to the off label uh use and understanding of these compounds and um and then essentially marketing them for these other purposes or I guess with OIC that's exactly what happened that's what happened with OIC I mean it's again I I write prescriptions and I think there's a time in place I think it's challenging for me though right and I think for a lot of Physicians it's become challenging operating in a paradigm um when we talk about chronic disease which is essentially failing I mean and we all know this statistically we're not making huge dents in heart disease cancer autoimmune disease neurod degener we're not at all but we're spending exorbitant amounts of money right um and this is you know something that I had to learn over time and and I don't know how I got into it but when I started my practice back in 2006 I started it was a traditional Family Medicine practice but I started using these nutritional IVs and this is before hangover IVs this before was popular this is you know 20 years ago and what I learned was that these nutritional IBS help people feel better quickly and I developed this model for my patients which I think is a better model which is I want to help people feel better first like we were talking about earlier in this podcast because if I can get people to feel better what what we learned through Co and honestly what I want to say to you Andrew which is really true your podcast and what you do has been so successful at a time during the pandemic when people lost so much trust in people like me right people lost that trust of what do I do you know my how this is a scary time I don't know what's going on and you guys come along you in particular providing this very stable vetted information that people can trust and have a starting point be like this is what I want to do because Health one of the gifts of Co was it put our health on the Forefront of most people's mind and life and and so what you're doing is tremendous work and I can tell you personally no literally like as a physician I am just it's it's such an honor to be here and to to talk to you because every day every day my patients come to me and said I heard this on the huberman Lab podcast what do you think of it and and I am not joking and I love that I think it is awesome because people one taking their health seriously but two they have a stable resource that they can trust the problem with Physicians and and I'll tie this back in is Physicians are hard to trust right and it's this paternalistic model which is and that's how I I was trained which is you know you're going to do this because I'm going to tell you to do it right and I remember being in medical school which was in the 99s and I can't remember the exact specifics of the study but they would go they did a study where they colle collected the trash outside of Physicians offices found that greater than 30% of prescriptions written that day were run away greater than 30% wow and what and I remember learning that and I was like what is going on by the patients correct like you came to the doctor because you wanted a prescription right no you came to the doctor because you weren't feeling good you came to the doctor because you wanted to be listened to you came to the doctor because you wanted to be validated and most of the time and this still happens to today the vast majority of doctors will just write you a prescription or they'll write you two prescriptions and that's not what most people want sometimes it is and I do it and sometimes it is but there are so many other tools that we can use and so when I help people feel better first what i' why I've been successful and I work with you know the the peak you know people on this planet whether the athletes the best athletes celebrities the royal family you name it I'm so privileged it's because they trust me and that trust is really important I take that really seriously you know what I mean and so you know tying it back in is we've lost a lot of that with the pandemic it's actually come to the Forefront and so that's why I want to help people feel better first you know the traditional model of medicine is is get a diagnosis write a prescription if that prescription doesn't work write another prescription and so yes there there's a time in place for that but there's also a time in place for just helping people it only works when people value themselves enough like we're talking I can tie this back to weight loss right why do people have such trouble losing weight I would argue that most people don't value themselves enough to actually care enough to make the hard disciplinary choices in their life to get away from emotionally eating you know what I mean to do the right things that they actually it's going to be a struggle to get the right food for themselves get away from processed foods to be disciplined to go to the gym on a regular basis they don't have the right people that they trust this is where you've been such a gift tremendous gift well thank you for the kind words I mean the the um the birth of the podcast did take place during the pandemic and um in large part because I saw everybody getting very anxious their circadian rhythms disrupted and um those were focuses of my laboratory and and frankly when I was a postto and graduate student but especially as I got a little older uh in my years um I couldn't believe that you know I was reading these papers about how important it morning sunlight is and all these things but then my colleagues were all getting sick and dying around me or getting what we call the tenur look where they show up you know start their job and 5 years later they look like they've aged 25 years yeah and I realized that I I wanted to avoid that so I've always just enjoyed learning and sharing science and health tools and uh so thank you for the the kind words I've I've certainly um been um kind of both astonished and positively amazed in the ways that the pandemic and the post-pandemic years I I like to think we're in the post-pandemic years I I think we can safely say that now um how they've drawn people's attention to this idea that they need to take agency into their own healthare that that no one no one no pill potion injection Etc can replace good behaviors um pills potions and injections uh can potentially augment those good behaviors um and get people going down the right path which is what we're talking about today but that it's a it's really a personal responsibility I mean no no one can give us a calmer mind no one can give us a healthier body um no no one can do that right you can in it's interesting that some of the wealthiest people in the world um the new thing isn't for people to boast about their their Yachts or their properties it's about their health it's about their Vitality their longevity because that's the thing that I suppose in some sense money can start to buy but it doesn't require a ton of funds to take great care of one's one's body and mind it doesn't and and what I've learned and I've had to learn this over time and I think the wisdom is is and this is why it's it's even more challenging because I think people you know go on social media and they listen to podcasts and they listen to influencers and and a lot of the messages is additive right if you're not doing a high-intensity workout every day and then doing sauna for x amount of time and then coal plunge and all this kind of dieting you're not doing it well I know that that is cumul that that stress of that is cumulative to people right and so what I've learned and I have a really good friend probably the most you know affluent successful but also the most generous and smartest person I know who lives on the big island and he says to me which is worth repeating here I look for every opportunity to surrender and it is that surrender to people who you can trust to guide you right so you don't have to be the quarterback of everything right and that takes off the pressure and I think finding it's not always about adding it's it's actually creating space for us to just be in that flow right like it's to be in like and I know you've talked about this a lot that kind of active rest place where it's not about being super focused it's not about just going to sleep but almost the best parts of our day is when we're in that flow state where things just click and to me helping people with those you know types of times and figuring that out is the most valuable and and I don't think people talk about that enough so I appreciate that you do a lot yeah well and I appreciate that you're um bringing up this notion that you know just stacking more and more behaviors like you got to crush a workout and do sauna and that is not the message you know sometimes um we get teased and there's some good comedy uh takes on me um uh that make me chuckle now and again um about that but that's not the the approach these These are tools that people can can uh it's a buffet um and I think most everyone agrees that sleep is key um most everyone agrees that exercise is key nutrition is key great social connection is key when it comes to um because I want to make sure that we um Circle back to this when it comes to the peptides it seems that one of your approaches if I may is to kind of raise the hide so that the you know the boat can get you know get out can get out to see and we were talking about these growth hormone secret toogs we covered um uh uh GH rp6 which is the one that stimulates appetite that's probably going to be a niche case condition that people would want to use that ellin tesalan saralin I get a lot of questions about is it mk677 what in the world is mk677 it sounds like a weapon it does it's yeah it's it's just I think it's just like ghrp6 however it's it's absorbed well orally so it's basically the same I see it working this very similarly to G to ghrp6 so stimulates appetite it does can stimulate cortisol prolactin it sounds like a not good situation for most people not for most people although you know let me give you an example where it is I have a client very successful Guy and um he's been on testosterone he's doing all the things right he's in his early 60s he's he's working out well he's he eats well super well all these things he can't put on muscle mass well right and and actually as people get older that does become an issue for a lot of people is maintaining healthy muscle mass mk677 before it was taken off uh the compound list by the FDA it's another one that was included oh another acronym take it out by the FDA acon but you can take it orally which again removes the stigma or burden of having to do a shot and you will increase your appetite and that actually is a very useful agent you know metabolically for people as they get older um and I know this you know my kind of approach with this and both personally and professionally is I try everything I can and I remember mk677 I took it bedtime and it was an hour later I was in a dead sleep and I woke up and I had to go eat this it sounds like puberty it was I was like what is going on cuz I didn't totally understand I was like what oh I took that c oh my gosh I should never have taken it right before bed and I had to go up and eat and destroyed my sleep that night but I learned and I always learn and I'm grateful for it but don't take that one at bedtime um but it absolutely will stimulate your appetite which sure the growth hormone secretagogues that um your more typical patients who don't want to stimulate appetite um both male and female patients uh prefer what what are you compounding for them I I test some realin I I don't see any appetite stimulation from that hexarelin we haven't talked about that I don't really see talks about hexel yeah hexarelin hexarelin yeah sure arellin I think of is more again if we talk about the flavor of these peptides how I kind of look at it in my head is more of the energy endurance growth horm releasing peptid I like it for people to use it in the morning they get a nice burst of energy they feel it's a clean energy it's not a caffeinated energy or jittery or anything like that um and it's good for more endurance type you know Athletics are working out so people in that you know field of competition or whatever um I think hexon is a great choice does not Spike appetite I have not seen that is taken first thing in the morning you get an additional growth hormone release yes you do yeah you do uh in the early mornings when you're waking up and and you used to compound it with CJC 1295 to get the other Pathways involved that can help but now CJC has been taken out by the FDA right but hexarelin still exists that can be compounded what's the dosage on hexarelin that you typically prescribe 100 micrograms it's the same as these other like ion ghrp6 uh 100 micr the the two that are different would be teston uh ideal dose is 2 milligrams per dose um which is 2,000 micrograms so quite different and then semonin has a actually very broad dosing range anywhere from 200 micrograms uh I've used it up to 3,000 micrograms depending on you know your goals we were talking about coenzyme Q10 and the um kreb cycle yeah um and I forgot to close the hatch on supplements more broadly yeah um again doesn't sound like you're a big fan of taking lots of pills and capsules I think some people will take that as a relief I think a lot of people get tired of taking a lot of pills some people don't like to do that um what are some of the other things that um you do take besides coenzyme Q10 um earlier we were talking about methylated vitamins of meated B vitamins yeah this is becoming increasingly popular we're starting to hear more about methylation and methylated compounds um could you educate us on methylated B vitamins yeah and I think people are familiar with it um you know some people are talking on podcasts about the MTHFR snip we've not talked about that in this podcast so it' be nice sure so so a snip is a single nucleotide polymorphism meaning that genetically things don't flow as easily again that's an oversimplification um and you know you could be homozygous for that meaning you have both genes making you you know influencing you more you could be heterozygous meaning it's just one gene meaning one copy from one parent or homozygous copy from each parent you say it way better and so um what that means is and where we see that reflected homosysteine is a is a marker we use a lab marker we use it's an emerging marker for looking at one's cardiovascular risk profile and so if one's got an elevated homosysteine um and elevated by some Labs is can be greater than seven by most Labs greater than nine um means you're at an increased risk of what that is I don't remember but you're an increased risk of having a cardiovascular event which would mean a heart attack or stroke and so we want to lower that number and the best way to lower that number is taking ample methylated B vitamins methylated means you're adding a methyl group um so methyl B12 methyl folate trimethyl glycine methionine these are all methylation donors which just metabolically and through your detoxification Pathways in your liver is going to help you lower that homocystine um I'm sure it's more complicated than that but that's most people if you're going to take a B vitamin take a methylated B vitamin because then you overcome even you again I don't we've done a lot of MTHFR testing I don't think it's as profound as some people make it out to be like it's going to change their life I've never seen that can it help you sure but you're going to overcome it by taking sufficient methyl B vitamins anywhere and again those methylated B vitamins are methylated B12 B12 folate uh there's a methylated B6 there's uh and then trimethyl glycine um TMG is is a good compound methine is a good methyl donor is an amino acid are these taken in the morning or in the afternoon I like taking them in the morning although I think you know for people to play around with cuz I've certainly seen it you know people get that 3 P.M kind of Slumber um as opposed to reaching for the coffee or the dut take some more methyl B vitamins and see what happens or just the coffee no sorry you're not supposed to drink caffeine too late in the day lately what I find I don't know this is wrong to bring up on this podcast but I can't help myself I love y bate in the morning and afternoon okay coffee in the morning now makes me feel nauseous I don't know if I'm pregnant or something but it makes me feel nauseous but I love the taste of coffee in the afternoon this is like a a midlife thing I don't know what it is um so I now in the afternoon like around 1 or 2 p.m. even just the smallest amount of coffee is like it's like the most delicious thing I've ever tasted yeah I love coffee um it can mess with your sleep too late in the day but um that's a perfect segue to talk about sleep sure um because one thing that I know you've done a lot of work on and with are these peptides that can improve sleep not just by virtue of enhancing growth hormone release but um you know I'll just be very direct I um for the last gosh like four to six months I've had the opportunity to try pineline um and uh injectable pineline um combined with glycine yes um goodness gracious in the positive sense of the goodness gracious you're from the south so I don't know where where people how they never before have I found something that can improve the amount of rapid eye movement sleep that I get yeah besides rapid eye movement sleep deprivation you know sleep deprivation the next night you'll get a compensatory effect that's not the way to increase your Rim sleep folks you know there are a lot of things like um high-intensity exercise that improve my slow wave deep sleep um cold plunge early in the day improve slow deep sleep there been a few other things but with pinin I'm and by the way I'm not doing this every night I do this occasionally by Rand a little experiment and I track my sleep using the sleep tracker that's in eight sleep um and it's doubling the amount of rapid eye movement sleep that I'm getting doubling yeah which is so like from an hour to two hours or from an hour and 30 near near nearly 3 hours you know even um I posted a picture of a sleep score with some rapid eye movement sleep it's not something I typically do but um even the uh the the most competitive of biohackers uh Brian Johnson was like oh nice sleep score you know um now he touts a sleep score that's perfect every night for you know um for for every night but um and I'm kind of poking at Brian because we like to poke back and forth we're friendly with one another um so the point being that pinealon is a remarkable way to increase rapid ey movement sleep I have very little knowledge about it except that I my understanding is that it might stimulate some um regeneration or stimulation of the Pineo sites so the pineal that's exactly it mhm you've nailed it yeah I remember when you messaged me after starting it and you were like this is amazing it's amazing yeah that you were saying amazing I hope the FDA doesn't nuke it as a consequence of this conversation I hope so too no but I mean your response is what wece with our other patients who are who are loving and I think that combination with glycine I'm a big fan of glycine and injecting it seems to work really well um but back to your question about pinealon yeah I mean it's a bit one of the smallest peptides uh but I think it's one of the most profound we used to combine it with epitalon the the Russian peptide that was used for circadian rhythm and for my understanding um epitalon also um it's involved in DNA repair and might has been explored in animal studies for um trying to offset vision loss in some retinal degenerative conditions yeah again put on the do not compound list um with all the others that's gone um but panon stays and remains and yeah your response to it and experien with has been very commonplace from working with patients and seeing that it's I I think there's a circadian rhythm aspect with it as well you know and helping with melatonin production obviously that comes from the pineal gland um I this is just I'm postulating I think there's more to the pineal gland than we understand oh yeah um yeah it makes things other than melatonin that's for sure yeah and I think it's kind of elusive but I think there's something to it and I say that having used a lot of panon with people over the years and having very similar respons mon es um which is awesome like everyone knows like you said when you sleep better your entire day is better when you sleep better your life is better like exponentially better I think of the millions of people that suffer from lack of rap and eye movement sleep the lack of neuroplasticity that can be the consequence of that the lack of um healthy removal of uh emotional labels on previous day memories that is the consequence of REM deprivation the enormous um impact on depression rates the enormous impact on pretty much every mental health issue is made worse by by lack of REM sleep so I I say or I raise this conversation about pinealon with um a little bit of trepidation because I do worry that on the one hand people will see it as a miracle drug that's not what we're talking about it has this effect but at the same time I okay I'll just say that you know there's another drug that was released recently um uh this is a FDA approved drug um in the category of sleep drugs called the Doras so it works a little differently it doesn't um push on the sleepiness system so to speak it um it suppresses the wakefulness system and the idea is that it's supposed to increase REM sleep okay was by name quic and things like that um I tried it it was a total disaster for me I fell asleep woke up 3 hours later couldn't fall back asleep I tried it with lower dosage it's extremely expensive as well so I'm going to piss off whoever makes cor Vivic I forget who makes it it was a complete disaster for me yeah um um pinealon has been incredible and here's what's really interesting about it to me is that it seems to improve my sleep on the nights when I don't take it which makes total sense if it indeed is providing some regeneration of the pine pinealocytes that make melatonin and other sense to me yeah so here we're talking about something that one could potentially pulse with now and again and get Improvement in sleep every night yes yeah wild yeah and it's I mean I think it's worth noting that you you also take care of your health on many other aspects and that's probably why you were sensitive to it but it worked really well for you right and some other people it's going to take longer you know if if they're you know having to work on their diet and having to work on their exercise and having to work on their thought patterns right we don't talk that about that enough having positive thoughts um but yeah it's and it's so safe we've never ever seen I mean I never ever have seen a side effect or negative side effect from pinealon it's and and your response has been uniform you know it people don't always get there as quickly but people get there with their sleep love it and so and you compound it with glycine yeah what's the rationale there I really like glycine as an inhibitory neurotransmitter um it's coming to the nervous system uh over the years I tend to start with that when people are having trouble settling down at night not that it's going to sedate people um but just transitioning from you know being active you know 8:00 p.m. 9:00 p.m. wanting to settle down glycine in pretty large dosages at least most people think they're starting with 3,000 or 5,000 milligrams orally um kind of TS down the nervous system people relax a little bit and then they tend to sleep better from it and then you can dial it up I mean I've used very large dosages for the other advantage of glycine is it works on Phase 2 liver detoxification uh which is amino acid conjugation so you're helping your liver work better um and in a world where we're being exposed with all these toxic things from glyphosate to heavy metals we all need to do some sort of you know liver mitigation strategies glycine is one of the best wow interesting uh we haven't done an episode of this podcast yet on heavy metals but we're um I'm very interested in in this because many people write to me asking about Metal toxicity and about mold toxicity molds become super big yeah big um yeah I mean it's it's very prevalent and it seems the more we talk about it I mean we've seen it for years and years and years it makes sense right like if you think about the amount of airplanes flying above us every day pouring down heavy metals I mean it's massive it's in the air it's in the water it's in the soil talk about glyphosate or round up same exact thing so many chemicals and it's challenging for us as humans the way I break it down not to get too far off topic is you know we're water soluble organisms living in a fat soluble world it's the job of our liver essentially to take the fat soluble stuff make it water soluble so we can excrete it right and that takes place in the liver in two phases phase one we're using the p450 enzymes it's like taking the trash putting the trash and the trash can putting it out the side of the road you have phase two amino acid conjugation the trash truck comes and picks up the trash very few things in nature induce phase two independent of phase one meaning most of us have trash piled up on the side of our road those things are the polyphenols right and so things like the blues the Reds the pigments that's why it's important to eat a wide variety of colors in your diet matcha tea you know has a very strong inducing effect on Phase 2 liver activity right y I need to develop a taste for matcha yeah I feel like it's kind of grainy it is and it's bitter you know but bitter things tend to be you know again helping that phase two um glutathione helps phase two uh you we do a lot of that intervenous and then glycine is a wonderful agent for inducing phase two independent of phase one and the trouble is I don't think people realize you know people are told well you know most Pharmaceuticals induce a450 enzyme and a misconception is well if I'm just inducing one I'm good if you induce one you induce them all so if you take any pharmaceutical you're inducing your entire p450 system you're speeding it up meaning you're putting more trash out on the side of the road and if you look at the amount of things we're being exposed to outside of pharmaceuticals it's mounting say on the side of the road you mean in the liver yeah that's what I'm I'm just using that as a metaphor yeah yeah yeah like you're not about screeing it in the um you're talking about um building up of of debris Cellar debris with it or uh excuse me metabolic debris within your body right that the the trash again very oversimplification you need to speed up phase two to get the trash trucks come to pick up the trash so that you can then take that compound and excrete it in your stool and your urine your sweat your breath right I mean that's the only way it works it's not complicated per se but I think there's a lot of misconceptions about it so when people take a peptide that's injectable pineal and glycine the gain glycine obviously but for let's say somebody doesn't have access to to you or to for whatever reason there's a barrier um to getting a hold of those peptides um Can people take glycine orally they can yeah glycine's absorbed well orally has a really sweet taste it's actually the smallest amino acid huge fan of it we've been using it a long time and you can take big dosages of it very again I my starting dose is usually three to five grams at bedtime wow and then I tell what my the way I do this recommended is try that for a few nights in a row not noticing a thing double the dose go to 10 gram literally most people at 10 grams of glycine will notice it again it's not going to necessarily make you drowsy you're not going to be sedated but your n nervous system is going to be tone down a little bit it's going to help you fall asleep a little bit better and then while you sleep where a lot of this detoxification process starts working you're going to be more efficient in how your liver Works everything ties together right I'm still still a big fan of things like magnesium 3 and8 um appenine which is a chemom mile derivative um and I'll try glycine I think a few years back I was was using a little bit of glycine but it was more like um a th000 milligrams but now that it's in the injectable peptide yeah pineline I I don't take it um is there an oral form of pineline that works that there's these bio regular bioregulator peptides um which were developed by this Russian scientist uh last name cornon I think done a lot of research actually there's published research about it I think pinealon is one of the ones uh that they say will survive the stomach acid and get through the gut and be absorbed um so I I think that's true we've always used as injectable and um I tend to like injectable things for the bioavailability so um yeah but to your point I think people can those are going to be harder and harder to find actually it's probably easier to find an injectable pinealon than an oral one yeah and I as we're talking about this I'm realizing what unfortunately just the way the internet works that people are going to start selling likely as a consequence of this conversation will start selling pinin but you need to know that you're actually getting pinin I mean it's very easy for somebody to just pop something up on Amazon and sell it and uh totally maybe they just throw some melatonin in there and call it pinin like there there's a lot of like BS stuff out there so T this is why the compounding pharmacy component and working with a physician uh and researching right making sure that what you're taking is is legit lot of illegitimacy out there do you think the pharmaceutical companies are going to move into these other peptides I mean certainly uh uh epom morelan for the reduction in a viseral body fat that's an FDA approved drug um so is cellin FDA approved drug um uh The glp1 Agonist FDA approved drug so those are the FDA is unlikely to pull those but they're Blockbuster um especially gp1 I mean they're making a a not even a small fortune but a large forun big money the the concerning part about the gp1s is uh to me is what we're starting to they've been able to be compounded because there was a uh shortage and the way it works with compounding pharmacy is because those are brand named drugs and they're not patented for the peptide right they're patented for the delivery system which is the pen um which most people don't realize and they've been able to be compounded and then way more affordable because they're compounded um and there is rumors that the pharmaceutical companies now have Supply back they'll come back and they will you know remove the ability to to allow these peptides to be compounded which means we'll have to stick to traditional dosages and people will lose access because they're going to be way more expensive I mean they are if if insurance doesn't cover it 1,500 a month for for most people very expensive that's a lot more yeah for a lot of people that's rent and more so yeah uh I'm hopeful that doesn't happen um but that's that's in the works that's in the works and and that would be a huge shame and again I'm not a a pessimist by any means I'm a Perpetual optimist so we'll just we'll just make sure it stays this way but you know again if it does happen we'll get creative and and go other routes as well um earlier you mentioned stem cell therapies y those are not FDA approved in this country they are actually they you can you can Sor my mistake yeah so uh I think that using the term stem cell is a problem right if we use the term autus cell right which would be PRP it's basically the same plasma right they take your blood they spin down they take the right and so the ruling is I understand it as long as you're taking a cell that from you and you give it back within four hours then that is allowed with under the FDA guidelines interesting there was this clinic in um Florida a few years ago was um touting stem cell therapies for macular degeneration injected some stem cells into these patients eyes and they went blind really quickly and they were not blind prior to the injections that to my understanding caused a severe setback to the whole field um I'm old enough to remember when gene therapy was set back by about 10 years because a patient received gene therapy um which is now pretty common um for certain diseases and the patient died it's unclear exactly why they died um but that delayed the field of gene therapy um by at least a decade I mean they this country is very conservative when it comes to the approval of new Therapeutics yeah sure yeah yeah no and I think um like anything there's going to be people who get too aggressive and I've heard of doctors injecting stem cells into people's Diss and then they get discitis an infection and that can just spiral very quickly I think it's you got to be reasonable in you know what you're trying to accomplish I I'm excited about stem cells and exosome therapy and PRP and prf and using them as you kind of biologics and uh because I think there's a lot to learn I think we only know very little um from what we've seen from working with our patients it's been tremendous from a Rejuvenation standpoint I mean we're as long as you know I think it's taking from your own you know and then giving back your own within how the FDA outlines it I think that's a great way to do it well certainly you have the clinical uh clinical data um to back those statements a thymosin Alpha One uh what is this peptide but maybe before we discuss it did the FDA nuke thymus and Alpha One they did whoa okay they're coming through with a with a Howitzer and taking out all these peptides um okay um well then let's keep this relatively brief what what was thymosin alpha 1 being used for previously yeah I think it was uh from my observation the best peptide for immune modulation so we would use it uh if you had an overactive immune system like autoimmune disease by definition if someone has an autoimmune disease their immun their immune system is attacking their own self right that's classically lupus rheumato arthritis things like that celiac disease type 1 diabetes those are all you know autoimmune diseases we could use thymus and Alpha 1 and we ton down the immune response we'd also use it a lot in postco where you have an abnormal immune response or the immune system hasn't caught back up and you can kind of dial it up using thymus and Alpha 1 in a very safe way use it a lot with long covid um and we were using 5,000 micrograms a day um sometimes intravenously getting great results very very safe had no issues with it um but unfortunately it's off the table I hear a lot of complaints about um brain fog um with long covid um and brain fog generally um cerebral lysen is a very interesting compound um my understanding is that cerebral lysen is available in Europe more broadly than it is in the US is it did the FDA is it Tak out Avil okay all right cerebral licon made the cut we see what happens after this podcast that's right um we've used a lot of cerebral license um we I actually have a clinic that's open in London we actually did use it uh we've used it a lot more over there than over here ah so you have a US clinic and a and a UK Clinic we have a one in based in London and and one in Charleston yeah and um I think you know cerebral license has been used for decades in the setting of you know poststroke um post traumatic brain injury the trouble with it again I've observed with people they get cerebral license we're talking about IV you can also use it subq is they will have a day or two where they feel really down and out like it's like their mood shifts to like this dark place um scary yeah and they come out of it um but most people don't like that feeling and so we just we stopped using it mostly yeah for that reason my understanding is that cerebral license is a kind of a cocktail of brain derive neutrophic factor cery neutrophic factor like some other things it's not one thing yeah and I think right I think I think collectively it increases bdnf levels right like uh there was dihexa too you know if you're familiar with aexa it's another one that was removed by the FDA uh supposedly the most potent way to increase you know brain derived neurotropic Factor kind of the juice the neurons live in again oversimplification that's gone but I think seron did the same thing interesting so as long as we're talking about um maintaining or boosting cognitive function um here's one never tried um but you and I have talked a little bit about and uh it it's still seen as kind of renegade but it's becoming more common place um and that's methylene blue and I always make the joke uh that I used to use methylene blue to clean my fish tanks right um cuz I was I'm a big uh fish tank a ficado at least I was when I was a kid right now I don't my have a tank but it's it's it's empty um nope pun intended um what is methylene blue and what are people using it for and does it turn your tongue blue it does for sure um not permanently not permanently it's actually the uh the first pharmaceutical ever prescribed in this country in the late 1800 was methylene blue goodness here so it sounds like really Renegade but it's it's not got it yep um but it's it's gained favor in the last five years that's certainly when we learned about it particularly you know I learned about it through this doctor who was telling me with covid patients he was getting immediate like within a day uh of stopping of Co symptoms from using methylene blue that's what like peaked my interest like wow that's incredible and then he went on to say that then covid test ret turning negative within a matter of like two days which was unheard of I've seen that with something else but I'll get back to that yeah and so that's when I was like oh this is you know it started to be talked about and learned about it um so methylene blue when we talk about the mitochondria using that mitochondrial membrane binds to cytochrome C oxidase and I think of it you know traditionally it's used when people have carbon Bon oxide poisoning they'll still use it you go in emergency your carbon monoxide poison it'll give you methylene blue and it helps your red blood cells displace the the carbon monoxide and put oxygen there and so you're it's an oxygenator that's how I think of it is it used as a performance-enhancing drug in in uh Endurance Sports because this sounds like the kind of thing that cyclist would would really want to use check with your local governing body there's always a question I get people like they hear something in the podcast and they go can I take it or am I going to get disqualified and I always say I have no idea if you'll get disqualified I don't believe it's on the water list okay I don't believe we we we'll just look for the people with the blue tongues yeah easy test so um methylene blue very absorbed very well orally you know I think of it like NAD the molecule NAD because it works on that you know on those cytochromes different than Ned though because Ned is not if you're taking Ned by itself not absorbed orally well at all it's one of the trouble with it methine blue is and actually you can take way bigger dosages orally than intravenously we've given it intravenously a lot but we're Limited and using it intravenously just cuz it'll start to cause some spasma of the vein the arm starts hurting if you're giving too much methylene blue either too much or too quickly and so we can give it orally you can get a capsule of it that's how we our phy so I think a good dose is no more than 10 milligrams 10 milligrams taken when in the morning it is you know it's a cognitive stimulant for sure I mean I've had more people over the last 5 years because we make methylene blue we combine it with some other agents a little bit of caffeine some B vitamins and people say this is the best thing for you know my brain function recall memory kind of quote unquote neut Tropic a term I don't really like because yeah you know there aren't circuits for being smart there circuits for y Tas switching but y so it's 10 milligrams of methylene blue combined and you've got some other things in the cocktail version that you make take it in the morning on an empty stomach yeah I you could take it with food though again it's going to be well absorbed um it will interesting to people and I need to say it will turn your urine green or blue for how long um about 24 hours hour depending and that be kind of fun yeah well and a good caveat is if it doesn't and I've had patients then that's interesting to me as a clinician because it means that your mitochondria is not working well right like the way I see this is you should get spill over you shouldn't kind of use it all and if you're not there's something wrong there that you're using all of it and you're getting no spill over back into your bloodstream which gets filtered into your bladder your urine which you urinate out that and that's happened with a couple patients so it's like oh wow you had no green or blue urine there's a problem with your mitochondria so it's putting more oxygen onto the blood cells correct like your your hemoglobin is able to pick up more oxygen that's exactly right um but then there's the you know a mild MAOI inhibitor which is monamine oxidase inhibitor yeah which going to allow things like serotonin to work a little bit longer in that synaptic Clift um you know and you've expounded way better than I can about serotonin and dop me and how those work but um there is a cognitive enhancement from it for sure it's very real and we have a lot of people using it and love it it also seems to be an antiviral you know you get this again that's probably through the mitochondria making your mitochondria more efficient it's a prescription drug it's a prescription drug but there's there's now and I don't totally understand it there's now strictly over-the-counter neutral supplement options that are methylene blue for sure anyone can go online and buy it for sure trust me now now there there are going to be a few and and you talked about turning your mouth blue if you take a liquid form right uh and we'll do that sometimes in the office when we're doing other treatments we'll give a big dose of methylene blue to kind of help fuel kind of quickly make a lot of ATP which we want to do with some different IV treatments we do um so we'll give sometimes up to 50 5 milligrams at a time um their gums teeth lips are blue for about an hour or two and how often um Can people take methylene blue again I you you could take it every day I think it I think it's a little bit longer acting I don't I don't take it every day I take it about three times a week I think that's about right um I do have people who need it more you know for whatever they're dealing with I do think you know as a nutrient if we're going to call it that it's it's a lot of it's an insurance policy for your mitochondria so earlier you mentioned um a patient or maybe it was patients plural that experienced a more rapid transition out of a uh a covid infection or maybe more recovery from long covid symptoms Etc uh it reminded me of um the second time I got covid um far less intense than uh the first time U but the second time I got covid I had an amazing experience where um my covid test was very strong band it was very clear like I I had Co there was no question about it um I didn't feel good I was fatigued um wasn't super severe I would put it more kind of on a six six out of 10 okay on the kind of malaise level no fever okay so I stayed in stayed in bed and you know stayed away from people this sort of thing um but I did an NAD infusion M of course told them I had Co they came over they gave me an NAD infusion right and correlation is not causation but um I think it was 750 mgram NAD infusion over the course of about 45 minutes um I had the usual feelings that one gets when you get an Ned infusion of you feel like an elephant is stepping on your legs y um your chest kind of cramp so you feel and then when that stops you feel much better than you go into the thing yeah um the band was absent the next day my symptoms were I went from I don't want to say gone I went from you know like a 5 six out of 10 as I mentioned to like a two out of 10 yeah and within another 48 hours I was good good to go and better awes now this is correlation not causation I don't know what was going could have been the sailing bag right could have been any number of things sure um but the shift from a dark band to no band was so dramatic that I took another test okay after the no band and then of course the next day and the next day you know this kind of thing um um it it's interesting I I don't know what it means um but one wonders whether or not it's just a um a global way of combating inflammation you know I I just sort of anytime I think about a systemic effect um and the reason I rais this is that I don't want to give the impression that I think that like NAD is specifically in the pathway that was targeted um but that my brain and body were inflamed clearly I had an infection so you don't you could have a flu you could have a cold you're flamed um what are your thoughts on that anecdote again it's just anecdote but what are your clinical Reflections we've seen it so many times yeah I mean the for the longest time and so we've been using NAD longer than most I'm fortunate that I was given the original NAD infusion protocol which came from Mexico it's kind of a long story I don't want to bore you but um that dosage of 750 milligrams is actually what we came up with in my office and that's what most people adopted just because we've used used it more than probably anyone else on the planet huge fan of NAD very biased but that's only because I've seen it work over and over and over in inexplicable scenarios just like you're describing where it's not just you go from A to B but you're going to A to Z very quickly and I used to use the word transformational talking about it not just okay going from a sick state to a well state but and most people going from a well state to a super well State really quickly and it's super impressive so there's a lot more to nid than we understand right because just very empirically giving someone this co-enzyme this vitamin B3 derivative how is it dramatically changing symptomatically how someone feels but it does and I've seen it with thousands upon thousands of people certainly in the setting of covid certainly in other virile infections you name it I have been more impressed with the work of Ned than probably any other agent we've ever used amazing yeah I take sublingual nmn each day um it makes my hair grow ridiculously fast I've done the control experiments I'm a scientist I know how to do control experiments it's still just n of one it's just me makes my nails grow really fast makes my hair grow fast that's the major consequence um I don't by the way I want to be clear I don't have any stake in any company that sells NAD sure or Ned infusion so I'm just reporting what I'm reporting um uh somebody who's uh quite expert in the uh NAD pathway Charles brener um who I believe has a relationship to a company that makes NR supplements I think that's correct encouraged me to try NR I I took these um NR supplements this is what it's um NAD minus a phosphate group is my understanding um and those I took orally I I couldn't tell if I got the same or different effect because I was taking them together um I didn't continue to take them because compared to nmn it was very expensive yeah um and uh I just stopped taking so I that's why I use sublingual NN but um in brief discussions with Charles and kind you know forging online it seems that there is some literature human clinical literature showing that NR can reduce inflammation is that right yeah okay less data that nmn can reduce inflammation at least lack of human studies okay so we're still kind of in the it's still murky murky foggy territory with with respect to the the research and clinical the biochemistry yeah and like what does the biochemistry do in the way I think about it again because we kind of pioneered the infusions the NAD drips which for me transformational just observing lots of people who I never saw the same thing with nmn and R you know you're not having these transformational experiences within a week um you know that I I tell the story a lot is I had a patient he was diagnosed with a chronic Epstein bar virus which is rare there it does exist he was depressed and on disability just cuz he couldn't almost get out of bed this is mono um but it was reactivation of epin bar yeah yeah and so very like fatigued and depressed and literally on disability couldn't work and he I said before we do anything I I the way I operate I want him to get you feeling better first before we start to tackle some of the bigger things we we did the loading dose of NAD which we came up with five treatments in 10 days came back to my office his wife was there she was crying she goes within a week my husband is back wow and I've seen that so many times with NAD and I can't explain it right and I and if I just stick to the biochemistry doesn't makees sense oh you're increased in the Ned n ratio fueling the mitochondria which are all over the body thousands per cell there's something that we just to there's there's got to be outside the mitochondrial effect of NAD that's not well understood so in the backdrop of our conversation today there have been uh uh a number of themes but one of the themes that seems to keep coming up is that um there are a lot of things about medicine that we don't understand totally um and yet there are tools that seem to work for certain people extremely well um a few years ago I went to a meeting this is a foundation meeting a foundation I was a part of um where you get to see talks from really the the best of the best Laboratories um and they only show unpublished data and at the time I don't know if this paper is published yet but at the time they were showing that they took people that were diagnosed with um major depression okay and they start doing a bunch of metabolomics on them okay now this sounds pretty standard for social media it is actually like pretty heretical like not a lot of uh of places have done this right so you know a couple thousand patients blood draws they're they're trying to figure out ask a simple question are there any specific vitamin deficiencies that are associated with depression and as I recall they identified a few different types of vitamin deficiencies so it's not like one vitamin it's not always methylated B6 or something like that excuse me it's not always B6 or B12 um but they found these you know clusters of patients that had major depression that were deficient in a particular B vitamin they supplemented back the B vitamin and lo and behold those patients showed remission of their of their depression so one could you know conveniently conclude oh well all depression is a B vitamin deficiency but of course that's not true right more likely depression like fever is just a broad description of symptoms right but what was so exciting about this talk to me anyway was that people were starting to look at nutritional def deficiencies as a potential source of mental illness which now has a bit more traction but at the time was like whoa what what are we really saying here I thought all of depression was a serotonin deficiency right this kind of thing so when you talk about NAD having these transformative effects and the fact that NAD can kind of um raise the tide on a number of different biological processes to me it makes perfect sense it might have kicked off some mitochondrial pathway or some some seller pathway that then fills in a blank that's desperately needed is that is that one way that we can conceptualize that makes total sense to me okay I like how you described it so how often do you encourage your already healthy patients to do NAD infusions what are the dosages I should mention the NAD infusions for most people are a little bit costly they are costly they're like anywhere from $500 to ,000 or more you're in Los Angeles if you're in Los Angeles um so assuming someone has the means so here's what we found and again just found it by treating a lot of people and learning is um we do a loading dose um for most people uh we found the sweet spot to be 750 milligrams intravenous intravenous um when they when they were doing uh NAD in the '90s and they were doing it for substance abuse so alcohol pain medicine you know morphine they used it for that that's where it came from actually it was in the '90s people traveling to Mexico for NAD infusions that that protocol was 10 straight days of intravenous n y the dose to use was 3,000 milligram 3,000 Mig and that's why it took 6 to 8 to 10 hours per infusion you could not get through it putting 500 milligrams in over the course of 45 minutes is going to be very uncomfortable many people take a anti nausea med so I'll tell you about that so that that comes from so there was a gentleman in the states in 2006 lived in Louisiana he had a pain medicine addiction went to Mexico got the NAD protocol changed his life he then licensed the use of the only inject Ned product which was from a South African company at the time brought it to the United States opened a clinic in Atlanta all he did was addiction and I got to know him because I'm in Charleston not too far involved in IV work he was not a physician I don't remember the time but he came to me and said hey I need some help because I'm getting a lot of questions about this NAD stuff and so he handed me the original protocol I mean I'm super grateful and fortunate um but what I realized is no one has time to spend 6 to 8 to 10 hours in someone's office you know they may do that once but they're not doing it more than once so we started triing you know different dosages 250 500 750,000 on up and I just found collectively by watching people how they did 750 milligrams was a sweet spot meaning they'd get the benefits which we can talk about but then they could get through it in an hour or two hours and that was meaningful and then we found that we don't need 10 straight days that's too much that just is crazy we found that five treatments in 10 days again a four people the ability to have great benefits which were uniform probably 95% of people who do a loading disc will come back and tell you their brain is getting bigger they feel more creative they have an elevated mood they can sleep less but have more energy colors look brighter languaging is easier I mean this is all very real so I think it affects the nervous system first just because of the concentration of the mitochondria for every single neuron in the body the physical components meaning you know recovery and helping with physical exercise those come but I think they come later and so we settled on 750 milligram we settled on the you know loading dose and then what I noticed is that people were coming back between 3 and four weeks saying hey I don't feel as good as I did after I did that loading dose and so we start doing a once a month maintenance dose and that is what we still recommend to today some people will do less and some people do more I have some people who do it once a week um but plenty of people do it once a month and then some people do it quarterly some people do it whenever they can on average once a month seems to work really well for people then during the pandemic um and realizing this is growing because again we train practices kind of in the medicine that we practice we trained 300 350 practices and kind of give them the Playbook so to speak um people weren't coming to the office as much with Co so we started doing it subcutaneously and actually that's worked out really well we'll do 100 milligrams subcutaneously again 5 days on take two days off you get a little bit of that stomach cramping from a 100 milligram injection um like you said can't really be absorbed well or not going to really work so you're going to have to inject it or Infuse it agreed there's a price point here right um it's going to cost money um but like most things it's you know it's to me if I had to pick one thing for people engaging in N would be it really yeah yeah I would all the things we've all the things I've just been so impressed over the years now peptides are amazing not to knock peptides peptides there's so many peptides and I will get there right because you can take this peptide for the nervous system this peptide for the immune system but collectively One agent one thing it's NAD has been the most impactful from where I sit working with patients well that's a significant statement so 100 milligrams injected subcutaneously get a little bit of stomach cramping yes as compared to the 500 milligrams to 750 or th000 milligrams that one brings in IV the fastest I've ever dripped it in was I think like 40 minutes um I can tell you the record what's the record 3 minutes and 26 seconds is that you no no no no no never 500 Mig 750 milligram two separate people did it 500 cc's of saling 3 minutes 26 seconds wow it's insane yeah I don't recommend it no no we wouldn't allow it to happen it's too much it's it's you got to have a lot of experience with that yeah I I found that because you have to sit there for a while you you could think okay well you organize the you know the the plumbing correctly that you could type or something but you feel hard garbage enough during the infusion that like you get irritable it's actually a very interesting um window into empathy for people who have pain totally you know when when you're in this kind of whole body kind of systemic pain and discomfort and you're getting that saliva I'm kind of sensing it now I have a distinct memory of this kind of like for people that get seasick you think about being on a boat and walking back and forth um get a little nauseous someone would walk in the room and you're like God why are they walking like that right you know and it's your own it's your sense of pain I normally don't have that response to people I I'm not a moody person um in general but then you know when you remove the infusion you feel great and all of a sudden people seem delightful the the irritating person it's it's a very interesting experiment in in Social empathy it is it's this is just what I postulate is that a lot of people are challenged because a lot of people are numb to the world they live in they don't feel things and when you do NAD there is nothing like that experience and that feeling and so you are going to just psychologically say something is changing inside of me and it's something in powerful because it's when I receive it it's a lot and to your point what what we do is we have a kind of an IV room where we have like eight chairs and we make it social because when you're talking to people and learning about their experiencing it it's there's actually a lot of healing that incurs just from that Community that's a bonding exper experiment um for people that can't afford the infusions um injections would be the next best bet if they can't afford those would it be the sublingual nmn or NR I think so I think the nmn I would choose over NR yeah so it going from most expensive to least expensive most expensive would be in uh IV then it would be um subcutaneous then it would be NR and then it would be sub a sublingual nmn yeah okay that's about right I mean you could do NAD topically it's a little bit Wild Card doing it topically you could do it under under your yeah ptic patches those give me a really terrible problem is the patch I get this the patch it's adhesive it's too strong lots of people get irritated their skin gets irritated I think the Ned gets in well but the the patch itself is a hindrance obstacle and for those that are listening to this and they may recall I did episode of this podcast with Dr Peter AA where we talked about NAD and nmn and NR and that was mainly focused on the the research literature you're not going to find much um you know so what we're talking about here is clinical experience yeah I'm a full disclosure I'm a clinician through and through so my experience is observing people and you're interested in what works well and but but you know I I'm confident about it because I've done a lot of it you know I've seen a lot of you know how peptides work because we've done a lot of it this NAD because we've overseen again a lot of NAD here and in London all over and the and the providers we work with so we get a lot of feedback about what works and what doesn't work you know speaking of um clinicians and Science and and all of this um there are a couple other peptides that have received FDA approval um that are commonly in use things like uh pt41 um which is in this um melany uh hormone pathway uh that's used one of its FDA appr proofed uses uh is I think the brand name is VII is for um uh female hypo libido so it stimulates libido in women it's also used to stimulate libido in men is that right can be and it can be helpful for it's like a neurogenic uh mechanism for erectile dysfunction so so it's not just related to blood flow it's not actually it's not in pt41 yeah like a fragment or derivative of the peptide melanotan um which stimulates Alpha mocy stimulating hormone which you know uh is becoming more in play I guess in the environment I operate in just because of mold tox toity and we think of mol toxicity being a biotoxin and hitting you know msh being kind of the the General in terms of a lot of these hormonal Pathways actually and melanotan can bolster by putting out more melany stimulating hormone seems to bolster immune response I think there's an element with energy too um the downside of melanotan is it stimulates melany so you're going to get this tanning and it's not like a it's like an orange looking tanning from the inside out yeah you see it you recognize it so pt41 what they found is in rats I think it was female rats were copulating more when they got this compound and they're like oh cool and let's try it in humans and it it's led to that our trouble with it is very small uh or narrow therapeutic window and if you give too much you're going to get nauseous pretty quickly and some people don't like particularly women don't like that tanning look it's not a not a very it can look very unnatural unnatural is the word yeah the medial pituitary which it at least my understanding is the origin of the these peptides that we're talking about now is is super interesting and you mentioned the nausea these peptides hit multiple Pathways um when we had Dr Zachary knight from University of California San Francisco on to talk about glp1 in a lot of uh detail um he mentioned that you know some of the nausea associated with um OIC and mararo and things like that relates to the fact that there's um you know there are receptors for these things not just in one hypothalamic structure but also in like like area postma and areas of the of the brain that are these quote unquote primitive areas that are associated with um generating nausea when you need to rid yourself of a poison that you know nature conveniently uh engineered us with um with neurons that when they detect chemical changes in the blood make us vomit yeah and but to touch on that is what we found is if we start with a again a micro do and go slowly with the gp1s the N is virtually unheard of not saying it doesn't occur but it's super rare if you just take your time with I think people have most problems they're doing they're shotgunning the dose essentially you're overwhelming your system so I have two more questions the first one is a bit of a controversial one okay um today we've talked about a lot of peptides that you've observed incredible clinical utility for uh we also talked about a lot of peptides that the FDA has banned basically to be blunt um we've also talked about pep that at one point not too long ago were considered part of kind of Niche culture like Fitness or bodybuilding culture that are now approaching what will probably be trillion dollar Industries over the next 10 years things like gp1 Agonist so any listener with um their neurons firing will'll put two and two together and say okay what's the deal obviously the FDA I like to believe has a genuine interest in our safety they don't want us taking things that are dangerous for us at the same time um there seems to be a kind of clawing back of what's out there and then um a handing off to pharmaceutical companies to put out compounds for which there are tremendous profit margins corre I mean the profit margins on these are insane we can't comprehend it we can't comprehend it so um I you know mk677 I crossed out right the FDA grabbed that one um thus alpha 1 crossed out okay bunch bunch of other things um that have been uh bpc 157 clawed back um so how should we frame this in our mind in other words do you think that the FDA has um genuine good intentions of trying to protect the general public and that's why they're doing this or is this a plan to kind of um make that appear to be the case so that these can then be sold at a very very high profit margin and perhaps it could be both right it's not in either or and and I want to be very clear you know I work at a major medical school I um but I'll speak freely anyway right you know um as would my colleagues like I like to think that these governing bodies have some people there at least with very good intentions sure I don't think it's a bunch of bad people like writhing their hands together with getting Kickbacks on far I don't believe that in fact I know that not to be the case but like what's really going on here because this is kind of weird there's this huge class of of compounds we call peptides that clearly have IM immensely beneficial uses in the right dosage in the right hands with the right Physicians they're being clawed back why it's confusing I I think it's probably both I think you know I would say that unfortunately a lot of times when the government acts they overreach right like I do think they probably have good intentions I think there's a there are probably sound reasons to want to have oversight of things that seemingly is the Wild Wild West right and there's truth to that right because peptides came on the scene and people started using them they're recommended here and there people could get them from still can research companies and there's not a lot of corralling of understanding what what is going on so I'm sure there's an element to like hey let's understand this better but on that side I think they went too far right because I think if you really look at data or if you were really interested in that there's ways to understand how things work without removing them from the marketplace so the other side of me is like just like we're talking about OIC and mouro semaglutide and tepati are Blockbuster drugs if you're a pharmaceutical company and you see that there's 15 to 20 other peptides which are really working and really working because again we've just seen the clinical response over and over and over it's not a large you know leap to think hey if we're a pharmaceutical company what if we turn that peptide which was available to the commoner for lack of a better term into a drug oh like VII that was done for melany stimulating hormone Pathways yeah and so I'm sure I think it's both you know I think um and that's why I go back to we have to operate within certain boundaries right like that's that's great we have to understand those boundaries it would be and I and I say this sincerely I I don't when we're talking about Healthcare and we're talking about People's Health I we're not even close to talking about the truth for most things right we we're not talking about why people get chronic disease we're not talking about how our food is really overprocessed and the availability of high quality nutrients and what that means we're not talking about all the toxicities we just look at Roundup glyphosate and its interference with so many Pathways in the body and people say you know and Monsanto and whoever runs that now saying it's so safe and it's just not true so I think it's in line with and what I support is unfortunately and fortunately as an individual you have to be your own best Advocate you can't rely on someone to say particularly the government that you have permission or not permission to do this you think it's best for people to do their own research you know seek out reliable information right start here I mean you guys vet so much stuff very safe place for people to be like this is where I want to start and then life is you you learn by exploring and seeing what works for you it's like you start with a recipe to cook right but some people like it saltier some people like it spicier you got to see what works best for you and that's why seek out other people people like myself other Physicians other people who have experience saying hey we'll help you guide you in this and that's where the magic happens but to be honest we're not being truthful on many levels when we talk about health we're just not we spend so much money for what we're not making a dent and chronic disease we're not making an impact we're not helping people lead Better Lives you know medicine is great for life and death things it really is you know I in 200 August of 2020 I had terrible abdominal pain I just come back from visiting our friends in Hawaii I kind of tried to treat myself unsuccessfully eventually it was on Labor Day I had so much pain the next day called my friend who was a radiologist said I need to do a CAT scan I did the CAT scan he called me on the way back to the office I had a blood clot in the vein going to my liver that had completely cut off I almost died like it was really serious it could be hospitalized I'm on blood thinners now I am forever grateful for Pharmaceutical save my life right but those same medicines aren't probably going to help me lead my best life right and there's it's it's challenging having been educated in a very formal conventional medical system which is dominated by the pharmaceutical industry is a problem right we go back to the flexner report which is like 1917 1915 or something where they studied medical education and basically said if you're a medical school and you're not promoting Pharmaceuticals and in line and we're going to kick out alternative remedies and modalities like Chiropractic and acupuncture and nutrition they don't count anymore and that's where we are the only thing that matters and we see it as a society we're deemed healthy by the pills we take right if we're going to be really honest those pills aren't making us healthy and by and large they're not even making us well anymore you know what I mean and so I think it's time and it's wonderful to have this form to be able to talk about like and this why I support so many other people talking about it like we need to make a change in that we need to start being honest about what we're doing our health is not going to be coming from doctors saying taking this pill or that potion it's not not at this stage and it's more likely that people are going to feel healthy from seeing their trainer in their gym right these why these things go to the gray Market or black market because people actually get results you know what I mean and it's just sad but true and so to answer your question I think it's both I think the pharmaceutical companies are greedy I think they like making money right I think they also like helping people right they want to help people um but it comes with a big cost and um the government's there to kind of Corral that but like most things the government does they go too far right and uh I think we need to be honest about those discussions and it's not threatening and it's not harmful just to be saying Hey how do we make this better and how do we even agree to disagree let's just start there I really appreciate your take I I too rely on prescription drugs now and again um I don't know maybe I'll lose some following for saying this but I I I've had some some situations where it made sense to like take an antibiotic like after a surgery or something or like I'm not I'm not like anti- antibiotics right I also don't take I don't also don't eat them like M&M's I also um believe that uh well everything you said I I generally agree with I don't have the clinical expertise or the Nuance to really understand these governing bodies that's one of the reasons why I'm asking today and really appreciate you uh shedding light on this I think um your clearly a truth teller you're telling us your truth from the clinical perspective but it's clear you also have a a broad uh broad Optics here um we appreciate that sure yeah this podcast has always been about bringing in diverse uh uh outlooks on the same things and um it's been wonderful today to be able to explore peptides NAD and and this issue of FDA approval and FDA removal as the case may be you said something earlier a couple of times that I'd like to uh finish up on um he talked about positive thoughts yeah you're a physician yeah uh not a psychologist no but you're a physician and you're in the business of making people feel better and it's clear to me that among your many talents you have great powers of observation so what is this thing about positive thoughts I mean there are a lot of neuroimmunological data out there showing that you know stress makes us sick if we stress too long for repeatedly for two for to Long stress in the short period is actually good for us right um there are some data showing that positive thoughts can enhance immune system function Etc the data are pretty cool um clinically however what's your observation about mindset and health I think we're just scratching the surface and I think it is the most profound way to affect your life right so there's a couple things I'll say about it one no good has ever come from a negative thought nothing ever good has come from a negative thought and because all of us have a choice about every decision we make to me it's always best to make a to slant that decision in a positive frame now it doesn't mean you're fake about it right people really suffer people really go I mean it is a very stressful time right now maybe the most stressful time in human history and there's no need to gloss over it and saying life is you know peaches and cream cuz it's not for a lot of people people but what I know just personally and professionally is that when you start pivoting towards positivity you get more positivity right and all of us every single human has that opportunity to do that that some people it's way harder choices they are dealt a much more challenging and difficult hand lots of people but if we think about it we didn't get to choose our eye color we didn't get to choose our family we didn't get to choose where we were born or how we were brought up but we do get to choose how we respond to those things and so what I've learned is the more I there's never enough positivity I can exude there's never enough positivity I can be around ever in my life it is just the most amazing thing and it can never be taken from you right and so when we talk about success and Longevity and health span to me positivity has to be a part of that because the mindset of positivity will override almost everything literally and and I can't tell you how that happens on a biochemical or physiological basis but I know it to be a truth I know it in the core of my being that the more positive I am the more I can influence other people's and plant seeds and help people be more positive and that is something that I cherish and just love and it's not talked about enough you know specially as a physician we're talking about the science and oh this study and you know putting people on this medicine but really the value and I made this decision back in 2010 cuz I had my own practice and I decided to stop taking insurance and it wasn't it wasn't a money thing it wasn't like oh it was because I was no longer valuable taking five to seven minutes with each person and seeing 40 patients a day and for me I felt like I'm not fulfilling my purpose here when I'm just writing prescriptions that my purpose will be fulfilled if I can really have conversations where I get to know people and peptides and NAD tie into that because they are gateways to build trust trust with me so that I can actually help you an individual learn how to be more positive and to slant yourself and have that posture because ultimately all of us need the energy and want the energy to find our purpose right and once you find that purpose oh my goodness life gets magical right because we're all unique we all have a different DNA structure God gave us that to be unique to shine our light to contribute to help others most people don't know about that cuz they're in pain or they're tired or whatever they're suffering and if we can help walk people through that and help them heal that that's going to get really good and that's that's just what I enjoy doing beautifully said and so grateful to you for doing that within your clinical practice for making that decision a few years back to shift over to being you know aligned with your purpose and and the way that you've now expanded your practice to public education will provide links to your practice and to your public education efforts and for coming here to do uh this uh significant public education effort about peptides and other compounds and um regulatory bodies and also just the field of medicine and also just you know I think so often we hear from scientists or from Physicians and and we forget the human component and what's what's so um what's so beautiful about what you do and the way you do it is that your Humanity really comes through oh I appreciate that it really does I can tell you really care and I know our listeners and viewers uh can tell as well so than you um as this field evolves and advances um please come back and talk to us again love to Meanwhile again we'll provide links so that people can find you and some of the resources uh that back up what we've discussed today and Craig

Title: How to Improve Memory & Focus Using Science Protocols | Dr. Charan Ranganath
Published: 2024-09-30 12:00:52 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. Charan Ranganath, Ph.D., professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of California, Davis, and a world expert on the neuroscience of memory. We discuss how memory works, what causes diseases of dementia like Alzheimer’s, and science-based strategies to reduce age-related cognitive decline. We also cover the essential role of curiosity and the dopamine-curiosity link that can assist memory formation and neuroplasticity.

We then discuss challenges with attention and focus, and how to overcome them, as well as how to manage task-switching and create home and work environments more conducive to cognitive health and longevity. Additionally, we explore the emotional aspect of memories, tools for overcoming rumination, and strategies for reframing past negative experiences.

This episode will be of interest to anyone seeking to improve and maintain their cognitive health, focus, and memory across their lifespan, as well as for those struggling with ADHD.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Char rangano Dr Char rangano is a professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of California Davis he is one of the world's leading researchers in the topic of human memory and memory of course is an essential component to our entire lives memory isn't just important for remembering things that we learn it's also vitally important for setting the context of our entire life meaning only by understanding where we come from who we were and who we are currently can we frame what we want to do in the next moments the next day the next years and indeed for the rest of our life this is why for instance that people who have deficits in memory either due to brain damage or due to age related cognitive decline or diseases like Al aler dementia suffer so much not just in terms of not being able to remember things for sake of daily tasks but also for sake of placing themselves in the larger context of their life recognizing family members isn't just about being able to relate to those family members on a day-to-day basis it's also about understanding the full context of all one's memories with those people and what meaning a given interaction brings to any of life's experiences so today you're going to learn how memory Works you're going to learn about things like deja vu you're going to learn ways to offset age related cognitive decline what the research really says about that and ways to prevent things like Alzheimer's dementia we also talk about ADHD or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Dr rangan shares his own experience with ADHD how it relates to memory and the tools that he has used in order to combat his own ADHD Dr rangano has an Exquisite ability to describe research studies in clear terms and to combine that with his own narrative and life experience in a way that really frames for you practical tools that you can apply in your daily life before you begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is David David makes a protein bar unlike any other it has 28 grams of protein only 150 calories and 0 gam of sugar that's right 28 gram of protein and 75% of its calories come from protein this is 50% higher than the next closest protein bar These Bars from David also taste incredible my favorite bar is the cake flavored one but then again I also like the chocolate flavored one and I like the berry flavored one basically I like all the flavors they're all incredibly delicious now for me personally I try to get most of my calories from Whole Foods however when I'm in a rush or I'm away from home or I'm just looking for a quick afternoon snack I often find that I'm looking for a highquality protein source and with David I'm able to get 28 gram of highquality protein with the calories of a snack which makes it very easy to hit my protein goals of one gram of protein per pound of body weight and it allows me to do so without taking on an excess of calories again I focus on getting most of my food from whole food sources throughout the day but I typically eat a David bar in the late afternoon when I get hungry between lunch and dinner sometimes also midm morning if I get hungry then and sometimes I'll use it as a meal replacement although not a complete meal replacement it can get me to the next meal so if I need to eat in a couple of hours but I'm really hungry I'll Le to David bar as I mentioned before they are incredibly delicious in fact they're surprisingly delicious even the consistency is great it's more like a cookie consistency kind of a chewy cookie consistency which is unlike other bars which I tend to kind of saturate on I was never a big fan of bars until I discovered David bars if you give them a try you'll know what I mean so if you'd like to try David you can go to david.com huberman again the link is davidpro docomo today's episode is also brought To Us by levels levels is a program that lets you see how different foods affect your health by giving you real-time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor now one of the most important factors in both your short and long-term health and your energy levels each day is your body's ability to manage blood glucose to maintain energy and focus throughout the day you want to keep your blood glucose level steady without big spikes or crashes now I first started using levels about 3 years ago as a way to understand how different foods impacted my blood glucose levels and it's proven incredibly informative for determining what food choices I make when best to time my food intake around things like workouts both cardiovascular training versus resistance training and when and what to eat close to sleep or not so close to sleep when I wake up in the morning if I'm fasting or breaking a fast Etc indeed using levels has helped me shape my entire schedule so I have more energy more cognitive Focus my workouts are better my sleep is better everything got better when I understood how different things especially food were impacting my blood glucose levels so if you're interested in learning more about levels and trying a CGM yourself you can go to levels. l/h huberman right now levels is also offering an additional two free months of membership again that's levels. link l nk/ huberman to try their new sensor and two free months of membership today's episode is also brought To Us by waking up waking up is a meditation app that offers hundreds of guided medit meditation programs mindfulness trainings yoga needra sessions and more I started practicing meditation when I was about 15 years old and it made a profound impact on my life and by now there are thousands of quality peer reviewed studies that emphasize how useful mindfulness meditation can be for improving our Focus managing stress and anxiety improving our mood and much more in recent years I started using the waking up app for my meditations because I find it to be a terrific resource for allowing me to really be consistent with my meditation practice many people start a meditation practice and experience some benefits but many people also have challenges keeping up with that practice what I and so many other people love about the waking up app is that it has a lot of different meditations to choose from and those meditations are of different durations so it makes it very easy to keep up with your meditation practice both from the perspective of novelty you never get tired of those meditations there's always something new to explore and to learn about yourself and about the effectiveness of meditation and you can always fit meditation into your schedule even if you only have two or 3 minutes per day in which to meditate if you'd like to try the waking up app please go to waking up.com huberman where you can access a free 30-day trial again that's waking up.com huberman to access a free 30-day trial and now for my discussion with Dr charin ranganath Dr Charon ranganath welcome thank you speaking of memory we go way back we do we do I was a graduate student when you were first hired as an assistant professor which for those that aren't familiar with the academic nomenclature and trajectories assistant professors are professors that have not yet received tenure but now of course you're a full professor and you are a world expert in memory something that I think occupies the minds of uh all of us even if we're not trying um so that's actually the segue to my first question which is as we move through our day how much of our cognition our perception is focused on things that are happening in the present as opposed to being driven by prior memories um you know studies ever been done that evaluate how often our brain you know switches to thoughts about the past of course we learn about things that are in our present I know this is a cup because I was taught that um at some point but what I'm referring to is how much of our thinking on a day-to-day basis is literally in the past well it's interesting that I mean it's first of all it's a great question to start off with and it's interesting because I actually don't think memory is about the past I think memory is about the present and the future it's about taking selectively what you need from the past to make sense of the present and to project to the future I know you're a vision guy right and so if you look at people's just eye movements right the first time I came into this room I'm sure I wasn't aware of it but I'm sure my eyes were going all over the place now if I came back to visit you say if you're like oh that was an awesome interview or whatever right um hopefully but maybe not but let's say I do right chances are yeah so I go and my eyes will probably go right to the Rick Rubin photo then I'll go right to you know something else to the espresso machine and so my memory allows me to make predictions about where things are and it's almost preconscious so that it's happening without our awareness and it's like confirmatory we're grabbing the important stuff and making sure everything is where it's supposed to be and you can see this play out in phenomena also like change blindness it's a little bit of a different phenomena but basically in change blindness there's a famous example where they show a video of people playing basketball and they're passing the ball back and forth and then this guy in a gorilla costume just walks behind them and about I think it's 40% of the people who watch this video don't see the gorilla and the reason is is that you're generating these serious expectations about what's in front of you and so you're not literally seeing what's in front of you you are creating an internal model a simulation really of what the outside world is and memory whether it's semantic memory which we'll talk about I'm sure uh your knowledge about the world like the cup thing if it's episodic memory which is your memory of what happened let's say just a minute ago it's all coming into play and terms of your sense of where you are right if I just ask you what day is it you will use episodic memory for that tomorrow morning I'm going to wake up in a hotel room if I don't have episodic memory I will freak out because I'll be like where am I did I get kidnapped why am I here and that's really the experience of people with memory disorders I mean they have to be in really familiar environments because it's frightening otherwise right so even I wouldn't necessarily say that we were never seeing the present of course we are right but our understanding of the present is so informed by the past that it allows us both to focus on what's important what's non-redundant with what we already know and it also allows us to detect surprises and find out the things that are unexpected and grab the most informative stuff as well yesterday I took a brief nap in the afternoon I do this practice of non-sleep deep rest oh yeah um in the afternoon I got have you teach this to me sometime um yeah it's very restorative for mental and physical energy I find um but I fell asleep uh toward the end of it and when I woke up I was in a dark room um but I didn't know where I was for about felt like 10 15 seconds somewhat scary but I I'd forgotten that I was in my solo Studio I turn turned the room lights down um what is it when we have these lapses in memory as we emerge from sleep or sometimes um if one has been severely jetlagged um you can experience this disorientation of of place do we know what that is well a lot of your sense of where you are comes from episodic memory now there's a school of thought that says that episodic memory which is your ability to remember past events is comes from your ability to understand where you are and we we have some interesting data from sea liines actually that's speaks to this issue sea lions sea lions yeah okay we'll get back to that we'll get back to the sea lions but um I would argue that to remember like where you are when you first get up you have to engage in an active episodic memory retrieval that is you have to figure out well how did I get here and that takes a moment orienting yourself takes a moment and that because it's it's a little bit of a controlled memory search right it's not something that's in front of you that reminds you of where you are initially and you're also in this little bit of a fog when you wake up um I don't know enough about sleep to say but I would suspect that people probably are in some kind of a stage oneish or just high alpha um these brain waves that are like very much associated with kind of grogginess as you're getting up neuromodulators are probably super low so you know so basically not much epinephrine not much adrenaline yeah yeah exactly and so that's going to lead you to really be slow ining that memory retrieval that you need to orient yourself so like in the clinic if you want to ask if you want to understand whether someone has a memory disorder one of the simplest things is to ask him what day of the week is it what month is it um who's the president who's the president yeah right now that's a loaded question well depends on what time of year relative to the election you ask right um very interesting uh I'm curious also why it is that most all of us have a stable representation of who we are so my understanding is that even people with very severe memory deficits don't wake up in the morning and wonder you know who am I or who is this person in this body that somehow um we remember that we have a self that we are separate from other selves that that kind of knowledge U might be innate we might be born with it um and that the representation of Self in memory is very stable is that true well here's what I'll say there it's a real really interesting and complex question everything's you always talk to a scientist you get it's complicated but um I'll give you a simple of a thing as I can which is so if you look at patients with amnesia so they have a memory disorder where they can't form new memories they have a sense of who they are as you mentioned right they it's not like they don't know who they are and I mean like they know their names they know their biographies and so forth but what happens is at the time let's say if you had gone swimming and you nearly drowned you had a hypoxia incident or a cardiac arrest or um you know you had like a traumatic brain injury severe memory deficit right your sense of self doesn't update it gets kind of stuck and so there is kind of a sense of looking and not expecting yourself to be as old as you used to be uh as you are because like you're you're stuck in your sense of who you were and I do think I talk my good friend Rick Robbins at at Davis is a personality psychologist and he studies the development of personality and it does develop you know it kind of stabilizes in these adolescent years and that's actually also interestingly related to memory but it does change people do change in really interesting ways so one thing is that people grow more optimistic on average as they get older um and right yeah yeah that's true so Laura Carstensen your colleague at Stanford actually has done some really cool work on that topic they become more uh optimistic and yet I would argue that we become more quote unquote set in our ways because neuroplasticity the ability to re reshape our neur neural circuits diminishes with age well you know so I think that's overdone a little bit I think you're right you know you definitely see less dopamine activity for instance as people get older and um uh but what I'll say is that people have gobs if you have a healthy aging person they gobs of neural plasticity but often what happens is yeah you get stuck in your ways and that could be related to a few things one is that you get changes in the prefrontal cortex and that leads you to be less cognitively flexible um it can be also because people just build up so much prior knowledge about the world that it just becomes kind of ingrained that this is the way it is and it's harder to be surprised I mean you kind of see this with old scientists right they go like nothing's new everything everything's been disced CED in 1960 and nothing new has happened since then and by the way for folks listening who are considering a career in science nothing could be further from the from the truth in fact prior to recording uh you told me a saying that I've never heard before I don't know if it's cynical or optimistic but if I recall the the quote uh that Dr ranganath passed along which does not come from him it descends from somebody else not to be named is that quote science progresses one funeral at a time very very actually uh very interesting statement could be examined from a number of directions but I agree I agree I mean there's some wonderful let's call them aged scientists with tremendous knowledge and excitement I mean one only has to listen to like the noo Prize winner Richard Axel talk about his love of w faction and perception and you can sense his delight and he's getting up there sorry Richard but it's true you're in your he's in his 70s right hopefully he'll live a very long time but um and certainly science progressed as a consequence of him being alive and work working on the old factory system but I think what you're referring to is really important neuroplasticity doesn't necessarily shut down as we age it might even stay open to the same degree as early adulthood but if I understand what you're saying correctly you believe that it's because people tend to seek out less new knowledge as opposed to lacking the ability to create new knowledge I believe that's true but that's kind of that's an opinion I don't have data on that per se but someone's probably looked at this but that would be my sensus is that a lot of what happens with the way people's lives play out as they get older have to do with their environment and their experience and that's not to say that I mean yes neuroplasticity does change as you get older but it doesn't account for the degree to which sometimes people can get stuck and set in their ways and you know your example of the scientists is such a beautiful example because I look at the scientists who don't get stuck in their ways right and they constantly challenge their beliefs they surround themselves with a diverse group of people who stimulate them and they're also open to prediction error that is they're open to saying something could be violating my knowledge of the world or my my understanding of the way World works so here's just an example and this is I know I'm going to be free associating all over the place we get into that but it's like what are the coolest studies that we ever did um and I totally credit my postto matius Gruber for this he came into my lab uh originally German came in from University College London and he told me he wanted to study curiosity and its effect on memory I'm like this is just I am being totally closed-minded I said this is just a dumb topic you know it's everybody knows if you're curious about something you'll remember it better just because you're interested right so he said no no no this is really interesting and so he did this experiment and I got on board with and I you know we really kind of collectively it was just this beautiful thing where I was exposed to something new and I got excited about it and so the idea was we would give people these trivia questions and so it's kind of like a pub quiz right you sit in a pub quiz sometimes you get a question and it's like I don't know the answer sometimes you get it you I know it sometimes you go I don't know but God I really need to know the answer to this and you get this itch right or sometimes your listeners I mean they're probably very curious people that's why they listen to this and maybe some them go to your show notes afterwards because they want to learn more right so we actually scan people's brains using functional MRI and so we scan them when they get questions and sometimes they had said I'm really curious to find out the answer to these question sometimes they weren't curious and then we make them wait about 8 seconds and then or 10 seconds I think it was something like that and then we show them the answer so they're kind of in suspense it's kind of like you're watching like Breaking Bad or something back in the day people at commercials and so you're like oh no I got to find out what's going to happen to Walt right so you're in suspense you need to know the answer to this or you don't care and sometimes you just don't care you're just sitting around so we show a little face and we say Hey How likely is it you think this person knows the answer to the question now this is a totally dumb thing to do because they don't know this person they're just looking at a face they're just making some arbitrary decision but I'll get to why we did that because that was I think the coolest part of the experiment but let's first get back to the the trivia question so we found that when we looked at brain activity when we give people the question right afterwards there is a burst of activity throughout the so-called reward circuit of the brain there's this Ser it's not really a reward circuit as we've discussed offline it's really these areas of the brain that process the neurotransmitter dope mean and unlike many other neuromodulators this go all over the place dopamine is much more restricted in its effects and so in the midbrain near the ventral tegmental area sorry I'm geeking out on this no we've talked about that in this podcast there a particular I think the key statement that you made that people should hold on to as we progress through this is that dopamine is not dumped everywhere it's not sprinklered all over the brain it's released in a fairly restricted sites in order to drive particular processes I think that's sufficient for now yeah yeah and so when we look at functional MRI we can't measure dopamine but what we see is activity in the dopaminergic midbrain area meaning the area of the brain around the midbrain and you see it in the nucleus accumbens or What's called the ventral stratum which is another area that's super high dopamine reward processing area the more Curious people are like on a one to six scale the more activity you see it's just like this beautiful relationship right and it's not driven by the answer now there's a reason we probably didn't get it for the answer but it's driven by the question so it's not like they're like oh I learned something new it's like I want to get this knowledge and so that's part one of the story part two of the story is we show that face right after the question and if people are curious to find the answer to the question they get a bump in memory for the faces relative to if they're not curious now the faces have nothing to do with the trivia question but it's being in that curious state that drives this dopaminergic activity in the mid brain so there's a whole lot lot of other studies findings from that study but basically I think if God I gotta you know how sometimes you do a lot of studies me I published like 180 studies so it's like I'm trying to remember exact I think it was like functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the red brain during the face was predicting better memory for these faces in general something like that we can put a link to the paper of course and the show Capt so let me make sure I understand that the um when people are prompted with a question that drives release of dopamine the amount of dopamine is proportional to how curious they are to get the answer to that particular question and then the dopamine itself if elevated because they are very curious can increase the probability that they will remember the answer it creates a millu an environment for better memory but that can confuse us and make us think that dopamine improves our memory but it's that Curiosity increases dopamine which increases the capacity to store information that comes subsequent to curiosity beautiful synopsis but I'll do two cheerful amendments so one is um technically we're not measuring dopamine so I have to be very clear about that this is bold signal meaning it's you know metabolic activity but it's following all The Usual Suspects of where you'd expect it to be um the second thing is I do think that dopamine is playing a part and I mean it definitely facilitates plasticity so I do think it helps in learning the answer for sure and there's a whole Theory called synaptic tagging which basically says that if you just release a bunch of dopamine and then you have these potentiated synapses that you can dry plasticity in those synapses even if it's not happening at the same time but what's really cool is the face has nothing to do with the trivia question the theory that we have is when you get that bump in dopamine activity You're motivated you're energized to get the answer and you're driven towards the state of plasticity and now I'm giving you something has nothing to do with this question and boom you got it you know so when people ask me and they ask me a lot yes how best to elevate their brain dopamine one reasonable answer based on this study is curiosity to engage curiosity do you know the quote by Dorothy Parker the cure for boredom is curiosity there is no cure for curiosity um I believe is it was Dorothy Parker if it wasn't I'm sure we'll find out quickly in the uh uh in the comments on YouTube older people show the effect just as much as younger people do kids show it just as much as older people do um it's just something that sticks around so I mean speaking to your point if you are surrounding yourself with things that will stimulate your curiosity and if you're open to that Curiosity and we could talk about knowledge gaps and all these things that stimulate curiosity novelty is another one um Richard Morris has some beautiful data on this with rats but um emerel and I too have some data with humans surprise all of these things I have a whole chapter in my book on this uh drive that system so the dopamine system the dopamine system so basically if you expose yourself to opportunities to be proven wrong you expose yourself to new people places situations and you allow yourself to be energized by these things and not be scared and anxious not be like oh this person's saying something that I disagree with I can't deal with this you know or oh we figured this out 30 years ago we don't need nothing's new here if you can be open to that I would argue that you're going to be engaging lots of plasticity and that's something that's preserved in old age recently we had uh one of the world's experts on romantic relationships uh on this podcast um Esther Perell to be specific and we talked about a lot of things related to romantic relationships but she said that one of the most um sustaining factors for romantic relationships over long periods of time is a sense of curiosity both about the other person but also about oneself and how one changes in the context of the relationship and also curiosity about where the relationship could eventually go where one to continue to invest in it so this word of curiosity seems to be a resounding theme um I'm struck by although it makes total sense that curiosity would drive dopamine release in these uh Pathways that novelty would drive dopamine release in these Pathways and that also in the Physical Realm dopamine is so important for physical movement yes I don't think this is a a coincidence right some somehow Evolution organize this neuromodulator dopamine to be involved the way I think about it is in both a physical movement mhm it's required for it in fact as well as cognitive movement what we're really talking about is is cognitive forward movement if there is such a thing is there is there a a we're both neuroscientists but you're the memory researcher is there is there sort of a a word or a framework for thinking about cognitive movement forward meaning um as opposed to just recycling past ideas and memories the notion of taking memories and actually putting them as you said earlier into the present to anticipate the future actually forward mental movement huh that's a really interesting question well first of all I want to be careful and not to say dopamine does this because it's kind you're it's a trap right it's like well to be clear you observed heightened activity in a in a dopaminergic circuit so the idea that it would not involve dopamine is is a bit of a stretch but you didn't directly show that it was do I want to be exact and just say that assigning a single function to a chemical is you know risky but that said I do believe there's a link one of the things that you see is in Parkinson's disease dopaminergic neurotransmitter mission is shot and depression is also a symptom of Parkinson's disease it's it's quite a severe one in fact and uh so what I think one Theory goes is that dopamine energizes us to seek Rewards or to seek information right so a big part of movement is you move to get something it's a approach right there they talk about approach and avoidance as basic kind of things that you want to program and so a person with Parkinson's disease have has a problem with willful movement Tremors and stuff too um but I think that dopamine is involved in this kind of energizing you to move I think it's involved in energizing you to seek information I think it's involved in energizing you to seek rewards and uh so I do think there's some kind kind of a common pathway there and speaks to this issue of the difference which you've talked about and I talk about a lot as wanting versus liking and so Kent barage at Michigan is a great work on those Rec gobs and gobs of manipulations of dopamine activity and what he finds is an animal let's say that is deprived of dopamine it will go for rewards just fine it just won't work for them it won't do the work that you need to get a reward but if you just put it in front of them they'll take it so what dopamine it is heavily involved with these opioid systems that does Drive um uh reward responses and it's heavily involved in learning about rewards and that's why you get a big dopaminergic bump when an animal gets a reward because you're learning about the reward and what predicted the reward there's a little bit of a credit assignment process that takes place what's interesting is you get this too with actually my colleague at at uh Davis Brian wilin some beautiful work where he's looked at Trace conditioning which is when you have like a let's say if you play a tone and you wait a long time and then the animal gets a shock right and so what you uh what you find is is that the animal learns to be afraid of the tone but it's such a long time in his thing I think it's on the order of 10 seconds or above the animal has to be somehow doing something to be able to blame that tone for getting shocked right and so what he found was that there 's this burst of dopamine activity in the locus ruus which actually known for norp andrine but there's really cool work on dope meaning the LC now modulating hippocampus sorry to get all nerdy here but no no this trust me this audience likes nerdy I think that's why part of why they're listening Locus Fus is just a area of the uh of the brain that um tends to sprinkler large Brain areas with epinephrine which is or norepinephrine nor adrenaline for alertness so somewhat distinct from the dopamine system but you're telling us it can also releasee dopamine yes that's right and sometimes they co-release from the same neurons from what I understand and so what seems to be happening is and he's studying this now but what seems to be happening is it's not that the animal's going oh I just heard a tone I heard a tone and then they get shocked it may be more like they get a shock and then they get an immediate what just happened and then they get a memory retrieval of the tone and that allows them to put the two together to learn that this tone caused the shock right and dopamine seems to be playing a part in that learning process too so it's not just about reward it's really kind of you know the next time you hear that tone you might if it were a real threat you could actually escape from it right and there's this whole active avoidance literature that you can look at with these approach circuits that are actually quite useful for avoiding threats and avoiding punishment so it's really to me I see this role for energizing and that's of rewards I mean you know I like rewards as much as the next guy right I mean look at how much coffee I drank when I got here um so it's not that but it's just that it's mobilizing you I think I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 by now many of you have heard me say that if I could take Just One supplement that supplement would be ag1 the reason for that is ag1 is the highest quality and most complete of the foundational nutritional supplements available what that means is that it contains not just vitamins and minerals but also probiotics prebiotics and adaptogens to cover any gaps you may have in your diet and provide support for a demanding life for me even if I eat mostly Whole Foods and minimally processed foods which I do for most of my food intake it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits and vegetables vitamins and minerals micronutrients and adaptogens from food alone for that reason I've been taking ag1 daily since 2012 and often twice a day once in the morning or midm morning and again in the afternoon or evening when I do that it clearly bolsters my energy my immune system and my gut microbiome these are all critical to brain function mood physical performance and much more if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim their special offer right now they're giving away five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman to claim that special offer one thing that we talked about just briefly earlier was this non-sleep deep rest protocol um that is in uh um yoga tradition is called Yoga Nidra or yoga sleep because you lie down it's self-directed relaxation long exhale breathing to slow your heart rate etc etc I called it not nsdr not to appropriate it but because the language of Yoga Nidra is a little bit of a separator for people it sounds a little bit esoteric right and non-sleep deep rest tells you what it is right um there's a study at the University of Copenhagen I can provide a link to it in the show note captions and I'd love your thoughts on it that show that people who do this practice this is a pet um Imaging study so positron and tomography for those that don't know and they see significant increases in strial dopamine in the condition of people that do this self-directed relaxation as opposed to a more traditional meditation and this is why I say that nsdr is useful for restoring mental and physical Vigor which translates to this idea that dopamine prepares us for or as a reservoir for potential movement typically toward rewards and I love that we're talking about some of the other facets of dopamine because all too often people think about it as pleasure or motivation and certainly it's involved in motivation um and uh I'm very happy um to learn that uh it's also involved in learning I think that's that's a that's a that's a novel perspective on dopamine and we hear so much about dopamine do you think that when dopamine is released as a consequence of curiosity in a way that primes the memory system that um we become uh entrenched in particular particular behaviors or um routes of uh pursuing curiosity um to the exclusion of others what I'm thinking about here is a kid um we've seen these data um kids with ADHD um actually have terrific ability to focus if it's something that they're really excited about really curious about so you give a kid with ADH who loves video games a video game and they're like a laser so it's not that they lack the capacity to focus it's that they have a harder time dropping into Focus but it seems that because of the learning ass um Dimension to dopamine that these circuits could potentially quote unquote learn that it's video games that provides that feeling of focus to the exclusion of other things meaning how does one keep a diversification of of um inputs to the dopamine system so that we're continually driving dopamine through lots of different things as opposed to just social media or just video games or just pick your favorite yeah yeah thing um because a becoming a functional human being involves the requirement to focus on many things not just the things we were curious about yeah yeah yeah um I mean to me I talk about this a little bit in the book but um to me and and if you look at the literature too you can see this a big part of being curious is the appraisal process so to speak and what I mean by that is saying something happens right let's say something in your environment happens if you're going to you have a decision to make is this interesting is this important is this scary and I think the thing is is that you need to be open to that possibility that it's interesting so like so let me just give you like an example that I um that I often give let's say you're walking in a neighborhood you're traveling like you do for many of your uh events and you walk into a new neighborhood you haven't been to it's nighttime kind of poorly lit and you hear a loud noise right you could be like well that's a gunshot I better hide or I better run or you could be like oh maybe there's a club nearby and there is like a cool band playing I should go check this out that appraisal is really critical for how you respond and uh so it's not just a matter of curiosity happens it's a process of cultivation and it's a process of appraisal and so I mean this is I think you know I'm not a wellness Guru or anything but it's like I think this is one of the cool things about mindfulness training is it forces you to take the mundane and be curious about it and when you start paying attention to your breathing uh my friend Mishi Jaws really kind of turned me on to this uh she wrote a book on on mindfulness and meditation and one of the things that happens is you're breathing you realize wait a minute this one isn't the same as the last one right or you can do these medit I'm sure you've done this right this uh part of like this sound is different I'll sit in the backyard doing thanks to you I do this morning 10-minute thing and so I'll be out in the backyard and I'll be like hearing some sound and I'll be like oh that sound there's a bird there I didn't even notice that you know and then there's some other sound I'm hearing the freeway that's annoying but I heard it and so these it's really a matter of paying attention in some ways and being open to it and I think this speaks back to this thing about as you get older sometimes people find it scary to be in a new place people find it scary to meet a person who's different from them or so forth I mean I love listening to music that's a little bit out of my comfort zone some people hate it you know so I I think some of it is sort of cultivating being comfortable with discomfort think it's such an important theme um I feel like nowadays in part because of the algorithms on social media we're we are fed things that um feed our U progressively greater and greater scrolling and um dwell time as it's called you know to they algorithms are measuring clearly how long we dwell on a given image and what's in that image and Etc um but it would be nice to um cultivate uh an algorithm for curiosity surely it can be done I mean you got all these smart computer scientists and AI folks um uh and we come into this world naturally curious um all primates including humans um will visually fixate on anything that's novel right and study it mhm I'm try and make predictions and gain understanding um maybe now would be a good time for us to discuss a little bit about the the circuitry involved in memory so that we have that as a template to to digest some other themes in memory um most people are probably familiar with the so-called hippocampus um which is uh mean seahorse it looks a little bit like a seahorse although the anatomist had a little bit of an imagination there in my opinion but um hippocampus um let's add to it prefrontal cortex which you've already mentioned and um and then these neuromodulatory systems so if we were going to assign a one sentence definition functional definition to each of those areas um what would you say the hippocampus does all a whole lot of other neocortical areas let's add those in but I think if we can start with three I think then folks can digest the hippocampus is controversial I mean it's the most studied area of the brain arguably except for maybe V1 um visual cortex yeah and uh but I believe and my colleagues do I wrote a big paper with Howard I delate Howard ion bomb and andinus on this who um you know from Davis and uh we believe that it's about linking various experiences to a context and what I mean by that is you've got information about smell high level Vision high level semantic knowledge information right and the hippocampus is wiring is really set up to not understand what's going on so the late David maru's Pioneer in computational Neuroscience proposed that what the hippocampus is about is what he called Simple memory it's basically saying I know Andy huberman sorry is okay us to call me Andy that's fine yeah long story it's a Davis thing you would understand so um uh so I know Andy huberman right but to have a memory of this moment that's separate from let's say I saw you at some Neuroscience Retreat when we were in uh when you were in grad school I have to have some part of the brain that doesn't know who you are to some extent right because I got to keep them separate and so there are the hippocampus what it'll do is it'll form a memory that's not an Andy huberman memory it's an Andy in this place at this time in this context and that's what allows it to support what's called episodic memory which is your ability to say I went to Washington DC once and I remember going to the Smithsonian as opposed to your knowledge about what generally happens in Washington DC oh the president's there oh that's where a lot of politics happen oh the Smithsonian is a place in DC it's a memory of your being there at a particular place and time now there's other parts of the brain that allow you to associate that information in a meaningful way and to be able to to actually expand on that context and create these narratives and these stories about it and where the prefrontal cortex comes in and it's it's a huge area it's about onethird of the primate brain so it's just massive uh there are a lot of people who go well there's no real there's a bunch of different areas and all do different things and I subscribe to the view that that is very true and at the same time there's a global function of the prefrontal cortex which is what's called cognitive control it's this ability to say I'm going to regulate my movements and I'm going to regulate my perceptions and my thoughts based on what's important to me in terms of this higher order goal right so um when I tested for instance patients with prefrontal lesions I'm sure Mark desposito talked to you about this it's like the Hallmark of them you know they used to say well the prefrontal cortex it's important for working memory and you could record from neurons in the prefrontal cortex or look at E from orai signal um and if a person or a animal is holding something in their mind like a phone number neurons or bold signal and MRI will be highly elevated their activity will be elevated um throughout this period of time where they're holding in mind but it turns out if you just ask somebody with a major prefrontal asan here's a bunch of numbers five 2 7 8 you know I ask you to tell them back to me in right order they can do it just fine but now I start to distract them I move my hands around there's a plane going on you know flying outside the window I had that literally happen once now they start to bomb it because their attention is not controlled by their goal it's controlled by the environment around them and so this is where things get really interesting so I once tested a patient and I'd heard about this but until you see it it like doesn't register really blew my mind so there's a a test called the Wisconsin card sorting test and we don't have to get into all the details of it but basically it's this test where people learn some rule about where to put a card on a table right and they don't get told the rule they just learn it and patients learn this with prefrontal damage learn it just fine right is it that they get a a error signal or a correct signal if they're doing it in the right direction over time they just kind of the brain figures it out yeah yeah so maybe I'll give a little bit more background but I don't want to go in the weed no that's okay I I if I'm correct if I'm wrong I forget the Wisconsin card task details but you know like they they're told to just start swinging the cards and that the the um the AL the correct algorithm will reveal itself by a series of error and um correct signals and so maybe I'm taking all the red cards and putting in one pile black cards and putting in another getting error signals so that maybe I go odds evens maybe I divide by suit if it depending on what kind of cards they are maybe I organized by even odd alteration and sooner or later the brain figures it out yeah exactly exactly and you don't need a prefrontal cortex to do that which is surprising but you don't you can do it and so there's context dependent action and learning without the prefrontal cortex yes but let's let's unpack this context thing right so now you've been let's say putting all the diamonds in one pile you've been putting all the Spades in another pile right so now I Chang the rule but I don't tell you and you put the D Diamonds the Queen of Diamonds In The Diamond pile let's say and now I say nope that's wrong so now you have to wait a minute that was right all this time what's going on this is like life this is like life right the thing that used to be used to work for you no longer works so you keep doing this and a person with an intact brain will eventually figure out okay that's not working I'll try another strategy and then they'll learn the new rule right it's not easy it's a pain but people will do it this in particular kept on using the old Rule and so you have to give a series of hints going like H what's your strategy here and they're like they'll tell you I'm putting it according to the color and then you okay well does that appear to be working for you and they'll go no they'll just keep doing it they perseverate they perseverate but the interesting thing is he knows it's not working but he's can't help himself from doing it and so what the prefrontal cortex is it's not about this declarative knowledge about what you should do and I think this is very deep because I think often we get moralistic about people's actions especially for people who have head injuries or something like that and it's like you can have all of these beliefs that you want to have but you need the prefrontal cortex to translate these high order beliefs things that are very abstract into actual concrete action otherwise what you do is not going to be dictated by that knowledge so how this relates to memory is we're constantly barraged by information I think it's it might have said something like 35 terabytes I don't know but it's a big number and the estimates get bigger and bigger every year so we're barged by information there's no way you can even pay attention to it all right so you really rely on the prefrontal cortex to be able to say this is what I'm doing right now and everything else it's noise here's the signal that I need to focus on and that's super important for memory because one of the things you see in old age is older people are bad at most memory tests but it turns out in the in Labs we kind of overestimate that and the reason we overestimate it is we're giving them a test which is something hard it requires a lot of focus and it's not something they do every day but Karen Campbell and Lynn hasher these great cognitive psychologists did this cool experiment where they had a bunch of other stuff that people were supposed to ignore in this memory task where they're studying a bunch of things they're trying to memorize a bunch of stuff but there's stuff going on they're supposed to ignore the older people were just as good as the younger people at remembering the stuff they were supposed to ignore they were just bad at the stuff that they were supposed to pay attention to that's so interesting maybe you could say that another time you said it very clearly I got it but say it one more time because if anyone missed it this is super important older people can they were bad at remembering the stuff that they were supposed to remember but they were just as good as the older as the younger people maybe even better but definitely as good as the younger people at remembering the things that they weren't supposed to pay attention to gosh it it speaks to um almost two um parallel processing streams for memory if I'm not mistaken um or maybe so what's going on there is it that um one form of memory involves the suppression of information and that circuit is actually uh quite active in these older people and young people whereas curiosity for um and the ability to remember and integrate new information is somehow diminished in older people earlier we um we were talking about how that's not the case that curios if curiosity is intact memory is intact and growing yeah well okay I should say the benefit of curiosity on memory is intact in older people I I got that wrong I don't know Matias could tell me if I just email him in a break or something but but uh I don't know if curiosity itself is as high in older adults selfreported or I would guess no but this is why I asked about movement earlier it's also curiosity is also linked to your ability to access novel scenarios of course online you can just thumb scroll or click and access all sorts of novelty um is there any there must be data as to whether or not people in their 70s 80s and 90s are um scrolling social media uh to the same extent that um younger people are I don't know but I can say two things to this one is is that definitely there's a lot of work on media multitasking and the short answer is bad for memory period okay so scroll scrolling is bad for memory well media multitasking is bad for memory scrolling we the tech thing is a super fascinating area in general it's really how we interact with the tech that's bad but if you're an older adult your frontal function is not going to be as good you will be more distractable you will be more likely to go off course and so that scrolling is going to be more potent because as you pointed out the algorithms are all designed to suck up our attention so psychologist herb Simon came up with this beautiful term called the attention economy right and so the idea is that the more information that you have in front of you the more impoverished you are in terms of your attention so there's no such thing as free speech because it's like you have a limited supply of attention so everything has a cost and so the more information you have in front of you the harder it is to pay attention to what's important and that's where I think the older adults really lose some of their their functioning because basically I I talk about in the book and it's not a Perfect Analogy is neurons are functioning kind of like a democracy in the sense that you know real democracies involve these political coalitions or alliances right I mean people talk about the right and the left but that's dumb because it's like there really just alliances between people who like different things and they just form these convenient alliances with each other right but let's just imagine neurons kind of do this in the brain right and so you have in theory to be able to pay attention to something some Coalition of neurons has to be firing a lot that is corresponding to the thing that you're trying to pay attention to but if something is Salient bright shiny loud it's just grabbing your attention what's going to happen is is that those neurons start to shout down the neurons that are trying to keep you on what's not shiny but it's important right and so what happens is with the prefrontal cortex you can bias that competition now that's the term that people have used in literature that allows you so what people have found for is just a really cool finding again is you can find in the visual cortex neurons that fire when you're see seeing something red and Ne on set fire when you see something blue let's say right kind of distorting the picture but you get the idea so if an animal is trying to hold in mind something I say hold on a mental picture of something that's blue what happens is the blue neurons are firing in visual cortex even though the animal is not seeing blue right it's just they're thinking about blue you damage the prefrontal cortex nothing so you lose that selectivity so what's happening is the prefrontal cortex is biasing the competition and saying I know Blue's not shining in front of you there's no shiny blue thing in front of you right now but I need these neurons to stay active and so it's doing this modulation to help out the neurons that are keeping the information that's go relevant so what happens when that communication goes let's say due to hypertension diabetes you get all this white matter damage that happens with old age and this is really a big thing that is very preventable with the right protocols so to speak I'll just bre white matter are the fiber tracks the wires that uh essentially that connect neurons across uh long and short distances exactly yeah and so if you damage those long range tracks the prefrontal cortex is not efficiently able to bias that competition and so now the inan gets Remembered at the expense of the important that's that's I think the key thing and uh a lot of that's why why people talk about the prefrontal cortex as the central executive as anybody who's worked a job knows it's like the executives are useless right he trying to get an executive to do I mean except for some who are useful but then they don't really run companies very well there's some CEOs that are doing spectacular things but um yeah well okay we will go there um controversial shall we say but anyway so uh like a good executive their job isn't to micromanage their job is to say here's the picture here's my vision for the company and I want everyone to be working towards this goal not you know sifting through the mail room not paying the bills right and so what happens is is that when you have certain kinds of things that happen with aging like damage to the white matter that happens uh through essentially tiny cerebrovascular events most likely and we've done some research on this um in our lab uh in collaboration with Bill jagus who's now Berkeley and Charlie dearly and you can measure this in MRIs with a A measure called white matter hyperintensity you use a scan that shows up little bright spots where the white matter is probably damaged and what you find is is that these people with white matter hyperintensities actually have memory performance that's as poor as people who have hippocampal atrophy probably in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's and they're also bad at controlling information even when they don't have to remember something thing so it's like a double whammy and it's kind of like the executive is trapped in a in you know a remote place and they got no internet access and no phone and so they can't communicate with the company as every just doing their own thing right and that's that's a little bit about what what can happen with aging it doesn't have to but that can happen and you see this to a really great extent in many disorders this is why so many disorders really affect control and frontal function multiple sclerosis um diabetes um uh many kinds of things we talked about brain fog many kinds of inflammatory conditions will affect it um uh depression clinical depressions I've seen people older adults with depression who are cognitively more impaired than people in the MCI stage of Alzheimer's really yes so depression is dangerous for memory it's terrible for memory and it seems to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's as well do you think that depression is dangerous for memory and a risk factor for Alzheimer's because it is by definition anti- curiosity I would probably not say that and I I would say also I don't know what what I mean you know once you kind of get into these things in the epidemiological world everything interacts with each other right and there's genetics and there's environment and blah blah depression means poor sleep which means poor learning which means I think that's a big part of it you know I think that's a big part but you do okay so let's go back to your question because I do think curiosity is affected by depression I don't know the research on this but I would be shocked if it isn't and I do think that dopamine activity is disrupted in depression and your motivation to get anhedonia is the hall one of the Hallmark symptoms of depression as is rumination by the way which is memory retrieval of preferential negative retrieval of negative events and cogitating over them I'd like to take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors function I recently became a function member after searching for the most comprehensive approach to lab testing while I've long been a fan of blood testing I really wanted to find a more in-depth program for analyzing blood urine and saliva to get a full picture of my heart health my hormone status my immune system regulation my metabolic function my vitamin and mineral status and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality function not only provides testing of over 100 biomarkers key to physical and mental health but it also anal anes these results and provides insights from Top Doctors on your results for example in one of my first tests with function I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood this was totally surprising to me I had no idea prior to taking the test function not only helped me detect this but offered medical doctor informed insights on how to best reduce those mercury levels which included limiting my tuna consumption because I'd been eating a lot of tuna while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens and supplementing with Knack and cetal cysteine both of which can support glutathione production and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels comprehensive lab testing like this is so important for health and while I've been doing it for years I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive I've been so impressed by function both at the level of ease of use that is getting the tests done as well as how comprehensive and how actionable the tests are that I recently joined their Advisory Board and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast if you'd like to try function go to function health.com huberman function currently has a weight list of over 250,000 people but they're offering Early Access to hubman lab listeners again that's function health.com huberman to get early access to function you probably think a fair amount about age related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's and I'm just curious um at a personal level uh what are the sorts of things that you do to try and offset cognitive decline uh you seem to be a very vivacious and curious person um I've known you a long time and I don't know whether or not you were caffeinated every time we met but you have a lot of energy you're a very curious person um you just wrote a book um we'll talk more about and you're going on podcast you're doing a lot of things besides running a you know worldclass research laboratory so clearly a lot of curiosity um what do the data say about ways to maintain or enhance one's memory capacity with the understanding that curiosity is probably involved as we talked about earlier but at a at a really basic level um I mean a number of things leap to mind but I'm just curious what you're um if you had to pick like three to five things that are clearly substantiated in the data as supporting the maintenance or enhancement of memory as we get older what are those I mean as a memory researcher I almost find it myself like ashamed when I talk about these things because as you know so many of the most important factors are ones that are related to just health so for instance uh you mentioned sleep that's a big one um we can actually there's a beautiful study that speaks to this that was done 29,000 subjects in China and they followed them up for 10 years now at the beginning of so they divided people into three groups they said okay here's well what they said is there's six lifestyle factors that we're going to investigate one was I think uh um engagement in cognitive activities I think one was social engagement one was uh um physical exercise uh not smoking I think no alcohol but they identify these lifestyle factors that were basically just kind of good lifestyle factors right so they get people who have four to six of these lifestyle factors going versus uh zero to one of these lifestyle factors we'll just take the extremes when they start they're all the same 10 years later the people with four to six lifestyle factors going for for them are performing almost twice as high on memory tests as the people with zero to one Lifest wow so these are people exercising paying attention to their sleep um social engagement what are some of the other I believe I'm guessing low inflammatory diet yeah yeah definitely not smoking and uh and smoking and alcohol um I think were big ones the smoking one is interesting because we know smoking can cause cancer and cardiovascular risk is is real there although there are some data as I understand that nicotine itself not smoking vaping dipping or snuffing but that nicotine can be proc cognition and maybe even Pro memory um and nowadays people are using nicotine more and more I'm not a big proponent of this because of the blood pressure increase and the typical routes of administration are dangerous but um nicotine I've been told is protective for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's is that true well um Let Me by the way I just have to say forgot healthy diet healthy diet was a big one too which I Define as people wonder what is that and there are all these online debates about vegan vegetarian carnivore blah blah blah but I think most people in the world are omnivores most and I think it's very clear that the number one thing for healthy diet is to try and get most of one's food from nonprocessed or minimally processed sources that sort of sets you in the right direction yeah yeah so I was actually emailing uh with Dean and Aisha sherai who really talk a lot about this yeah they do great work they do great work and so they were actually sending me some stuff and I had known about some of this but like Mediterranean diet has worked really well oil fruits vegetables fish eggs limited amounts of meat although I happen I'm half Argentine so I I'm yeah you like your steaks I do yeah which I think you know is let me come back to this point because I think is super important but leafy greens were a big one they pointed out a rush Presbyterian study that I didn't know about that put people on I think it was called the DASH diet and it included leafy greens as a big part of it and that had a dramatic increase in cogn I mean dramatically preserved cognitive performance in people who were on that diet so the healthy diet is a big part now nicotine's interesting so if you notice a lot of people with schizophrenia smoke and uh one of the things that's been found is is that nicotine does seem to improve functioning in people cognitive functioning in people with schizophrenia now I think the big thing to remember about any kind of drug and this goes for food effects probably too but especially drugs is there's huge individual differences huge and so I mean just to give you an example I could not function without that coffee that I had this morning and then coming in here but my daughter would not be functional after those cups of coffee some people really are affected by these different things differently and then of course there's always a dose response curve and they often follow these inverted use so Marc desposito um who was my postdoc Mentor did a lot of work with dopaminergic drugs and a lot of people had done these drug studies early on on cognition and they would find no effects or sometimes would make people worse and what he found was was that if you looked more carefully there was an inverted U effect where some people and it depended on their working memory capacity were actually benefiting from the drug and then these other people who were let's say I can't remember as higher or lower were doing worse and there's a genetic component to that unsurprisingly dopamine Transporters play a role and so forth and so now you start to get into all of these Gene environment drug interactions that are just I would really caution people against saying nicotine is good nicotine is bad I think it really really is a much more complex issue just like marijuana right so you can look at uh smoking weed in adolescence for people who are at high genetic risk for psychosis it dramatically increases your risk for psychosis that's my understanding too although the times I've said that on the internet I caught a lot of uh push back from some of the Cannabis researchers but then having invited one of them on this podcast um I then got subsequent input from other researchers which counter their narrative which uh we can both say because we're both research scientists um that's what you call a field you know so maybe cut out any misinformation I might have said in the Ed no no no you didn't I you didn't I think the point is just that um it's very clear that there are certain individuals for whom high THC consumption can trigger psychotic episodes yeah and we're seeing this but not everyone yeah I mean I I mean we're we're now interestingly seeing this with psychedelics where it's like all these positive effects of psychedelics were being are being brought up but you know a lot of people remember the negative effects on people like Rocky Ericson from the 13th floor elevators or like uh Sid Barrett from Pink Floyd who became psychotic after doing large amounts of LSD what was the first example uh Rocky Ericson from the 13th floor elevators great psychedelic band oh psychedelic okay we'll talk more about Char is a is a himself a rock and roll musician and loves rock and roll hence the reference to Rick Rubin earlier um and there's a photo of Rick here in the studio that uh our photographer Mike bayback took um so we were looking at that together so yes psychedelics have claimed the minds of certain people made them uh helped contribute to their pre-existing presumably psychosis I should also say um In fairness to the other compounds out there methamphetamines have also significantly contributed to um the progression of psychosis in many people so it's not just psychedelics right and and then of course there are those who um have somehow managed to take psychedelics and um become more sane yeah at least remain at least as sane as they were before yeah and of course sanity is in the eye of the beholder too but uh what I'll say is is that yeah and you can see this actually there's some new concern about Aderall and stimulants and uh if you're giving it to people who might be at high risk for schizophrenia it might also promote psychosis that makes sense given the neag ergic dopaminergic um involvement in schizophrenia and those drugs are pro noradrenergic dopaminergic in general yeah yeah exactly exactly so it's really a much more complicated interaction and I think this is where this whole realm of personalized medicine will be super helpful um but there does seem to be a broad General effect for certain dietary intera interventions berries seem to be good leafy greens seem to be good eat healthy we talked about the exercise and my understanding I've been looking at this in detail lately but I'd love your thoughts is that while everybody we now believe men women Etc should both uh should do both cardiovascular exercise so to speak Elevate heart rate for 12 to 60 Minutes kind of thing depending on the intensity as well as resistance training to maintain neuromuscular function offset sarcopenia Etc to me the really impressive effects of exercise on learning capacity and the Brain in terms of brain health seem to come from cardiovascular exercise and that could just be because that's what's been emphasized in the studies but even when one looks at some and compares the best human studies um it really does seem like getting blood flow up to the brain yeah get getting a a nice um release of modulators into the brain facilitates learning and then of course people have to do something with that learning right so um do you make an effort to exercise for the specific purpose of maintaining or enhancing brain function yes yeah actually so I like when I finished my book I limped to the Finish Line I had all sorts of crazy stuff happen I won't depress the readers with all the crazy stuff sure people would be curious what what does it take to finish a book and how much you mean you took a toll on your body it took probably I mean matter I probably lost some like biological years in that but it was really like I mean it was great I mean it was really an emotional roller coaster though but then I had a bunch of you know I'm trying to do science write this book basically in my spare time which doesn't really exist as you know how it goes sure and then I had life happen you know my mom was in the hospital my cat died on my birthday I mean it was just like yeah see I didn't want to depress people with all this stuff it's real real life I'm just sorry to hear it yeah no no no it's okay so then I finished my book and uh I was like just thoroughly thrashed and I had a sabatical because I wanted to have time to promote the book and educate people about what's in the book and uh which I'd never gotten a chance to do before it's like doing this fantastic right I get to talk to people so um I really wanted to make some changes and actually this gets something we were talking about before we started recording which is after I wrote the book it's all you know it's going in the proofing stage uh I was talking my daughter and just you know out of the blue she said we're talking about ADHD and she's like Dad you totally have ADHD and I'm like what you know and I'm like oh gen Z you know overdiagnosis of ADHD whatever right and then I remembered when I was a kid my school contacted my parents and said you have ADHD he has ADHD and it was interesting because it was like I actually was ahead in school by a year and I got held back because I just was so socially bad I couldn't stop talking in class and I was just like really awkward and impulsive and uh um and so but the you know it was the 70s nobody did anything you know and and I had all sorts of behavior issues and so forth and there are other factors going on too but it really got me thinking oh my God I got to make some changes I'm living this unsustainable life where I'm jumping from crisis to crisis to crisis and say I don't have time for blah blah blah and so um my again it's going to sound depressing but it's got a happier ending so my dog had died in 2019 of cancer and that was my first dog and so I thought I'm never getting a dog again and uh in 2020 in the pandemic I got another dog because yeah and what kind of dog uh she's a both of these were shelter dogs so they're all mixes um I'm sure there's some pitol in her because that's every shelter dog either has pitol or um or Chihuahua exactly so but she's looks very Belgian malano and she moves like a Belgian malan beautiful dogs yeah and they're so smart and super athletic I mean she can like jump vertically you know just like it's so like which all come home she'll like jump up and then push herself off me which is like a very classic thing and so that's why they can jump like she can climb up like s feet up a tree to chase a squirrel yeah they use these for military operations in tier one military yeah yeah yeah jump out of planes with parachutes yeah yeah and she's but she's a smaller dog so our big our older dog looked like kind of she wasn't she was actually a kelpy mix I think but she looked like a um a Rottweiler and so everyone was scared of her even though she's the sweetest dog this one she's like smaller even though she looks kind of Shepherd likee everyone's like oh your dog is so sweet she's so cute you know you're like but this one's the ninja exactly yeah yeah um I mean all shelter dogs have a little bit of a crazy switch and them don't it's like it's it's tough for them they're they're like feral people feral dogs yeah but they have big hearts yeah they're eternally grateful you give them a home yeah yeah exactly and you know one of the things that I was thinking is I missed walking the dog I missed that activity and so I make sure to do that every morning and this is goes back to some of the activity things that we're talking about I know I'm totally drifting away from which is ironic no I see I see I see where you're going with this yeah so but this is this is is a little bit different but it's related which is um having a sense of purpose is very important for healthy brain aging there's a trends of cognitive science article can send you it's one of these things that neuroscientists don't talk about because it's not we don't understand it but it's hugely important it's part of this whole phenomenon what they call cognitive reserve and you know having this dog that I'm taking care of especially cuz you know my kid had gone to college just growing up living independently walking this dog every day it gives I mean obviously I'm married and I love my family and I've got lots I got love my students and so forth but it gave me more and I'm exercising in a way that's kind of fun I'm listening to podcasts and I'm moving and so that's something right there it's not just the exercise but it's the whole thing right I'm not doing something that I hate so then I'm like I hate running I hate I have this inertia because i' my ADHD brain doesn't like to do stuff unless it's shiny fun right I could go into work I could write this book cuz it's fun for me you know but so I'm like how can I do this and so I I ended up shelling out for a personal trainer I blow my advance on a personal trainer who's great and I go to see her and I she tells me what to do so I don't have to think about it and it's fun and you're in great shape you're a few years older than I am and I haven't seen you in a while and I I always have this like slight fear when I run into a colleague again after a while cuz there was this joke that we didn't tell professors until we became professors about the the so-called tenur look you see someone come in as a postto you see them as a junior professor and then you see them after tenure and tenure is a big milestone right it corresponds to academic freedom Etc it's a it's a wonderful Milestone it's a wonderful thing that we both have this um but you see some people who got tenure you just go oh goodness they look like they're you know aged 25 years in five years yeah we also see this with former presidents not all of them but a lot of them and um and so to run into you I well I saw you on Le freedman's podcast but then to see you I'm like Char's taking great care of himself it makes me happy it's not a judgment it's it's it makes me happy because I I love my colleagues and I want to see them live a very long time because I don't subscribe to the idea that science progresses uh one funeral time of my favorite scientists okay let's let's not attach that saying to me it was a joke I'm saying I'm saying that there's certain scientist my fellow scientists if you're out there anywhere don't H me there are certain scientists that you'd love to see live forever and you're one of them so um so you said walking the dog which presumably gets you some sunlight um a lot of sunlight in Davis even in the winter cloud cover is bright up there it gets your own regular sleep Rhythm so but you said this um sense of purpose right so and I'm curious about how you now frame exercise you said you don't like working out you made an investment in your health by paying a trainer so now you you train regularly and that's also an investment in your brain health MH and and um if we were to go back to this notion of sense of purpose are you talking about a larger sense of purpose like okay I I want to contribute to understanding of how the brain works you're a brain Explorer after all and therefore the exercise and the money you put towards the trainer is linked to the ability to do that are you linking these nodes or is this are these kind of separate entities like I want to be healthier and here's a way to be healthier and at Ergo um I'll be around longer to study the brain to me and again you know I'm not a social psychologist so this a little bit off out of my wheelhouse but to me the sense of purpose is is kind of this existential thing of like you know I got to take care of this dog and I gota you know and I when I look at this dog and she's moping around in the corner I feel bad but I feel like it's my responsibility to do something with my students yeah with my students I have uh you know I had was very very fortunate to have many people leave my lab after the pandemic which destroyed so many careers and many people left my lab and I got faculty positions I'm like so happy for them speaks to your mentoring as well well thank you I mean got you know you do well because you have good people in lab as you know true and so uh but what was interesting was IID finished the book and my lab was relatively empty and I did feel purposeless I felt that absence of that sense of this bigger thing and so part of the work is you know and this was like a thing that I felt doing the book promotion is I feel a sense of purpose in explaining science to people I got an email this morning as I was getting on the plane from somebody who was asking me a question about memory and I was just like this is so cool you know after you spend years lecturing students and some of them are sleeping in class and you wonder is anybody really impacted by this and it's just been a beautiful thing so that gives me a sense of purpose I've come up with I've really rededicated myself to research and we're doing these huge computational models of learning and I'm trying to get we're doing VR stuff and we're going to be doing all sorts of new things in the research and that gives me a sense of purpose but a lot of it to me about the connection thing that you bring up it's super important because often I find myself again because of the ADHD thing I for all of these things that I like there's things that you have to do that suck and for me that suckiness is utterly painful I mean and I know there's a lot of people like I know ADHD is over diagnosed right now for reasons that are interesting um and I know a lot of people it's very kind of fashionable to say stuff something like that maybe I don't know people are can be judgy about the stuff but for me it really is painful I mean I I've actually found that it's hard for me to work with certain people if they talk slowly I it's that tough so I've really had to think about uh so I actually hooked up with an ADHD coach who has been phenomenal for me and I know coaches are another controversial thing I don't know like I'm not in my world you want learn something you learn something from somebody who's sked in how to improve somebody at something yeah yeah well you know I mean I I didn't know what to expect because it's like a an unregulated world so to speak or minimally regulated but the person I found was just amazing and the first thing she had me do was she put down had me write down a sheet of all my values and order them and rank them and stuff I'm thinking this is such a waste of sorry Lori but I was thinking initially this is such a waste of time why am I doing this I don't really value any I don't know I just do things I don't necessarily value them or whatever but then I started writing them down and and then later I was talking to her about like this you know some of my troubles with motivation and getting things done that I don't want to do and I'm kind of Infamous for having trouble getting things done that I don't want to do in terms of like administrative tasks and so forth you're a real scientist well that's true I guess ADHD any scientist that likes administrative stuff I think uh I'm willing to call as uh you know what are they doing in science cuz that's like you're supposed to be focusing on experiments so Bravo so so values then motivation Yeah so basically it's like so I'm then I put the two together and I said I'm not giving myself credit for why I'm doing this so This goes back to the whole I mean in a way it goes back to the prefrontal cortex conversation is what's my goal if I'm going to see someone and have a meeting and I don't feel like going to the meeting cuz I'm tired and I'm bored or I want to just look at this YouTube video or I want to go on social media whatever dumb thing that I would waste my time on right I say to myself why am I doing this and I remind myself of that motivation and it kicks everything in gear because now I have that goal in place because the goal just doesn't pop up for me automatically and so relating what I do to values is a game Cher for me but it's a conscious thing that I have to work on to remind myself of those values and connect them and that's part of what I think people lose when they retire for instance I see this in people people I'm close to who have retired they feel like work is their only purpose and so afterwards they feel purposeless and then they're just doing things like you know Doom scrolling or you know being radicalized on on the Internet or like you know going into like but it's just like whatever captures their attention and I think so a big part of that sense of purpose for me has really been to get in touch with what do I really want and I mean this goes back to another thing with memory and I know this a total ADHD free association thing but it's like um I can people often ask me okay fine giv me all the stuff for brain aging and we didn't even get into hearing aids and uh Vision testing and oral hygiene and so forth we'll talk about those three things but um what I tell people is I can tell you lots of strategies for remembering names for remembering where you've been for trying to um remember like to do something in the future some of the hardest memory challenges we have but unless you do them do those strategies I can't help you and the problem is is that and this speaks to I I really liked what you said we do have to talk about some exceptions like retrieval induced forgetting and some interesting things like the pre-testing effect but your thing on study skills I listened to that podcast and I was like the beautiful thing that you did with that one of them was that you said assume that you will forget because if you go back to the earliest research on memory by eing house he tested himself and he actually he created these weird words called trigrams that weren't really words he tried to memorize them and what he found was within 20 minutes he had forgotten about half of what he memorized within and I don't mean just forgotten like he couldn't bring it to mind it took him as long to rememorize them as it was if he had never done it right so sometimes we have partial memory where we can't recall it but we get some savings and it's easier for us to learn he didn't even have that for a lot of the stuff so then he waited 24 hours and he had lost 2third of what he had memorized right so translate this into the real world there are some things that are caveats that we do better in the real world I would say at the big things the gist of what we encounter but the details we lose most of them most of the details of your life will be gone and this is true for even I would argue this is even true for people with highly Superior autobiographical memory we don't know for sure but I can tell you more about that um this is true for everyone who's been studied as far as I know and so if that's the case the question is not like why am I so forgetful it's why do we remember in the first place why that titled it for the book and the question is what do you want to remember what are the memories that you want to take with you whether it's memorizing things for a class like in study skills or whether it's your kid's birthday party which I talk about in chapter one um these are it's about intention is what I say it's the difference between attention which can be grabbed by anything versus intention which is saying this is what I want to take with me right let's let's um uh hover on that attention versus intention we hear these words all the time um attention is the directing of one's perception to particular Sensations or things in one environment is the way Loosely defined um accurate but not exhaustive um intention is understanding why or having a a cognitive sense maybe a cognitive emotional sense of why I am directing my perception to particular things is that right yes it is directing your attention based on some reason that's an internal goal right and that's where the prefrontal cortex really comes inh so it's very easy in some ways to pay attention to me if I'm like gesticulating and I'm talking very loudly because it's grabbing your attention constantly I mean it's face it I know lots of people in my life who hate this because I'm so loud and justicul you're not loud who are these people giving you this feedback send me their names and numbers I I I have words for them and and listen I would say given you run a world class lab labatory you're successful in your family life you're you're successfully raising your second dog you've written a a spectacular book you're going on um podcast you're educating the public I would say you're doing great so keep going um and whoever these people are we'll have words with that um you know um I need I need like huberman's like words of encouragement on my phone that I could just open up plus I don't want to take us off track but you know I I spend a lot of time each morning I first do a non-sleep deep rest or some sort of meditation Rick Ruben taught me this to get into intention and there are other people who have come into my life recently um this notion of intention the reason I said let's hover on it is so important yeah because we are in a world where things will grab our attention especially on social media yeah it's it's basically a war for attention I don't think it's an attention economy anymore or Simon's brilliant you know I'm not trying to take anything away from that but it's it's a war for attention and one of the ways that you rob your competitors is by taking their attention I used to Joo and I was in a very competitive area as a postto I was competing against a big Lab at Harvard and this and that we trying to find genetic markers for retinal neurons Etc and I said if I could just get them excited about the wire remember that show The Wire because it'll suck like 15 hours of those post box time so I thought you know be really diabolical I didn't do it but you know telling people like you have to see the wire they you know this and that you know because you get someone on a really good Netflix program and and if they're a competitor you just got a competitive Advantage this being done all day attention is our ability to for our perception to be um drawn to whatever is most uh moving most loudest most Salient um intention is different yeah and this is by the way this isn't a technical term this is just I like it because it Rhymes and a friend of mine came up with it so um but yes intention is your ability to say this is what's important to me right now and that's why I need to pay attention to it hence the values list hence the values list because if if I don't keep that in mind my so we tend to think of control as being just like willpower or like you want to do the right thing or whatever it's not it's really a big there's so many parts of it really but a big part of it is motivation and motivation is not a trivial thing it's not simply wanting to do the right thing but being able to keep that value in mind and retrieve that value because everything has a value associated with right and sometimes things that are you you know I'm thirsty and there's water in front of me that has a big value and that should grab my attention so it's not that having your attention shift you want it to be flexible but you want to keep these higher order goals in mind and so it's this balance between stability and flexibility now the key is or let's get to your specific example of like technology right so ever since I got a phone uh that is a smartphone my first iPhone when was mine was 2010 mine was well you did better than me I think maybe it was around the same it was iPhone 3 I think was my first okay we'll have to look up I think I had the iPhone 3 which was whenever that came out yeah so until then I would check email when I was at a computer when I'm not I don't think about it now it's always there and I get you know and you get alerts on your phone right so let's let's play this out now we're having this great conversation let's say we leave we talk about skateboarding and punk rock and like yes why didn't we talk about this on the podcast right we're having a great conversation right but now let's say I didn't put my phone on Focus mode and I start getting all these little beeps on my phone I know people I know played with in a band with somebody who had ADHD and he would const anytime we were in a conversation he would just check his text messages you text in front of me right so what happens is every time you do that your you're essentially shifting your task your mindset changes your your intention is somewhat Changed by this new task right so now I've shifted and there's a cost associated with that in fact actually people who study this there's like four or five different costs that go on it makes you slower to do the new thing right now I go back to the conversation well now I have another cost associated with that and so I'm not there where you are in this moment I'm several seconds behind you and I'm still catching up while you're talking and that requires even more control to get caught up and get back up to speed so I'm straining my matal resources I'm straining my cognitive control by shifting back and forth but here's an even worse part of it so a memory we haven't even talked about this but it's like a lot of our forgetting happens because we have these blurry memories they're not distinctive they don't you don't get a population of neurons that shouts out loud hey that's this conversation I had with Andy right it's like it's just kind of this blurry sense of I talk to someone on a podcast and not saying that this will happen now because it won't but um so I have this blurry memory well why does that happen well part of it is you have to catch the distinctive moments of these events and you have to associate them together into this cohesive narrative one of the things we found in our research and other people have found this is when let's say if you're watching a movie and somebody changes the topic of conversation or a character comes in something that shifts your attentional focus and shifts your understanding what's going on you see this big peak in activation in the hippocampus and what that seems to be related to is encoding a memory for what happened up to that point and so we call that an event boundary and so once you have an event boundary it turns out you like you go on to the next event and you have trouble remembering the stuff that happened right before the event boundary it's why people end up in the kitchen and they're like what was my reason for coming here and it's because they pass through three different rooms and their sense of where they were was changing their mental context updated to the point where now they have to work to figure it out right so this is what's happening when we are shifting between different tasks I'm texting and I'm emailing and then I'm talking to you or as you've probably seen in going to conferences people scientists scientists who know better are sitting typing emails while someone is giving I've done this because I'm intentionally impaired or I'm impaired actually ADHD is a cognitive control issue I think but nonetheless it's like I do this right so it's like I get it but it's like you are now creating this fragments of memories where it's not I have a cohesive conversation I have a little bit I got a little bit more I got a little bit more and those fragments of memory don't play together well in memory they can compete with each other and that competition is a big part of forgetting and so that's why it's super important to just do one thing and then do another if you want to do social media fine do it then do whatever it is you are supposed to do for work right but it's the shifting that really kills you because it creates saps your cognitive control it actually uh creates these fragmented memories it also actually increases stress levels so there's all sorts of you know things I know there's a lot of tech Bros who are just like oh no I'm multitask I'm great at you're not well I I you know I'm from the Bay Area and spend a lot of time with those uh folks uh men and women in Tech I think that the best ones like the truly exceptional ones are very good at dropping into a trench of attention they're very disciplined with their phone use and the ones that are doing a lot of task switching often aren't don't have complete lives they really don't they're they're not taking care of their health also and they are sort of under the sense that like they're working the time when they're not as a graduate student I didn't have a smartphone um I did something recently I tweeted about this um you may have commented about it I don't know but this has helped me a lot um I took an old phone oh um and I put social media on the old phone yeah yeah and only social media so it doesn't operate as a phone I can um airdrop things to it if so I use that for um looking at social media and for posting that phone is in a box and then my my main phone is for or um texting and other forms of communication so I still have that distraction around me but social media is now a dedicated thing that I spend a specific amount of time and I have a timer on that phone that so I allow I allocate myself a certain amount of time each day so for every moment I'm start that timer yeah once it hits zero that's it and I'm starting to shorten that amount of time ni the impact on productivity in terms of writing in terms of researching in terms of just dropping into conversation has been enormous with that um simple switch um and I just find it easier to just segregate social media from the phone the part of the problem is the phone is it's like a walking office it's not even it's a phone it's a computer it's a I mean just too much access well and here's the thing and this is really gets back to this idea of engineering your environment and because so much of our Lives we're out of control even though we feel like we're in control right and it's really if I have a hire or a goal sometimes you have to do exactly what you did which is hack your environment to allow to enable you to regain control right so what I mean by this is it's like I even though I might not check my phone I might have alerts off if I have a habit I'm thinking about it and every time I think about it that urge pops into mind I'm getting a little distracted I'm losing a little bit of executive control so you don't even have to do it right you can just think about it um so and multitasking is just one thing there's other things uh uh like uh one thing is is I talk about in the book is taking pictures so you've probably been to concerts I know I have where it's like you know people are like just filming the whole things on their phone or like now you see the rise of Instagram walls where you go into places and there's a wall that exists so people could post to Instagram nothing wrong with this but most not all the research interestingly and I can get into why uh shows that taking pictures actually impoverishes people's memory really yeah what about looking at pictures um of um I think it was Larry Squire when I was down at San Diego that said that hanging a few pictures in your office of things that are really pleasant memories can uh really enhance your work environment because you look at them go oh I remember that thing like because of all the context it brings about but you're saying that the the act of taking pictures depletes our memory for that experience let me be more specific about this right so let's say I'm mindlessly taking pictures so I go in I'm seeing the Grand Canyon a lot of people like intuitively on average will say that they will remember it better because they took pictures but what often happens is they're not really focusing on the distinctive elements of their experience they're just grabbing as much stuff as they can right let's take the concert as another example if you are filming the concert and you're just trying to grab what's being sung you will have a recording of the concert but what's the memory you want to have do you want to have a memory of the song that you already can stream any time or do you want the memory of how you felt the friends you were with the connection that you had with the artist because you were there I know this sounds real hippie dippy but it's real in the sense that this is what you want to remember I think at least I don't want to lecture people if they want to remember taking pictures of things that's fine I'm sure everybody remembers taking pictures at these things but what did you take a picture of and so you can use the phone and this is where the studies show good effects is if I mindfully use the phone and I say like there's something here that that will be a good cue that will remind me later of this great conversation I focus the camera on that I take a picture mindfully I use the camera not as a way of spreading my attention and just grabbing everything in the shop approach but rather use it to find what's distinctive and what's important and actually Focus me on it that's a really good thing so what I try to do is selectively document not overd doent I'll take a picture of people laughing or people eating I like to go to conferences now uh John lisman used to do this late John lisman and so he passed away and said I I try to do this I think more about these things and so I try to take pictures of people randomly you know they're drinking a beer and then they spit out loud laughing or something like that and these are not things that are like landmarks they're not things that are tourist St but they are great retrieval cues and so what happens is the next part of it is seeing the picture well what do you do when you see the picture right do you scroll right or do you use it as a cue to effectively test yourself to recall what happened during that event and integrate it now what's interesting is is that act of recollecting the event in itself will change the and it can make it more accessible but it can also make it a little bit more abstract and story like and so there is an interesting tradeoff where you have these things where you have these memories and you could even document it but if you use the the if the more you retrieve it the more accessible it will be but sometimes it'll be less immersive and more like a story that you've told a hundred times so is it so it sounds like if we H we go on a uh on a vacation or to a show or something that take a photo as long as it's intentional of something specific that will look the key is to look at it later not just post it but to look at it later and to spend a few moments or more drawing to mind some of the emotional and um cognitive experiences around that memory that however changes the memory right anytime we create a story we're changing the memory but perhaps provided it was a good experience that's better than to not access the photo at all um but I'm struck by as you are that the number of people who are taking photos at a concert a friend of mine who's a very successful photographer um who shoots a lot of photos of musicians thinks this is the craziest thing as if any one of those photos is going to be meaningful right um that they're outside of the experience of the concert which is exactly what you're describing maybe you just have a memory of taking a lot of photos yeah yeah that's exactly what happens people will remember something but it's not their feeling it's not like the friends they with and what they talked about you know it's it's more like you know uh I I Ed this example in an interview so apologies people already seen this but it's like uh I just uh I got to see The Descendants and I'm guessing since you skateboarded you probably had heard The Descendants and the desc yeah yeah yeah exactly so I grew up listening to them in high school but I never got to see them because all the great Brands bands I got into broke up right before black flag and the minute man and so forth and so when they reunited I was like I had an opportunity to see them in the club uh in uh Sacramento and so I saw them for the first time and what was I wasn't one of the kids taking photos I was actually watching but then there was a moment where Bill Stevenson the drummer who's a super intense guy and really one of the creative forces behind the band um he gets up and he starts walking towards the crowd and Milo's like sit down go back behind the drums and he's like no I want to say something and I was like I got to take a picture of this because this is going to be like he's really connecting with us and he talked about how cool it was to just be able to have this moment where he's now at this age able to appreciate this connection that he has with the audience that he couldn't appreciate before when he was younger and I was like I'm taking a picture of this because that's what I want to remember you Won't Remember Everything But if I look at that photo technically I haven't looked at that photo again but just taking the picture of it forced me to really think about that and that's the biggest takeaway I have you know a lot of the songs they played they did a really good job on but what I really took away from that was this connection that I had really wanted when I was a kid you know and reexperiencing that feeling of being a kid and hearing these songs when they were fresh and new for me and so that's that's I know I'm sounding like kind of a hippie or something that's not myself not a you sound like a punk rocker it's not confus the two that's good yeah exactly I I I got a digic all over the place no no it's I I have a question that that um I'm hoping bind some of this together um related to taking photos and memories um I keep many photos I like printed photos I have these in a drawer um they mean very much to me some of them are in the studio um but I keep most of them in a drawer at home Polaroids are an interesting um example I think of what you're describing the act of taking a Polaroid is more than just clicking or pressing with your thumb on a camera there's a waiting process there's a you actually get to see the photo emerge over time I would bet even though I haven't run the study I would bet that people keep Polaroids more than they and look at Polaroids more than they keep other photos which if you think about it is um if it's true if it's true is counter logic because you know usually people want to do another photo because they don't like the way they looked in the previous photo with Polaroids you can't do too many of those right it's kind of one and done maybe two and done but I feel like the act of taking the the Polaroid waiting for the photo to emerge kind of stamps it in your memory of the experience itself and the act of taking the photo is more involved it's more of a process than just a click that then you see the photo later now of course with digital photography you see it but you can take 100 you can take 200 photos like that if we were to export this theme of limiting our task switching as a way to enhance our memory setting up our environment in a way where we put our phone away perhaps or um and we we also are focused on intention why we are in something do you think that there's something positively reinforcing about um getting into a trench as I call it um because I find that conversations like this one of the reasons I do this podcast the solo episodes and the these interviews is that um they provide something that my life prior to it did not provide which was depth I mean we're just here there's no phones here and if there are they're off right and I feel like anytime we go into these trenches could be a video game could be an interaction with a loved one of various kinds and but when we go into these tunnels of attention there's something that's so deeply satisfying about it especially to those who have attention deficit issues that it feels like something real happened and the rest is just noise mhm is there any relationship of this of the focus system to release of dopamine I know release of dopamine can drive Focus but is the reverse also true that if you're in a state of focus do you enhance the release of dopamine correct that's the question yeah I well I don't know I I wish I could give you an answer and say I don't know um and it would be really hard to disentangle the Chicken and the Egg right because if you're measuring dopamine activity you'd have to well okay so here's what I can say is that I think that we often think of you know we think of like let's say an emotion right or any other mental state and we think of it like it just happens but in fact there's a time scale to these things right so it's like there is a basic response that you get when somebody points a gun at you but then there's an interpretation that you have that can take that threat response and make it into something more and then you're like really jacking up your noradrenergic activity right you catastrophizing yeah but it's like I mean well in that case it is it could be a catastrophy but if you survive the you averted the catastrophe the question is does the potential catastrophe live within you or does it die within you you only need to live within you sufficiently enough that you avoid the threat in the future right but that's the that's the the double-edged sword of norag energic systems is that they capture lots of memory and they open up thoughts about what could have gone wrong yeah but if it didn't go wrong it didn't go wrong you're alive you only need to remember to avoid whatever puts you in that circumstance yeah but that that can still be scary right sure and and this is where I think it's like this uh we talked about this before this appraisal is very important you know um in the case of focus it's a little bit different but just to make this very concrete the prefrontal cortex has top down inputs to many of the neuromodulatory systems so on average people tend to think of the neuromodulatory systems like dopamine and neopine phrine as being very bottom up they just send signals everywhere and set the brain into Focus or not focus or whatever uh but the prefrontal cortex has some anatomically at least some capability of regulating those systems both directly and indirectly and so that does I think speak to this idea that if you have a very strong gold Focus you can in fact Reg regulate the dopamine system I I think it's a reasonable and nor norrine to noradrenergic system so I think it's a reasonable thing and i' I bet you Amy arston has done some related work on this topic I'll check it out earlier you mentioned and I want to make sure that we return to um this notion of taking care of one's vision and one's hearing as a way to offset memory loss very important Concepts um could you share with us what's known about that this is just starting to be a thing but the effect sizes for instance for hearing raids are really strong both in reducing ad risk I believe and in Alzheimer's dementia Alzheimer's risk and in just good cognitive aging and keeping your memory as you get older so to your headphones too loud yes this what right well actually okay so speaking of things I did to preserve my brain health I'm playing in a band now and we're pretty damn loud and so I got I went to an audiologist and I got uh custom earplugs oh yeah yeah all the top music I'm friends with some some really amazing musicians they all wear insert earplugs oh yeah yeah but I think these custom ones will be more effective at both preserving the spectrum of all the frequencies so oh I just mean protect your hearing yeah yeah no but yeah but they're related because if you can't hear your frequencies you might end up turning up and you get this paradoxical sure thing so too much information I know but basically that is yeah so uh there is this issue with in fact actually there's an article that the Shai sent me on in the Lancet that one of their uh um Public Health recommendations is to get into a preventative mode for preventing Alzheimer's disease and one of the things they say is screen for hearing and give people hearing aids and and make people use them if they have encourage people to use them uh vision is starting to be a big one people who are older get cataracts get it treated you know um a lot of this preventative health care which we our system is not really equipped for it but can really save so much money it can save so much emotional pain for so many people it's really amazing another one we me I mentioned briefly is oral hygiene gum disease it turns out increases your risk for I believe it's Alzheimer's and also for cognitive brain health in general I did an episode on oral health and the effects on as you said on brain health are amazing because streptococus mutans which is the bacteria that causes cavities um Can funnel its way into the bloodstream and potentially cross the blood brain barrier which is I think why people think it might be detrimental to brain health yeah yeah I mean I don't know the detailed mechanisms but I I think that makes sense and there's this vague notion of cognitive Reserve which is basically some people seem to be quite immune to the effects of cognitive aging and some people seem to be very protected against Alzheimer's so what is it one of the things that seems to come up as as far as depleting cognitive Reserve or putting at higher risk seems to be um inflammation right neuroinflammation and and uh so Kim mallister as you know was doing work on on this topic of neuroimmune interactions and basically the immune system expresses itself in the brain you get microa activation that can cause these inflammatory responses and there's reasonable evidence suggests that it's interacting with toao and Amid and and this kind of cascade of stuff that happens in Alzheimer's disease right and one of the things that we we're learning now and we don't know nearly enough but the data out there is quite scary in fact is long covid is associated with significant cognitive effects and brain is that uh the explanation for the brain fog that people report many many months so they they report a subjective brain fog and you can see this you can measure this as a significant cognitive deficit that they're experiencing right and we've seen in the past like HIV was there is actually a whole variety of dementia that was associated with HIV from the viral transmission um we can like you can see with multiple sclerosis where you have like autoimmune uh responses in the brain affect mental function dramatically we're seeing more and more evidence of this and so this is again another one of those things it's like people go oh co I don't care about it blah blah blah I mean this is a health thing that can really affect people and it can I don't think anybody it's not a political issue to get brain fog it's just sucks right nobody wants this so I think that there's a lot we're learning about viruses and bacteria one of the the cool things I was talking about before we started recording is um I was at a conference I met the coolest guy and I'm blanking on his name but I'll send it to you Afters um but he's uh he did this great study and he was studying the effects of nutrition on brain health and memory especially cognition and so I what's the most interesting finding that you've gotten I love to ask people this because I'm curious and it stimulates my curiosity and I usually get a good answer so he told me he did this study where he has these rats and he gives them sugary water during the day about the equivalent he said to a can of Coke a day so they're getting this sugar when they reach adulthood you know these teenage rats they reach adulthood and they have memory problems and they do they have hippocampal atrophy so you go okay well the hippocampus is affected memory is affected sugar blah blah blah no problem so then what he does is he takes the gut bacteria from the sugar animals and put in an animal that doesn't get this diet and he finds the same kind of pathology and the same kind of memory deficit in these animals so there's something about that process of like the gut brain interaction that also seems to be playing a part in ways that I don't understand I think they're still figuring it out but again this this really shows this tight neuroimmune link you know we're seeing this now with pollution air pollution is a big factor so even if people don't believe in global warming there nothing good about being in a place with a lot of smoke in the air you know it's uh it definitely can and this is one of the risk factors that is noted in the Lancet report for Alzheimer's disease um one of my colleagues uh Pam L is doing research on this at UC Davis showing that you get like she actually takes real pollution from the calicott tunnel which connects Oakland and and uh Walnut Creek yeah and uh finds that rats exposed to this pollution have hi cample damage and uh um so it's there's so many of these environmental factors that can trigger the inflammatory response we talked about blood sugar blood sugar also seems to be related to these issues so um and diabetes is like so bad in so many ways it It's associated with those white matter hyperintensities that we talk about and so that's bad we've done some research on that and but it also affects um it can cause little uh you can get if you get severe diabetes keto acidosis you can actually have hyp hipocampal damage from that directly and it also dramatically increases Alzheimer's risk an epidemic of diabetes right now this probably explains um at least to my mind why um these lifestyle factors like improve sleep um cardiovascular and resistance training exercise but certainly cardiovascular exercise you know um uh eating a lot of leafy leafy foods Etc um we know all of those things offset inflammation to some degree or another right I mean one of the best ways to inflame your brain and body is to not get enough sleep and eat you know a lot of Highly processed foods for instance um to date are there any even semi satisfactory prescription drugs or other compounds that can slow the progression of Alzheimer's dementia once it's started there are now some drugs that are um I think they're targeting amalo that are producing some modest effects in stalling the progression of the disease see the problem with Alzheimer's as you know is once you lose neurons you're not getting them back right and it's like yeah there's neurogenesis and you can run around but it's not it's not much it's not you don't want to if you're depending on that you're hosed you know so um like but getting back to the exercise thing it's neuroprotective and so like let's say with a drug right I mean everybody wants a drug if I told you give you this drug you're 60 years old and it's going to have some terrible side effects you're going to get diarrhea nausea all this stuff but it'll reduce your risk of Alzheimer's by 40% a lot of people would be motivated to take it now I tell you okay well here's a lifestyle intervention that's going to involve what Sarah medin calls down States doesn't have we can actually get into that and and memory reactivation during down States but um uh involves sleep diet exercise exerise social stimulation right and these things by the way also reinforce each other having better sleep makes it easier to EXC having exercise makes easier better to sleep all of these improve mood right so these will improve your mental function your mood as well as your mental function relatively soon and reduce your risk by at least 40% if not more wow um if you go to I can send you this Lancet article but it's like the amount the proportion of variance meaning the degree of risk that you can reduce with fully preventable or fully in our control lifestyle issues is huge it's as big or bigger than the genetics I think people really need to hear and internalize that because I think everyone's waiting for this miracle drug that is unlikely to ever arrive frankly I mean you know to dat we have some okay treatments for Parkinson's to try and offset the loss of dopaminergic neurons but they can even transplant essentially dopaminergic neurons into the substantia but none of those things alopa Etc have proved to be cures for Parkinson's um not getting hit in the head is helpful oh yeah yeah traumatic brain injury is another one of the big risk factors so there are a lot of don'ts yeah I'm grateful that today you're sharing a number of Dos both in the context of offsetting age relay cognitive decline Alzheimer's but also in terms of how to enhance focus and enhance memory um I want to make make sure that we um touch on a few topics related to memory that a little bit um off the the trajectory we're on now but that come up a lot when people start thinking about memory and one that's kind of um intriguing very intriguing is deja vu do we have any understanding about what Deja Vu is is it just like a recollection of something similar that spontaneously gets triggered um I'm like what is deja vu well it's not fully understood but I'll give you my best guess that's science-based and not just my wildly speculating completely but basically uh one of the early findings that gave you sense about what Deja Vu is is hings Jackson who is this great neurologist who um did pioneering work in Behavioral Neurology observed that many patients who get epilepsy would have this Aura it's this mental Sensations right before a seizure where they would get an intense feeling of deja vu it doesn't happen in everyone but a certain and this is associated with temporal lobe epilepsy and the hippocampus as you know is in the temporal lobe but there's also these areas around it that are super important for memory um um including the amydala but also really the peronal cortex is is a key key player in this and so the um so then uh you have Wilder Penfield and other people who started to do these surgeries for epilepsy and they said well I want to make sure I'm not taking out good brain right you don't want so Penfield wasn't responsible for hm and that was like kind of an irresponsible surgery hm is a is a now dead famous patient and literally chapter in the history of Neuroscience somebody who um had his hippocamp high bilaterally one on each side of the brain uh removed to treat epilepsy um it fixed the epilepsy but he had uh lost all capacity to uh remember prior events yeah and so in fact he had this dense dense Amnesia right and actually one of the little known things even in memory research is he actually lost he had what's called a temporal leomy where they just hack off the front part of the temporal lber it might have been cauterized I I can't remember the ex I think he cauterized it but anyway they do that temporal leomy and he actually had the posterior onethird of his hippocampus but he had lost his perir rhinal cortex bilateral and that turned out to be Betsy Murray at NIH later and other people should turned out to be huge thing so one of the reasons I think that he became so densely amnestic is that it was bilateral so if you think about the brain like you have a side of the brain that's causing a seizures so you kind of got a spare tire on the other side where it's like that other healthy tissue on the other side can sometimes pick up the slack but if you take out both hemispheres now you're in really bad shape so Scoville did that you actually did it for people who are hm had epilepsy and it was a legit operation in that sense but he did it for people who had I think like psychosis to depression I mean back then they just did all kinds of crazy stuff so um uh but Penfield was like no I want to make sure I take out only the tissue that needs to go so what do you do you stimulate different parts of the brain and you see does it produce anything other than a seizure and if so that's not an area you want to remove and so he would go into the anterior temporal lobes and stimulate and people would have sometimes they would have an intense real memory but sometimes they would have this intense sense of deja vu where it's like they feel this I feel like I'm lived out this whole thing that's happening right now I've lived it before when you know that's not true right so what is this well a number of people my lab was heavily involved with this and Andy yenis that UC Davis was you know really Central to a lot of the stuff found that the perir rhinal cortex which is this area as I said it's a big player with the hip campus seems to be very critical for this General sense of familiarity that we have and so you know I use in the book an example of like if I say have you eaten a rambutan before now you being a worldly guy might have you ever eaten a rambutan no I don't know what that is okay so how quick was it that you were able to say no that you were able to think about go I've never eaten Rutan uh less than a second okay so you didn't have to search your entire memory for whether or not you've eaten romitan you know because it's so unfamiliar right so things that are highly familiar like you know maybe I'll ask have you eat a banana before or grapes before you can say yes because and partly you wouldn't even have to remember any instance it just feels right you know those are very familiar things to you have you ever seen a grape before yes of course you have right Apple very familiar to people so we just have that General fluency you can look at this like I've um you go into the grocery store and you see someone and you're like I know I've seen this person before where have I seen them before and then you leave and eventually you're like oh well that was somebody who I met at this conference or something like that but you weren't expecting them at this context it's and no episodic memory is triggered but there was something about their features that felt very fluent and natural to you and triggered that sense of familiarity and that seems to be processed and you can see brain activity associated with that in the perinal cortex and people with damage to the perinal cortex seem to not differentiate between the rambutan and the banana it's all kind of unfamiliar to them they might remember I've eaten a banana but they don't necessarily have that sense of familiarity and Rebecca Burwell at Brown University the coolest experiment that doesn't nearly get you know how in science you get these unsung hero experiments well what this was one of them where she stimulated in rats uh the peronal cortex at this frequency called the beta frequency which is kind of a relatively low frequency oscillation and basically put two objects in front of the the animal and so like typically if there's a new object the animal will spend more time like exploring it right and depending on how she timed the stimulation she could make the animal think that a familiar object was novel she stimulates at a different frequency I think it was gamma and the animal now thinks uh uh or actually was like yeah so she thinks now the Animal thinks that a familiar thing is novel with beta was that it thought a novel thing was familiar wow so could literally use this stimulation to change the way the animal is interacting with in presumably a memory driven way with this object right so for those looking for novelty in different domains of life maybe this is the solution maybe yeah and so uh an clear just to close the loop here who's a great researcher of Colorado State developed this beautiful Paradigm where what she does is she said okay well does that relate to Deja Vu well let's see so what she did was use virtual reality and so in virtual reality you can create these environments and you know put objects in particular places and so she creates these virtual environments where there are particular objects in particular places and let's say one's a museum right so a person can go through passively and watch a movie or they actively navigate through these spaces and then what she does is she has them go through let's say a video arcade but unbeknownst to the subject the objects that are in the room are an exactly the same positions as the objects in the museum but it's a video arcade so it looks different but the room shape the spatial a you know everything is identical it just it's got a different skin on it so to speak for video Gamers so what happens is people are much more likely very likely to produce a Deja Vu sensation when they're in these places these virtual environments that look very much like where they've been but they're mismatching in some critical way so it's like you've got enough to trigger the strong sense of familiarity but the mismatch is suppressing recollection and so that seems to be a crucial part of why you get this uncanny feeling of remembering is the strong familiarity you get and by the way I've watched these movies and I cannot for the life of me see that the museum is the same as the arcade it just feels so different cognitively but you know I can imagine being like if I really did it immersively having that sense of familiarity so you're really pitting these things in opposition to each other so what likely happens with Deja Vu is something uncanny that triggers a little bit of memory retrieval or a strong wrong fluency but then there's a mismatch that suppresses it and prevents that a context from coming up I'd like to talk about the relationship between memory and mental health um for the following reason um I'm very struck by the fact that in experiments um such as the work that Carl dyser off who was a actually the first guest on this podcast brilliant um neuroeng engineer of course and psychiatrist described which um he's talking to a a patient who's depressed um this patient has a stimulator for the vagus nerve they can crank up stimulation the Vegas nerve and and essentially The Narrative goes from this patient I believe it was a woman in this case talking about being suicidally depressed she can't anticipate doing anything of any interest or excitement to her increasing vagal stimulation which by the way folks does not just calm people down vagal stimulation actually creates a lot of alertness so this is a a vast misconception out there um that vagel stimulation is all about calming in any case as the vagel stimulation goes up her narrative literally changes in real time to yeah I could see myself going out and applying for a job I'm kind of excited about the future Etc so complete transformation of one's Outlook but also in some instances memory of Prior events so how we cast prior events is so interesting and the bridge I'd like to to uh build right now conceptually is is that there are two papers that um intrigue me one is a a paper from lamberto maf's Lab in Pisa which had a paradigm for exploring learned helplessness in rodents which is sort of a model for depression uh how long rodent is willing to swim in water to save its life right before it gives up and there's a learned helplessness that eventually arrives these yes are not kind experiments um but at some point they give up and then they they've essentially learned they're helpless and of course they save the animal before it dies but these animals given a essentially an SSRI like prac um Can restore some sense of hope meaning they'll swim longer after having learned to be helpless okay is it recovery of depression we don't know but in humans you see some of the same thing when ssris have been effective and they're not always effective you also see this in some of the psilocybin trials where people have done the psilocybin therapy talk about that in the correct context and now all of a sudden people have this completely different emotional version of the same events like yep a bunch of terrible things happened or with the MDMA trials for PTSD controversial right now FDA didn't approve it but a good number of patients describe saying yeah this really terrible set of things that happened those happened but I accept it and I'm taking the lessons and I'm moving on and and there's maybe even forgiveness etc etc so to me this is a this is a shift in memory brought about by a dramatic shift in neuromodulators ssris of course increas serotonin Sil cybin increases serotonin and it's interesting to me that MDMA while it increases dopamine most dramatically increases serotonin like 7x or more in terms of the now I'm not suggesting anyone do these drugs at all you can blow out the serotonergic system with too much of it with too much of too much MDA ma although the studies on this is interesting because the study that claimed that MD MDMA did that actually was retracted science it turns out they had inadvertently used methamphetamine oh jeez keep in mind folks that MDMA is methylene dioxy methamphetamine so I'm not suggesting anyone do these drugs I'm using this as a as a conceptual temp I mean this is abuse we're talking about to not like right right I mean so in clinical trials it's clearly been shown both for ssris as well as for psilocybin these are still emerging clinical trials and MDMA that in a significant percentage of individuals especially when combined with therapy people can now feel differently about the same memory so feeling different about the same memory and feeling different about therefore the sense of possibility going forward this to me is incredible and it speaks to the fact that much of depression the lack of a positive anticipation about the future Etc is based on memories about failures of past yeah or harms of past yeah rumination basically right so what is the relationship between the serotonin system system and memory or what is the relationship more broadly of the these neuromodulatory systems or the vagal system that can create these incredible like reversals of what we previously thought of as terrible as like manageable and therefore we're willing to lean into life again what is that again you know serotonin's like a neuromodulator it enhances plasticity and uh what I mean by that is is that if you have like a transient learning event you will get a change in the connections between neurons that were active during that event and super interesting work right now going on in behavioral time scale plasticity and all this stuff so it's not just cells that wire together fire it's more interesting actually or fire together wire together it's more interesting but those changes can often be transient and what people so like uh Eric kandell for instance one who studied uh serotonin in particular emphasized this but basically many neurom modul if you give a little bath of these bathe these neurons in in uh um serotonin or other neurom modulators you stabilize that plasticity and that allows you know increases in receptor density between these neurons that allow them to communicate more effectively now you can get weakening in LTD too we won't get into that but uh but serotonin definitely promotes plasticity right and so one of the things I talk about in my book is that memories are I mean we all have plasticity as I said retrieving a memory can allow us to change the memory in certain ways and it can change when you get into the details of it it becomes complicated in interesting ways but the short version is you can change it we get a small part of what happened when we remember but there's that feeling of the context there's that emotional response that we have that's both a kind of a basic raw motivational my heart's racing or something like that that's why people often say well emotion emotional memories are stored in the body well it's just part of the memory it's a retrieval cue so to speak and it can be also be part of the retrieved experience but you have all these factors going on that are part of this emotional memory and then you have a story that you create a narrative that you use to make sense of it and that affects all these physiological systems too right so every time I used I talk in the book about an example of how group therapy is so powerful as a means of memory updating social interactions where it's like people can change the narrative they say well you know I gave you this narrative about how I'm loud and you told well I remember hanging out with you and you weren't loud then you're not loud now and so now I can update these memories maybe byous yeah exactly I could I reframe it right and these framing effects are huge so in theory people can take and experience those traumatic and many people do and say this made me who I am and I'm happy with who I am now even though it's a horrible thing I'm stronger for it or I'm a Survivor or you know I couldn't have done anything about it and it's not my fault and or you can have these narratives of Shame and so forth and and guilt and anger and so forth nothing's I'm not judging anybody's reaction to trauma but what I am saying is that's part of the emotional response it's part of the memory that people construct the problem is is that with trauma memories when they do stick it's hard to change because there's so much plasticity driven by the neuromodulators during that event with PTSD we could talk about that that's a whole another thing but just let's just take traumatic memories there's it's so intense and the amydala response drives the physiology in many cases of that arousal which makes you feel like this immediacy of it right and it affects sleep and nightmares all but anyway stay out of PTSD for a moment because that's a whole another thing but those memories are very resistant because of that intensity and often the more we retrieve them we ret traumatize oursel so reframing in a cognitive therapy sense is very difficult because they feel this and their brain is telling them I'm under threat or I'm ashamed because they've reinforced this narrative so many times and you can work through the logic but sometimes times you need to create some big prediction error to generate some error driven learning which is something we can talk about or you need to some kind of help so if you're driving neuromodulatory systems like that theoretically could give you a broader window plasticity in fact actually we're trying Prozac on my dog and one of the things that uh that I've seen she's very anxious and very like uh like she'll just and it's to the point where she'll not exercise even though she's very active dog she'll stop on a walk if she hears a garbage truck anywhere and so it's a very low dose and I'm not I'm not necessarily saying go drag your dogs but I'm just saying that the story that I've heard is is that you get this period of plasticity where you can kind of rewrite some of these behavioral patterns and make them more open to training and so forth and so it doesn't even have to be a permanent thing right and I think a lot of these things like you're talking about learn helplessness study is probably transient if effects of not being on it for years or something but it's not very effective in terms of ssris but soloc cybin and psychedelics have shown a lot of Promise as being bigger effects right and these produce massive plasticity there's two things I think that are really interesting about it so my neighbor DAV by the way Davis I will just say I'm biased but it's one of the top three places in the world for learning and memory research so next door d David Olson it turns out is studying psychedelic effects on plasticity and and um you know so he really emphasizes that there's just these massive neurotrophic factors bdnf like all these factors that are going on that are promoting plasticity and you know for people who've taken them that's what they report is that there's this period of integration afterwards where your brain's just like you know you can feel it everything's you change you change yeah you change if if the integration is guided properly one thing that I do want to make sure I highlight and it's not just for you know public safety reasons although that as well is that people are so intrigued by the idea of quote unquote opening plasticity plasticity is just an opportunity for learning new contingencies yeah right just taking psychedelics is an experience but um certainly but the learning of new contingencies occurs in the integration phase as well as within the session that's why the clinical trials that showed some efficacy for some people were guided intensely by therapists but the mere Act of having plasticity plasticity is an opportunity for learning it's not the actual learning that's right it it opens up like significant opportunities for reshaping uh but the second part of it which maybe I think is is really interesting is there is also a dissociative element of these drugs so ketamine isn't a psychedelic but I think there are some interesting plasticity effects and and definitely it produces this dissociative element too but um with uh a psychedelics there's often a major perspective shift and perspective is hugely important for memory because a lot of our sense of the emotional impact of our memory is based on a perspective that we adopt when we remember and research has shown that you can take the same encoding event meaning like I tell you a story let's just take a very simple thing uh very you know I give you a story and it's like I tell you now viewed from the perspective Ive of someone else and you're trying to remember it you can remember things that you didn't exper remember the first time around changing your perspective can literally change what you remember it can also change the narrative that you produce so now let's say you pull up this traumatic memory but you're viewing it from the outside you're feeling your hearts racing your eyes are dilating there just crazy effects for psychedelic but you're seeing it and it's not you there's some Deeper Self you're feeling whether it's true or not or you have a sense of agency in there yeah some of this ad delics um I've never tried this one um uh but there are interesting studies of ibigan iboga where the universal uh experiences I understand is that PE it's 22 hours long it's actually a cardiovascular risk there's some things that need to be offset there so don't run out and do this folks but people I'm told get a highdefinition movie of specific events in their life that actually happened only when they close their eyes so no hallucinating with eyes open interesting and then they have agency within those movies and once they exact the change they wanted to have it rotates like a cube very interesting perhaps to a memory researcher why this would be and then they get another event of past where they have agency in that event incredible it's I mean you know there's so much that we don't know and I think it's you know and I I will say that some of the Psychedelic stuff is overhyped and there's not some of the science is quite bad in that field right now sum papers are being retracted now yeah yeah I do think that some of the concerns they had in the FDA I take issue with but what I will say is is that um you have a drug that dramatically increases plasticity but it changes dramatically the mental context that you have when you pull up the memory so you have a real opportunity for memory updating now there's a phenomenon in the animal literature called reconsolidation where essentially the ACT of retrieving a memory opens it up to requiring some kinds of uh um neuromodulators again to really promote resealing of the memory so to speak but it can also if you interrupt it you can erase the memories and theoretically if you can do that you could also change the memories pretty significantly so if I can vividly access some neural population that's giving me this normally gives me this physiological response it sets off this train of thoughts and it's associated with this physical and mental context and I can dramatically I can access those neurons but dramatically reshape the context and dramatically reshape The Narrative I've created the opportunity for massive change and I don't know if that's true but it sure makes sense to me that that's the case now having said that if you and me share our traumatic elements of our childhood I'm sure we could go out for drit and do this for quite a few hours right that in and of itself will also produce some change in our memories it's very powerful and I saw this in the clinic where I was doing group therapy with Vietnam vets and I'm like I'm a total fraud I'm like I don't know 27 years old 28 years old and I'm like in with these like you know Vietnam vets in their 50s who've really seen stuff you know and they live in combat zones now in Chicago and what I realized was everyone was telling their story but they're hearing reflections of their story from me but also from other members of the group who they can relate to that are different from their narrative and now all of a sudden what happens is the memory is no longer theirs it's a collective memory that's shared by all these people because the memory now incorporates elements of their reactions as well it allows people to remember it in a new context right and I mean and we can just take a much more watered down version of this where how many times have you had a terrible experience and it became a great story I basically say that there's no point in having a bad experience in life if you don't get a great story out of it right so I talk to the book about a near-death experience I had paddle boarding and as everything about this was stupid it's like the degree I could send you pictures of it you oh my God what was he thinking you I've made I've made uh foolish errors in um uh Outdoor Adventures in my past where afterwards I thought that was a really dumb move to even go to that location to dive let alone what we did when we did there like you know I mean the some of the stupid stuff that we did um even and as kids like bridge jumps and without testing water depth I mean stupid stupid stuff yeah um that I don't recommend anyone repeat but you're right the the uh surviving stories are uh you carry those forward yeah yeah exactly exactly problem is the other stories we can talk about people who are paralyzed dead etc those stories exist too yeah yeah and well so I mean to be clear it's like I felt horrible during that experience and it was one of the most immediately fear inducing experiences I've had but later me and Randy O'Reilly the computational Neuroscience were friends we both did this stupid thing together we would tell the the story tag team it you know we told it to students and friends and so forth and it just became funny and so each time we told it it just became kind of funnier and funnier and you start to embellish things and so forth and so that change of perspective was really drawn out by sharing and seeing people laugh and seeing people like what were you thinking you're such a smart person and you did this and and it becomes part of the narrative and you know keep in mind there are people who do this that they say like I had a really traumatic experience but I've learned from it I've had a horrible emotionally abusive relationship but I've learned from it right and I don't mean to trivialize anybody's experience who didn't have that thing and they're just traumatized by it and they carry it with them but what I am saying is is that the memory so to speak I think in Neuroscience right now there's a big Hot Topic about engrams as if a bunch of neurons is the memory but every time we have a memory we're painting a new picture we're creating a new novel well and I think this is where people have to be very careful not to um Cowboy uh post-traumatic stress disorder treatment in a way that um allows the narrative to make it worse because people um we previous guest on this podcast has this notion of um in describing this of of story fondling where people can go further and further into the description of how terrible something is reinforced by others and then the memory changes to become much worse than either the real events were or just simply worse within their body and mind and then they have to live that forward so it can go both ways which is really points to the key uh uh which is to do this with really trained professionals yeah yeah and it's it's all about like because you can retraumatization is so bad in depression is because you recall a negative memory and that gets you in a negative mood because you pull up the context and then that makes it easier to recall more negative memories and then every time you recall them now they're getting more power because they're associated with these negative mov so recollection is really a double-edged blade oh yeah yeah I mean look at like so if you take something like reminiscence or um Nostalgia so the original term Nostalgia I credit phelipe ad Bard for tell he's a philosopher neuroscientist he he uh told me that uh Nostalgia used to be a term for a disease that was coined by a Swiss physician and he used it to talk about a kind post-traumatic experience that soldiers had where they would get so wistful about their home that it just made them miserable in the places that they were at it's um been referred to as the pain of an old wound yeah yeah yeah exactly I didn't say that someone else yeah yeah and uh um so it can the research shows it can have very positive effects on Mental Health right and it can have positive effects on Mental Health if you use that as a way of saying hey this is just a great thing that's happened I'm grateful for that but it can become toxic if you're like my life used to be so great and now it's terrible even if it's positive reminiscence if you come into it with the wrong attributions it can become negative and toxic and it can contaminate your present right I mean the past has got good and it's got bad in it just like the present has got good and it's got bad in it and it's really all about what what are the narratives you're constructing for it in many ways and that plays a big part in the dynamic malleable constantly shape-shifting nature of memory incredible I want to make sure that we talk about something at first glance very different than all of this um but it land squarely in the conversation we've had until now which is your love for and your um participation in rock and uh you have a band right pavlovas dogs yep I actually have a couple bands now thankfully so okay what are the other ones called well so Pavlov's dogs also say ver is like a a band of neuroscientists and and psycholog neuroscientists who met actually most of us met at a memory meeting actually and so uh we get together at conferences and we'll rent out a club and we'll play basically uh we uh Brad calls it skinny TI music it's it's like is it original music or covers covers that one's a cover band covers okay um and so uh we'll play like the Ramones The Clash gang of four great um it's it's a a lot of we're you know we added Blondie and um she's still touring yeah she's amazing is a friend of mine went on tour with her yeah there's a band called surf surfbort was on tour with I know them yeah oh that's a friend Danny from surfboard know yeah the great band um and she tour with blondie Blondie's amazing she's still super vivacious as a surfboard and and um uh and Danny um what instrument do you play I play guitar and I also do vocals lead vocals uh yes or yeah and uh reluctant because sometimes it's talking or being off key but yeah can people find um links to any Pavlov dog live shows or recordings online I think we have some recordings on YouTube and if you look on our Facebook page um maybe our Instagram too we have live recordings okay and you have a show coming up put a link to that it's um because people will listen to this long after that um presumably that's coming up in Chicago on October I think it's the 7th is it a mon it's the Monday we'll put a link to that yeah sorry but for those that can't make it because most of us aren't in Chicago including me unfortunately um we'll keep an eye out for uh Pavlov's dogs um I love that you play music and I just have for sake of time one question about your love for rock and roll and playing music music when you're playing rock and roll live are you thinking about anything else sometimes and that's when I suck actually you know one thing one hack that I came up with because it's like with the cover I me we practice like we cram it's not the worst thing it's not space learning it's like we we go through the songs and we keep adding and taking away songs but it's like we'll cram for like I don't know about eight hours of practices over three days or something and so it's for me it's like a constant memory thing because my brain doesn't want to play covers it wants to play the songs that I've written and so there's always this memory thing it's and then I get nervous I get really nervous and so I move a lot and then that distract and then I'll see friends and that kills me because then I start thinking what are they thinking and so I started last show I did with Pavlov's dogs I wore sunglasses and it was great it was because then I wasn't attuned to them and I was it just goes back to what we're talking about kind of with the camera and stuff I was feeling it and I was thinking I was I was not I was in the flow in the zone and feeling it and doing it and not thinking about it and there's a whole interesting literature choking under pressure that actually relates to this idea of like you know sometimes having too much cognitive control going on is like really bad when you're under stress and if you know something fairly well you're going to be better off if if you just go into an automatic State I love that um when I do live shows I like to have the um house lights relatively dim I don't want to see anybody at first and then as I get more comfortable I'm happy to have the house lights come up you play I didn't know you I don't play anything I do live events where I talk about science where I tell stories about science and scientists um okay a couple of things are right in the front of my mind and I'd be remiss if I didn't say them right now first of all it's absolutely clear that we need to get you back here for more discussion about memory and learning there's just so much that we didn't have the opportunity to cover in this conversation but we most certainly will in a future conversation we didn't bring up the turkeys of Davis not the T no we didn't um second of all I I want to thank you for writing your book why we remember because it's a fantastic exploration of the modern understanding of memory um still some of the Mysteries that remain but um this is a field that's evolved a lot and and you capture so much of the incredible findings there over the years um in a very uh pleasurable way so it's it's a pleasure to read and then also want to thank you for coming here today to share with us your understanding about memory and also your sharing of your experience uh with ADHD and some of the tools you use some of the struggles I think um all too often people hear about these you know scientists or Physicians or people who are authorities on a topic and they um don't hear about the the challenges they face and I assure you that a great great many people U will appreciate the fact that you yourself have have struggled with certain issues related to attention but that you've overcome them at least as well to be able to be a functional parent and familyman Professor author uh now public educator dog owner a second time around and um you know for that and for a great many other reasons uh you've educated us and you've given us a great many practical tools it's also great to see you as a fellow punk rocker and old friend um and I even let you call me Andy so thank thank you so thanks for coming here today and please do come back again Char oh I would love to thank you

Title: How to Heal From Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) | Dr. Victor Carrión
Published: 2024-09-23 12:00:04 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. Victor Carrión, M.D., the Vice-Chair of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford School of Medicine and a world expert on the understanding and treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children, adolescents, and adults.

We explain why, as children, we are particularly vulnerable to PTSD and how stress and trauma affect the developing brain. We also discuss how PTSD is related to attention-deficient hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and vice versa.

Dr. Carrión shares effective therapeutic interventions for PTSD, including cue-centered therapy (CCT) and how to create a custom “toolbox” to help you identify triggers and manage stress. We discuss an emerging curriculum that combines yoga and mindfulness to help people with PTSD improve their stress resilience, mood, and sleep.

The episode will provide listeners of all ages with a clear understanding of PTSD and effective strategies to heal from it.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Victor Kion Dr Victor kerion is a professor and the vice chair of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine he is one of the world's foremost experts on post-traumatic stress disorder in particular the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder in children and adolescen although his knowledge and today's discussion certainly extends to adult PTSD as well Dr Karen is also the director of the Stanford early life stress and resilience program and today's discussion focuses on the psychological and the neurobiological underpinnings of PTSD and which treatments are most effective for PTSD we focus heavily on a particular therapy called Q centered therapy that was developed by Dr kerion and colleagues that has been shown to offset the triggering by words or events or memories that often are the precursors to PTSD episodes and this has been shown to be effective in both children and adults today's discussion explores the difference between anxiety stress and Trauma we talk about how those things of course are related but how they can be separated out to better understand if indeed somebody has trauma and how to best approach the treatment of that trauma as you'll soon see what makes Dr kion's work so unique is that it combines the psychological the neurobiological but also practical tools such as mindfulness it relates mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy to the underlying biology and what's known about the Psychiatry and psychology of PTSD at its different stages depending on the trauma the age of the person Etc today Dr Kon clearly explains all of that so that by the end of today's conversation you'll really understand what PTSD is and is not and of course the best ways to treat it before you begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity I've spoken many times before on this podcast about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts of quality sleep each night that's truly the foundation of all mental health physical health and performance and one of the best ways to ensure that you get a great night's sleep is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3° and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase about 1 to 3° eight sleep makes it incredibly easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment by allowing you to control the temperature of your mattress cover at the beginning middle and end of the night and it turns out the ability to do so allows you to get the maximum amount of Deep Sleep slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep at the different stages of the night I've been sleeping on an eight Sleep mattress cover for nearly 4 years now and it has completely transformed and improve the quality of my sleep eight sleep has now launched their newest generation of the Pod cover the Pod 4 ultra the Pod 4 ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity higher Fidelity sleep tracking technology and even has snoring detection that will automatically lift your head a few degrees to improve your air flow and stop your snoring if you'd like to try an eights Sleep mattress cover go to 8sleep.com Huber to save up to $350 off their pod 4 ultra eight sleep currently ships in the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by betterhelp betterhelp offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years initially I didn't have a choice it was a condition of being allowed to stay in school but pretty soon I realized that doing regular quality therapy is an extreme important component to overall health in fact I consider doing regular therapy just as important as getting regular physical exercise including cardiovascular exercise and resistance training which of course I also do every single week there are essentially three components to excellent therapy first of all excellent therapy should provide good rapport with somebody that you can trust and talk to about all issues in your life second of all it should provide support in the form of emotional support or directed guidance or both and thirdly expert therapy should provide useful insights insights that can allow you to do better not just in your emotional life and relationship life but of course also your relationship to yourself your professional life and all of your career and life goals with better help they make it very easy to find an expert therapist with whom you can build all three of these effective components of therapy if you'd like to try betterhelp you can go to betterhelp.com huberman to get 10% off your first month again that's betterhelp.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by waking up waking up is a meditation app that offers hundreds of guided meditation programs mindfulness trainings yoga needra sessions and more I started practicing meditation when I was about 15 years old and it made a profound impact on my life and by now there are thousands of quality peer reviewed studies that emphasize how useful mindfulness meditation can be for improving our Focus managing stress and anxiety improving our mood and much more in recent years I started using the waking up app for my meditations because I find it to be a terrific resource for allowing me to really be consistent with my meditation practice many people start a meditation practice and experience some benefits but many people also have challenges keeping up with that practice what I and so many other people love about the waking up app is that it has a lot of different meditations to choose from and those meditations are of different durations so it makes it very easy to keep up with your meditation practice both from the perspective of novelty you never get tired of those meditations there's always something new to explore and to learn about yourself and about the effectiveness of meditation and you can always fit meditation into your schedule even if you only have two or three minutes per day in which to meditate if you'd like to try the waking up app please go to waking up.com huberman where you can access a free 30-day trial again that's waking up.com huberman to access a free 30-day trial and now for my discussion with Dr Victor Kion Dr Victor Kion welcome thank you thank you so much for having me I'd like to talk today about PTSD post-traumatic stress disorder in particular in young people but also in adults but before we do that can you educate us on the definition of stress and maybe distinguish between short-term stress and long-term stress and then perhaps we can segue into PTSD that's a very good way of starting because in reality my main interest was the role of stress and the role of stressors and how stressors really would activate the gene makeup and make us vulnerable to things that we might be vulnerable um but at the time when I was training everything Psychiatry as a field was very diagnosis based so you needed an anchor and hence I use BTSD to communicate what I was really referring to but the reality is that the experience of stress as we now know is a spectrum from beneficial to not beneficial to traumatic so it really stress operates in our lives as an inverted ushaped curve The more stress we have the better we perform the better we do if we don't care about that exam that we're going to have tomorrow we'll probably fail so it's good to be so muchat stress right vaccines are a stress in the system so um we'll talk about this uh I hope but I'm very concerned also about the overprotection of kids to to protect them from any type of stress because it is through this experience of early stress that of us develop our problem solving abilities and we become aware of our coping mechanisms we become aware of our support system how can I manage that stress and we can we can manage stress because in the same way that through the process of homeostasis we process um we have a range of temperatures right in which we can live the same thing with stress we can actually cope up to a certain point after a certain point it's not homeostasis anymore and it turns into what we call allostasis when when it really starts having a physiological cost to the body so in that inverted U-shaped curve there's that optimal point where your health your happiness your performance everything is better because of the stress you've been having but after that optimal Point all of those outcomes Health performance start to decline happiness starts to decline and it is in that second part of the curve where we find traumatic stress traumatic stress being a type of stress that is not only something you have to cope with but it actually puts your physical Integrity in gibberty is a threat and and you have to manage that and when you experience traumatic stress many outcomes are possible one is that you're resilient and we'll talk a little bit about that as well I hope um but another one is that you may develop symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and the reason that I didn't anchor on the diagnosis right away from the outset and I was interest in uh studying stressors is because many kids we were seeing many kids that that had symptoms of PTSD without having the diagnosis that were demonstrating functional impairment so they were not doing well in school they were not doing well with their relationships they were experiencing distress right so their function was affected yet they didn't have have the diagnosis so the diagnosis is is good and that is there and and it it is a behavioral definition that we can anchor in but but there's more Nuance to that so then that that chose the whole the whole spectrum and of course we can come out of PTSD and we can go back to that optimal point so we don't want to get rid of stress but we just want to return to that optimal point and treatment is is available and and people can recover from PTSD and especially kids can recover from PTSD but there's one thing that really gets in the way and that's something that in my team we call uh we have a phrase that we say PTSD feeds on avoidance if we pretend that something didn't happen if we pretend that it will go away if we pretend that treatment is not necessary then and that that's when it gets complicated and he gets complicated with uh substance abuse he gets complicated with self-injurious behaviors and then at that point it becomes harder to treat is it also possible that PTSD gets worse if we tend to look at it um over and over again ruminate on it in the absence of any structured clinical support meaning if people perseverate on their traumas can the uh negative impact of those traumas actually uh root deeper into us it's interesting that you use the word perseverate because one of the characteristics of trauma when it affects children is that it robs them from play play is something that's essential in development is how we grow socially emotionally physically but when play becomes traumatic play it becomes non- joyful but it becomes pers and repetitive this is the attempt of the individual to try to make sense of what happened and the reason why it's not good to be alone with it and kind of perseverate on it by oneself is that we're probably not looking at the right insult so in our experience uh usually PTSD doesn't result from that one traumatic event we all carry a backpack and we can all carry all the stressors that have come our way like we were saying before but if you're five six seven years old and that backpack gets really heavy you can fall backwards and when you fall backwards that's because you don't have the tools really to carry that but what I'm saying is that that it is the accumulation of stressors some of which may be trauma atic that cuss the symptoms of PTSD so for example um some of us went to Haiti after an earthquake right and I was starting my program at that time I was very young already to talk about earthquakes and know everything about earthquakes it was the last thing they wanted to talk about they saw the earthquake as an opportunity to talk about the violence that had been experiencing the poverty the lack of education so they were talking to me about everything they were carrying that led some of them to develop symptoms of PTSD I see as you describe these other aspects of one's life that can have negative impact poverty violence Etc um I get the impression that PTSD can be caused by a single event or trauma but that there's a cumulative aspect to it so is it the case that in children because their brain is far more plastic we know this I mean brain circuits are modified even by passive experience in childhood whereas in adulthood it requires focused attention in order to learn unless it's a negative event for better or worse um that in kids it takes uh far fewer or less intense negative experiences in order to create PTSD because the brain is so plastic or is there a similarity between Youth and adult PTSD epidemiological study confirm what your assertion children we think we we usually you know one line that I really don't like is children are resilient because children are really not they're more vulnerable they have the opportunity to become resilient if we help them and we tell them what tools to use and how to develop and and all of that but they are more vulnerable to PTSD and part of it might be that neuroplasticity and and this is why we care for them right this is why we protect them and give them safety because they are vulnerable um by the same token that neuroplasticity can work both ways because if PTSD is teaching us that the environment can have an impact on biology that's the only lesson right environment can have an impact in biology in PTSD is a negative impact because of a negative stressor or accumulation of stressors but that also means that if the impact is positive as in a good supportive system or as in Psychotherapy that recovery can actually happen in an easier way before we talk about therapeutic interventions I'm curious about genetic predisposition and a topic that comes up a lot anytime the the letters PTSD are stated in that order um is transgener ational trauma I can imagine at least two forms of transgenerational trauma one is a generation of what are now grandparents or great-grandparents or parents are impacted by some trauma either in the family or maybe in culture or you know even broader scale and then discussions about that pass through generations impact the uh children and therefore their adult life I could also Imagine and I think this is normally what people are referring to when they talk about transgenerational trauma this idea that somehow The genome is modified by the trauma such that even if kids are raised by um parents that adopted them or they have no contact with the grandparents or great-grandparents that experiened the trauma that somehow they are more vulnerable to or in some cases the idea has been put forward carry that trauma put in air quotes such that their life is more difficult even though they never had a direct experience of that trauma what are your thoughts about transgenerational passage of trauma both forms both the narrative passage as well as the um potential for epigenomic or genomic passage of transgenerational no this is a very interesting uh subject the jury is still out if genomic changes that result as a consequence of stress can be passed from one generation to the other but certain certainly the genes that made one generation vulnerable are being passed to the Next Generation as well that we know so it can be passed that way um but what happens is that there's also this impact of learning and I have treated kids that come to me with all of the symptoms of PTSD and there's no trauma I cannot find the trauma and the parent cannot find the trauma and the kid doesn't reported trauma but when I'm talking with the parent the trauma becomes evident in the history of the parent so the parent has developed PTSD and behaves in a way that has been learned by the new generation ways like avoidance or re-experience or hyper vigilance or lack of trust you know things like that so certainly there are Pathways in which it can go from one generation to the other and and we know that the battle between nature and nurture is pretty much over right we know that that they both influence uh vulnerability and that they both interact and I imagine that's what's happening in in some of these situations in terms of stress you know I always think of stress as both a response within the brain and a response within the body and I'm not alone in that belief I I think uh we know that adrenaline epinephrine is released from the adrenals but also from areas of the brain like Locus culus so that there's this parallel effect of elevated states of mind more alert more focused on narrow locations in space and time and the body is also prepared for Action I think this is what underlies the increased heart rate the you know shaking in some cases sweating it's essentially a preparation for action with PTSD I often hear that some of the symptoms are more of the opposite end of the Spectrum in terms of autonomic arousal right things like dissociation fatigue um kind of checking out which I realize this dissociation but things that uh are more akin to kind of parasympathetic right for those that don't know the sympathetic parasympathetic represents the Continuum of autonomic interaction sympathetic having nothing to do with emotional sympathy it's all about um fight ORF flight type responses although at lower levels it's what's responsible for us being alert here but not in fight ORF flight and parasympathetic being more of the rest and digest even leading into sleep type responses so you know if somebody experiences a big stressor a trauma or chronic stress to the point where it becomes PTSD is there a tendency for them to be more hypervigilant and you know a start response um to uh have their head on a swivel all the time looking for danger or to be more dissociative or can the both sets of phenotypes exist in the same person yeah no this is very interesting well we're talking about the letters let me say that a lot of people call post-traumatic stress disorder post-traumatic stress injury not considering it a disorder but considering it something that where our fight or flight mechanism the autonomic nervous system has been desensitized and we need to regulate it again uh and it's going to hurt it's going to be painful it's just like when you break your arm and go to the emergency room and it hurts to be placed back in place but is the cure is what cures it so a lot of people visualize it I do as an injury rather than a disorder traumatic stress injury injury interesting and so what happens so these autonomic system gets activated we have our fight ORF flight reaction but what happens to a young kid because they're very little and they cannot fight they're also very dependent and they cannot flight so they're stuck they're stuck there so they freeze they freeze and that's dissociation it's actually during development a healthy um defense mechanism but very much like a white blood cell that's very helpful if you have too much of it you develop a leukemia you can develop dissociative disorders if that's the only thing you have but it does help children cope with some of the situations pretending this is not real or this is not happening to me is the only thing they have left um and because this arousal system is so key in the development of of this children um I thought that we should look at the hormone cortisol in in in the kids and and when I started when I was a fellow doing my shell Psychiatry Fellowship I was seeing all types of kids with all kinds of issues uh some had ADHD some had OCD some had PTSD symptoms but I was getting a lot of kids with notes uh from school saying this kid has ADHD please place on rolin right a stimulant medication and I'm like wow the diagnosis has been made there's already a treatment plan what am I training here for um but in some instances they were right you know the kids had ADHD but in most cases what happened is that that hypervigilance that you're talking about was being misinterpreted as hyperactivity and the dissociation was being misinterpreted as inattentiveness so the kids were getting a diagnosis that was not correct of course there are other very complex cases where you have both ADHD and pthd also ADHD can put you at risk to develop PTSD because you're not as attentive as to what's happening in your environment but there's definitely two different conditions and and it was that clinical observation that made me think well people don't know enough about PTSD and certainly they don't know enough about PTSD in children and we were having some research in adult around that time in terms of cortisol levels David Spiegel who you've had here raciel Yehuda the Bronx VA looking at PTSD in adults but I said but what how does PTSD look early on what's happening in the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal AIS that is responsible for secreting cortis and regulate cortisol uh when these children are young because this is a new access you know is is is it already not working or is it working right and so we did a number of studies that demonstrated that the normal circadian rhythmicity of cortisol was there it was higher uh early in the morning which we need to jump out of bed and as the day progresses it decreases uh very helpful it goes up when we are stressed like when we have lunch after we have lunch cortisol goes up right so that we can help manage the insult of digestion or or whatever uh and this kids were having those levels but something was happening uh in a number of studies and we noted that the pre-bedtime level was higher we were measuring it at different times uh in the morning pre- breakfast pre- lunch pre- dinner pre- bedtime but it was the bedtime level that wouldn't come as low as the healthy controls it would remain high and this was also important clinically because many of the symptoms these kids were having were happening at night anyes right bed wedding nightmares not sleeping deep enough not sleeping long enough um fears at that point I felt uh well we don't know anything other than the cortisol pret time is elevated right maybe they needed to be who knows uh but I was concerned about the work by sapolsky right and Bruce mchu and his mentor demonstrating the neurotoxicity that glucocorticoids can have in key areas of the brain areas in the lyic system and the cortical system where uh which interestingly enough have a lot of gluc coroy receptors so then uh we decided to look at brain structure and brain function in youth with PTSD symptoms and see how this cortisol would relate to that or not uh and we did that through MRI magnetic resonance imaging let's talk about cortisol for a moment it's a topic that has not received enough attention uh in previous episodes of the podcast I'm just going to summarize a little bit of what you said and you'll tell me where I'm wrong cortisol starts to rise just before we wake up in the morning assuming a good night's sleep and Peaks a maybe I don't know 30 to 90 minutes after waking for you slow risers like me uh probably a little delayed by the way the height of that Peak and the acceler the uh I would say the steepness of the curve can be uh increased uh by viewing morning sunlight we know this bright light increases that cortisol Peak it'll make you a better early riser but in any typically the pattern then is that it rises um through mid morning and into the early afternoon and then starts to taper off to lower levels and as you mentioned we'll see bumps in cortisol post meal if there's a stressor we get a disturbing text we get a bump in cortisol but these aren't huge Peaks unless it's a big stressor correct and then by evening cortisol levels in healthy individuals are typically low and that allows for transition into sleep among other things allow for transition into sleep but you said in these kids with PTSD cortisol doesn't come down to low levels as much as it does in healthy individuals um in the evening and nighttime and that I imagine would lead to perseverating on stressors from the day this kid was mean I have a test tomorrow maybe any stressor becomes more um intense in our mind and body as it were um and that perhaps could lead to issues with quality or duration of sleep which then could perpetuate this cycle do I have that correct correct okay so um has the direct intervention of just trying to suppress evening cortisol ever been done I mean certainly there are drugs that will do this um has that approach ever been taken I thought about that when I had those high levels but I I felt that we needed to understand better I I think I think yes that there were some attempts with some medications and I I don't think that led to anything uh in terms of of helping those kids um or just helping individuals in general that had high levels of cortisol because of of uh traumatic stress um but nighttime you're right it is a time when basically we fall asleep because we let it go and and this kid's hyper arousability does not allow them to Let It Go um so if these levels are high why as I was Finding you know what impact are they having in brain development and and usually the younger you are the more universally distributed receptors are so glucocorticoid receptors could be anywhere at that point but as as we age uh they become more localized and The glucocorticoid receptors and cortisol is a type of glucocorticoid um are more common in areas like the hypoc campus and the prefrontal cortex which I also found interesting because these areas relate to the symptoms right that that many individuals with PTSD have memory anticipation of the future problem solving context dependent problem solving so on and even those attention issues that make them overlap with kids that have ADHD as well um so this frontal limbic pathway the prefrontal cortex community ating with these emotional areas of the brain including the amydala which is very close to the hypoc campus um needed to be investigated in in in a pediatric PTSD and what I sometimes call Pediatric ptss because post-traumatic stress symptoms uh because as I mentioned there's a group of kids that have post-traumatic symptoms do not fulfill criteria for dsm5 PTSD but their function continues to be inair sometimes that's because um of comorbidity there's a high incidence of comorbidity with anxiety and depression so most of our studies that have look at PTSD symptoms also look at the impact of the interventions that we're doing in anxiety and depression as well I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens ag1 is designed to cover all of your foundational nutritional needs and it tastes great now I've been drinking ag1 since 2012 and I started doing that at a time when my budget for supplements was really Limited in fact I only had enough money back then to purchase one supplement and I'm so glad that I made that supplement ag1 the reason for that is even though I strive to eat most of my foods from Whole Foods and minimally processed foods it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits vegetables vitamins and minerals micronutrients and adaptogens from food alone and I need to do that in order to ensure that I have enough energy throughout the day I sleep well at night and keep my immune system strong but when I take ag1 daily I find that all aspects of my health my physical health my mental health and my performance both cognitive and physical are better I know that because I've had lapses when I didn't take ag1 and I certainly felt the difference I also notice and this makes perfect sense given the relationship between the gut microbiome and the brain that when I regularly take ag1 which for me means a serving in the morning or midm morning and again late later in the afternoon or evening that I have more mental Clarity and more mental energy if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer right now they're giving away five free travel packs and a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman to claim that special offer I definitely want to get into some of those interventions including some of the ones that you've developed that are very novel and are um being used to great success um I want to just circle back for a moment on this relationship between PTSD and in some cases inappropriate diagnosis of ADHD as you mentioned these two things can coexist in the same person um so we don't want anyone who has been told that they have ADHD um and PTSD or even just ADHD to immediately assume that that diagnosis is wrong based on what we're going to talk about but it is possible um that the a DHD that a child is told they have is reflective of PTSD and I imagine that if that PTSD arises through something in the family structure or dynamic it would be even harder to unmask because the parent perhaps would be less motivated to try and understand that if they played some sort of role in it so I realize this is a complex problem with a lot of layers but um if you were to just throw out a number based on your experience what percent percentage of pure ADHD diagnosis would you like to see explored for the possibility of a PTSD influence let's just keep it kind of uh diplomatic that way as opposed to saying what percentage of ADHD do you think is actually PTSD I firmly believe that ADHD does exist um I'm I'm going to say two facts that we know in the field one are kids getting over medicated it the answer is a clear yes they're getting more medications that they need for ADHD for for anything in general kids now in ADHD they're getting undermedicated so that's the second fact so the first one is that if we look at kids overall in the field of mental health those that manage to receive treatment which access is something else we should talk about because like 50% of them do not get access to Mental Health Services um those that manag to get it may end up uh with the appropriate treatment right a medication or a psychotherapy but there's another subset of them that will be medicated no matter what they present with because they need to be seen fast or is a fast solution so there's many reasons for that but are kids getting overmedicated yes but within those kids those the those that truly have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are getting undermedicated and that's because of that access issue because most of them we're not identifying and that's a Pity because the first line of intervention for ADHD is stimulant treatment it does work and it works very well uh for children that have the correct diagnosis but the first line of intervention for children that have a history of PTSD be acute or chronic is psychosocial it's a psychosocial intervention so if you give a kid that has PTSD and know ADHD a stimulant medication not only is not taking care of ADHD because they don't have it but it adds to that hyper arousability you know that is manifested there from before by the way there are clinical ways of separating hyperactivity from this hyper oability and hyper vigilance hyperactivity if you see a kid that is not medicated and has ADHD and they have the hyperactive symptoms and the hyperactive type they're going to be hyperactive for most of the time that you're with them the kid that has hyper arousability it will be more of an on and off phenomenon the the hypervigilance and Hyper arability comes more when they're presented with a cue that consciously or unconsciously reminds their body of the traumatic event or the traumatic experiences um what happens though is that usually we don't know what those cues are right so we just see a kid that sporadically becomes um hyper Vigilant or hyperaroused and then the other thing is is hypervigilance something that needs to be treated you know I I learned this from a mother early in my career she's like I was giving some talk in the community and she came to me afterwards and she said listen uh we live in a street that's very dark and it's very dangerous and my kid has to pass through that every day I want him to be hypervigilant and if he has developed this trait of hypervigilance this is something that could be helpful to him and I said you're right I said you're right it's not only to him to a lot of people it could become very helpful to be hypervigilant to assess the environment in which they are in so the problem is not the hypervigilance the problem is knowing when to turn it on and when to turn it off having the cognitive flexibility right to be able to say yes this is a dangerous situation and I better respond this way if if I can give you an example of of of a kid right a kid that experiences domestic violence and has Associated that with noise in the in the house house learns that running and getting into the room is is a safe thing for them because they're out of the picture right and they protect themselves in the room but a year later they're in the classroom and for some reason the classroom gets this level of noise the body without him knowing right uh the body reacts by the response that was helpful this is classical conditioning right so he runs out of the classroom but he's missing the context the teacher is missing the context when the teacher sends him to the principal's office the principal doesn't have the context right that this response was actually adaptive at one point and helpful at one point and the body has had a hard time letting it go to ask that kid to give us the only response that he has is not the way to help him we need to help him develop new competitive responses so that the experience of the other responses then extinguishes that response that was adaptive at one point but now it's maladaptive by the way if they are in a traumatic situation again we still want them to use it right we still want them to run and get out of there it's part of that hyper vigilance that that's protecting them in a way it's so interesting uh you said if I understood correctly that in kids with genuine ADHD the hyperactivity is fairly persistent across environments and with different people Etc I'm sorry to interrupt but if I could add the in attention comes and goes because we all know kids that have ADHD that you if you give them the right video game all of a sudden they become attentive right right this is a very important Point uh when I did the solo episode on ADHD I was um frankly shocked to learn but it was validated by the literature and certainly by the responses from the audience that kids with ADHD and adults with ADHD for that matter absolutely have the ability to sharply attend to something if it's something that's very engaging to them really exciting something that they typically enjoy but their ability to direct and maintain attention in other environments that are required for normal life progression school work relationships Etc is very diminished compared to those without ADHD so what I have in my mind is a step function meaning a you know an increase in a steady state of hyperactivity in a kid with ADHD but then a jagged line beneath that of attention this is I believe the picture we're I'm painting here but that in PTSD the hyperactivity is a jagged line it really needs a Quee as you said um a loud noise or um maybe it's the presence of a particular voice I once attended a um a trauma um it wasn't trauma release as much as it was genuine uh trauma Treatment Center out in Florida a friend of mine runs this Center and I was out there learning about the practices they use in order to inform uh potential uh experiments for intervention in my lab back at Stanford and um and he said something really interesting he said you know when you bring people into this sort of environment and they they've all had trauma you see a pretty rich array of of responses um to even just the same conversation and then at one point perhaps because he said that I I noted that a woman raised her hand and she said that particular tambers of voices in the room were really activating her you know this was important it wasn't just what was being said it wasn't that people were yelling at each other or even the volume of the voices but that even just the the the frequency the the lowness or the highness of the voice as it were was triggering something in her brain that was giving her these bodily Sensations and it was a very um important insight for her to be able to then start to direct interventions so I guess we all hear that kind of now um stereotypical example of you know the the veteran who experiences combat comes back and he's a car backfire and then they hide that's kind we we read about this and hear about this but it seems like it's much more subtle than that that sometimes the cues for this uh hyperactivity this hypervigilance is um very much linked to something that sometimes even the person with PTSD doesn't recognize until they start to be put into that environment again and again and then they can pinpoint it my question now is if they can pinpoint what the queue is do they stand a better chance of recovery um as opposed to somebody that just like feels like I'm hyperactive then I'm exhausted I'm wired and tired and and now I also Imagine That in kids they don't have necessarily the verbal proficiency to be able to express what's going on for them and in fact many adults don't really know because we don't have a great language for expressing this body mind thing in any event a lot of questions there but um what are your thoughts about the requirement for being able to understand what the cues what the triggers are in order for a child Andor adult to be able to start to make inroads into their PTSD uh first a word on the Vietnam veteran because there's a very important study that was published years ago that demonstrated that those veterans that had a history of child Mal treatment and went to war had PTSD at higher prevalence than the ones that did not have a history of child Mal treatment so child maltreatment I see so they were traumatized before they went to combat and and maybe they did not develop PTSD but once again that point of the accumulation right of of the stressors at different times and I'm just mentioning that because you may have a veteran and you're waiting to look at the classical cues where in fact it might be more like a voice like the example that you were giving that triggers them what triggers an individual is very personal so cues are usually neutral and they're usually related to our senses and I know you like senses a lot so what we see what we hear you know all of these things the senses are really the the window to the central nervous system right this is how we get information the first time so in this state of hyper arousability when something traumatizing is happening our senses are really acutely aware of what's going on and they are making sense of the insult but they also are registering everything that's related to that so these cues usually are neutral so they're they're not like a gun for example because a gun is not a queue it's a threatening it's a threat right but it's usually a color so there was a red car part near where they were so the color red made may be a que maybe a trigger it was raining the day that that happened so rain may be a queue maybe a trigger and to answer your question identifying those cues are important because they let you know when your symptoms are coming they let you know that they're not coming out of nowhere they let you know that you're not a problem or that you're crazy or that you're bad which is sometimes the messages that kids get when they go to that principal's office okay but they let you know that they learned themselves this is a normal response right I've learned through my psychosocial intervention I've learned that this is a Quee that triggers a response from me triggers a response that was helpful at one time and through classical conditioning and we do teach classical conditioning to the kids those respon has then become uh present become conditioned right uh when the queue is there when the triggers there so yes to answer your question it is important to know the cues now what happens are we going to know all the cues to everything to all of our behaviors and this shift in mood that sometimes we have during the day and we don't know why right no the answer is no we're not going to we're not going to know all the cues but the beauty of this is that if we can just learn about one or two or three cues what our response is there's more of a forgiveness to ourselves in that when we respond inappropriately we can think well maybe I was exposed to a queue right because I've learned all of this about cues and classical conditioning maybe that's what What's Happening Here Yeah I'm thinking again about post-traumatic stress injury the reason I like that term even though I realize I'm using it non-clinically is that if we understand that the autonomic nervous system the seawing back and forth or this Push Pull between the sympathetic fight ORF flight and parasympathetic rest and digest Loosely speaking systems are always at play in us when we sleep more parasympathetic when we're alert and calm more sympathetic and when we're stressed or having a panic attack extremely sympathetic if we understand that as a biological system which it is that deploys hormones and shapes our patterns of thinking and what's available to us in our memory and Etc then ptsi post-traumatic stress injury I I feel like it liberates us a bit to understand that yeah this autonomic system has been disrupted in a way and if I think about the autonomic system as a seesaw which I often do and I think about the Seesaw having a pivot point with a with a hinge it's almost like the post-traumatic stress injury is to create the tendency for that hinge to be too tight and sometimes that makes it more like dissociative and we're exhausted and kind checked out and maybe it creates the hinge to be too tight such that we're more on the sympathetic excuse me sympathetic the way I uh for those listening I'm using my hands but you don't have to to see it to understand that the the the alertness system is locked in place it's hard to get out of that and I almost feel like the the injury that is post-traumatic stress injury is a tightening down of the hinge with the Seesaw tilted too much to one or the other side and I I as a biologist I I just wish that we understood what that disregulation uh was or is um chances are it's not one location in the brain or body it's going to be a network phenomenon but um I feel like the word disorder the D in PTSD is so critical because it highlights the importance and the pervasiveness of this thing but that the eye in post-traumatic stress injury hopefully will give people it certainly is giving me some some sense of um uh relief or Liberty and understanding that like these are nervous system injuries that um need treatment and that there isn't something wrong or crazy with us because of because of the fact that we you know suddenly feel like we're having a panic attack you know I've had people I know close to me in my life say I'm having a panic attack like what do you mean what what happened like nothing happened that's the point well how do you sleep well it's okay you know and you start doing the the curbside diagnosis that neither of us is qualified to do right but this is what we do as as caretakers for each other in our lives and it very well could be that their autonomic system just got that hinge is just locked in place for whatever reason reason maybe it's one sip too much of coffee maybe it's one sip too little it's probably something or a bunch of things does am I am I I realize I'm getting outside my expertise here because I'm not a clinician but I feel like this ptsi thing is is is sticky and important for for people to hear about it certainly changing the way that I think about PTSD yes no and I like the visualization of your seesaw and the example of the hinge because it it it reminds me of that cognitive flexibility right it's not there it's kind of stuck it's kind of tight too tight and and in some individuals they just experience the dissociation they're like stuck on on the bottom right sitting on the bottom on the seiso whereas for the other individuals they hyper arous all the time then you have everything in between but but no I that's a very good representation of it and I feel like a good night's sleep allows some recalibration of the tightness of that hinge put differently anytime we don't sleep well or long enough we're not good psychologically a good night's sleep is good for everything we're finally at the point in history where we where everyone seems to accept that I really have to tip my hat to uh Dr Matthew Walker from UC Berkeley for writing the book why we sleep you know it was only a few years ago that book came out and um he deserves such a token of praise for that because prior to that there was this oh I'll sleep when I'm dead mentality I I think people knew sleep was important but they didn't really understand and he had to come out as kind of the um kind of the downer message like listen you know this is serious stuff you better sleep you better sleep but I think we're there now I think in in in 2024 we're there I think people understand and I think people have their own experiences with sleep right we we've all felt that c that's coming and and if we really sleep those eight hours we may be able to fight it because we've strengthened our immune system if we don't we will get sick yeah absolutely well let's talk about some of the treatments that you use and have developed for PTSD in young people and maybe we should Define young people are we talking about you know the 18 and under just because that's typically what we think about so in pediatric uh Psychiatry we have three different populations we have the preschoolers we have the school age and we have the teenagers and they are all very different they all uh have responses and defenses that are very different the projects that I'm describing happen mostly with the school age uh school age children so preschoolers are going to be essentially I think of kindergarten starting at 5 so you're talking about zero more to to more or less five or six years old as the preschoolers kindergartener and then transition Point correct um and then for the kids we're about to talk about we're really talking about what six years old until about end of adolescence yeah 15 and and and then yeah then their teenagers later on okay so I work mostly with the school age the school age kids and like I said when when we started doing magnetic resonance imaging to look at the impact of cortisol we have a number of studies really demonstrating that those kids with higher levels of cortisol had um less volume of the hypoc campus uh the first study that we did in that was cross-sectional and there was no difference and it gave me a lot of hope that there would be a window of opportunity there where we could intervene uh because what we were seeing in chronic PTSD in adults was that there was smaller volumes of the hypoc campus which help us process memories and have strong connections with the emotion center of the brain the amydala and also with the prefrontal cortex and um and what what we found was that cross-sectionally there was not this difference but we also follow a small sample longitudinally and there we saw a correlation between that higher preet time cortisol and the smaller hipocampal volume uh more impactful was a functional Imaging study uh as as many of your audience members now with magnetic resonance imaging we not only can look at the structure but we can also give tasks uh of memory for example or of executive function and different tasks that tap at the at the areas that we are interested in looking uh so when we look uh when we give a memory task and we looked at how children with post-traumatic stress symptoms were behaving compared to kids that do not have symptoms or other Psychiatry diagnosis we were seeing that the healthy kids were activating a lot of more voxels or units of the Imaging of the of the haboc campus so so there was concern here that yes that plasticity that you talked at the beginning was really affecting the development of the brain of the kids and then with the prefrontal cortex we saw something uh similar in the uh ventral medial area of the prefrontal Al cortex so but with other tasks right with tasks of executive function or or tasks of emotion um looking at faces for example emotional faces all of this to say that they probably have a malfunctioning frontal striatal pathway and front olymic so front olymic I'm sorry so um if we think of the amydala for example in close proximity to the hypoc campus being involved in this hypervigilance and we have some data to show that the amydala becomes active very quickly when you present emotional faces uh to young kids um and that that hyperactive amydala needs a a break of some sort that break comes from the prefrontal cortex but if you have a prefrontal c cortex that's not working that well either then your break is not working right so so then the issue came here well this is important information to know what we need to Target with treatment and can we target this with psychosocial interventions and the way that we provide treatment and we decided to begin with what we discussed earlier with the cues right and uh teaching and having kids understand what cues are what classical conditioning is um talking to them about the impact of trauma talking to them about the impact of treatment and how recovery is possible right so an educational an educational piece and something that I never thought I would end up doing was developing a treatment right I I felt I'm here to invest investigate and use the treatments that we have but it became very clear to me that there were a population of kids that still needed a form of treatment that was not out there so most treatments out there for trauma were targeting one traumatic event and not TR targeting that backpack that allostatic load also and rightfully so most treatments were um requiring that the parents were involved in treatment as well I can see where that might be problematic when the parents perhaps were the source of the trauma and also when there's avoidance right and also when there's practicalities that if they lose one day from work they're going to get fired so so sometimes the parents are just not available and the kids are totally ready to begin and do the work so I I wanted them to be able to do so so how can we devise a treatment that is hybrid and by that I mean multimodal that is not only cognitive behavioral therapy but that it brings other elements that are important like self-efficacy empowerment Insight oriented work and give it a structure that uh can be tested and that's how we created Q Center Q being cue Q centered therapy for kids that have PT D SD and we've had a number of trials with them and it it helps uh decrease symptoms of anxiety symptoms of depression and symptoms of PTSD and not only as uh scored by the student but also scored by observers by the parents and in one of the trials where we measure actually how the parents were doing parents that were not participating in treatment their own anxiety was decreasing as well and that's is it to understand right if your kid is doing better you're going to do better as well um so so that was very very good to see but then we wanted to see that plasticity too is this some doing something to the activation of the brain and that's when we brought functional near infrared spectroscopy into the picture because it's cheaper than MRI and it's more portable and it's easier to do it only gives you cortical information it doesn't get into those interesting lyic structure so it's um just to uh just highlight for a second the fmri fun functional magnetic resonance imaging is wonderful because it allows a lot of um uh Imaging both on the superficial outer parts of the brain but also deep into the brain my understanding is that and perhaps this has changed in in recent years that the um spatial resolution can be very good you can pinpoint very small areas if you have a powerful enough machine magnet um the temporal resolution the ability to see changes in the neural uh circuit activation and deactivation over time at one point was somewhat limited but now some of those limitations have been overcome but then what you're talking about near infrared spectroscopy is excellent because it can be taken to a school right you don't have to you couldn't bring an fmri machine to a school unless it's a medical school where there's the machine um it's much less expensive the downside is oh excuse me and my understanding is that the spatial resolution isn't quite as high as MRI but the temporal but the temporal resolution is very high which is a huge advantage and then there's this one disadvantage that you can only really image the outer portions of the brain but nonetheless there's a lot of information there right so a little technical lesson for people and these outside areas of the brain the cortical areas in the prefrontal area were helping predict which kids would do better only for those kids that were having Q Center therapy and another gold standard treatment called trauma Focus cognitive behavioral therapy when they were both compare to treatment as usual I'd like to take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors function I recently became a function member after searching for the most comprehensive approach to lab testing while I've long been a fan of blood testing I really wanted to find a more in-depth program for analyzing blood urine and saliva to get a full picture of my heart health my hormone status my immune system regulation my metabolic function my vitamin and mineral status and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality function not only provides testing of over 100 biomarkers key to physical and mental health but it also analyzes these results and provides insights from to doctors on your results for example in one of my first tests with function I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood this was totally surprising to me I had no idea prior to taking the test function not only helped me detect this but offered medical doctor informed insights on how to best reduce those mercury levels which included limiting my tuna consumption because I'd been eating a lot of tuna while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens and supplementing with Knack and acetylcysteine both of which can support glutathione production and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels comprehensive lab testing like this is so important for health and while I've been doing it for years I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive I've been so impressed by function both at the level of ease of use that is getting the tests done as well as how comprehensive and how actionable the tests are that I recently joined their Advisory Board and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast if you'd like to try function go to function health.com huberman function currently has a weight list of over 250,000 people but they're offering Early Access to hubman lab listeners again that's function health.com huberman to get early access to function I want to get into the Q centered therapy versus cognitive behavioral uh versus the uh no therapy um conditions you just described but before we do that I just want to have a brief uh discussion about some of the Neuroscience you mentioned because I think people will find this very interesting and um certainly not just a listing off of names of structures you said that the frontolimbic pathway is important here the limic pathway including the amydala but other structures as well and my understanding and I think the generally accepted understanding about these lyic Pathways is that they create a response State a state of alertness a state of relaxation that they um translate certain information that impinges on them into uh a level of reactivity either low medium or very high when I say reactivity a tendency to move toward or away from something or stay still for it put in uh broadly speaking now the fronto piece the feed the feeding in of information from the frontal cortex where context dependent decision-making and as you said executive function takes place is so critical for all of us as we mature even as a I would say if you look at a puppy everything's a stimulus and then over time they're not going to pick up everything in the room that's without question largely due to the development of these fronto limic Pathways and in children and in um in humans that is it's the same I can imagine that the signals coming from the frontal Pathway to the lyic system are going to be somewhat cryptic to people that aren't familiar with um Psych patry and Neuroscience so maybe we could just um throw a few of those out there here's an example tell me if I'm wrong um but the way I think about this is okay uh a kid is in a room and they're hyperactive and um or maybe something set them off and they're particularly uh Vigilant and stressed they're in the stress response the frontal cortex is the pathway by which an internal dialogue could be de delivered to quiet that lyic pathway the message that would perhaps trigger that would be the kid recognizing because they learned uh this is okay I've had this happen before it passes or I'm supported there's Dr Kion there's my mom there's my dad there's my teacher there's my friend I'm supported because we know social support is important or it's normal to feel stress every once in a while so these kinds of thoughts are these internal dialogues that we're told that we should do for ourselves when we're stressed I think we can be pretty certain that that's the kind of information that would trigger this front to Olympic suppression and can I comment on that dialogue because all of those are examples of positive thoughts right positive thoughts that are good uh but they're not automatic thoughts they are thoughts that need to be practiced right negative thoughts unfortunately that reside in our reptile brain are automatic so that hyper response I mean danger type of situation when we evolved right is responsible for our survival so we learn the negative thoughts very well I'm in danger I have to run I have to get on top of this tree the lion might come whatever so only 50 million years ago when we developed the frontal cortex more uh positive thoughts came into the picture and they're very helpful for all the reasons you're mentioning but they're not automatic like the negative ones are hopefully they will become so what I tell the kids is if I if they don't play guitar if I give you a guitar right now would you be able to play me a song absolutely not I have absolutely zero minus one musical ability but I love music but if you if I gave you a guitar with guitar lessons and you practice you probably will be able to play a song a year from now well me with some degree of proficiency but not but everybody else yes a support system a support system that's right and with enough practice hours and enough deter focus and determination I'm I'm convinced I could um become at least proficient um even at 49 years of age so we have a slogan in in my team which is practice positive thoughts all the thoughts you were mentioning are good ones and we have to practice them right this is what I'm learning no I'm I'm not bad this is happening because of the que even when the lyic system is not active should do you encourage uh your patients to practice positive thinking even when they're not in the stress response all the time interesting it's like it's learning a tool so in this Q Center therapy one of the lessons is that they have an empty toolbox and and this toolbox gets filled with tools that they learn and practicing positive thoughts deep breathing mindfulness all of this muscle relaxations are tools that we teach them but they decide and here's where the empowerment comes in they decide what the cues are they decide what tools they're going to put into their toolbox or they're not going to put in the toolbox and by far whatever tools they develop that have not been taught by me or anybody else work better when they develop it themselves interesting and you know I I I had this case once and and it got Illustrated really well when I I was in in one of the sessions you teach them breathing exercises muscle relaxation things that we know help and I'll talk a little bit more about how we know that they help and um and then they have like a week to practice and then they come the next week and we see where they are and what's in the toolbox and things like that and the next week when when she came she was much much better you know and I said I was very proud I'm like oh you've been practicing the tools right that we discussed last week and she's like no I actually don't remember anything you said last time but I I came up with this thing that when I feel bad I'm I'm drinking a glass of orange juice every time and at that moment I knew I could go both ways I could go no no you must practice is my tools or I could say how wonderful you've identified a tool that helps you to drink a glass of orange juice which obviously is what I did and then she was able to have that in her in her toolbox and and we have multiple examples like this so she would drink a glass of orange juice in order to quell her anxiety yeah if she felt bad and is this something that she would do even when she wasn't feeling stressed I mean it's kind of interesting it suggests and it completely squares with everything I understand about prefrontal cortical limic Pathways which is that they're highly subject to contextual learning right if any the frontal cortex is this incredible feat of evolution that um allows us to link essentially any stimulus with any um non uh learned response in the body right I mean this is what allows you know soldiers to learn to overcome their fear of Bomb Blast and run toward them if if necessary I mean I mean it it can cut both ways of course um but for me and this still needs to be tested is is nothing necessarily about the glass or even the orange or the vitamin C or anything like that it's about the fact that she has this message she has sent a message to herself I can take care of myself because the best tool that I have is me it's my own body whatever these kids go in the future there's something that's always going to be there with them which is themselves so they as themselves is the best tool they can have you know their body the the way they think all of these things do you think this is why we hear the uh kind of classic anecdote about the patient who has anxiety attacks whose psychiatrist gives them a a couple of pills of medication that can help reduce anxiety and they decide to keep those pills in their pocket should they have an anxiety attack and knowing they have those pills in their pocket allows them to control their anxiety yes because it it gives them a sense of control right and and they have control over this and some people may choose to leave them in the fridge and some people may choose to put them elsewhere but is what they decide is that decision they're making that gives them uh a sense of control that's important it's so interesting the sense of agency and control over the um non-negotiable stress response you know I sometimes unfortunately get um in my opinion uh incorrectly attached to ice baths uh we've talked about cold water exposure on this podcast our colleague Craig heler at Stanford Department of biology phenomenal scientist was on this podcast we talked about some of the beneficial uses of deliberate cold exposure there are a lot of arguments does it increase metabolism doesn't seem like it does very much is it useful for inflammation perhaps um but the one thing that everyone agrees is that being in uncomfortably cold water makes you breathe F faster excuse me and stress a bit in other words it kind of sucks it's uncomfortable and I think one non-negotiable fact about deliberate cold exposure is that it gives people an opportunity to explore their own stress response if they're going to do it safely right you take a cold shower you have some control you can get out immediately obviously you don't want it so cold that you give yourself cardiac arrest you know you have to be care care f with deliberate cold exposure but the adrenaline response to uncomfortable cold is non-negotiable and I believe that whether or not somebody decides to you know recite the alphabet or think about how cold it is or whatever it is what they're doing is they are practicing this frontal control over the lyic pathways it's just sort of a general exercise for controlling the lyic system through thought but as our colleague David Spiegel has said to me many times says um you know it's not just the state that you're in here we're talking about stress as the state it's how you got there and in particular did you have any control over how you got there and whether or not you can get out and I think that the kind of stress that you're talking about in post-traumatic stress disorder or in post-traumatic stress injury is typically of the sort that people didn't have a choice certainly these kids didn't have a choice about the initial exposure to the trauma or stress but that also the stress is showing up when they would least want it to appear or when it's very inconvenient to appear so this this narrative is important is an important part of of recovery um but we feel that it needs to come after the education piece and after learning uh a toolbox having defenses because sometimes it can get very charged when you go through the narrative and you want to assess many things during the narrative you want to assess gaps of memory you want to assess potential cues you want to assess the emotions that are present so and and the narrative should be one that covers not only negative events but also neutral ones and also positive events and and it sounds like a lot right but when you're talking about kids that have 10 11 12 years it is doable you know you can really manage it by the way with the cold showers I I think you're getting to the hinge of that seao I I think the cold shower probably does not the cold shower what do you call deliberate cold it could be from cold shower I always say that because oftentimes people think oh you know they're just trying to sell cold plunges and the truth is you don't need that I mean the fact of the matter is uh it's uh independent of income actually a cold shower will save you money on your heating bill I'm not saying everyone should take a cold shower I I love a nice warm or hot shower I sometimes use the cold shower as a stimulus and I hate it every time but I always learn something each time um by the way it feels great when you get out so that's nice and it does for many hours um especially if you end it with some warm water but the uh the learning I believe is in recognizing just how destabilized our patterns of thinking get when we have adrenaline in our body which is what uncomfortable cold does and it deploys that adrenaline in the brain and body and it also is a great learning in seeing the return to a BAS line just seeing how that affects our psychology and I I to my mind I can think of no other zero cost or even negative cost um meaning saves money approach that works the first time and every time you know that is safe enough right I mean I'm not interested in anything that has to do with snakes for instance I don't mind spiders I'll pick them up with my hands as long as it's not a black widow or a particularly large spider and I'll put it outside but I don't like snakes I don't like thinking about them I don't like being near them so you know there are other stressors that one could use but it's so individual whereas cold water seems to be uh pretty uncomfortable for everybody I think you need some exposure of snakes and you're cold no interest it's so interesting you know these things get so firmly rooted but I'd love to talk about this toolbox um because first of all it's according to your work and um this has been done repeatedly It's very effective and and I I love the idea that it can be customized so the words that come to mind is a customized toolbox for combating stress and PTSD and the fact that it can be customized and maybe even covert like we can have these tools inside us we don't need to share them with anybody if we don't want to but that they are very effective I think that those are very compelling reasons for exploring the uh the toolbox approach a bit more here so you mentioned one way to go about this is to think about or to have in mind some negative some neutral and some positive experiences and then to think about the different tools that one would deploy under those different conditions correct so so the exercise of the events is a Lifeline that we do separate from the toolbox we actually work on the toolbox first to identify um coping mechanisms and coping tools that help so what would that look like let's say I'm a a nine-year-old I come into your clinic and I meet the criteria for ptsi or PTSD um what sorts of questions would you ask yes so I the first thing I would say when you're feeling a certain way whatever way we're talking about right agitated anxious nervous uh is there anything that makes you feel better because the experience of having something and they bringing something is important too and sometimes they do they say I listen to music or you know I play the guitar or I go to play or my friends or my friends are my teammates mostly actually they say teammates teammates is pretty popular I love that yes there's something about sports and and and sports is something that comes up a lot when we do the toolbox people put in their Sports they're doing or talking to their coach or talking to their teammates or learning a new sport uh sports are big so that's an example that they give uh talking to friends um uh planning a sleepover uh listening to music uh different things like this are there any particular tools for um when kids are stuck in a stress response yes so because I I myself am familiar with um you know the toolkit that I use um certainly teammates is is one of them and I have others including long exhale breathing physiological size these things will be familiar to some of the listeners but certainly there are times when we're stressed about something and we don't want to be and we have a hard time pulling our thoughts and our emotions and the stress response you know out so the ones I just mentioned are are some ideas that the kids bring with them what we always try to do is we teach them uh exercises of relaxation we have to be very careful with this because like like you say it's good to be personalized right it's good that it's adapted to the kid and that's why we don't tell them put this in your toolbox we tell them learn it and if it helps you you decide if you put it in the toolbox or not so when I talk about the treatment being not so much about the what because there's many components here like education narrative uh that are common right exposure we we can talk about uh it's it's not so much about the what but it's about the how it's about empowering kids to identify those cues to say if a tool works or doesn't work to develop their own tools so but sometimes they are very stuck right and and they need a little bit of help so we teach them breathing exercises and we have a script for that we te Teach them muscle relaxation and we have uh something for that we teach them the positive thinking for example so that's a cognitive uh type of tool um and we teach them mindfulness because of our other work in prevention that we can talk about uh later in in which um mindfulness has been helpful and and and also yoga very simple yoga exercises so so nothing too complicated things like the mountain pose for example uh can be quite helpful for some kids if anything it helps them uh reassess the moment and and stop and if we're going to think about it in cognitive behavioral terms kind of break break that chain of negative thoughts that happen one after the other which can lead to a panic attack right that's many times how a panic attack can start well what's so interesting to me about the stress response is that while it's quick to start it's slow to shut off for logical reasons related to our evolutionary trajectory right um wouldn't it be one wonderful if you could stress when needed and then it would turn off when needed but what we're really talking about here is intervening in the stress response either before or as it's happening but then also making sure that the tail of that stress response isn't too long we're also talking about eradicating stress that causes discomfort right and is this causes this stress uh not necessarily to live a life without stress or to get rid completely of stress because that's would be impossible in certain cultures there are um accepted practices that adults use to deal with stress things like worry beads um and a few years back there were those what were those F what were the little spinner things that kids had um uh when those were popular maybe they're still popular Did You observe any reductions in stress um you know kids have a lot of energy like sometimes I think we confuse energy and stress um wouldn't we all love to have the kind of energy that we had in childhood um I was observing this the other day you know you'll see a kid sitting cross-legged listening in class and then all of a sudden it's time to move across the room and they'll just pop up and move across the room like when was the last time any of us like popped up out of our chairs unless we were particularly excited or scared as adults um just that immediacy to action um implies that there's a lot of energy in the system so I could imagine that having some ways to siphon off some of that energy through as far as I can tell you know um things like worry beads or or fidgets or whatever those are called I mean they might irritate some adults around but really they're pretty innocuous when you think about it I like that you're not calling it nervous energy because it is just what you said it's Just Energy it's extra energy uh that needs to be placed somewhere and they're trying to find out where to place it I mean we have colleagues that not all of them this is not a requirement for being a professor at Stanford but I've got colleagues that work 80 hours a week you could argue that's healthy or unhealthy depending on the context and their agreements with others but you know that requires a lot of energy and I know they are not particularly happy working less so you know I think sometimes we are dismissive or kind of um pejorative about you know uh physical energy and and shaking and moving but you know I I see I know someone in my life who bounces her knee while she works and it it's it kind of makes me a little bit nervous but boy does she have a lot of focus and energy you know so I mean I think it's wonderful in other words yeah yeah and and some of us you know choose to have meetings while walking rather than being in an office that's certainly my preference you know I go for a walk sometimes uh when I have a meeting so yes so there there is increased energy but there's increased energy that of of I feel like I need to do something and there's increased energy that causes a lot of discomfort so for this kid that kids that experience discomfort then they can look at their tool point and say which one I'm going to use and and that gives them also a choice which goes back to that sense of control again earlier meaning off microphone we were talking about the fact that some people indeed some kids have a different tendency to Anchor towards thinking or feeling or action when under stress and um you were describing the four quadrant system uh could you share with us this four quadrant system because I think it's both extremely valuable to children and to adults it's certainly something that I plan to incorporate into my life yes so we have to be careful with uh structured uh interventions because sometimes a structured interventions can break a little bit the fluidity uh of the relationship that a therapist and a child may have or a therapist on on a patient so it's it's better to be semi structure and to really be attentive to the temperament that the kid brings into that relationship or into that session and certainly with the toolbox as you mentioned we see an example of that we also add that in Q Center therapy by dissecting and examining a response so for example a child that breaks windows or child that screams or a child that lives the classroom running we try to understand what's happening at that moment and the way that we do that is by looking at a square and a square is composed of four corners and the Four Corners are what you're thinking so it's a cognitive side to it uh what you're feeling emotionally what you're feeling physically and what your are uh actually doing what the action is and and this is your classical triangle of cognitive behavioral therapy in terms of what you're thinking what you're doing and how you're feeling but but we felt it was important to add that somatic physiological component because for many children they don't have the vocabulary to talk about all of this they just tell you I have a headache or I have a stomach ache and and there's no other Medical reason that explains it right so depending on the kid that comes you're going to start examining their response through one of those Corners so if the kid is really brainy and likes to think about the things they think or don't don't think you start in the cognitive corner you know other kids are very attentive to their body and they say I feel my heart racing when when I engage in this Behavior or in this response and you start with that corner the beauty of this is that most of the time you don't have to work in all of the corners by just working in one corner all the other Corners change and a new response develops okay so if I'm thinking that I'm not in danger maybe I don't need to leave running maybe I can just tell the teacher I'm distressed by the amount of noise all of a sudden the kid has created a new Square that's another Square so hopefully we take that one response as a square and build a cube right of many potential responses so that when the Quee happens now there's an armentarium of responses and if I'm too distress to think what response to do I can bring myself there by using my toolbox so it it all kinds of starts tying together and then as I have more responses as I understand cues I can begin talking about this narrative that I have where I will fix some cognitive distortions hopefully like it was my fault I made it happen to things like no it wasn't my fault somebody else was responsible and I'm just a Survivor right I'm not a victim I'm a Survivor that's another cognitive distortion that can be fixed so so all of that we we've included all of this in a manual for therapist right so we have a manual for therapist that is called Q Center therapy for youth with post-traumatic symptoms published by Oxford but I believe that adults that want to reexamine their childhood or their history or want to think about their kids or are interested in trauma can get a lot from actually examining this manual and studying this manual and in fact I believe in so so strongly that we are um beginning the first first steps of adapting it not only for youth but also for adults in this four corner system and forgive me because I called it a four quadrant system but in this four uh corners of the square system you said there's thinking which is cognitive there are emotions then there's feelings which are somatic physical and then actions so actions are straightforward thinking uh would be for instance uh if I understand correctly I'm in danger um emotions would be I'm scared so it's a it's a a a a verbal label I'm depressed I'm scared I'm sad I'm yeah and it way is cognitive too right but it carries an emotion with it and then in terms of the physical feeling it's you know of the body but it could include of the head too like I have a headache or my heart is racing or I'm I um or something of that sort and then actions of course is the action that they an action is really fun one because you can imagine there are some kids that are not psychologically minded at all and they don't even want to engage in this with me and they're like okay what is it that I'm doing I'll do something different so they'll they'll immediately develop the next Square so they cannot things talk too much about their emotions or how they're feeling physically or look at the negative thought but they say oh is the problem that I'm running out of the classroom well what if I don't and they give you another action and and so some kids start with that corner so you can really start with any of the corners yeah I love that earlier you were talking about practicing positive thinking even when perhaps especially when one is not in the stress response or trauma response but also of course when one is in the trauma response I think that's just so vitally important for people to hear certainly for for me to hear um I'm not claiming to have PTSD it just but as a as a novel concept that I've not heard raised before you um around these topics the other is this four corner system um which immediately occurs to me is so powerful because it breaks down um the kind of reflex arc of the stress response into its component parts right what's of the body what's of the thinking what's of the thinking that's emotional and then what's the action and you said as soon as one um identifies one of these corners and starts to kind of look at it differently and consider some of the optionality that exists an alternative that all these other options Cascade from that and I believe that in doing that you've described what um for thousands of years really um but recently we've heard a lot about in the kind of mindfulness Arena as creating space right like like this notion of creating space not outer space but creating space within us to to uh choose better options is something that I think until right now as you've described this has remained unfortunately very mysterious you know people talk about okay you um you know you want to be uh reactive excuse me you want to be um responsive not reactive responsive implies some optionality to your responses reactive implies kind of a reflex arc of just whatever the default was but this notion of space is like too squishy for me as a biologist to really um to really be able to latch on to and I I would argue given the prevalence of PTSD and stress it's probably too squishy for me most people it hasn't really LED anywhere specific but I think what you're describing is the ability to become responsive as opposed to reactive um assuming that the word responsive includes like some options within it and so this four corner system to me is genius because it gives us an anchor point to start from so could you say that if a child or adult is um uncomfortably stressed maybe about a trauma but just as like caught in the stress response that actually pulling out a pen or pencil or crayon as it were and and write and drawing a square and and just really like what am I thinking like maybe it's just like this is terrible I don't like it writing down um I'm embarrassed like I'm not with my friends like I'm like not you know I'm flush you know my cheeks are flushing whatever um I'm feeling like just weighed down or something and then think well what what are the actions I want to remove myself from the situation at that point is the suggestion that one find what is the the point of entry that feels most accessible and to start there yes with one caveat we usually use um Wagner's um emotional thermometer to measure where the kid is at and it goes from like 0er to 10 or 1 to 10 uh with different levels of stress and and it's good to use something concrete because sometimes we think they are a 10 and they're at five or vice versa yeah we're very poor at assessing others internal states are as our colleague Carl dth who's also been a guest on this podcast I heard him once say this in a very large lecture he said you know we're terrible absolutely Dreadful at assessing other people's emotions in fact most of the time we don't even know how we feel yeah he he always says that and it's true it's true but I would say if the kid is at 10 at that moment the best thing is to use a tool from the toolbox and not to engage on the Square at that moment until they come down a little bit and they can pick pay attention and they can listen to you because then that they will be letting the information come in they're so emotionally charged right at the moment that that may not be the right time um which also by the way is the same thing as as when you need to talk to kids about traumas that are happening in our society right sometimes you just want to let them know that the door is open for communication you may want to talk about it at the moment with the kid K may not be ready but you can let them know Well when you're ready we can talk about it here the same when you're ready let's go over the square exercise or the example if the Kitt is already familiar with it or I have something to show you right and pick his C curiosity that way um but I would say use the thermometer to see if that's a good time right if if it's 10 98 probably not wait till it's like 543 and then engage in that so the toolbox should be used essentially under any conditions um and the kid should generate their own tools to add to the toolbox customize the tools and then the square can be used when they are at a slightly lower level of stress because it requires a certain level of cognitive intervention they need to be able to think about and and express their own State correct okay and is this something that you suggest kids only do with their therapist or is this something that they can do on their own as well assuming that they're old enough to to write and to think about it yeah well our our hope is that after a kid goes through Q Center therapy that they can internalize a lot of these activities and exercises and like I said become their own tool like like take those for life and continue to use them yeah I'm certain that many many adults not just children can benefit from these tools I mean I mean I would argue that most most of the bad things that happen in the world are the consequence of disregulated autonomic function put kind of bluntly Yeah by directional right kind of making things worse once they happen they impact the system even further yeah I mean I think most homicides are homicides of of jealous rage from what I have read I don't know if that's still true but and of course then that it's probably also true for all the things that are not as severe as homicide but still dreadfully bad like assault and things like that yeah um and and it's interesting that you bring that up because I often think about we we've been talking about how we experience trauma as individuals right but we experience trauma in our civilization we experience trauma in our history we experience trauma in our nation and how those in nation heal how does a system heal well the steps are not that different perhaps this is the appropriate time to um give you the opportunity to editorialize a little bit about um social media and online behavior um setting aside really aggressive online Behavior bullying and things like that which of course exists and is really serious um do you see the behavior of kids and adults online the sort of um just maybe even the the addiction to online um commenting and reading of comments and the kind of battling of issues back and forth it clearly isn't going anywhere some of it goes someplace functional but most of it I would argue especially among the adults is going nowhere it's just very circular it's my side versus your side my side versus your side and emotions get really stirred on there yeah um do you think that is reflective of um a lack of tools for self-regulation um do you think like what we're seeing is the manifestation of of just a lot of challenges in the world um and or an outlet for people to just vent without the need to address their own internal State and what's underlying the venting I I know many very very intelligent adults who eventually just had to quit social media in order to have any level of functionality in their life it comes down to that space you were talking about and building that space and creating that mindfulness time that you need which is also going to be personalized it's going to be different for different people uh this spring I was in Morocco and I visited the Medina was staying at the Medina and I was overstimulated as you can be and enjoying it but I imagine this is the state that teenagers are in all the time when they are with social media bringing them information and different tid bits and different things that are happening all over the place and very much like I found it restful to go to my hotel for a couple of hours before dinner uh people need to build that space people need to create that space what I tell parents is that it's important to remember that this was also a very helpful tool for us when we were in the pandemic right the kids were interacting socially Academic School was happening uh through technology so how can something so good be at times so harmful and I remind them about when they brought hammers to their house right and they had little kids they had to teach them how to use them this is a very important tool when you need to nail something or when you need to take a nail out this can be dangerous right you don't run with scissors you you have all these rules around other tools we have to have these rules around social media as well and and I and I think that's what the Surgeon General is getting at when when he talks about we need some regulations around it um but at the family level at the family level I think parents need to say there are certain boundaries that we are going to have for so a dinner time for example in this baskets all the phones go into the basket and that's what we're going to do from now on but it is very difficult because when you establish rules like that kids watch you like a hawk so you have to model the behavior you are expecting right the moment that you as a parent decide oh no I need to go to the basket during dinner because I need to check this thing out then it breaks so that's what I think I I think it can be quite helpful and and I think that it can be dangerous we've seen examples of that and and it is a tool like any other like a knife that we need to learn how to use it I think what you're describing to my mind uh is a situation where the tool has become the terrain it's like social media has become the landscape in which many people live as opposed to the real world I mean my original understanding of social media is that one would experience and do things in the real world and then bring those to social media that's certainly what I do I teach on social media and um I do the learning for that teaching the drawing in some cases the preparation in the quote unquote real world and then bring it to social media but I feel like the it's almost like the the hammer has become the um has become the landscape the house or yeah or something like that the hammer has become the house yes that's much more eloquent and and and appropriate um yeah I feel like with social media the tool of social media has become the terrain in which people are living in so that just feels like a um a closed loop is sort of an engineering uh example just like it doesn't go anywhere like you C you can never actually get the relief that you're seeking and I think we default to descriptions about dopamine and dop dopamine hits and there's some truth to that but the more I look at the literature on brain activation during social media use it it doesn't really speak to dopamine and reward prediction error as much as it does just sort of a Mindless compulsion and um kind of just P passive overuse as opposed to like rewards like oh this is so cool and that so cool I mean it can be I mean I've been watching some of the track and field races of the Olympics and there's a I mean I was cheering out loud for a few of them but it's it's usually something quite different yeah I I think if if you live in a virtual world all the time then you're not living right you're not in the real world so it's like how can you use the virt are there ways that the virtual world can help you live the current world in a better way yes so that's that's why I think it's helpful um but if you replace your life with a virtual life then that's a Pity that's very sad I see that in a lot of adults as well as kids let's talk about risk you know up until now we've been envisioning a a treatment situation or a study that you're running where a kid and perhaps parents as well are brought into the laboratory or clinic at Stanford and you're talking to them assessing them they're developing a custom toolbox and that's a wonderful opportunity for um kids who sadly have PTSD or ptsi um to be assessed and to develop tools that can really help them that's been proven by the work you've and others have done but what about the many many millions of kids and adults who are at risk either because of lack of access it could be due to finances geography poverty any number of different things or they simply don't even know what PTSD and ptsi are uh their parents don't know um what are some of the tools and interventions that you think could be implemented at the level of schools families or even individuals that might help them so here we were in my program we had created Q Center therapy right we develop a training program for it we have a Q Center therapy training program and I became increasingly concerned about my own staff and my own team because this is a team as you can imagine that are seeing trauma every day and are seeing trauma in kids I was worried about vicarious trauma and the impact that this would have in their health so I remember that when I was doing my residency I took a course in hypnosis and I was really struck by how much control one has during hypnosis so it's nothing like anyone is doing to anybody else is is is really kind of having the control to relax yourself self-directed hypnosis self-directed uh type of hypnosis and and I said I would like to bring something like that and I met a PhD John redger that was a yoga instructor and also a mindfulness instructor and I brought him to the team and and he had other things to do but one of the main goals was to take care of the team and we started regularly practicing yoga and practicing mindfulness as we were seeing all these cases and working with trauma and so forth and I was able to see firsthand how helpful it was for me personally and for my team at the time we were doing some work in East paloalto in some of the schools we're doing some prono counseling because this another problem many of the schools have no counselors right so um and this but this was a while back this like 10 years ago yeah the East Palo School District for those that don't know paloalto I guess it could be called West paloalto is a separate city and county from East paloalto pal Alto is not exclusively but is known for at least nowadays let's just be frank fairly tremendous affluence relative to most places in the world put bluntly um East paloalto a separate County different School District police system has for as long as I can remember having grown up um in pal Alto um has always been stricken with far fewer resources and U while there have been tremendous efforts to improve the um the situation there it is still at a um steep disadvantage financially um but of course um many uh amazing people working there and living there and um you know and growing up um there was some exchange across uh that um east palto west palalo uh border as it were uh in the school district but they're pretty separate domains when it comes to resources and it is not now but many years ago it was the number one murder capital in the US um it's also the place where Facebook is now so so in Ikea and there there's people that bring some employment to the area but also bring some other problems yeah that area where Ikea is used to be called do you remember it was called whiskey Gulch they didn't know for years a kind of terrible name right but it was a stark contrast to right as you literally cross the train tracks heading towards Highway 101 um in that case that portion of palalo Crescent Park an extreme of wealth to an extreme of poverty yes in in literally a distance of 10 meters and of course there are uh wonderful families there of course uh uh that support the kids there's a Ravenswood which is also the other name for is paloalto Family Health Center uh that that really provides a lot of good resources to the area and there's a good school district but at this time it was missing counselors so we had some presence there we decided to to bring some of the things that that we were learning in terms of yoga and in terms of mindfulness to two of the class rooms at the end of about 3 months I get called to the principal's office I have to go to the principal's office to because the principal was interested in finding out what was going on in there because none of those kids in those classrooms had gone to her office in all that time they hadn't gotten in trouble they had not gotten in trouble so I explained what it was and we decided to do you know a bigger scale uh study and and eventually we partner with a group called Pure power uh pure power inc.org uh developing a yoga and mindfulness curriculum for students at schools at that time we started bringing yoga instructors into the classroom but we we very quickly learn that the best approach to this would be to teach the teachers and have the teachers teach the students because the yoga instructors had no training on how to control a classroom and the teachers did and some of these poses were so Elemental that you know it was okay if they were not a yoga instructor so anyway we tested this curriculum and and there was a piece about it in the newsour I think it might still be there and I get this uh wonderful phone call by uh this family in New York that wants to see how they can help me spread this further into not only the classrooms that I was working but uh into the whole school or the school district and I knew at that point that two things were important not only that they wanted and I wanted but that the school district should want it and also that at this time we would need to do a very in-depth study to see what our intervention was and what the curriculum was because mindfulness can be the name that you give to many different things so we wanted to make sure that our intervation of yoga and mindfulness exercises that now pure power carries um is really what we're being tested so they were very very helpful in helping sponsor not only the dissemination of this curriculum through the school district but a randomized control trial where we actually had a whole other District that would also be trained but only after the study was over it was a demographically comparison School in in San Jose in in the city of San Jose uh near enough for us to conduct a study but far enough that were there wouldn't be uh too much um dissemination from one District to the other and it was good that we did a a districtwide control because if we would have done done it by classroom or by school it wouldn't have worked because there was so much diffusion of what the kids were learning into the their friends and their family and the other classes and the other people in the community that was beautiful to see but it would have ruined a control study so you needed literally physical and demographic separation so you went with uh what used to be called the peninsula the South Bay East pal Alto and then San Jose far enough apart that the kids weren't talking enough to uh blur the the treatment groups exactly so we demonstrated feasibility you know we were able to do it we demonstrated acceptability the kids liked it the kids would do it some schools actually had a a room specifically for them to to go and do it even if if the teachers were not doing it in the in the classroom and it ranged it was like uh twice to three times a week for 15 or 50 minutes of this curriculum in the in the classrooms can I sorry to interrupt but can I ask you a little bit more about the curriculum um you said five uh you you said or 15 to 50 5 Z minutes um two to three times per week and did the kids have to like change over to their yoga clothes the reason I ask is that um I could think of a number of real world barriers to getting something like this implemented I feel like going jogging usually you get a little sweaty you need running shoes you know there are other forms of exercise that require that less but um these days there as far as I know not every school requires physical education when I was growing up and through High School you had to literally suit up you had to go in the locker room put on your your PE clothes as it as it were and then you'd run or play volleyball whatever the PE teacher told you to do had to do if you wanted to get a good a decent grade um is the yoga being done you said it could be in the classroom or at a separate location but are the kids basically getting up out of their chairs and just right in their school clothes doing this for 15 to 50 minutes so they they stay with the same clothes um but we had mats they had mats every student had a mat and it's interesting that you mentioned PE because the first suggestion was let's do it during PE class and I'm like no that that's you know rowing from Paul to to Peter um until I learned that PE like you said was not happening so sad which I couldn't believe and if anything I think the study has helped for them to bring PE back and the classes which are these lessons and yoga movements and mindfulness were really taking place in the classroom that whatever teacher learned it so if it was the math teacher she was taking 10 minutes aside to do it if it was the p and B was not happening there they may dedicate the 50 minutes uh to do the yoga and the mindfulness so um we we have a a number of uh assessments that we did and like I mentioned yes it was acceptable and and it improved mood and and all of that but I think the biggest finding that we published from that study was that it increased 73 minutes of sleep uh 73 73 minutes of sleep that's EX extraordinarily high on average for for the students and it increased the depth of sleep so something that we did in the study was that we also did portable polysomnography and it was not in a Sleep Center it was in their own house so collaborating with Ruth oara from from the Department we were able to assess their sleep and and deep sleep is very important that's where you process the events of the day so these kids were increasing RM total sleep deep sleep doing much better and then another thing because of our previous studies that we've talked about in terms of brain function uh this hasn't been published but we have some preliminary data demonstrating that those kids that went through the intervention before and after the intervention uh were able to decrease the activity of their amydala which was very powerful and also very helpful so many of these kids adapted this into their daily practices after this study was over we went to our control group and and we taught those lessons there and um and now it has served to identified even more tools that we can put in the toolbox of CCT so so we utilize some of the things there in here so pure power and our program have been collaborating a lot because it covers the risk group and the treatment group so sometimes when we go to schools and we do trainings we um partner with them so that we have the yoga and the mindfulness and the Q Center therapy and and and I by no means mean these are the two things that everybody should be using I'm saying these are two more Tools in fact I think we need more development more development of interventions both for treatment and for intervention and how do we identify who needs what and and how is where we're moving next wow what spectacular results I mean 73 minutes more of sleep is like I mean talk about effective medicine you know I mean we agreed at the outset that sleep is the foundation of mental health and physical health and all forms of cognitive and physical performance I mean it's just me we know this the study done at Stanford albe it a small one of having athletes just get a bit more sleep or even just stay in bed a bit longer and know not on their phones but just lying quietly with eyes closed and resting or sleeping more improved shot accuracy in basketball players this has been shown in so many domains of cognitive and physical it's like not even worth spooling off all the examples but that is spectacular it also makes me think I should start doing some yoga um because I I do get enough sleep but that's significant what do you think are the barriers to having this sort of thing implemented at national scale and I always think about this you know okay so the results are in maybe it's one study maybe it's two but you're talking about a basically um harmless intervention and actually it's a very therapeutic intervention sure there are some people that won't be able to do all the poses Etc but there's always something that somebody can do um even people that are immobilized there are certain forms of uh believe it or not um uh cognitive yoga and and that friend of mine who works with people who are uh quadriplegic they can do certain things to keep nervous system function online but you know essentially anyone can do this um what are the barriers from taking it from this East pal Alto school to a study to another study okay San Jose school now let's say you get all of Santa Clara or um you know neighboring counties um you know what does it take to get something implemented at National scale so that the work can really Ripple out and benefit all these kids who of course are going to become adults well we need to prioritize it right we need to prioritize education to to for starters right we were talking about classes not even having physical education or arts for example uh and we need to prioritize mental health and it needs to start early and I think when we work our national budget it needs to be uh there needs to be ear marks for these two areas and that should go to the Department of Education the Department of Education should make this a a priority um teachers are really really overwork uh they they are under resource and like pediatricians many times are responsible for doing somebody else's work right everybody tells them oh this will only take a minute or this will only take two minutes or if you make this assessment you know you can do that but but it the time is finite right and the space is finite so they need more space they need more time they need more support teachers uh and then this needs to be a priority from districts to really Implement programs like this so parents and and even non-parents um talk to the teachers in the school talk to the principles in the school and I've been learning about the power of the telephone um for lobbying this has been around some uh things I've been involved with with the veterans community I mean the ability to look up and call your Congressman or congresswoman and tell them that you are really concerned about or excited about a particular program does have impact I mean I I at first I didn't think this was true but I realized that when they start getting 100 a thousand messages about a particular topic that people are passionate about they pay attention um maybe it's because they just want to get reelected maybe it's because they are genuinely um concerned about helping people I I like to think it's the latter but regardless of which they run those messages up the flag pole uh when they bring issues so so let me tell you what we just started doing in Puerto Rico I'm from Puerto Rico uh but Puerto Rico and Puerto Rico Puerto Rican students have gone through a number of natural disasters that started with hurricane Maria and continue with other hurricanes and and also with earthquakes and and this has led to violence and there's interpersonal violence so some of the cases in Puerto Rico have gone through a lot uh but also the whole island of Puerto Rico is one of the largest school districts in the US uh the whole island is one District meaning that if you do something like a program like the one we're talking about you can implement it islandwide um currently we are launching a project in Puerto Rico where all the teachers will be train in the yoga and mindfulness curriculum and all of the counselors will be trained in Q Center therapy the kids are being assessed at Baseline then they go through their yoga and curriculum and at time too when they get assessed to see how they're doing after that um we also screen those that have uh ptss postraumatic stress symptoms that cause impairment and then those go through the trained counselors and then they get assess again at the in the latter part so the the goal is for us to although we've talked about the two treatments we've never really uh have both of them happen simultaneously and we want to do it in a large scale like this because if if this works if if it's sustainable if it's feasible we can actually then bring it to other large school districts like New York like La for example and and start disseminating this I'd love your thoughts on something you know I'm so impressed that you were able to bring this from a study or set of studies to a much larger scale in Puerto Rico I could be wrong here but I feel like uh in the United States we have such a culture of Fame and popularity and reward around people who are extreme performers you know we hear about you know these NBA stars and right now we're seeing a lot about these incredible track stars and we're um or we have these Tech innovators that found huge companies they used to be called unicorn companies but all these incredible um successes and um I wonder sometimes if the hyper emphasis on these extreme performers has led to the conclusion in young people that unless you're going to be Michael Jordan or Lebron James or Mark Zuckerberg or uh Elon Musk or win an Olympic gold medal that the practices that feed up to becoming those sorts of people like mindfulness meditation or becoming a yogi for that matter you know I feel like the there's been a push towards hyp specialization and performance to the point where people are writing off the The Incredible utility of physical activity mindfulness um you know learning math science literature and the Arts you know talk about the Arts studies music right even for people like me you know I mean sure they always gave me the triangle cuz I could manage that one and I don't want to insult the triangle players I'm sure it's much more complicated than uh I'm giving the impression is but the point is that I feel like um there's been a uh not so gradual uh disintegration of the idea that there is utility indeed there's great benefit to doing things not with the intention of becoming a high performer but just doing them for sake of how it enriches us in a number of different ways including our mental health and I wonder whether or not the lack of PE is sort of a well if you're not going to run track and try and medal or something and you know or go to Championship meets then like what's the point but I I don't um I certainly don't subscribe to that I'm curious what your thoughts are um well I I think we need to redefine success and what it means to be successful uh I I think that we are currently describing it with the examples that you just gave which probably was not the way that we were describing it in the 60s or the 70s um but it it is harming individuals that which is most of us that cannot attain that level of uh proficiency in an area and in fact the individuals that are choosing to have a broader belonging in a way are more protected I I worry about those other individuals too that have that very personalized um not personalized but very very individualized unique component in their life where they dedicate everything to that one thing they trust me they they often suffer in one or more of their other domains of life some don't but I would arue most do but the the idea of belonging right is that you have you belong to many different facets of life um you are a sports person you're a community person you're a student you're a father you're you know an ant you're you're different things um when you're only one thing and that fails your whole identity is gone it doesn't even have to fail it has you have to perceive that it has fail and that's enough to throw you of course and so with the current definition of success we're not doing a service for those that attain that definition and those that do not attain that definition I think it needs to be broader I think belonging needs to be included I think the way that we care not only for ourselves but for the rest of our citizens needs to be included uh citizenship is important um so it is dynamic so far it has been Dynamic how we define success and hopefully it will change again I I agree wholeheartedly let's talk about resilience earlier you said you know kids are not resilient but you also implied maybe you even stated it outright that they can become resilient what is resilience and what are some of the paths to resilience resilience is a physical term right it means you bounce the coil bounces back to where it was I originally I I like to think of the word adaptation because it means not only you bounce back but you bounce back to a better place like I like to think that we adapted during the experience of the pandemic other than we were resilient of it yes we were resilient because we survived it some of us did not all right some of us have to deal with the grief of what happened during that time um but adaptation means that not only we go back to where we were before the pandemic but that now we've learned from that experience to be in a better place now we know very little about resilience and we definitely know very little biology about resilience we know that having a sense of humor is good we know that persever perseverance is good we know that the presence of an adult in a child's life that was there to give them opportunity or or to talk to them about things they were going through that's probably the the best known you know resilient Factor um but what if it's not the presence of of that adult but there's something in that child that makes them seek and maintain that type of relationship right so I feel that we need to start looking at the biology of resilience and one way that we've done that in my program is through a collaboration with Alex Urban from our department and from genetics and Caroline Perman who's in his lab and one of his post dogs um they work with organoids and I don't know if you've mentioned organoids before to your audience I have not but um uh one of my good friends and uh uh colleagues at Stanford Sergio pasca is one of the world leaders in organoids and we hope to host them on this podcast soon but uh please um educate us on organoids they are oh so cool and oh so science fictiony but they are also real yes as well so so we have stem cells that can be converted to any type of cell under the appropriate nutrients and environments that we want to examine uh so for a psychiatrist of course the interest is to turn them into neurons and not only they can grow in a Petri dish but they grow suspended so is it's almost like a 3D and and Sergio uses um the term asem bloid for when he actually assembles them further to create build uh more organ specific mini brains mini brains is the term that I like yes um so these mini brains are this neurons that are growing uh in a in a circle like the brain and they communicate with each other and they are active with each other and we can study so in conversations with Alex and now that you all know my previous work with cortisol and all that I was telling him and Carolyn well why would happen if we expose some of organoids to cortisol um and of course we needed to come up with oh what would be the right amount you know that would mimic trauma so we also involve Robert saoli to help us come up with a concentration that would be trauma mimetic and so we expose a number of organoids to different levels of of cortisol for some of them it was a trauma for others they were not exposed then half of of that amount or much less of that amount was a trigger the Q right so some had the trauma on the Q some had no exposure some only had the queue and then we compare what was Associated um with really um well the first thing that they needed to do was identified that these neurons actually had these glucocorticoid receptors and that they were active and they did have them and they were active so we looked through epigenetic analysis I wi is the Royal Wii right is more Alex and Carolyn they look at the genes that were change that their activity change because of this cortisol exposure and through epigenetic analysis which is the space you know uh between DNA and RNA and there's like methylation patterns and all that and some gen activity changes some turn on some turn off so interestingly the majority of the genes that we found there were genes that have been addressed in the literature as potentially being related to post trumatic stress disorder things like the glucocorticoid receptor genes and things that you would think of but there was another subset of genes that we identify that were novel and I was very interested in those because of my interest in accelerated aging because of stress and those were genes that are related to collagen formation and we know that atherosclerosis has been related to stress for example and as and we know that accelerated aging not only in BTSD but in mental health conditions overall individuals that suffer from severe mental illness chronically in their life end up dying 25 years Young than the rest of the population that's very significant and um so stress and accelerated aging interesting okay so these are interesting findings in organoids but but when you have those what you do is you move on to a population study so these kids in Puerto Rico that are going through these interventions besides me checking on their PTSD their anxiety their depression they're giving me a vocal Swap and in the vocal swap those epithelial cells we can actually take them through epigenetic analysis and see those kids a time one that even though they've gone through all this trauma may not be fairing that much worse as as their counterparts and compare them and not only that we can actually also look at response treatment response for the intervention for the yoga and mindfulness preventive intervention and for the treatment for the Q Center therapy so that's the plan that's the plan in trying to bring more light into what is the biology of resilience and how can we understand resilience better what a spectacular study goodness and if any of you miss some of the underlying mechanics I'll just quickly recap these organoids are little brains in dish that came to be by virtue of taking fiber blasts or other cells so skin cells essentially put into dishes provided four what are called transcription factors these are the four transcription factors that uh yamanaka won the Nobel Prize for identifying that reverts those cells into stem cells and then a few other goodies molecular goodies that then allow them to become neurons in particular then they grow into little mini brains and then as Dr k was explaining are exposed to cortisol at appropriate concentrations to mimic cortisol exposure in the whole person and then from that the genomes of those cells and the epigenomes are analyzed to identify potential targets the results are brought back to these kids in Puerto Rico such that the genomes of all these kids experiencing different levels of stress and yoga mindfulness interventions or not maybe they're in the control group the outcomes can be assessed and then one can address hey what are the genes that are protective against stress AKA what are the genes that are protective against high levels of cortisol and a bunch of other surely to be very transformative and important facts about how stress impacts the young brain to either give rise to PTSD or not I must say as you described that study I had three thoughts one wow how awesome is this that you can Bridge across so many different levels of analysis I mean because you're talking about molecular genetics all the way up to yoga in school children in Puerto Rico and PTSD you know it's just a complex disorder I was also thinking to myself um wow what an incredible Place Stamford is that such a collaboration is possible Right makes me Delight in the fact that colleagues like you exist and Sergio and forgive me the names of the other colleagues I'm not familiar Urban and Caroline Perman thank you and the third thing is how important it is to bridge across these different levels of analysis I think this is the first time on this podcast where somebody has discussed an experiment that Bridges across so many levels of analysis literally from fiber blast skin cells in a dish all the way to a complex psychiatric condition and in an attempt excuse me to create novel Therapeutics so it's just truly spectacular so if people are sensing a um even further surge in my energy this is the kind of thing that gets me so excited because in the landscape of science we often see a study or we hear about organoids or we hear about a yoga intervention and these things tend to exist in silos and isolation but the ability to bridge across these levels of analysis I believe is uh critical and so um yeah kudos to you for for being a part of this incredible collaboration and collaborations are key right because the world is so complex now that there's no way that a single lab could have all this expertise so you're right a place like Stanford allows for these communications to happen for these collaborations uh to happen uh in 28 years that I've been there I have never heard no I'm not interested in that how we say at at Stanford especially if two scientists um meet for more than 30 minutes what comes out of that is a collaboration as a final question I'm going to ask you to limit it to one answer but I'm sure that there are many um the question is if you had a magic wand and you could get any message out to the whole world about PTSD and ptsi in particular in kids and young people but also in adults what is that message what do you want people to know about post-traumatic stress disorder stress and post-traumatic stress injury the first thing that comes to mind is the importance of of listening and listening to to what kids and adults have to say about their experiencing and really creating a space for them where they or us don't feel isolated uh that they feel supported and that they feel that they can identify their own uh strengths and their own capabilities of of making themselves better um you know every everyone knows or has heard about psychiatrist and everybody thinks oh what would your Psychiatry say and psychiatrist have these smart things to say to people that help them with their life but the best psychiatrist that I know actually say very little they listen uh so I would say that listening to the experience that people have is is Key Well thank you so much for that and Dr car on vict thank you so so much for the work you do thank you for having me here yeah it's it's spectacular work um at so many levels um it's also very bold and brave work to tackle such a big problem with such um you know focus and to really give people agency this notion of a custom toolbox I think is profound to give kids and adults as it were agency over their own interventions in an effort to really help themselves um I appreciate you coming here today more than I can express I know the listeners and viewers of this podcast appreciate it as well um you are involved with Stanford clinically you're involved running uh studies clinical studies of you know great importance so for you to take time to educate us with these tools is absolutely spectacular and is really appreciated um please keep us updated on your progress and please come back and

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Esther Perell Esther Perell is a psychotherapist and one of the world's foremost experts on romantic relationships she's also the author of best-selling books such as mating in captivity and the State of Affairs today's discussion focuses on what it means to be in a truly functional romantic relationship we discuss this from the standpoint of identity that is how people both try to hold on to and evolve their identities within a relationship and how a truly functional romantic relationship indeed evolves over time from a standpoint of curiosity and Adventure but also one in which people need to hold on to certain components of themselves we explore What conflict in relationships looks like and the Dynamics that underly those conflicts so focusing Less on specific scenarios but rather the Dynamics that exist in conflicts in romantic relationship across all different situations and different combinations of people and of course we also talk about what healthy conflict resolution looks like what a truly effective apology looks and sounds like and we explore the erotic aspects of relationships comparing and contrasting for instance Love and Desire how sometimes those things run in parallel in the same direction how sometimes those run in opposite directions and and how people can explore their own Notions their own models of Love and Desire in order to have more effective romantic Relationships by the end of today's episode you will learn from the world's foremost expert on romantic relationships how to find build and revive romantic relationships that feel most satisfying to all Partners involved I'm also pleased to announce that Esther Perell has just released a new course on intimacy you can find a link to that course in the show note captions as well as links to her books her podcast and other resources about romantic relationships before you begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is David David makes a protein bar unlike any other it has 28 gram of protein only 150 calories and0 gram of sugar that that's right 28 gr of protein and 75% of its calories come from protein this is 50% higher than the next closest protein bar These Bars from David also taste incredible my favorite bar is the cake flavored one but then again I also like the chocolate flavored one and I like the berry flavored one basically I like all the flavors they're all incredibly delicious now for me personally I try to get most of my calories from Whole Foods however when I'm in a rush or I'm away from home or I'm just looking for a quick afternoon snack I often find that I'm looking for a highquality protein source and with David I'm able to get 28 gram of high quality protein with the calories of a snack which makes it very easy to hit my protein goals of one gram of protein per pound of body weight and it allows me to do so without taking on an excess of calories again I focus on getting most of my food from whole food sources throughout the day but I typically eat a David bar in the late afternoon when I get hungry between lunch and dinner sometimes also midm morning if I get hungry then and sometimes I'll use it as a meal replacement although not a compl s meal replacement it can get me to the next meal so if I need to eat in a couple of hours but I'm really hungry I'll E A David bar as I mentioned before they are incredibly delicious in fact they're surprisingly delicious even the consistency is great it's more like a cookie consistency kind of a chewy cookie consistency which is unlike other bars which I tend to kind of saturate on I was never a big fan of bars until I discovered David bars if you give them a try you'll know what I mean so if you'd like to try David you can go to david.com huberman again the link is david.com /h huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by element element is an electroly drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means the electrolyt sodium magnesium and potassium but no sugar proper hydration is critical for optimal brain and bodily function in fact even a slight degree of dehydration is known to diminish cognitive and physical performance it's also important that you get adequate electrolytes in order to stay hydrated the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium are vital for the functioning of all cells in your body especially your neurons or nerve cells drinking element dissolved in water makes it very easy to ensure that you're getting adequate amounts of hydration and electrolytes so to make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of both I dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I first wake up in the morning I drink that basically over the first half hour or so that I'm awake and I'll tend to also drink element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot and I'm losing water and electrolytes if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element.com / huberman again that's drink element spelled LM nt.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with the purchase of any element drink mix Again drink element.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by Helix sleep Helix sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are customized to your unique sleep needs I've spoken many times before on this other podcast about the fact that getting a great night's sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance now the mattress we sleep on makes an enor difference in terms of the quality of sleep that we get each night we need a mattress that is matched to our unique sleep needs one that is neither too soft nor too hard for you one that breathes well and that won't be too warm or too cold for you if you go to the Helix website you can take a brief two-minute quiz and it asks you questions such as do you sleep on your back your side or your stomach do you tend to run hot or cold during the night things of that sort maybe you know the answers to those questions maybe you don't either way Helix will match you to the ideal mattress for you for me that turned out to be the dusk mattress DUS us I've been sleeping on a dusk mattress for gosh now more than four years and the sleep that I've been getting is absolutely phenomenal if you'd like to try Helix you can go to helixsleep.com huberman take that brief two-minute sleep quiz and Helix will match you to a mattress that is customized to your unique sleep needs right now Helix is giving up to 25% off mattresses and two free pillows again that's helixsleep.com huberman to get 25% off and two free pillows and now for my discussion with Esther Perell Esther Perell welcome thank you it's a pleasure to be here there are so many questions and Curiosities and puzzles and uh challenges around the topic of romantic relationships but what I really want to know is to what extent is the decision to even think about being in a relationship of the romantic type A extend of our Identity or is it really a willingness to potentially Embrace a new identity and I asked this somewhat abstract question for a very specific reason and the reason is the following I think everyone who's been in a romantic relationship or even who just wants one is familiar with the kind of Yearning or interest or curiosity and then also with the fact that just like the development of our physical body it has an arc across the lifespan that a relationship has a sort of Developmental Arc there's the first meeting the first week the first month Etc and so much of what I've seen in your work and in the discussion about relationships in the public sphere seems to be trying to understand how we change in terms of what we want and what we ask for what we feel willing to ask for ETC across this Arc of the relationship but what I want to know is is the decision to enter a R Mantic relationship a willingness conscious or unconscious to actually change who we are in other words are we entering a relationship to just be ourselves and find someone with we go lock and key or are we really saying hey even whether or not we realize or not if we're pursuing a relationship are we really basically saying I'm willing to become a different person by virtue of being in a relationship I think it is both completely both we meet other in order to find ourselves and we meet an other and want to be surprised by the self we haven't known I think that all of us come into this world with a fundamental set of dual needs we need security and we need freedom and adventure and we need togetherness and we need need separateness so in the relationship you come in order to create that identification but also that differentiation it's it's a it's a dialectic all the time but what's interesting is even if I choose you because you represent sometimes the parts of me that are more challenging or that I disavow or that I prefer to Outsource so I don't have to be too vulnerable about them what draws me to you in the beginning because it is different that I think May expand me and make me change is also the very thing that becomes the source of conflict later because we want to change but up to a point not too much and not on your terms so we want change but we sometimes are afraid of change and so we let the other person represent the part of us that would want to change but then we disconnect from it so you can you become the represent ative of that I am drawn to the fact that you are stable grounded structured solid reliable on time you name it I know that this is something that I would like to be more of and just a very simple example but then I start to think of you as rigid because I get a little more than what I bargain for and now I start to argue with your rigidity and my desire to actually become more structured and solid and un punctual and reliable has somehow disappeared so if I understand correctly we seek out others in order to try and initiate the process of change that we want right but then when we hit the friction Point meaning the point where it challenges where we are that's right then there's a a form of um resent or frustration the reason defensiveness defensiveness you know what it is every system straddles stability and change and then grapples for homeostasis every relationship goes through that every every every system in nature goes through that but the same thing is true inside and individual we want change and we need stability and then these things sometimes are compensating each other and they are complimentary and at times they but heads so a very practical question yeah then what are the um necessary but not sufficient elements that some body should have in themselves before they go seeking a romantic relationship meaning um what is necessary in order to be able to embark on the process with any chance of success um barring you know extreme pathology right um assuming that both people entering the relationship have the best of intentions to make the relationship work in quotes yeah yeah is it both a sense of One's Own identity as well as what specifically they would like to change or is it um some other you know constellation of factors different ways to answer this um you know I think sometimes people say I I I I'm want to be with you because you help me become the best version of myself yeah you hear that a lot and so what is that version you know who is it that I want to see that I think you will help me become when you talk about these romantic relationships first of all I think there's a different answer if we're talking about Cornerstone relationships or Capstone relationships do you know the the concept if you don't mind defining the Cornerstone relationship is is where when we used to meet in our early 20s and together we build the foundation of our relationship we grew together we saved our first monies together we got our first places together Etc it was very much foundational stone is the foundation has already been established because we are tend to meet at this point 10 12 years later so during those 12 years I've already actually worked so to speak on my identity I have defined myself my values my aspirations my constructs how I want to see my life and when I meet you you're a confirmation for all of this you're a confirmation of what I've already built and I am putting you and me as the CH Stone which we put on top of what we've already created you and me you've done the same thing so I am looking for someone who recognizes my identity not for someone who helps me develop my identity from much earlier age so there's a developmental Arc that changes the Mandate I said it's both but the priority of if it's the building of identity or the expansion of that identity what you call change differs if you meet somebody when you're young and if you meet somebody when you're in in your 30s what happens when people are mismatched in terms of age I mean there is a big age differences a lot of the time and in gay relationships you have often a major um age difference that means something else but it creates differentiation in straight relationships you often have men who are a lot more a lot older than the women very much rooted in evolutionary bi biology I think and and fertility but um and now we have more and more a new phenomenon of older women with younger men but that's actually been very rare in most cultures so that's shifting now towards um more more often people are observing older women with younger men you know when you have four movies at this moment that are talking about this and you begin to see the the Crescent of a of a new cultural phenomenon I don't I think the fact that it appears in the Arts and in the culture usually announces something I wouldn't make it yet a phenomenon but you asked me a question before about what are the things people need I mean you know when you Embark any relationship it's it it's uh again it's it's I tend to think as both end on a lot of things I come to you with a certain self-awareness how much self-awareness the more there is the better and that self-awareness I think as its best translates in the sense of I you know I think a good vow to say at the time of your wedding is I'll [ __ ] up on a regular basis and on occasion I'll acknowledge it it means that a self-awareness comes within self- knowledge about your limitations your and your ability to take responsibility for it Without Blame and shame and and basically accountability I think accountability is an enormous component of relationship it's it's and it's okay we all do things you know we all have our wounds and our frustrations and our expectations and our unexpressed needs and our unfulfilled longings Etc but it's a good thing to know it and to admit it and to not pretend that it's not me but it's you you know I often say that couple's therapy I am a practicing couple therapist for almost 40 years and couples often come to therapy thinking that you're a drop off center you know they come to deliver their problem and their problem is their partner and you're going to fix it and they're going to help you because they're an expert on what's wrong with the partner and it's an amazing thing how people have tremendous Insight on all the shortcomings of the other person and do not see themselves as part of the system a relationship is a breeding living system of interdependent parts do you think that's perhaps one reason why people who are in these Cornerstone relationships of whom I've known many you know um even family members of mine you know met in University met their significant other and then had their first jobs moved in together all the things you described that there's this um they grow up together yeah and I think it probably happens at a stage of life when there's still a lot more neuroplasticity frankly I mean everything I know about neuroplasticity is that it exists across the lifespan but that it tapers off significantly in one's late 20s right and you know fortunately it's still available but the notion of being set in our ways as a neuroplasticity pH it's the closing of the prefrontal cortex pretty much pretty much font exactly takes a lot more to open that plasticity later than it does earlier certainly and yet it's um inversely related to the self-awareness right I mean the younger we are the less self-aware we are about our patterns because we just have less data over time so I I could see how it would be more difficult uh for somebody in their 20s to say Hey listen I I think I have a a good many virtues but I have this severe issue with something or this particularly frustrates me or here's my laundry list of issues right whereas somebody in their 4S or 50s um or older if pressed could probably make that list if they were really being honest with themselves so it seems like a good point you know so it seems that um there maybe there's a sweet spot but um that these earlier relationships I've I've always um been impressed by them and kind of romanticized them in my mind um because that wasn't the trajectory that I took a challenge you see when you grow up together you often put a not of energy into the building of the unit MH and that unit then is supposed to become your base your scaffolding from which two individuals can begin to grow and to Define themselves when you meet later you are already two individuals that have defined themselves who now have to find a way to create the energy to come together so it's a different Mo movement it's a different choreography I think that the challenge for young couples today who meet early in C in college and have known often only themselves and a few people in their teenage years Etc or nonone is what happens when when when they begin to change individually can the relationship expand enough to broaden the envelope to let these two people you know emerge individually or is the jacket too tight is the vest too tight and often that it it becomes a bit of a crisis it's because they grew they grew together by by you know on the basis of this togetherness um and sometimes they can and sometimes it just feels like is this the that in order to become adults it may need to happen with a different partner and that's why I always say I think this moment we have two or three relationships or marriages in our adult lives in the west and some of us will do it with the same person but the relationship has to change um it's like the person changes the relationship but the relationship makes room for the person to change this is dynamic if that just feels like such a true statement to me because uh in my um professional life as a developmental neurobiologist there's a saying people always think of development and then adulthood but all of life is one big developmental art absolutely correct and the great psychologist Ericson spoke about the different sort of challenges that people face from birth all the way until death which you know nowadays hopefully will extend into people's 80s 90s or even Beyond well his last stage is the generative stage It's actually an amazing I mean he's the the most articulate irti of stages of life I agree if people haven't seen those stages we'll put a link to them in the show note captions but the idea is that you're basically grappling with some basic struggle that you either reconcile or you don't at every stage so you could imagine that these let's say these three marriages let's imagine a couple that meets in their 20s and does three marriages which implies uh a couple divorces in between maybe not legal divorces um across their lifespan they really are according to the Ericson theory development or any neurobiological examination of brain development different people in their 20s versus 40s versus 60s 70s 80s so this notion of three different marriages to me seems um both logical and very grounded in what we know about the biology of the the brain and the self so um a good metaphor is rooted in science and and yet it's also kind of a radical idea when one hears it for the first time if framed in the context of with the same person it sounds kind of lovely and romantic okay they meet it's lovely they have their first marriage then there's some challenge they overcome they do a second marriage then some Challenge and a third marriage and maybe there's even grandchildren you imagine maybe even great grandchild there's all this kind of uh romantic Notions built up around it but then there's also the reality that for many people more than half there's a fracture of the first marriage and that they either remain single or marry again and so what do you think dictates whether or not a person can go through these series of evolutions and actually find and create love again and again and again either with the same person or with someone new or in some cases I guess three different partners I mean mean what what is the sort of um requirement is it a a willingness to accept this model and understand that who they are at 50 is going to be very different than who they were in their 20s you know a good question is a question that has many answers there's different ways to answer this um I think that more than thinking about it as they were able able to overcome crisis it's really the ability to redefine oneself and to redefine a relationship it's much more creative than problem solving you can overcome a crisis and put it aside and stay the same this is much more of a of a generative experience it's a creative experience is that you actually become a different unit the power Dynamic is different the interdependence is different the the erotic charge is different the the the the connection to the outside world is different it's it's really it's it's it's en liven the you know I think everybody understands the difference between a relationship that is not dead and a relationship that is alive I I am not there to help people survive I my work would is is about more than that it's about helping people to feel alive and the redefinition of having the same relationship with the same person it has to be alive not just not dead and if sometimes that alive means recreating a new you know going to a new person a new country a new city a new Social Circle a new profession a new a lot of things that we today have access to to change things that people did once you know when I ask an audience if your grandparents grew up in the same neighborhood or in the same town and worked in the same company I mean most people rais their hands and then I go down the generations and then now it's like how many how many of you have had three jobs in The Last 5 Years so this notion that we can create new things for ourselves is actually one of the greatest things that has happened in the realm of relationships we can have kids much later we can join somebody who has already had those children we can marry in our 60s for the first time we can live in a in a trip trism we can there's a plasticity if you want to use a word that you that to to the world of relationship today that is extremely rich and expansive but Demands a set of skills to negotiate to understand the uncertainty that comes from having to make so many decisions at the time with in the past none of us made decisions about most of these things they were handed down to us so that level of freedom is utterly rich but comes with a tremendous amount of anxiety and the man's maturity and sometimes couples have become so entrenched and so locked in their story and confusing their story with the truth and feeling that they're living next to someone who has a completely different version of the story that they cannot talk to like there is no greater polarization sometimes than a couple that once agreed on a lot of things that you just think there there's no way change can end enter this system okay so when I hear your answer um what comes to mind is that again as a neurobiologist I think the brain the human brain has this amazing capacity to focus on past present or future and sometimes two of those three things uh it's kind of hard to think about all three at once but it sounds to me as if one of the more functional attributes that somebody can have if they want to navigate relationship in a healthy way is to be able to at least temporarily discard with one's story about one's past and even their past identity and the word that was coming up over and over again in my mind as you answered was this word you used earlier which was curiosity and I'm wondering if what you're referring to is a curiosity on the part of hopefully both people in the relationship as to what the relationship could become and who oneself could become and my definition of curiosity is an interest in finding out but without an emotional attachment to what the outcome is this is what we train scientists to do you want to get the answers but you can't get emotionally attached to the answer Being A or B that's anti-c curiosity real genuine curiosity is about the process the verb action of wanting to figure out something but not being attached to a particular outcome and as you were describing of function trajectory of relationship I was thinking okay so if one could approach relationship with a willingness to discard kind of stories about one's past and maybe even a sense of one's identity of past be willing to let go of that a little bit and just be curious about like where could this go if I let the relationship guide my evolution of identity a bit and that takes some as you said some some boldness because if it's kind of scary right if you not knowing who one is going to become if they let the other person you know maybe lead for a while or um or if they were to lead for a while are these the sorts of dynamics that you're referring to I think you almost articulated one of the most important pieces of my work um I mean curiosity is one of the top words for me um because it stands in opposition to reactivity reactivity reinforces the cycle it just creat creates narrow repetition rapid in you know cycles of escalation it usually involves defense and attack and blame Etc curiosity is an active engagement with the unknown and I like when you say without the attachment to the outcome or the emotional uh investment I think that's absolutely accurate and um much of what I do is try to have people switch from reactive to curious but that Curiosity means that they're willing to enter empathically and respectfully into the realm of another person whose narrative is completely different I'm very invested and familiar with the neurosciences and the the whole work on the brain in relationships but I am very interested in narrative because I believe that the story shapes the experience and when people hold on to the story and they don't think it's a story they think it's fact this is what happened last night I'll tell you what you did I'll tell you what happened you know that's not the case you know and they don't see this as a subjective rendering it's totally valid but it's valid as your experience and much of coup's conversations is pseudo factual talk but it is actually subjective once you get that you can become curious once you are curious you open up but it is very challenging when people are hurt wounded defensive um holding tight to invite that Curiosity it's it's what's happening in their bodies is about shutdown and defense and self- protection and you want I'm doing this physically to you because you this is where the brain and the neurobiology in that moment is going against what actually is in their best interest psychologically and exist essentially I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens ag1 is designed to cover all of your foundational nutritional needs and it tastes great now I've been drinking ag1 since 2012 and I started doing that at a time when my budget for supplements was really Limited in fact I only had enough money back then to purchase one supplement and I'm so glad that I made that supplement ag1 the reason for that is even though I strive to eat most of my foods from Whole Foods and minimally processed foods it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits vegetables vitamins and minerals micronutrients and adaptogens from food alone and I need to do that in order to ensure that I have enough energy throughout the day I sleep well at night and keep my immune system strong but when I take ag1 daily I find that all aspects of my health my physical health my mental health and my performance both cognitive and physical are better I know that because I've had lapses when I didn't take ag1 and I certainly felt the difference I also notice and this makes perfect sense given the relationship between the gut microbiome and the brain that when I regularly take ag1 which for me means a serving in the morning or mid morning and again later in the afternoon or evening that I have more mental Clarity and more mental energy if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer right now they're giving away five free travel packs and a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman to claim that special offer I am a firm believer that when we are in a stress response that we become locked in a Time domain and not to spin off into aention about this no it's not aention you know put differently when we are relaxed we can think about time and our life and other things happening around us and others in a far more Dynamic way the stress response is about solving for the feeling now it has no sense about um or it doesn't allow us a a window into the cognition or emotions that are related to what could be even though we desperately want out of there and there's all sorts of evolutionary reasons why this would be the case of course but um I feel like a statement that you made um which is that a curiosity and a willing to discard with one's own narratives and in particular what you said about the that people perceive their own experience as fact when in actuality it's it's just two different stories neither person is correct um or one person you know but people have these stories which are almost confabulation at some point but they feel so true to all of us when we experience them I also feel like that's a lot of what's happening in culture at large people diametrically oppose camps really believe that the same thing is a reflection of two completely different series of facts and and it seems almost unsolvable at the level of culture there's too many people but at the level of two individuals I feel like it to be um tractable you know I have gone to a lot of meetings in the last year on issues of polarization at on on societal levels and and I often think like what is a psychologist or a couple therapist doing in those meetings why am I invited here and then I think you know what you actually have a lot of experience with polarizations sitting for a long time with couples who once actually thought in the presence of the other I discover myself now you know can be so at odds they're sitting in the same room they're listening to the same session they have a complete different interpretation of what I said and what it meant and they leave and you wonder did it happen in the same room the same thing is about what they describe about the night before it's like and if you didn't see them together and you saw them each alone you would be complet completely mistaken because it's like swiss cheese everything that one has left out is where the other one starts so we learn a lot from doing couple's work around the process of polarization of the around the process of intractable conflict around the this sense that you are my enemy and and there is nothing in what you say that I can recognize or be empathic towards or or understand understanding I think on a societal level the people who have studied intractable conflict um basically have a method and of how you bring two opposing parties factions uh tribes you know who have been in conflict and at War for a long time and how do you bring them together there is there's actually a method a process it's not it's written in stone but you know you certainly don't start by talking about the things that drive you completely apart and unable to talk to each other you start by finding some elements of your shared Humanity in a couple because that that is the the the space we we talk about now in a couple it's an incredible thing how you people can literally think that the other person wants their demise you live day in day out with some someone who you have who you really think wants to hurt you is your enemy and sometimes there are there is evil you know there there's people who don't have good intentions but in many situations it's it's a it's also a projection it's also experiences that you've had in the past and this is where what's interesting is that the narrative the conscious narrative lives here and the what you call the brain that can only locate it itself in three temporal and the brain and the physiology are in a different time implicit memory is completely influencing explicit narrative yeah people are incredibly prone to confabulation based on these unconscious things going on and it it's kind of a scary thought if I feel it this is what's happening that's right right and because we are creatures of meaning we need to reconcile those things and we need coherence in our narratives and that coherence is what is so difficult for when when you work with people who are hold what is it that they're holding on to I mean you know one of the classic examples is some you know someone says I'm really sorry I didn't mean to and the other one says that's not the case you know like if someone tells you I didn't mean to hurt you you would think that someone would say Ah that's reassuring I like to hear that I hope that's true um makes me feel a lot better rather than proving to you that that's not true you wanted to step on my toes you you intentionally put those heels on or those shoes or you know those fists to to to to step on me and that coherence of maintaining the idea that if I feel that you hurt me you must have been wanting to hurt me rather than you know I can be hurt and that doesn't mean you intentionally were trying to do anything it's as if I need to justify my being hurt by the by the intention of what you did and to just make sure sometimes that's the case it's not that there are not people who intentionally want to hurt some people but at other times what I'm highlighting is that the coherence to make sense of why I'm feeling this way demands that I also Define what you are trying to do to me I mean and in reality um most people are terrible at understanding how they themselves feel let alone someone else's intentions I mean if somebody apologizes and says listen I'm I'm truly sorry I screwed up and the other person says um I don't believe you I think what they're really saying you can tell me if I'm wrong is I don't feel better as a consequence of your apology that's because your apology I screwed up is incomplete most of the time people say that I made a mistake I'm sorry and but it doesn't acknowledge what the other person felt in response to what we did so let's say that the apology also includes that I you know I really messed up it makes total sense that you would be upset you know we had an agreement that we would meet at 7 and I didn't get home until 9: and I didn't notify you until 8: I would be upset too that's totally justified that sucks that's got to really suck at that point if the other person still feels like it's still frustrating um presumably it's because either this is a pattern um so this doesn't this one apology doesn't encapsulate all the other the the the sort of litany of other things that relate to this of feeling unseen or unappreciated or you know there's often a lot more behind this the event apologize many times right um or yeah it could be a pattern of apologies that don't equate to change or it could be a pattern of an apology that um doesn't encapsulate all the other things that weren't voiced because sometimes people won't voice their grievances at because they for whatever reason but there's a lot of resent that's built up right so in that moment when somebody um tells another that they are um not convinced emotionally convinced uh what what are the tools that you give each in order to be able to navigate that stick taking point I think apology is an amazing Topic in the realm of relationship it's a huge piece apology forgiveness ownership responsibility accountability that whole range of things I think if you give that apology many times somebody and and it's not yet you're doing this every Tuesday the person will probably just say thank you if you have someone who can't receive an apology and the apology is sincere that's the first and foremost thing that accompanies an apology then you begin to ask why is this person struggling to receive this because it is the thing that you should be getting and then you start to ask yourself is it because if I AC accept your apology it's as if I agree that what you did wasn't so bad it is repairable and in order to really make clear that a grievance is big I cannot receive your apology that's one of the Dynamics that often occurs in that moment and and so you ask sometimes you know you sit and you see you see somebody who pretends to say I'm sorry you see somebody who just says come on what's the big deal and then you see people who really are are sincere and then you watch what's happening to the other person are they relieved are they suspicious are they feeling like they would they would dissolve a certain element of their identity if they don't hold on to this um is it as if they're saying you know you can get away with it you know it's not as bad because accepting the apology is to minimize the issue and then you switch burn on the other side you know in in Judaism you apologize three times and if after the third time and you've done a real Reckoning apology if at the three time the other person does not accept it the burden passes over to the other person interesting this is my money des and I think it's an incredibly interesting idea that at some point the person has made the amends when they have and and when you cannot receive it then now the burden passes on you I'm just going to hover there for a second because I agree that apology is such an interesting and important concept and you mentioned that accepting somebody's apology at an emotional level not just saying thank you I accept your apology but really internalizing that and allowing space for it to shift your experience of the the thing that hurt and by the way accepting the apology doesn't yet yet mean that you forgive forgive is your freedom you decide at what point you do it and you may do it alone it's not always a diic experience apology is a diic experience but forgiveness is freedom yeah I appreciate that distinction um now that you've given it I mean I appreciate you giving that distinction I did not uh make that love this topic because it's so it's really so many things happen underneath you know there's issues of Shame around apology what's the difference between shame and responsibility what is the capacity of a person to have real distress rather than empathic distress real empathy rather than empathic distress so it it's a a portal into a lot of things you know they're people who can never apologize is that right oh yeah because to do so would what for them shame I think a lot of that pieces around shame it's not I'm because self esteem as as my friend ter says is your ability to see yourself as a flawed individual and still hold yourself in high regard when you admit your flaw it means there's something wrong with you then it's very hard to say I'm sorry this is the essence how do you see yourself as imperfect flawed but you still respect yourself and you hold yourself in high regard if you can do those two things you can apologize very easily I find that so much of being an adult again in quotes yes yes you would hope uh involves um the disambiguating two things uh one is we're taught to really trust our own experience to some extent to stand our ground when we know a is true and B is false but then also part of being an adult is admitting when we're wrong and um and there's no rulebook no real-time rulebook for that especially given that people have different versions of the same thing often but it seems to me that one of the great challenges in not just in romantic relationship but in relationships of all kinds is to really be able to slow down and enter the state of mind and body that allows us to do the kind of processing you're talking about so at a very practical level I'm curious let's say a couple comes into your office and they're dealing with um a either a single hurt or a Litany of hurts or something like that do you m uh believe it's important for them to shift out of their emotional state to be able to process differently do you have them at the beginning of a session do you have them do a couple deep breaths together do you have them recall a time when they felt particularly bonded is there an effort to shift their somatic state in order to bring their mind to a place of more curiosity or is going straight to the issue often the best way in first of all I like that we that it's interesting we going from apology to conflict it makes total sense I I spent the last year creating a whole course on conflict and how do you turn conflict into connection beautiful what is good conflict you know I think conflict is inherent to relationships and then what are problematic ways to deal with conflict yes on some level you there is very little you can hear if you are in a state of hyperarousal if you are in a position of self- protection I mean all these stressful places all these cortisol levels going up Etc are not going to help you but at the same time you can't in the moment that someone is uh completely agitated talked with them about trusting it's just like the physiology is not corresponding so it's a it's a real dance um I don't do the breath often sometimes I I actually don't do anything all the time I I I'm working like a tailor I do fittings I I mean I think the richness of therapy is is is in its art on some level let maybe um but sometimes I just say I think you need to stand up and move and just listen to what your partner has to say but don't sit sometimes I say don't look at each other sometimes I say turn to each other some things are better done face to face and some things are better done side by side you know parallel play fishing there's a lot of like you know driving every parent who's ever had a kid in the back knows this the the you don't you have both you have moments when you need to be able to look into each other and then in moments where you just need to do this something about the side by side then it's also the limits of words when is it important to talk and when you know we're talking because we are Homo sapiens but in fact if we were animals we would be just making noises we're not really making sense so stop talking so what I try very hard to do is to not let people show the worst side of themselves they can do that at home they don't need to come and shame themselves in my office and I do know that certain situations will draw the worst out of people but that doesn't mean that that's who they are and that's one of the big things as a therapist is to to not fall for that and just because if you met these people alone they would be charming and if you had met them maybe two years before they would have been Charming too so something's happening between them that is making them act and react from places of deep hurt and fear and attack and all of that and aggression and sometimes I see them alone I don't think that you are capable of having this conversation at this moment because you're not willing to take any responsibility when you're sitting next to your partner you're in a blame Fest we're not going to do that so I'm going to talk with you alone and then I'm going to prepare you to come to your partner with at least one or two things that you can own what am I doing to contribute to this mess or what am I doing to make things better I like to start a session by asking what did you and if I'm dealing with a kind of chronic conflict low intensity Warfare or bigger depends what kind no there's different kinds of but I like to ask what have you done this week to make things better what a great question what have you done to make your partner feel that they matter rather than what happened this week you know know I I kind of have a sense please do not tell me the last unraveling you know I got it it goes from one from 0 to 60 no time and none of this I I don't need the details of the story I need to know what you're doing to each other what feelings you're instigating in each other I don't need the plot I the plot is you know there's only three dances this fight you know aiming at each other withdrawing from each each other or one person withdrawing and one person pursuing those are three types of major choreographies of conflict or quiet silence or one goes after the other who is closing the doors and they follow them through the house which is following them to a lot of other things and from that place on you decide okay who is doing what to whom who is feeling what at the hands of whom how what is influencing this you know um this person is once again feeling that when this one didn't talk to them they were being given the silent treatment that they used to feel when they grow up and um and then and this feeling of neglect and and dismissal is just crushing them because they suddenly feel like they've been rejected completely and this one is feeling like they're once again being attacked and invaded by this other person who keeps following them and wants to talk when they have and is remembering when they were living in the place where they grew up where they couldn't wait for to get out because they were feeling completely flooded and overwhelmed by the [ __ ] show of their house and these two stories are now dictating what's happening between these two people these two people are no longer adults in the room their younger selves have completely taken over their amigdala is completely flooded and then and then it matter it depends sometimes because I'm a little bit narrative driven I may make the mistake to actually go to the story when in fact these two people really put some times I sit for 10 minutes quiet I say we're going to just wait for for our systems to regulate because even I get agitated it's not like it doesn't absorb I don't absorb it I say I think we need some sitting here sometimes I put music I love music so I put music you know um I just say I don't think a single word is going to help here and sometimes I say I think we should stop the session I mean it depends if you think there's something that can be gained if you start to feel like it's just going to make it worse and sometimes I in the middle of the session may say when's the last time you made him a cup of tea and the fact that you can still make a cup of tea to someone who you would like to Str angle it's really special it's amazing how we can inhabit two completely contradictory feelings at the same time I can't stand you get me the hell out of here and I can't imagine my life without you those things coexist love and hate side by side I'd like to take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors function I recently became a function member after searching for the most comprehensive approach to lab testing while I've long been a fan of blood testing I really wanted to find a more in-depth program for analyzing blood urine and saliva to get a full picture of my heart health my hormone status my immune system regulation my metabolic function my vitamin and mineral status and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality function not only provides testing of over 100 biomarkers key to physical and mental health but it also analyzes these results and provides insights from to doctors on your results for example in one of my first tests with function I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood this was totally surprising to me I had no idea prior to taking the test function not only helped me detect this but offered medical doctor informed insights on how to best reduce those mercury levels which included limiting my tuna consumption because I'd been eating a lot of tuna while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens and supplementing with Knack and acetylcysteine both of which can support glutathione production and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels comprehensive lab testing like this is so important for health and while I've been doing it for years I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive I've been so impressed by function both at the level of ease of use that is getting the test done as well as how comprehensive and how actionable the tests are that I recently joined their Advisory Board and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast if you'd like to try function go to function health.com huberman function currently has a weight list of over 250,000 people but they're offering Early Access to huberman lab listeners again that's function health.com huberman to get early access to function there's something that I really want to revisit that you said um you said it incredibly clearly but I have never heard this described um and I think it's so so very important for people to hear and internalize including me that I'm going to ask us to visit it again but not because you weren't clear but just because I think what is it so as a biologist when we teach biology the good biologists who uh good teachers we emphasize names only because people need to know them this is called that this is called that but it's all about verbs it's all about processes and Dynamics and what you just described as the three verb states of conflict I think I've never heard articulated that way so you described um if I understand correctly pursuer pursu right either pursu one person pursuing another no pursuer pursu each other loger heads and those are escalations okay two arrows pointing at one another arrows and not in a good way no not in in Conflict it's usually not at a good way you know and you there are there's a whole interpretation of an attachment style that underlies why to people in the situation of threat go on the attack you have two people fighting MH you have two people flighting fleeing and you have one person who flees and one person who fights that's another language for pursuer pursuer distancer distancer pursuer distancer and in each of those cases it seems that the first step to getting to a more functional Dynamic to try and sort this out whatever the conflict is is to somehow change one's mind mindset from talking about the story of what led there or stories of what led there to really starting to parse the feeling states of ourselves and hopefully empathy for the feeling state of the other it's feeling States and physiological States it's two different things the physiology is more primitive more basic it's physiology senses feelings thoughts is the way I would you know but because we I say it you know because we are Homo sapiens and we think we we really this thing about coherence and thinking that what we say has meaning is is extremely powerful to the point sometimes of delusional you know because I have to believe this because there would be too much dissonance if what I feel and what I think and what therefore happened didn't all have a coherence to themselves and it you know sometimes when you see it in the room you kind of say they never said that yeah it's almost like a psychosis of sorts I'm not calling either person psychotic it's psychotic because it's a disconnection from reality I would say it's such a a a a an inhabiting of an internal reality that it is disconnected from the possibility and this is where curiosity comes in it's the possibility that what you are experiencing is completely real in its experience but that doesn't mean it is factual or it is real in reality you know and to when I'm hurt and when I am thinking that you want to harm me it's very difficult for me in that moment to be willing to be empathic towards you and there are relationships where this is the truth I want to constantly come back to that because not everything is imagined sure you know but there are many other relationships where um why would why you know why would he want maybe he he he stepped away because he just thought that whatever was going to come out of his mouth he would regret it it's not because he doesn't care about you in fact it's the opposite and he knows what he can sometimes say he day she doesn't matter but not because he wanted to just throw you to the Wolves it's almost like we lose our theory of Mind our ability to place our ourselves in the mind of another in a in a healthy way when we're in these stress States I'm curious it's funny you call it stress States because stress to me is so physiological that it doesn't include the relational components sure I mean there needs to be a word for stress that involves the emotional reality and that emotional reality that now may be somewhat imagined and this is why it's complicated was once true what now is an internal truth once was what really happened and that's why we imagine and this is how we interpret the dynamic it's it's very important to add that so the the past was real there was someone in the past who actually did this to me but when you do this I think of them I I bring those two things together I I Collapse the past and the present and that's why I'm convinced this is what you're doing to me too and so how do you take somebody out of their physical and mental and emotional past to be grounding themselves into the present so so that they can consider that this person that is next to them is not doing to them what once was done to them right and my mind immediately goes to what you just described as a shift from focusing mainly on the past and how it's making us feel in the present to how we're feeling in the present acknowledging and understanding something did happen it that was real as you said and yet with this curious eye toward the future of what could unfold that's probably the hardest nugget of couple's therapy I mean I do individual work too but if we talk relational therapy this is one of those nuggets because people are not aware that they are in their past they are convinced that this is in the present it's a collapse of time zones and realities it's what makes us so rich it's what makes us so able to be creative and Artful but it's what sometimes makes it very challenging for us especially in romantic relationships because you asked at first you began with romantic relationships a lot of what we say here is true for friendships and work relationships but there is only two relationships that mirror each other it's the one we had with our first caretakers mostly our parents and the ones we have with our romantic Partners people can sit in the office and tell you I don't have this with anybody else and it's true often you believe him because nobody gets as close to you and nobody elicits in you the kinds of early yearnings and and and and and emotional needs than a romantic partner and that is very interesting I don't know if it's a bug or a feature as the uh Engineers say but it is remarkable to me um that the very same neural Machinery that forms the under pinning of infant primary caretaker relationship is repurposed for romantic relationship I mean I Marvel at that interesting right I mean the brain doesn't have like oh here's your developmental wiring circuits and then guess what you get to hit adolescence and you go through puberty and then you get this new circuit for forming a romantic attachment the brain Imaging shows us that it's repurposed so it's it's like if you got a 2 plus 2 equal 4 algorithm in that circuit let's call that securely attached although I realize that language is not sufficient but for just purposes of discussion okay well then great then you get healthy romantic attachments as adults or you you as an adult then perhaps you can navigate in and out of things that are unhealthy more quickly however if you got a 2 plus 2 equals 5 algorithm wired into that circuit well then you're forever looking for something that won't that is essentially dysfunctional that's the simplest version give me more about this repurposing it's really interesting yeah so um beautiful work by Alan Shore and others has yeah um his work I know you're familiar with has shown that you know you you image the brain of infant and typically it's mother but they've done other caretakers as well and you see this incredible mirroring of sure right brain left brain activity more dopaminergic or serotonergic activity basically the the the takeaway is that you see a lot of coherence what's going on in the mother is going on in the child and vice versa and it's there's a lot of reciprocity but sometimes in unhealthy caretaker infant relationships the so-called you know anxious attached dissociative or you know avoidant type scenarios the ABCD baby type thing people can look that up um if they like we can provide a link um you see a mismatch in the neurochemistry and the activation of these brain areas in other words that the brain circuitry for attachment is is set up so that um you know anxious states are evoked when calm States should have been um have there been better parenting okay all right but then you take those you run the same sorts of studies on romantically attached young adults or older adults and what you see is it's the same sets of neurons the same circuits I mean this is remarkable nowhere else to my awareness nowhere else in the nervous system do we repurpose neural circuitry from early in life you know it's as if there's a neural circuit for uh sensing thirst and drinking early in life and then later it's used for sensing uh how to navigate a city okay now that those are two very disperate things but this is this is like out outrageous right and so I say it's either a feature or a bug we don't know but it is the way it is right I would say I wasn't consulted at the design phas what you think was the was the The evolutionary logic of that I like to think in a kind of romantic way that some of our most important work in our lifetime is to try and resolve these developmental miswiring yes that are the consequence of um faulty caretaker infant relationship and you can't blame the infant now does that mean we blame our parents to the point of ostracizing them well one would hope not maybe in some cases that's necessary but I think I like to think that what we've observed over the last 10 20 30 years in no small part seriously thanks to your work reflects an evolution of how we are thinking about attachment that we are actually getting better at understanding the self and there's something about the human brain that wants to understand itself very interesting so I like to think that in a hundred years not only will there be more models of relationship as functional healthy relationships but there will also be a deeper understanding of what this whole thing of love and attachment really is and the parallel I use is one of biology we understand so much more about brain function now than we did just 10 years ago addiction for instance you know not just a a condition of failure of willpower but this understanding about dopamine you know um and other molecules I think we now look at a a feny addict or a heroin addict very differently they're caught in a neurochemical algorithm that is not serving them well it doesn't remove their responsibility but there comes a point where they can't recover themselves and they need certain supports and those supports are starting to emerge now so my hope is that this is built into our our evolution as some sort of um Vector toward progress you know it's interesting because some models of coup's work of couple's therapy will say you have recreated with each other patterns of your early life in order to be able to transcend them right the uh repetition compulsion you get the same thing over and over again Lord knows I've had that um and some wonderful partners and by the way as I say that I'm also taking 50% of the responsibility so it's all or 100% of the responsibility for the choice um as they say you didn't have six hard relationships you had one hard relationship six times right I think uh Paul kti says it that way but that yes that the repetition compulsion is a unconscious attempt to resolve the core conflict that arose during attachment correct do you subscribe to that view I think it's a very useful idea you know I was thinking at one point it's like sometimes when when when I listen to you and you know there is an exactness in the things that you describe often rooted in science and research Etc couple's therapy or Psychotherapy relationship [Music] thinking it's you don't have an exact answer um it's first of all you don't have an exact answer because modern relationships are more complex than ever and I don't think any relationship expert at this point can have answers you have invitations you have ways of thinking that are useful and here is the question is it true for me is answered by to the people does it resonate for them if they bite it then it's true it's a framework I can analyze this Tableau in multiple ways if this is the one that resonates for you this is what we're going to go with and that's what makes it true this is a very interesting thing there's multiple I mean to me it's interesting because there's a whole movement within the world of psychotherapy and psychology that wants to actually become much more norti with protocols and the same thing for everyone I think that much of what at least relationship therapy which is really the world in that I practice in is is existential and it's meaning making and there's a lot of ways to do that so um if this interpretation works for you be my guest but that's not because it is more true than another it's the one that was useful for you and that makes you much more humble I love that answer it's a little bit like when you raise kids you know you think that I used to think that all these things I had done with my first one you know is because I had such good ideas then I had a second one and not of these things worked with them because it was a different person you know so I realized that the first one it worked because there was a fit between my method and the person and this is the important thing in therapy is that it it's an issue of that fit is what you're looking for we hear a lot these days about the different attachment Styles or languages of love uh you know the love languages you know people will say I you know I emphasize you know gifts feel very rewarding or acts of uh what is it words of affirmation um you know unstructured time or etc etc or people will I think nowadays if they look into it a little bit they'll um realize that they are either you know more avoidant or more anxious these things can shift I mean I think it's wonderful that that people are thinking about these things in the same way that I think it's wonderful that people understand that there's a molecule called dopamine it can do certain things serotonin certain things but I'm curious as to whether or not you feel that the the naming of things and the assignment of oneself to a category can sometimes be limiting in terms of one's ability to really Embrace this curiosity and you also use the word invitation and you you are describing couple's therapy and healthy relationship as a bit more of an art form than a reductionist protocol oriented science which I love because to me you know despite being a scientist the some of the great mystery of life and certainly of romantic relationship is um when you find yourself in happy places that you didn't anticipate finding yourself or in a place of uh forgiveness and close friendship when at one point you can recall being as you said like you just this person like embodies the worst things in your mind so I think um I wonder if the processes that you found useful in your clinical work is it possible to formalize those in a way that people can start to adopt to them um in other words do you think that we can learn to navigate relationship in more healthy ways not just by saying I'm anxiously attached or avoiding or securely attached I'm looking for someone that has that or My love language is this and they love to do that and so therefore we're a perfect lock lock and key I think people are starting to think about relationship in in a more um nuanced and sophisticated way and yet also what I'm hearing is it's a lot more Dynamic than that and that some of those categorizations that we assign ourselves can really perhaps be limiting to what could be it's a great question but I have a moment now as if I'm in a session with you where I have like five things are arriving here in front of my brain and I'm thinking which one am I going to am going to enter um I I I'm going to actually start with just the the actual question but then I I probably is an opportunity to say a little bit about how I approach this thing I think some naming is very useful it frames it it gives it a a a found a foundation something to hold on to language matters if we would not be having a conversation without having a shared language at this moment but within that you and I are using the same words and may have very different meanings attached to it so that's the richness of the of the process is what do you mean when you say invitation curiosity you know conflict Etc when I for example when I do the work on conflict I I did provide language for example one of the things that happens in conflict is we have confirmation bias that's a cognitive framework that is often present in situations of emotional conflict of conflict which involves always something an emotional Dimension could be political too confirmation by means that I am looking for evidence that reinforces my beliefs and I disregard any evidence that contradicts it now this happens between two people this happens between two two parties this is a that's a very important naming you know it's interesting I've noticed this this this this but all you mentioned is that okay cogn bias another cognitive bias that is very common in is is fundamental attribution error you know we have this idea that I am complex and you are more simple if I if if I'm in a bad mood is because there was traffic you know the circumstances there's context if you're in a bad moon is because you're a contous person that's just your personality you know will categorize and totalize the behavior of others and we'll have lots of nuance and poetry for our own that's a concept that concept is very useful it's neutral it doesn't blame anybody and it says we all do this I like that kind of naming this very different from the kind of naming that pathologizes people the kind of naming that locks you into one identity you know you may have addiction and addiction may be really important that may even have destroyed your life but to just say you're an addict I've seen so I worked in an addiction Center for for two years and you know people people had a lot of there were a lot of other things happening in these people's lives and to just focus on this one thing is it it it reduces the person but it also reduces your ability to do something with the person it Narrows your lens so it's always this question about how wide is the lens that you that you don't get overwhelmed so you want to make it smaller but not that small that you that you're looking through a keyhole a person is more complex than a keyhole you know with don't just treat symptoms we we work with lives that's the difference of for me anyway in the work that that we do and that and then when you begin to think about lives then you start to think about culture what is happening in the world of relationships today it's such an incredible thing that is going on and and if you don't put that in the broader context I'm trained as a systemically oriented family therapist and that means that you're looking at the interaction of different systems and I think that a lot of what happens is a hyper individualization of these things and the naming is useful when it expands your understanding the naming is not useful when it locks you into a symptom a a reductionistic thing that that gives false certainty to profits I no you got can't agree more that you that naming uh that expands one's understanding and maybe even lends itself to a hint of curiosity stands a chance of of having some rehabilitative um Quality to it I I feel that nowadays there's such an overuse of psychological terms um like narcissist gaslighting therapy terms it's it's almost the way that if people were to talk about neurobiology as um neurosurgeons right I'm not a neurosurgeon but I have friends who are and neurosurgery is like something people trained for many many many years for just as being a uh clinical psychologist people trained for many years for and have a ton of in Office experience uh Real World Experience nowadays the naming and the attachment of names to particular top Contour features of people out there seems to be largely for the purpose of um closing off possibility as opposed to increasing possibility however it's both because on the one hand more than many other forms of medicine or health care or care Psychotherapy psychology but certainly Psychotherapy was always stigmatized and still is in many parts of the world it's for the crazies it's for it's for people there must be something fundamentally wrong I mean it's something that nobody went around talking about the fact that they are in therapy you went to see a therapist you know now you're putting it on your on your dating app you know it's a status symbol so there is a destigmatizing that is very important but there is also words that are weaponized and they are not useful and they and they are separating people and we have enough separation at this moment in our Societies in the west we don't need more efforts to pull people apart we need efforts to bring back the collective the community the the the shared experience because we are too far apart and that's why I think that some naming is useful and some naming is not always that useful well Amen to Bringing people together more I um yeah such an important mission right now I'd like to explore the possibility of something that I've heard but I don't know if it's true um that sex which of course doesn't just include intercourse but the things that lead into and out of sexual intercourse but that sex is a microcosm for the relationship at large meaning that the Dynamics that show up in uh intimate interactions are somehow reflective of a larger um working out or or um Dynamic uh in the relationship to what extent do you think that's true it's a concept that I've I've heard um it it's sounds interesting and um uh any discussion about sex tends to you know get um people's ears bricked up because uh it's uh depending on where you live in the world it's either something that people talk about um casually openly or with a lot of um you know uh electricity around it but um I always like to say you know as a biologist we can all agree on one thing which is that we're all here because um sperm met egg if not inum in in Dish and then eventually inum so we're still at at that point in uh Evolution so um what are your views about intimacy and sex as a reflection of the relationship and here what I'm thinking of again are these um when you described conflict you describe these three different uh uh positioning of arrows towards one another separate away from one another one chasing the other is there a parallel uh for healthy relationship that we can offer up um sexually yeah um for uh talking about this question of whether or not um sex is a microcosm of the of the larger relationship the health of the relationship let me start like this I mean I've I I I've studied sexuality for quite a few decades now in relationships but I think maybe because of what you said around the world Love and Desire are Universal experiences but the way that they are constructed are highly culturally contextual and so the most archaic rooted traditional aspects of a culture or a society are lodged around its beliefs and attitudes and behaviors towards sexuality and relationships especially the sexuality of women American elections case in point but the most radical Progressive changes that take place in a society also occur around sexuality and relationships sexuality of women in particular so sexuality is a window into a society sexuality is also a window into a relationship and into a person that invites deep listening one of the big challenges is that modern sexuality has been I mean traditional sexuality was identified with procreation modern sexuality is identified with performance and outcome sex is something you do do to which I say let's drop the performance and outcome for a moment and let's think of it as an experience so now you you're going to start to see my the choreography I draw when I think of sexuality as an experience and I say sex isn't just something that you do sex is a place you go so my question to you is where do you go in sex inside yourself and with another or others do you go to seek deep spiritual union a deep intimate connection Transcendence do you go to a place for vulnerability a place to surrender a place to be taken care of a place to be safely powerful a place to be nauy a place to have just plain fun a place to abdicate your responsibilities of good citizenship because sexual desire is quite Politically Incorrect where do you go in sex what parts of yourself do you try to connect with what is it that you're expressing there sexuality is a coded language for our deepest emotional needs our wounds our fears our aspirations our our longings it's that that is you know sex is never just sex even when it's hit and run and then it becomes really interesting so one of the things that one of the assumptions that existed very much at the heart of my field and that I challenged or questioned was that sexual problems are by definition the consequence of relationship problems so you fix the relationship and the sex will follow and I together with many colleagues have helped a lot of relationships get along better fight less laugh more enjoy each other and it changed nothing in the bedroom because in fact maybe sexuality is not a metaphor of the relationship maybe sexuality is a parallel narrative to the relationship and that in fact when you change the sexuality in a couple you change the whole relationship but not necessarily in the other direction so that opened up a whole that was one of the foundational ideas for mating in captivity my first book because I I have been trained to think like this and and then I began to think Love and Desire they relate but they also conflict they're not one and the same and they don't need the same things they don't thrive on the same elements and modern relationships romantic relationships have wanted to reconcile those two fundamental sets of human needs into one relationship that is the grand experiment of Modern Love and am I correct in interpreting what you just said as that Love and Desire are fundamentally separate that they can exist in parallel but that any goal of society much less a couple to try and unify those as one thing is not going to succeed no no no not at all it it actually has been remarkably successful the Romantic ideal is tenacious you know many other philosophies and ideologies of the end of the 19th century have all gone this one has survived many others I'm relieved to hear you say that the Romantic maybe I grew up on too many I did on I don't know how many romantic comedies I saw but I I grew up in a home where um love sex and romance were discussed in very almost ethereal terms yeah no no no I think that it's a but it is an experiment it's not something that we have tried throughout history in human history so I think that if you ask an it's an exercise I like to do sometimes I divide your page in a with a line in the middle up from top to bottom and on the top left you write when I think of love I think of then go to the other side and when I think of sexuality I think of and then you go back and you say and when I am loved I feel and when I am desired I feel when I'm wanted and when I love I feel and when I want or I desire I feel and when I think about the love between me and my partner if there is a couple and when I think about the sexuality between me and my partner and then you let people free associate about this and the there are words that you find back and forth and then there are words who just never appear in the other column do you recommend that uh couples exchange these documents they do it at the same time then they read it out loud in front of each other I do it in groups you know huge audiences as well but what I'm asking people to see is when you look at what you responded in both categories create a line between those two is it a thick line like what happens in love is completely separate for me than what happens in desire I need a complete different set of things I express myself differently I interact differently or is it very much that when this exists it completely ignites that they are interrelated interdependent one feeds on each other one reinforces the other there is a degree of variety about that for some people Love and Desire are inseparable and for some people they are often retrieve irretrievably disconnected and I think the model wants them to be really together and for a lot of people it's exactly what they aspire to for other people it's more challenging because somehow in them it's there's a there's a split between these two things some people experience love in such a way that it sometimes because becomes challenging for them to make love to the person they love what I mean by that is that love comes with a sense of responsibility worry care about the well-being of the other person and some of us sometimes have learned to love in a way that comes with extra worry extra responsibility extra burden we were the parents of our parents we took care of our depressed parent we took care of our alcoholic parent we learn to love with a sense that is not free that is not curious or playful because curiosity cannot happen in a St state of stress as you so well said when we experience love with that extra sense of Burden it is difficult to be with someone that you feel close to and at the same time go inside yourself and completely chill and relax in pleasure land that's one of the scenarios there's many others but this is one of the more common ones Michael Bader's work that makes it difficult for some people to experience Love and Desire at the same time the more they love the more challenging the desire becomes for them because desire ex is is to own the wanting it's it exists in you can't make someone want you can make someone have sex but you can never make them want want is your sovereignty your autonomy your freedom and for some people that wanting cannot exist when they are with someone that they feel so responsible and worried and anxious about and that's the attachment piece that you're talking about so this is how attachment style often manifests in the way that you then organize your sexual self what percentage of infidelity do you think reflects somebody's inability to um integrate this uh love component From Desire component um such that they find that they only uh experience desire or strong desire um outside their their committed relationship look I wrote an entire book about in about infidelity as in what happens when desire goes looking elsewhere I think that some people go outside for to ex as a response to a lot of discontents in the relationship loneliness being the first one neglect indifference um conflict rejection sex ual rejection in particular but some people go outside um and it has very little to do with the relationship it sometimes has to do with how they organize themselves in the relationship to the degree that in order to feel a certain Freedom or ability to think about themselves they go they need to be outside and it's I used to say I have seen a lot of infidelity in happy Rel relationships it's not always a symptom of a flawed relationship by no means and that in those situations people tell me it's not that I wanted to find another person it's that I wanted to find another self or to reconnect with lost parts of myself and I don't say this to promote or to condone or anything but I just listened across the globe one word it's not that I wanted to find another partner is that I wanted to find something else inside of me and I don't know how to do that in the relationship that I'm in and that's not because of the person I'm with that's because of what I do to myself in the context of intimate connection and the word that you hear all over the globe when people who you interview people who are in Affairs is that they feel alive it's kind of the erotic as an antidote to deadness they feel that aliveness and that doesn't mean they often that doesn't necessarily involve sex it's about something aliveness is that the erotic not the sexual and the erotic is the quality of liveness vibrancy Vitality hopefulness curiosity imagination playfulness it's those elements that often people lose for a host of reasons life work children dying parents illness economic hardship you name it you know and there's a sense that they need to go elsewhere to find that and some people would say [ __ ] justification and some people understand that at the heart of Affairs there is betrayal and long and duplicity and lying and all of that but there is also longing and loss on an existential level that's a very different lens into this so the people for whom that reconciliation that you talk about is more challenging are often people who are often more likely to compartmentalize what you just said brings me back to this idea that we were exploring at the very beginning of this conversation that it seems that so much of navigating relationship in healthy versus unhealthy ways depends on this internal Dynamic within ourselves of an ability to be in close intimate relationship with another and yet hold on to enough of our own identity right and evolve that identity within the relationship to the other that is the definition of intimacy or a definition of intimacy and that is probably the number one task of every relationship a romantic relationships is how do I get close to you without losing me and how do I hold on to me without losing you now you know I said to you in the beginning that we grow up and we have both needs togetherness and separateness and then we come out of our childhoods and some of us need more space freedom separateness and some of us need more protection connection togetherness of course we tend to meet somebody whose proclivities match our vulnerabilities and so you find that in many relationships you have one person who is more afraid of losing the other and one person who is more afraid of losing themselves one person more afraid with the fear of Abandonment and one person more afraid with the fear of Suffocation this is a recurring Dynamic that you see and does it um swap back and forth across couples um male female um I'm assuming in that um example heterosexual relationship but even homosexual relationships you'll see it um switch back and forth or it tends to be a pretty stable feature meaning one person in the couple tends to be afraid of Abandonment the other person abandonment by the other the other person more deeply afraid of Abandonment of themselves right it it doesn't switch back and forth it switches by relationship but not within one relationship you may have been a different in different roles with different partners indeed I have uh so interesting again not be because you weren't clear you were incredibly clear and concise about this but I think this is such an important concept maybe you'd repeat it for us again just so that people can really drive it into their Consciousness and maybe ask themselves the question are they more afraid of Abandonment by the other or abandonment of themselves you know one of the ways that you sometimes can see this is that I mean in the tour this week one woman stood up and basically said I recently divorced I would like to be able to enter another relationship again and I said is the issue an issue of trust or is the issue was there betrayal was it what's LED she says how do I how do I allow somebody to enter into my life without losing myself so it's in the language you know it's one person but this could and really I think it's very important for me many of these things are not gender specific nor orientation particular this this is human but and I answered a little bit with some of this and and other things and so then the next question is how often do you not say what you really think because you want to please or you want to harmonize or you want to avoid conflict how often did you then resent the partner who actually stood for their ground because if you're afraid to lose yourself you're often more the one who stands for your ground you don't give in because you some and if it's rigid you don't give in at all because you think that every time even the language agreeing is giving in and giving in is a losing a part of myself I mean it's it's buil in it's so you know it it it starts here and it continues all the way it's like so you I mean it's like it's a sequence of things you break apart in in small granular pieces how does it play out for you when you lose yourself what are the things you do not do that facilitate this dissolution and to the other person who is um when you're afraid sorry of losing the other and when you're afraid of of of losing yourself like where's your rigidity where is your kind of totalistic thinking where is this unle lack of flexibility and that may manifest in I don't travel to those places you know the sentence that indicates that we're dealing with this bigger issue is something sometimes very anod you know I don't go to those kind of restaurants you know why should I go to those kind of places and you kind of want to say why is there such intensity about the restaurant what are you fighting against and what are you fighting for and why are you even fighting we're talking about going out supposedly supposed meant to be fun now you start rewinding you know what is this statement go connected to that we are going to have Co you know so now you have conflict meeting identity meeting connection to another person this is when the the and and it is sleuth work it's fantastically engaging and exciting it's like when you do scientific research it's that sluth work that you say this thing doesn't fit at all you know why do you want me to wear blue shoes why do you make such a big deal out of the blue shoes what are blue shoes for you don't start talking about the shoes please talk about you know boundaries but boundaries today is a concept that has become so ill used almost so it's talk about how the preservation of the self now involves not where in blue shoes I mean you get what I I I do and and I I my mind um keeps flitting back to this parallel construction of these circuits were built in infancy and childhood and Adolescence and I'm uh what kind of flashed to mind is when we are adolescence and teenagers there's this fundamental question that we ask that rarely do we ask again later in life I mean maybe people do but the question is kind of who am I you know teenagers try on a lot of different identities often and how they dress you know is one of the ways in which they self-identify their music I mean the music we listen to when we're teenagers and young adults is forever stamped into us as like some core part of our identity it has an emotional weight that music that we arrive to later doesn't unless it resonates with that early music or um recapitulates that rather so in my mind I'm thinking I wonder if these circuits that are struggling with uh holding on to self versus a kind of a playful curious exploration of new things novelty which is so fundamental to relationship and they're not they they're as we say it's neurobiologists are are really antagonistic that they're really in a push pull I mean there's so many things that we're discussing today that really feel as if these are um like circuits that can't be coactive easily that they they're like that we're in this internal grappling match and what keeps coming to mind but they also need each other right they're right they're they're like the um right it's like the front axle and the back axle of a a vehicle like you can't exist without both you just made me think of something because you asked before that the thing about the sexuality and and and I like the concept of erotic blueprints which I work with a lot and um and I try to really kind of distill it in in in this desire bundle course that I'm I'm releasing that it cuz I thought how can people ask themselves a set of questions like a lot of my work is about finding the good questions that will you know a good question this like a portal right and the the the the line on top which is the answer to your question is tell me how you were loved and I will tell you how you make love not just how you love but how you make love meaning that your emotional history is inscribed in the physicality of sex and it's all about what you asked me in the beginning identity and change holding on to oneself connecting with the other sexuality is the place where this occurs at the most fundamental level it's to be inside oneself and inside the other at the same time their Universe not their orifices that is what is the experience that temporary Oneness that then again opens up as two people so people who struggle with that emotionally how do I stay connect to me and then to you without this polarities experience that in Sex and then you ask a set of questions how did you learn to love and with whom were you protected by those people but who took care of you or did you have to flee for protection did they take care of you or did you take care of them did they hold you rock you cuddle you or did they harm you or violate you or shake you was it okay to laugh and to cry was it okay to experience pleasure was it safe you know a set of questions like that and this is where people enter their erotic blueprint and get to see that their emotional challenges are directly if you film them if you watch them making love you'll understand and their emotional challenges but then comes the next level and if you then study their fantasy lives then you'll understand the depth of their emotional needs which are brought into their sexuality fascinating you get it I get it I get it and it um makes me think that this earlier discussion we were having you know is sex a microcosm for the larger relationship it sounds to me like the answer is yes but especially the relationship to self and especially the like there's a lot of information in one's uh desire template or blueprint about how one was cared for or not cared for your sexual preferences your sexual fantasies are a translation of your deepest emotional needs not sexual needs emotional needs you know my mother used to say tell me about your friends and I'll tell you who you are and then I said you tell me about you sexually and I will know a heck of a lot about who you are but you have to translate don't the problem of sexuality in modern society is the literalness with which we approach it and in our pornographic Society ever more so to our detriment right I couldn't agree more and I think that there also seems to be this attempt to directly translate from well if somebody had issues with their mother mother then they're going to have issues with women as an adult or if they had issues with their father they're going to have issues with men as an adult that's confirmation B right but in reality it's the algorithm it's the algorithm um it's that these um algorithms that are laid down in our neural circuitry earlier they don't care about U male femaleness I mean it doesn't change whether or not people are heterosexual or homosexual that's it ain't to them I I believe I think these are frankly biologically driven but the idea is that our ways of being um don't translate directly that way that these are deeper processes so if one had issues for instance with their who's male and heterosexual but they had issues with their father they could have the same issues with women as an adult right that it could translate that it's not always mapping uh male to male female to female I have a a a segment of my podcast where should we begins that opens the tour where basically they talk about how they met and then they are they fight about everything all the time and they think that they're fighting this is the line of the show they think they're fighting about the closet the cat litter and the cat what I think they're fighting about is that when she says why didn't you close the closet he instantly thinks of his dad who was this military guy who told him you know and he is basically in a fight saying to her you ain't telling me what to do you the boss of me so she can never make a request for which he doesn't feel like she's controlling him and he answers with this fight and that throws her into the she grew up all alone you know took care of her two siblings mother was gone etc etc and she hoped her whole life she would finally meet a partner and she wouldn't feel alone and there would be somebody to support her and every time he says to her you ain't the boss of me don't tell me what to do she says oh I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life here I am in the worst place that I always wanted to avoid this is what they're fighting about but they're talking about why did you leave the cat Closet open this is beautiful example beautiful example it cuts across our preconceived notions that if somebody had a good relationship with their mother they will have good relationship with women if they good relationship with father with men it's a little bit more subtle and complicated Nuance than that I think the Frameworks are useful but they Frameworks and the they're models that help us to think and make sense of things but it's a little bit like in science you know the truth of today is the joke of tomorrow I had heard that but but uh uh that one's going up on X um repair work is something that is so fundamental to healthy relationship it connects to our what we discussed about apology what is your uh recommendation for how couples think about repair work let's assume that they're still together and um there's some at least uh hint of a hope to recover the relationship should repair work be framed as um in a particular way to facilitate it um you know how does one begin I mean I I can sort of been uh we've been doing a lot of Threes today so I can imagine mistakes misunderstandings and betrayals right there are mistakes like I accidentally step on somebody's toes there's uh misunderstandings to people thought the same thing and then they're outright betrayals and my understanding from your work is that you've seen many couples indeed helped many couples recover from all three of those categories to the point where they are quite satisfied with their relationship there's a sequence to this and it's to in Intimate Relationships it's to in friendships I'm very interested in friendships these days and in in Friendship therapy I do co-founders work I mean there's other diets that I'm very interested in beyond the the Romantic unit but you said something before that I I thought actually I may come back to when you said you know it's about acknowledging that you were wrong sometimes you may not have been wrong but you were hurtful mhm and rather than get all you know I didn't do anything I didn't do anything it doesn't matter what you did even if you don't think it was anything terrible seem to have really upset your partner do you care about that or you want to just kind of stand so I think the first piece in in repair work and and I think by the way that repair is not the end of the story The Revival is the end of the story much better word the you know the erotic recovery erotic in my sense of the in my definition of the word so that's what when I say it's not enough to survive it's I I I I'm I'm a child of survivors I wanted to see people who how do they continue to live not just how do they stay alive and I think that's a fundamental difference in our lives and in our relationships it's a huge piece of it's really at the heart of my work and of my life you know so every trauma process the say the you know of Nations or of individuals demands the acknowledgment of what happened and that acknowledgement involves remorse and guilt for the hurt and the harm that it caused even if you don't feel guilty for the act itself and you think the ACT is Justified the consequences of the act on the other person person is where the guilt and the remorse must take place without that there is very little option for repair if I if I don't feel that you even know what you did to me my you my dad you my boss you my political enemy I mean that it's it's really at the root so after you do the remorse and the and the guilt the next part is to be really careful that you don't sink into the now I'm going back to relationships into the shame I'm such a terrible person how could I do something like this so I feel so bad about myself that I still can't feel bad about you now that's narcissism that's the different story the point is not for you to still think that you're at the center you were at the center when you heard and now you're at the center of the of the your own wound it's really a process of Reckoning with the other person and it's slow challenging for some and it's immediate for others and then I think the next piece in a relationship is not just to apologize and to to to show your remorse but it's actually to show that you value the other person because hurting a person and especially when it's betrayal and careless is a devaluation of the other person you didn't matter what that me mattered more than you for whatever the reasons it was still selfish and I devalued you and to become the Vigilante of a relationship is that you become the person who protects the relationship by showing that the other person really matters and in detail that sometimes means you know how are you today is there anything you want to talk about you still think about it you know this is going to this is a big one to carry every day are you able to go to see this movie can we you know just without being so afraid that every time you ask you're going to get blamed again or you're going to feel so bad about yourself it's a little bit step out of yourself and just reach out and just check in half the time when you say how are you and do you want to talk The person says no I don't but I just wanted to know that you are prepared to in case I needed to set the conditions make me feel that you value me and our relationship which you have just trashed and then the third thing is what I call the erotic recovery it's the it's the Regeneration or the generation of new cells in in you know it's I need a new skin to come over the scab that's the real you know repair is not yet healing the healing is I know I hurt myself somewhere it's it's here I can feel it when I touch it but I don't feel it the whole time it's not front and center every moment of my obsessive rumin but when I touch it it's tender it's wounded it's it's a place that I need to make sure not to hit again and don't hurt me again and don't do this to me again I I can't recover from that twice it's very it's that vulnerable and then it says let's go do new things you know erotic recovery is not about comfortable and familiar and the return to the status quo erotic recovery is about new risky curious play unknown imagination outside of the comfort zone so that we can see ourselves a new as who we are and how and who we are together and I think that's where the Revival takes place it's hopeful it's possibility it's adventure it's got that energy beautiful aspirational and realistic too this uh notion of not notion forgive me this act of truly getting outside of oneself to be present to the way the other person feels irrespective of who was right or who is wrong if it was a misunderstanding betrayal but especially in cases of betrayal the exiting of as you said um either a stance of not wanting to look at it for oneself or of self- flatulation both are self-centered yeah so really getting into real genuine care for if not car taking or the offer of care for the other person I hurt you that bad you know one of the big things is people are often shocked at the hurt of the I thought you wouldn't care what I thought I or I I didn't think about it I just didn't because there is a dissociation that takes place when you when you take off and so the when people are faced with the the raw hurt wound suffering collapse fracture of the other person they find it very hard to tolerate and this has to happen you have to be able to to know the consequences of your action if you want to you know freedom in the existentialist San terms involved the ability to take responsibility for the cons the consequence of your actions this is it I'll help you face that that doesn't mean that you become the worst creature on the planet but you are you have to face that and that is something very hard for us because sometimes we meant it sometimes we thought we deserve it and sometimes we didn't that we didn't think that that was going to be the case and so it's sometimes easier to stand in front of someone else's anger than someone else's hurt yeah absolutely and what you're describing also perhaps at least partially explains why sometimes not always apologies are insufficient necessary but not sufficient because there are certain um modes of apology that don't show us that the person is who's apologizing is really outside themselves they're in their own guilt they're in their own shame and therefore they're not really present to how we feel no no there's a beautiful book by harat learner about apology that I often recommend in these situations because she really analyzes if you ever do apology you know she she this concept of sincerity of of the apology that actually shows that I care about you and not just about restoring my dignity and my pride and all of that you know the the the the Maneuvers that are about self-preservation versus the Maneuvers that are really about restorative justice who is ready for relationship and for people who are not in relationship or who are what sorts of questions should they be asking themselves what what sorts of um things should we all be doing you know what's a question that I ask people often almost in the first session knowing yourself as well as you do what do you think makes it hard to live with you great question um my answer is far too long to give here uh everyone will be relieved that's that's that will give you some of the material about you know who nobody's ready as in I'm prepared I'm I'm I'm perfect I'm I'm I'm fully baked I I say to every person everyone has relationship issues they're going to have to address at some point in their life the only question is with whom not if just with whom who's the one that you're going to do the work with we're all works in progress we are notoriously imperfect rather unpredictable and many relationship problems are not problems that you solve they're paradoxes that you have to learn to manage well I want to make clear that um before what I say next um that if I had my way uh we would continue this conversation for uh many hours if not days perhaps There's an opportunity for that in the future but uh I was told um and not surprisingly that you're in a tremendous demand you're on a live tour now I can't wait to see this it's all sold out so I'll have to wait like everyone else but um sounds like an incredible experience indeed I know some people have spoken directly to them uh who attended one of your lives recently and they sound like a a completely immersive and um experience like no other so I'm very excited about that um my only regret about your tour is that uh we have to Halt this conversation um in the next couple of minutes and I and there are a couple things I I just want to reflect back to you um that are all from a place of real deep appreciation uh first of all for bringing forward what you've brought today um you're one of these exceedingly rare people with whom when they speak like gems just fall out of them and I know I'm not alone in sentiment I mean uh just in today's conversation you've uh transformed the way that I think about relationship self identity neurobiology uh love sex uh so many um key topics and in a much larger way um as you pointed out and I completely agree the themes that you're talking about are not just fundamental for us to resolve as individuals they are not just fundamental for us to resolve in couples or whatever relationship configuration people happen to be in they're societal they're societal that we can look at anything uh an election uh two countries battling one another political groups whatever at every level this is this is what it it means to be human built up from the same fundamental circuit same fundamental Dynamics and I really see you as not just a Pioneer but the pioneer of this parting of the veil from what has I think until this point in human history been a lot of descriptions of things of what's right what's wrong this and that and and some of that might be true I don't know I'm not qualified to know but that you represent a real parting of the veil into the next evolution of what it means for humans to interact in more healthy ways and with curiosity and sense of invitation toward more love connection and peace so you know there really aren't words to express um how enthusiastic and appreciative I am of what you brought here today and what you're doing and so I just want to say you know the Deep heartfelt thanks and I know I

Title: The Power of Non-Judgmental Listening
Published: 2024-09-12 19:19:45 UTC
Description:
Dr. Marc Brackett, a professor in the Child Study Center at Yale University and director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, highlights the importance of compassionate, non-judgmental listening in helping others express their true selves and seek emotional support.

When we think about the people who create the conditions for us to be our true selves, we don't think about the wisest, smartest, fixer, problem solver. We think about the non-judgmental listener who shows compassion. I think that has to be reinforced, that some of the fear that we have is that we're going to get lost in all these feelings. But no one's asking you to get lost in their feelings. What they're asking for is support. They're asking you to just listen and to maybe ask me a few questions to help me clarify my experience and then help me on a path towards feeling better.

Title: Reducing Digital Dependency in Youth
Published: 2024-09-11 13:15:02 UTC
Description:
Dr. Jonathan Haidt, a professor of social psychology at New York University and bestselling author, explores how technology and culture impact the psychology and health of kids, teens, and adults. He advocates for delaying smartphone and social media use for children, implementing phone-free schools, and promoting real-world play and responsibility to restore a traditional childhood experience.

Transcript Language: English
I think we can restore childhood in the real world. No smartphone before high school, no social media till 16, phone-free schools, more independence, free play, and responsibility in the real world, those four things. And these are things that we can all do if we work together, if we do 'em at the same time. If we're the only family that's keeping your kid off of smartphone till high school and off of social media till 16, you're imposing a cost on your child. And she may be lonely and she'll say, "Mom, I'm left out." Now, she might still thank you, as we saw last night. So one of the women said her daughter thanked her for keeping her off. But at the time it was painful for her. And so my hope is, by spreading these norms, no parent will ever be in that position again, where their kid is the only one in the class who doesn't have a smartphone at age 10.

Title: The Impact of Processed Foods on Our Health
Published: 2024-09-11 01:16:19 UTC
Description:
Dr. Casey Means explains why humans face obesity and chronic diseases, citing a toxic food supply that lacks essential nutrients and advocates for eating unprocessed, nutrient-rich foods to improve health.

Transcript Language: English
There are really no other animal species in the world that have obesity and chronic disease epidemics. And they don't have social media, they don't have experts, they don't have PubMed, they don't have the FDA, they don't have the USDA. They don't have any of it, and they have somehow figured out a way to stay at a healthy weight and to not get heart disease. And it's because they're eating real food that meets the needs of their cells. The root cause of the problem is that we have a toxic food supply that's no longer filled with the molecular information that our body needs to know to be satiated and to function properly. And so through the complex biology of satiety hormones and neurobiology and microbiome function, we are driven to eat so, so, so much more. So, truly, the jumping-off point for anyone on the quest to better health is to eat as much real, unprocessed food from good soil as possible.

Title: Dr. Jamil Zaki: How to Cultivate a Positive, Growth-Oriented Mindset
Published: 2024-09-02 12:00:35 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. Jamil Zaki, Ph.D., professor of psychology at Stanford University, director of the Stanford Social Neuroscience Laboratory, and the author of the new book Hope for Cynics. We discuss cynicism and its healthier, more adaptive alternative, healthy skepticism, and how embracing healthy skepticism can enhance both our emotional and physical health.

We discuss the data on how cynicism affects us as individuals and in relationships, causing lower levels of happiness, poorer physical health, and reduced creativity, trust, and collaboration. He also explains novel data-supported tools that we can use to shift ourselves towards a more informed yet more positive worldview and how to adopt a mindset of “hopeful skepticism” — the ideal stance to navigate life. 

Dr. Zaki offers listeners a positive, hopeful view of humanity grounded in cutting-edge research from his laboratory and other top laboratories. He also offers science-supported protocols to navigate relationships in person and online better.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Jamil Zaki Dr Jamal Zaki is a professor of psychology at Stanford University he is also the director of the social Neuroscience laboratory at Stanford his laboratory focuses on key aspects of The Human Experience such as empathy and cynicism which lie at the heart of our ability to learn and can be barriers to learning such as the case with cynicism today you'll learn the optimal mindsets to adopt when trying to understand how to learn conflict resolution and how to navigate relationships of all kinds and in all context including personal relationships and in the workplace what sets Dr zaki's work apart from others is that he's able to take laboratory research and apply that to real world scenarios to direct optimal strategies for things like how to set personal boundaries how to learn information in uncertain and sometimes even uncomfortable environments and then how to bring that to bear in terms of your relationship to yourself your relationship to others and how to collaborate with others in more effective ways I want to be very clear that today's discussion while focused on cynicism trust and empathy is anything but Squishy in fact it focuses on experimental data derived from Real World contexts so it is both grounded in solid resp search and it is very practical such that by the end of today's episode you'll be armed with new knowledge about what cynicism is and is not what empathy is and is not this is very important because there's a lot of confusion about these words and what they mean but I can assure you that by the end of today's discussion you will have new Frameworks and indeed new tools protocols that you can use as strategies to better navigate situations and relationships of all kinds and indeed to learn better I'd also like to mention that Dr Zaki has authored a terrific new book entitled hope for cynic the surprising science of human goodness and I've read this book and it is spectacular there is a link to the book in the show note captions before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Maui Nei Maui Nei venison is the most nutrient-dense and delicious red meat available I've spoken before on this podcast about the fact that most of us should be seeking to get about one gram of quality protein per pound of body weight every day that protein provides critical building blocks for things like muscle repair and synthesis but also promotes overall health given the importance of muscle as an organ eating enough quality protein each day is also a terrific way to Stave off hunger one of the key things however is to make sure that you're getting enough quality protein without ingesting excess calories Maui Nei venison has an extremely high quality protein to calorie ratio such that getting that 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight is both easy and doesn't cause you to ingest an excess amount of calories also Mau Nei venison is absolutely delicious they have venison steaks ground venison and venison bone broth I personally like and eat all of those in fact I probably eat a Mau Nei venison Burger pretty much every day and occasionally I'll swap that for a Maui Nei steak and if if you're traveling a lot or simply on the go they have a very convenient Maui Ney venison jerky which has 10 gram of quality protein per stick at just 55 calories while Maui Nei offers the highest quality meat available their supplies are limited responsible population management of the access deer on the island of Maui means that they will not go beyond Harvest capacity signing up for a membership is therefore the best way to ensure access to their highquality meat if you'd like to try Maui Nei venison you can go to mauii venison docomo ubberman to get 20% off your membership or first order again that's mauii venison docomo today's episode is also brought To Us by ju juv makes medical grade red light therapy devices now there's one thing I've consistently emphasized on this podcast it's the incredible impact that light can have on our biology now in addition to sunlight red light and near infrared light have been shown to have positive effects on improving numerous aspects of Cellar and organ Health including faster Muscle Recovery improved skin health and wound healing even improvements in acne reducing pain and inflammation improving mitochondrial function and even improving Vision itself what sets juv lights apart and why they're my preferred red light therapy devices is that they use clinically proven wavelengths meaning it uses specific wavelengths of red light and near infrared light in combination to trigger the optimal Cellar adaptations personally I use the ju handheld light both at home and when I travel it's only about the size of a sandwich so it's super portable and convenient to use I also have a ju whole body panel and I use that about three or four times per week if you'd like to try ju you can go to ju SP jv.com huberman ju is offering an exclusive discount to all hubman lab listeners with up to $400 off select ju products again that's ju jv.com huberman to get $400 off select ju products today's episode is also brought To Us by waking up waking up is a meditation app that offers hundreds of guided meditation programs mindful trainings yoga NRA sessions and more I started practicing meditation when I was about 15 years old and it made a profound impact on my life and by now there are thousands of quality peer- reviewed studies that emphasize how useful mindfulness meditation can be for improving our Focus managing stress and anxiety improving our mood and much more in recent years I started using the waking up app for my meditations because I find it to be a terrific resource for allowing me to really be consistent with my meditation practice many people start a meditation practice and experience some benefits but many people also have challenges keeping up with that practice what I and so many other people love about the waking up app is that it has a lot of different meditations to choose from and those meditations are of different durations so it makes it very easy to keep up with your meditation practice both from the perspective of novelty you never get tired of those meditations there's always something new to explore and to learn about yourself and about the effectiveness of meditation and you can always fit meditation into your schedule even if you only have two or three minutes per day in which to meditate I also really like doing Yoga Nidra or what is sometimes called non-sleep deep rest for about 10 or 20 minutes because it is a great way to restore mental and physical Vigor without the tiredness that some people experience when they wake up from a conventional nap if you'd like to try the waking up app please go to waking up.com huberman where you can access a free 30-day trial again that's waking up.com huberman to access a free 30-day trial and now for my discussion with Dr Jam Zaki Dr Jam Zaki welcome thanks so much for having me delighted to have you here and to learn from you uh you have decided to tackle an enormous number of very interesting and challenging topics challenging because my read of it not just your book but of these fields and the science that you've done is that people default to some complicated States and emotions sometimes that in some way serve them well in some ways serve them less well so I'd like to talk about this at the level of the individual and interactions between Pairs and larger groups and and so on but just to kick things off what is cynicism you know I I have my own ideas but what is cynicism what does it serve in terms of its role in the human mind the way that psychologists think of cynicism these days is as a theory a theory about human beings it's the idea that generally people at their core are selfish greedy and dishonest now that's not to say that a cynical person will deny that somebody could act kindly for instance could donate to charity could help a stranger but they would say all of that all of that kind and friendly behavior is a thin veneer covering up who we really are which is self-interested another way of putting this is you know there are these ancient philosophical questions about people are we good or bad kind or cruel caring or callous and cynicism is answering all of those in the relatively Bleak way that you might I believe in your book you quote Kurt vaget who says we are who we pretend to be so we need to be careful who we pretend to be what do you think that quote means how do you interpret that quote uh thanks for bringing that up Kurt vut one of my favorite uh authors and to me that quote is enormously powerful because it expresses the idea of self-fulfilling prophecies you know there's this subjective sense that people have that our version of the world is the world that we are passively taking in information veridically uh dispassionately and in fact that's not the case we each construct our own version of the world and so for instance if you think about cynicism right are people kind or cruel that's pretty much an unanswerable question at the level of science it's a philosophical some could argue even a theological question but it turns out that the way you answer that goes a long way in constructing and shaping the life that you live the decisions that you make so cynics maybe it's not so much about who they pretend to be but it's about who they pretend everybody else is right if you decide that other people are selfish for instance you'll be far less likely to trust them and there's a lot of evidence that cynics when they're put in situations with new people even when they interact with their friends romantic partners and families that they still have their guard up that they're not able to make trusting and deep connections with other people but guess what when you treat other people in that way a couple of things happen one you're not able to receive what most of us need from social connections there's one really classic and very sad study where people uh were forced to give an extemporaneous speech about a subject they don't know much about a very stressful experience that raised people's blood pressure uh some of these folks had a cheerleader not not an actual cheerleader but a a a Friendly Stranger who was with them while they prepared saying you've got this I know you can do it I'm in your corner other people had no support as you know one of the great things about social support is that it buffers us from stress so uh most people when they had this friendly person by their side their blood pressure as they prepared for the speech went up only half as much as when they were alone but cynical people had a spike in their blood pressure that was indistinguishable uh in in magn itude whether or not a person was by their side or not one way that I think about this is social connection is a deep and necessary form of psychological nourishment and living a cynical life making the decision that most people can't be trusted stops you from being able to metabolize those calories leaves you malnourished in a social uh in a social way a second thing that happens when you choose to to pretend that others are selfish greedy and dishonest is that you bring out the worst in them there's a lot of research that finds that cynical people tend to do things like monitoring others spying on them or threatening them to make sure that that other person doesn't betray them but of course other people can tell how we're treating them and they reciprocate our kindness and retaliate against our unkindness so cynical people end up bringing out the most selfish qualities of others telling a story full of villains and then ending up stuck living in that story how early in life does cynicism show up I'm thinking about Sesame Street characters which to me embody different neural circuits um you know you've got Cookie Monster some strong dopaminergic drive there knows what he wants knows what he likes and he's going to get it that great prefrontal system maybe right even if he has to eat the Box uh in order to uh get to the cookie quicker um you have Elmo who's all loving and you have Oscar the Grouch somewhat cynical but certainly grouchy and then in you know essentially every fairy tale or every Christmas story or uh you know there seems to be sort of a skeptic or somebody that can't be brought on board the celebration yeah one would otherwise have but even though kids are learning about cynicism and grouchiness and um krogans I often think about those phenotypes in older folks because that's how they've been written into most of those stories I guess Oscar the Grouch is we don't know how old Oscar is if one observes children how early can you observe classically defined cynicism that's a great question classically defined cynicism would be hard to measure very early in life because you typically measure it through self-report so people have to have relatively well-developed elaborated stories that they can tell you about the ver their version of the world that said one early experience and one early phenotype that's very strongly correlated with generalized mistrust and unwillingness to count on other people would be insecure attachment early in life so for instance you might know but just for listeners um insecure attachment is uh a way of describing how kids experience the social world it's often tested using something known as the strange situation where a one-year-old is brought to a lab with their caregiver mother father whoever is caring for them uh they're in a novel environment and researchers are observing how much do they explore the space how comfortable do they seem then after that uh a stranger enters the room a couple minutes after that their mother leaves the room or their caregiver leaves the room which is of course incredibly strange and stressful for most one-year-olds uh the caregiver then returns after a minute and what researchers look at is a few things one how comfortable is the child exploring a space with their caregiver present two how comfortable are they when other people are around three How do they react when their caregiver leaves and four how do they react at the reunion with their caregiver and the majority of kids approximately two-thirds of them are securely attached meaning that they are comfortable exploring a new space they get really freaked out of course as you might when their caregiver leaves but then they soothe quickly when their caregiver Returns the remaining third or so of kids are insecurely attached meaning that they're skiddish in new environments even when their parent or caregiver is there they really freak out when their caregiver leaves and they're not very soothed upon their return now for a long time attachment style was viewed in very emotional terms and it it is it is an emotional reaction first and foremost but researchers more recently have started to think about well what are the cognitive schemas what are the underpinnings the ways that children think when they are securely or insecurely attached and one brilliant study used looking time looking time in kids is a metric of what surprises them if something really surprising happens they look for a very long time and researchers found that insecurely attached kids when they saw a video of uh of a reunion of a of a caregiver and and and infant acting in a way that felt loving and stable they looked longer as though that was surprising kids who were cely attached didn't look very long at those stable interactions but looked longer at interactions that were unstable interesting it's almost as though there's a setup that kids develop very early can I count on people am I safe with people and insecure attachment is a signal coming early in life no you're not safe with people that I think well and the data show elaborates later in life into mistrust in other relationships how different is cynicism from skepticism you know I can think of some places where they might overlap um but cynicism seems to carry um something of a lack of anticipation about any possibility of a positive future is that one way to think about it that's a very sharp way of thinking about it actually and I wish that people knew more about the the discrepancy between these two ways of viewing the the world cynicism and skepticism people often use them interchangeably in fact they're quite different and I would argue that one is much more useful for learning about the world and building relationships than the other again cynicism is a theory that's kind of locked in that no matter what people show you their true colors are uh again untrustworthy and self-oriented it's a hyper darwinian view right that that ultimately people red and tooth and Claw um skepticism is instead uh the I guess restlessness uh with our assumptions a desire for new information one way I often think about it is that cynics think a little bit like lawyers right they have a decision that they've already made about you and about everybody and they're just waiting for evidence that supports their point and when evidence comes in that doesn't support their point they explain it away right and you see this actually that cynical people will offer more ulterior motives when uh they see an act of kindness for instance they'll explain it away in that way I think cynics actually are quite similar to the naive trusting gullible folks that they love to make fun of right naive gullibility is trusting people in a credulous unthinking way I would say cynicism is mistrusting people in a credulous and unthinking way so if if cynics then think like lawyers sort of in the prosecution Against Humanity Skeptics think more like scientists uh skepticism you know classically in philosophy is the belief that you can never truly know anything but as we think about it now it's more uh the desire for evidence to underly any claim that you believe uh and the great thing about skepticism is it doesn't require an ounce of naive you can be absolutely sharp in deciding I don't want to trust this person or I do want to trust this person but it allows you to update and learn from specific acts specific instances and specific people when I think about scientists one of the first things I think about is not just their willingness but their excitement to embrace complexity yes like okay these two groups disagree or um these two sets of data disagree and it's the complexity of that interaction that excites them whereas when I think of cynics in the way that it's framed up in my mind which I'm getting more educated now but I I admittedly my my understanding of cynicism um is still rather uh superficial um you'll change that in the course of the uh our discussion uh but that cynics um are not embracing the complexity of disagreement they are moving away from the um certainly any notion of excitement by complexity it seems like it's a a heuristic it's a way to simplify the world around you that's exactly right uh Phil tetlock has a great uh term for this called integrative complexity to what extent can you hold different versions of the world different arguments in mind to what extent can you pick from each one what you believe based on the best evidence available right and integrative complexity is a great way to learn about the world and about the social World whereas cynicism as you rightly point out is much more of a heuristic it's a black and white form of thinking and the really sad thing is that cynicism then puts us in a position where we can't learn very much this is what in learning theory is called a wicked learning environment where and I don't want to get too nerdy well I guess I can get nerdy here get as nerdy as you want this audience likes nerdy so let's think in beian terms right so beian statistics is where you have a set of beliefs about the world you take new information in and that new information allows you to update your priors right into a posterior distribution into a new set of beliefs um and that's great that's a great way to learn about the world to adapt to new information and new circumstances a wicked learning environment is where your priors prevent you from Gathering the information that you would need to confirm or disconfirm them so think about mistrust for instance right it's easy to understand why people mistrust you know some of us are insecurely attached and we've been heard in the past we're trying to stay safe we don't want to be betrayed this is a completely natural response it's a totally understandable response but when we decide to mistrust we never are able to learn whether the people who we are mistrusting uh would have been trustworthy or not when we trust we can learn whether we've been right or not right somebody can betray us and that hurts and we remember it for years or more often than not the data turn out to show us they can honor that trust we can build a relationship we can uh we can start a collaboration we can live a full social life and it turns out that the problem is that trusting people incorrectly you do learn from but mistrusting people incorrectly you don't learn from because the missed opportunities are are invisible to us wow there's certainly a lot there that maps to many people's experience so you pointed out that some degree of cynicism likely has roots in insecure attachment that said if one looks internationally do we find cultures where it's very hard to find cynics um and there could be any number of reasons for this or perhaps even more interestingly uh do we find cultures where there really is isn't even a word for cynicism wow uh I I love that question there is a lot of variance in and the the data on cynicism are much more local to the US typically I mean for for uh for better and For Worse a lot of research on this is done in an American context but that said uh there's a lot of data on generalized trust which you could say as an inverse of cynicism right so for instance there are National and international uh samples of major surveys which ask people whether they agree or disagree that most people can be trusted and there's a lot of variant around the world in general the cultures that are most trusting have a couple of things in common one they are more economically equal than untrusting cultures so there's a lot of great work um from uh Kate Willet and uh Richard Wilkinson um that uh they they have a book called the spirit level where they look at inequality across the world and related to Public Health outcomes and one of them is trust um there's also variance in trust over time you know so you can look at not just are there places or cultures that trust more than others but when does a culture trust more or less and in the US that's sadly a story of decline in 1972 about half of Americans believed that most people can be trusted and by 2018 that had fallen to about a third of americ am an and that's a drop as big just to put it in perspective as the stock market took in the financial collapse of 2008 so so there's a lot of variance here um both across space and time and one of the not the only but one of the uh seeming characteristics of cultures that tracks that is how unequal they are in part because research suggests that when you are in a highly unequal Society economically there's a sense of zero suome competition that develops there's a sense that wait a minute anything that another person gets I lose and if you have that inherent sense of Zero Sum uh competition then it's very difficult to form bonds it's very difficult to trust other people because you might think well in order to survive this person has to try to outrun me they have to try to trip me they have to try to make me fail uh for themselves to succeed i' like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 by now many of you have heard me say that if I could take Just One supplement that supplement would be ag1 the reason for that is ag1 is the highest quality and most complete of the foundational nutritional supplements available what that means is that it contains not just vitamins and minerals but also probiotics prebiotics and adaptogens to cover any gaps you may have in your diet and provide support for a demanding life for me even if I eat mostly Whole Foods and minimally processed foods which I do for most of my food intake it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits and vegetables vitamins and minerals micronutrients and adaptogens from food alone for that reason I've been taking ag1 daily since 2012 and often twice a day once in the morning or midm morning and again in the afternoon or evening when I do that it clearly bolsters my energy my immune system and my gut microbiome these are all critical to brain function mood physical performance and much more if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com Hu to claim their special offer right now they're giving away five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman to claim that special offer what is the relationship if any between cynicism and happiness or lack of Happiness when I think of somebody who's really cynical I think of a Oscar the Grouch or a kudin like uh character and as I asked this question I'm thinking specifically about what you said earlier about uh how cynicism prevents us from certain forms of learning that are important and very valuable to us here's the reason why I'll give just a little bit of context I remember when I was a kid my dad who went to um classic boarding schools he grew up in South America but he went to these um boarding schools that were very strict yeah and he was taught he told me that um to be cheerful and happy people would accuse you of being kind of dumb whereas if you were cynical and you acted a little bored with everything yeah people thought that you were more Discerning yeah but that he felt it was a terrible model for going through life because it it veered into cynicism my dad happens to be a scientist yeah he's a I think a relatively happy person um sorry Dad a happy person seems happy but meaning um he's a person who has happiness and he has other emotions too I wouldn't say he's happy all the time but he experiences joy and pleasure in Daily AC small things and big things in life so clearly he resued himself from that um the forces that were kind of pushing him down that path but um that's the anecdote but I use that question more as a as a way to frame up the possible collaboration between cynicism and and and you know exuding boredom or or a challenge in shifting somebody towards a like happier affect yeah um because when I think about cynic I think that they're like kind of unhappy people um and when I think about people who are not very cynical I think of them as kind of kind of cheerful and curious and um there's some aboian there they might not be tiger-like in their um in their affect but you know they kind of Veer that direction Andrew I love this trip down memory lane I'm having all these childhood memories of uh of of Tigger and Sesame Street there's so much in what you're saying I want to try to pull on a couple of threads here if that's okay first and this one is is pretty straightforward the eff of cynicism on well-being is just really documented and and quite negative so there are large prospective studies um with tens of thousands of people several of these studies that measure cynicism and then measure life outcomes uh in the years and decades afterwards and the news is is is pretty bleak for cynics right so uh absolutely lower levels of happiness flourishing satisfaction with life uh greater incidence of depression uh greater loneliness but you know it's not just the neck up that cynicism effects cynics over the course of their lives also tend to have greater degrees of cellular inflammation uh more incidence of heart disease and uh they even uh have higher rates of all cause mortality so shorter lives than non cynics and again this might sound like wait a minute you go from a philosophical Theory to a shorter life uh the answer is yeah you do because and again these are correlational studies so I don't want to draw too many causal claims but they're quite rigorous and controll for a lot of other factors but I would say that this is consistent with the idea that really one of the great Protectors of our health is our sense of connection to other people and if you are unable or unwilling to be vulnerable around others to really touch in to that type of connection it stands to reason that things like chronic stress and isolation would impact not just your mind but you know all through your your body and your organ system so again the news here is not great and I often think about you know one of the best encapsulations of a cynical view of Life comes from Thomas Hobbs the philosopher who in his book Leviathan said we need a restrictive government because left to our own devices human life is nasty brutish and short and ironically I think that might describe the lives lives of cynics themselves more than most people so that's point one right is that there is this pretty Stark negative correlation between cynicism and a lot of Life outcomes that we might want for ourselves but point two I think is related to what your dad also noticed which is that right if cynicism hurts us so much why would we adopt it right if it was a pill if there was a pill that as its side effects listed depression loneliness heart disease and early death it would be a poison right would have a skull and crossbones on the bottle but yet we're swallowing it more of us are swallowing it than we did in years and decades past why well one of the answers I think is because our culture glamorizes cynicism it's because of the very stereotype that your father pointed out which is that if you're happy gol lucky if you trust people that kind of seems dull it seems like maybe you're not that sharp maybe you don't understand the world and there is that strong uh relationship in in our stereotypes in our models of the world Susan Fisk and many other psychologists have studied warmth and competence right how friendly and uh caring does somebody seem and how able do they seem to accomplish hard things and it turns out that in many studies people's perception is that these are inversely correlated that if you're warm maybe you're not that competent and if you're competent maybe you shouldn't be that warm and in fact if you tell people to act as compet ently as they can they'll often respond by being a little bit less nice a little bit less warm than they would be otherwise there's also data that find that you know where people are presented in surveys with a cynic and a non cynic they're told about here's one person they really think that people are great overall and they tend to be trusting here's another person who thinks that people are kind of out for themselves and really doesn't trust most folks and then they'll ask those people who should we pick for this difficult intellectual task uh and 70% of respondents pick a cynical person over a non- cynic for difficult intellectual tasks 85% of people think that cynics are socially wiser that they'd be able for instance to detect who's lying and who's telling the truth so most of us put a lot of faith in people who don't have a lot of faith in people ironically and even more ironically we're wrong to do so Olga Stova this great psychologist who studies cynicism has this paper called the cynical genius illusion where she uh documents all these biases the way that we think cynics are bright and wise and then uses National Data tens of thousands of people to show that actually cynics do less well on cognitive tests on mathematical tests that trust is related with things like intelligence and education and um that in in other work uh this is not from Olga Stova but from others that actually cynics do less well than non cynics in detecting Liars because if you have a blanket assumption about people you're not actually attending to evidence in a sharp way you're not actually taking in new information and making wise decisions in other words cynics are not being scientific their hypothesis is cast but they're not looking at the data equally right and we should remind people that a hypothesis is not a question uh every gr experiment starts with a question and then you generate a hypothesis which is a uh a theory or conclusion essentially uh made upfront and then you go collect data and you see if you prove or disprove the hypothesis yeah and you can never really prove a hypothesis you can only uh support it or not support it with the data that you collect depending on the Precision of your tools but uh um that's very interesting because I would think that if we view cynic as smarter which clearly they're not as a group right you're saying cynics are not more intelligent right you I believe that's covered in in your book and um and if one knows that then you know why do we send cynic in uh kind of like razors to uh you know to assess what um what the environment is like is that because um we'd rather have others um deployed for us to to kind of like weed people out is it that we're willing to um accept some false negatives meaning um for those that I guess we're using a little bit of semi- technical language here false negatives who would be you know you're trying to assess a group of people that would be uh terrific employees yeah and you send in somebody to interview them that's uh very cynical so presumably in one's mind that filter of cynicism is only going to allow in people that are really really right for the job yeah and we're willing to accept that you know there probably two or three uh candidates that would also be right for the job but we're willing to let them go some false some false negatives um as opposed to having someone get through the filter who really can't do the job like we're willing to let certain opportunities go by being cynical or by deploying a cynic as the you know I'm imagining the person with the clipboard you know um very rigid like cynicism and rigidity seem to go together so that's why I'm lumping these kind of uh psychological phenotypes no I I think that's absolutely right and so a couple of things one you know you said that if we know that cynics aren't smarter than non- cynics why are we deploying them well let's be clear we know this meaning you you and I know this and scientists know this but the data show that most people don't know this that we maintain The Stereotype in our culture that being negative about people means that you've been around the block enough times that it is a form of wisdom so that's a stereotype that I think we need to dispel first of all but I do think that to your point when we deploy cynics out in the field you know when we say I'm going to be nice but I want somebody who's really pretty negative who's really pretty suspicious to protect me or to protect my community I think that's a really again understandable Instinct almost from an evolutionary perspective you know we are built to pay lots of attention to threats in our environment and threats to our community and in the early social world you know if you wind I mean just to do some back of the envelope evolutionary psychology if you wind the clock back 100 150,000 years what's you know what is the greatest threat to early communities it's it's people right it's people who would take advantage of our communal nature right the thing that allows human beings to thrive is that we collaborate um but that collaboration means that a free rider somebody who chooses to not pitch in but still take take out from the common pool anything that they want can do exceptionally well they can live a life of leisure on the backs of a community that's working hard and if if you select then for that type of person if that type of person proliferates then the community collapses so it makes sense that we uh depend on cynics from that perspective from a threat mitigation perspective from a risk aversion perspective but it doesn't make sense from the perspective of trying to optimize our actual social lives right and I think that often times you know we are risk averse in general meaning that we're more scared of negative outcomes than we are uh enticed by positive outcomes but in the social world that risk aversion is I I I think quite harmful in a lot of demonstrable ways is cynicism domain specific and there again I'm using jargon meaning if somebody is cynical in one environment like cynical about the markets like well things are up now but you know have an election come so things could go this way or that way depending you know um do they tend to be cynical about other aspects of Life other domains so there's a little bit of data on this um and it suggests a couple of things one left to our own devices our levels of cynicism tend to be pretty stable over time uh and also decline in older adulthood Contra The Stereotype of the kinly older person but another is that cynicism does tend to be pretty domain General so for instance cynics uh you know people and and this makes sense if you look at questionnaires that assess cynicism which are things like people are honest chiefly through fear of getting caught or most people really don't like helping each other I mean if you're answering those questions positively you're just not a fan of you're probably not great at parties you're you're not a fan of people and it turns out that people answer the this is an old scale developed by a couple of psychologists named Walter cook and Donald medley in the 1950s if you answer the cook medley hostility scale if you answer these questions positively you tend to be less trusting of strangers but you also tend to for instance have less trust in your romantic Partnerships you have less trust in your friends and you have less trust in your colleagues so this is sort of an allpurpose view of the world at least as cook and medleaf first uh first thought about it but I do want to build on a great intuition you have which is that different environments might bring out cynicism or Tamp it down and it turns out that that's also very true as trait-like as cynicism can be there's lots of evidence that the type of social environment we're in matters a lot one of my favorite studies in this domain um came from uh Southeastern Brazil there are two fishing villages in in Southeastern Brazil they're separated by about 30 40 miles they're similar in socioeconomic status religion culture but there's one big difference between them one of the villages sits on the ocean and in order to fish on the ocean you need big boats heavy equipment you can't do it alone you must work together the other Village is on a lake where fishermen strike out on small boats alone and they compete with one another about 10 years ago economy this was a study led by Andreas LeBron a really great Economist they went to these Villages and they gave the the folks who work there a bunch of social games to play these were not with fellow fishermen but with strangers games like would you trust somebody with some money and see if they then want to share dividends with you or given some money yourself would you like to share some of it with another person and they found that when they start in their careers Lake fisherman and ocean fishermen were equally trusting and equally trustworthy as well but over the course of their careers they diverged being in a collaborative environment where people must count on one another to survive made people over time more trusting and more trustworthy being in a competitive Zero Sum environment over time made people less trusting and less trustworthy now one thing that always amazes me about this work is that people people in both of these environments are right if you're in a competitive environment you don't trust and your right to not trust if you're in a collaborative environment you do trust and your right to trust and this is from the point of view of economic games and I think much broadly construed as well so one question then becomes well which of these environments do we want to be in right I think the costs in terms of well-being and relationships is quite obvious if you're in a competitive environment and then the the second question of course is how do we put ourselves in the type of environment that we want knowing that that environment will change who we are over the course of our lives so much of schooling in this country is based on at first cooperation like we're all going to sit around and listen to a story and then we're going to work in small groups but in my experience over time it evolves into more Independent Learning and competition they post the distribution of scores that's largely uh the distribution of individual scores there are exeptions to this of course like I think I've never been to business school but I think they form small groups and work on projects it's true in computer science at the undergraduate level and and so on but uh to what extent do you think having a mixture of Cooperative learning still competition perhaps between groups as well as individual learning and competition can foster um kind of a an erosion of cynicism because it sounds like being cynical is I I don't want to be hard on on the synic here but um they're probably already hard on themselves and everybody else um we know they're hard on everybody else but um oh there there was my presumption okay I'm going to stay open-minded maybe they're not you'll tell me um that you know that they are on average less intelligent is what I'm hearing that um and that there's a something really big to be gained from anybody who decides to embrace novel ideas even if they decide to stick with their original decision about others or something you know provided they explore the data in an open-minded way even transiently it sounds like there's an opportunity there uh you gave a long-term example of these two uh fishing scenarios um so the neuroplasticity takes you know years but we know neuroplasticity can be pretty quick would imagine if you expose a cynic to a um to a counter example to their belief that it's not going to erode all of their cynicism but it might make a little dent in that neural circuit for cynicism yeah this is a a great perspective and you know a couple of things I want to be clear on one I am not here to judge or impune cynics I should confess that I myself struggle with cynicism and have for my entire life part of my journey to learn more about it and even to write this book was an attempt to understand myself and to see if it is possible to unlearn cynicism because frankly I wanted to so you will get no judgment from me of people who feel like like it's hard to trust um I I think that another point that you're bringing out that I want to cosign is that saying that competition over the long term Zero Sum competition can erode our trust isn't the same as saying that we should never compete competition is beautiful I mean it it's the Olympics are going on right now and it's amazing to see what people do when they are at odds trying to best one another that's it's incredible Feats are lished when we focus on the great things that we can do and often times we are driven to Greatness by people we respect who are trying to be greater than us so absolutely competition can be part of a very healthy social structure and a very healthy life um I think that the broader question is whether we canr that competition at the level of a task or at the level of the person in fact there's a lot of work in the science of conflict and conflict resolution that looks at the difference between task conflict and personal conflict you know you can imagine in a workplace two people have different ideas for how they want for what direction they want to take a project in well that's great if it leads to healthy debate and if that is mutually respectful but the minute that that turns into blanket judgments about the other person oh the reason that they want this direction is because they're not so bright or because they don't have Vision or because they're trying to gain favor that's when we go from healthy skeptical conflict into cynical and destructive conflict and you see this with athletes as well athletes often are very good friends and some of the people they respect the most are the folks who they're battling in the case of of uh of of contact Sports and boxing literally battling but they can have immense and positive regard for one another outside of the ring in those contexts so I think that there's a huge difference between competition that's oriented on tasks which can help us be the best version of ourselves and competition that bleeds into judgment suspicion and mistrust I'd like to take us back just briefly to these developmental stages um maybe I'm um bridging two things that don't belong together but I'm thinking about the young brain which of course is hyperplastic um and comparing that to the older brain but the young brain learns a number of things while it does a number of things it handles heart rate digestion Etc unconsciously and then in many ways the neuroplasticity that occurs early in life is to establish these maps of prediction you know if uh you know Things fall down not up in general Things fall down not up um and so on so that mental real estate can be used for other things and learning new things so I'm I'm thinking about the sort of classic example of object permanence you know you you show a baby a um you know a block or a toy and then you hide that toy and they at a certain age a very young age will look as if it's gone and then you bring it back and then they're amazed and then at some point along their developmental trajectory they learn object permanence they know that it's behind your back okay and then uh we hear that characters like Santa Claus are real and then eventually learn that they're not and so on and so on in many ways we go from being um completely non- cynical about the physical world to being um one could sort of view it as cynical about the physical world right like uh I love to see magic in fact we had probably the world's best or among the very best magicians uh on this podcast uh Azie wind he's a mentalist and magician and to see him do magic even as an adult who understands that the laws of physics apply they seem to defy the laws of physics in in real time and it just blows your mind to the point where you you like how that can't be but you you sort of want it to be and at some point you just go you know what it's it's what we call Magic so it seems to me that cynics um apply almost physics Like rules to social interaction like that um they talk in terms of like first principles of human interactions right they talk about um this group always this and that group always that right the these like strict categories thick black lines between between categories as opposed to any kind of blending of of understanding or uh blending of rules and one can see how that would be a really useful heuristic but as we're learning it's it's not good in the sense that we don't want to judge but it's not good if our goal is to learn more about the world or learn the most information about the world can we say that uh yes and I I appreciate you saying yeah I I I also try to avoid good bad language or moral judgment but I think that many of us have the goals of having strong relationships and of of flourishing psychologically and of learning accurately about the world and if those are your goals I think it's fair to say that cynicism can block your way towards them I love this I I've never thought about it in this way but I I love that perspective and there is almost a philosophical certainty maybe it's not a happy philosophical certainty but we love to right human beings love explanatory power we love to be able to have laws that determine what will happen and the laws of physics are some of our most reliable right and really we all use theories to predict the world right I mean we all have a theory of gravity that lives inside our head we don't think objects with mass attract one another but we know if we drop a bowling ball on our foot we're going to probably maybe not walk for the next week at least right so so we use theories to provide explanatory Simplicity to a vast and overwhelmingly complex world and absolutely I think cynicism has a great function in simplifying but of course in simplifying we lose a lot of the detail we lose a lot of the Wonder that maybe we experienced uh earlier in life and you know I do want to your your beautiful description of kids and their sort of sense of I suppose perennial surprise um makes me think about another aspect of what we lose to cynicism which is the ability to witness the beauty of Human Action and human kindness my friend daker Kelner studies awe you know this emotion of experiencing something vast and and also experiencing ourselves as small and a part of that vastness and he he wrote a great book on awe um and in it he talks about his research where he cataloged what are the experiences that most commonly produce awe in a large sample large representative sample of people now I don't know about you Andrew but when I think about awe my first go-to is Carl Sean's pale blue dot this image of a kind of Nebula band or you know sort of sort of cluster basically Stardust really and there's one dot in it with an arrow and and Carl San says that dot is Earth and every King and Tyrant and mother and father and every person who's ever fallen in love and every person who's ever had their heartbroken they're all on that tiny dot there I go to that I show that to my kids all the time when I think of awe I think of outer space I think of Groves of redwood trees I think of Drone footage of the Himalayas right but daer finds that if you ask people what they experience a in response to the number one category is what he calls moral Beauty everyday acts of kindness giving compassion and connection this is also related to what daer and John hey talk about in terms of moral elevation witnessing positive actions that actually make us feel like we're capable of more and moral beauty is everywhere if you are open to it it is the most common thing that will make you feel the vastness of our species and to have a lawful physics like prediction about the world that blinkers you from seeing that that that that that gives you tunnel vision and prevents you from experiencing moral Beauty seems like a tragic form of Simplicity I'd like i' like to take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors function I recently became a function member after searching for the most comprehensive approach to lab testing while I've long been a fan of blood testing I really wanted to find a more in-depth program for analyzing blood urine and saliva to get a full picture of my heart health my hormone status my immune system regulation my metabolic function my vitamin and mineral status and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality function not only provides testing of over 100 biomarkers to physical and mental health but it also analyzes these results and provides insights from talk doctors on your results for example in one of my first tests with function I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood this was totally surprising to me I had no idea prior to taking the test function not only helped me detect this but offered medical doctor informed insights on how to best reduce those mercury levels which included limiting my tuna consumption because I'd been eating a lot of tuna while also making an effort to eat more greens and supplementing with Knack and acetal cysteine both of which can support glutathione production and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels comprehensive lab testing like this is so important for health and while I've been doing it for years I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive I've been so impressed by function both at the level of ease of use that is getting the test done as well as how comprehensive and how actionable the tests are that I recently joined their Advisory Board and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast tast if you'd like to try function go to function health.com huberman function currently has a weight list of over 250,000 people but they're offering Early Access to hubman lab listeners again that's function health.com huberman to get early access to function I love that your examples of a both pale blue dot and uh everyday compassion Bridge the to uh what I think of as um time domains that the or I should say space time s that the brain can Encompass you know this has long fascinated me about the human brain and presumably other animals brains as well which is that you know we can sharpen our um aperture to you know something so so small and pay attention to just like the the immense Beauty and you know like I have a lot of ants in my yard right now and lately I've been watching them interact because they were driving me crazy they were just like I you know they're like everywhere this summer and they're climbing on me and I thought I'm just kind of like watch what they do and clearly a structure there I know um Deborah Gordon at Stanford has has studied amp behavior and others and it's like there's a lot going on there but then you look up from there you're like wow there's a big yard and then the sense of awe for me is that interactions like that must be going on everywhere in this in this yard and you know it frames up that the aperture of our cognition in space and in time you know covering small distances quickly or small distance and slowly and then then we can zoom out literally and think about us on this ball in space right you know and um and that ability I think is is incredible and that awe can be captured at um these different extremes of SpaceTime um cognition amazing it seems to me what you're saying is that cynicism and awe are also opposite ends of the Continuum and that's taking us in a direction slightly different than I was going to try and take us but I I love that we're talking about awe because um to me it feels like it's a more extreme example of delight um and I'd like you to um perhaps if if there's any examples of of research on this you know um touch on to what extent uh a sense of cynicism divorces us from delight and awe or uh I guess their um collaborator uh which is creativity to me everything you're saying about cynicism makes it sound anti- creative because you're by definition you're eliminating possibility and creativity of course is the unique original combination of existing things or the creation of new things Al together creativity yeah um so what if anything has been studied about the relationship between uh cynicism I guess we call it uh open-mindedness and uh creativity and or awe yeah great questions and there is some work on this and a lot of it comes actually in the context of the workplace right so you can examine I mean these Brazilian fish fishing villages were after after all workplaces right that led people to more or less cynicism but other workplaces also have structures that make people more or less able to trust one another one version of this is what's known as stack ranking and um you know this is where people managers are forced to pick the highest performing and lowest performing members of their team and in essence eliminate the people who are at the bottom 10% every six or 12 months stack ranking has thankfully mostly fallen out of favor in in the corporate world but it was very uh Durer um in the late 20th and early 21st century you know up until 10 or so years ago and it still exists in some places and the idea again was if you want people to be creative if you want them to do their best tap into who they really are and who are we really we are really a hyper individualistic again Darwin species it's really stack ranking is a social darwinist approach to management and the idea is well great if you threaten people if you make them want to defeat one another they will be at their most creative uh when they are trying to do that right that that it will bring out their best the opposite is true I mean stack ranked workplaces of course are miserable the people in them are uh quite unhappy and more likely to leave their jobs but some of the more interes interesting work pertains to what stack ranking does to creativity because it turns out that if your job is to just not be at the bottom of the pile then the last thing you want to do is take a creative risk you do not want to go out on a limb you do not want to try something new if other people are going to go after you for doing that and if you screw up or if it doesn't go well you're eliminated from the group right so so I think you're exactly right that these cynical environments are also highly conservative I of course don't mean politically conservative I mean conservative in terms of the types of choices that people make and that's sort of I think at the level of individual creativity but there's also a cost at the level of what we might call group creativity right a lot of our best ideas come not from our minds but from the space between us from dialogue uh or from group conversation and it turns out that in stacked rank zero some environments people are less willing to share knowledge and perspective because doing so amounts to helping your enemy succeed which is the same as helping yourself fail so to the extent that creativity requires a sort of collaborative mindset then cynicism is uh is is preventative of that and there's actually some terrific work um uh by by Anita wooly and colleagues uh that looks at group intelligence collective intelligence this is the idea that of course people have levels of intelligence that can be measured in various ways and have various forms of intelligence as well but groups when they get together have a type of intelligence and especially creative problem-solving intelligence that goes above and beyond the sum of their parts that can't be explained and actually in some cases is almost orthogonal to the intelligence of the individuals in that group right controlling for the intelligence of individuals there's a group factor that still matters and so Anita willly and others have looked at well what predicts that type of collective intelligence and a couple of factors matter one is people uh people's ability to understand each other's emotions so interpersonal sensitivity but another is their willingness to in essence pass the mic to share the conversation and to collaborate and so again uh succeeding thriving optimizing and being creative both at the individual and at the group level require environments where we feel free and where we feel safe and where we feel that contributing to somebody else can also contribute to ourselves it's so interesting to think about all of this in the context of neuroplasticity I I feel like one of the Holy Grails of Neuroscience is to finally understand you know what are the gates to neuroplasticity we understand a lot about the cellular mechanisms we know it's possible throughout the lifespan we know that there's sure a an involvement of different neuromodulators and and so on but um at the level of um kind of human behavior and emotional stance uh not technical uh not a technical term but I'll use it of say being um curious like to me curiosity is an interest in the outcome with no specific emotional attachment to the outcome but of course we could say you're curious with the hope of getting a certain result you know so one could modify it but there is something about that uh childlike mind so-called beginner's mind where you're open to different outcomes and it seems like the examples that you're giving keep bringing me back to these developmental themes because if it's true that CICS you know exclude a lot of data that could be useful to them um it seems that the opportunities for neuroplasticity are reduced for cynic um to flip it on its head um to what extent are we all a little bit cynical and how would we explore that like if if I were in your laboratory and you had 10 minutes with me and you what questions would you ask me um to determine how cynical I might be or how um not cynical I might be well the first thing that I would do is give you that classic questionnaire from cook and Med which would just ask you about your theories of the world what do you think people are like do you think that people are generally honest do you think that they are generally trustworthy so it loads the questions or it's open-ended where I would would you say what what are people like and then I would um just kind of free associate about it's a series of 50 statements and you're asked in a binary way do you agree or disagree with each of these statements since then olus aova and others have adapted cook medley and made it a shorter scale and turned the questions into Contin 1 to n or 1 to S uh answers um but generally speaking these are discret questions that numerically or quantitatively tap our general theories of people if you were in my lab I might also ask you to play some different economic games you know the trust game being the number one that we might use here so I can explain it um so the trust game involves two players uh and one of them is an investor they start out with some amount of money let's just say $10 they can send as much of that money as they want to a trustee the money is then tripled in value so if the investor sends $10 it the in the hands of the trustee it becomes $30 the trustee can then choose to give back whatever amount they want to the investor so they can be exactly fair and give 15 back in which case both people end up pretty much better off than they would have without an act of trust the trustee can keep all $30 themselves betraying the investor or the trustee can give more than 50% back they can say well I started out with nothing why did you take two-thirds back and this is one terrific behavioral measure of trust and it can be played in a couple of different ways one is binary where I would say Andrew do you you can send $10 to an internet stranger or you can send nothing and they can choose to send you back half or they can choose to send you back nothing would you do it I I actually I'm curious would would you do that oh I absolutely zip it over to them yeah yeah I'm curious great you know and and I'm willing to lose the money um so I suppose that factors in as well yeah follow-up question in that type of study what percentage of Trustees do you think make the trustworthy decision of sending back the money gosh 55% yeah so your prediction there is quite aligned with most people's uh um there's a great study by fetchenhauer and and and Dunning uh that found that uh people when they're asked to forecast they say I bet 52 55% of people will send this money back will make this binary trust decision uh in fact 80% of Trustees make the pro-social and trustworthy decision uh and again what fetchenhauer and Dunning found is that when we when we have negative assumptions we're less likely to send over the money and therefore less likely to learn that we were wrong right uh and so that's one of it's another example of where cynical beliefs I mean you you're interesting because you had the belief that's a 50% chance but you still chose to trust right so From abasan perspective when that person actually sent the money back which they would have an 80% chance of doing and if if I were to ask you again what percentage of people give back you might update your perception absolutely right uh but without any evidence you can't update your perception so and this is just one of many examples it turns out that there's a lot of evidence that when asked to estimate how friendly trustworthy uh compassionate or open-minded others are people's estimates come in much lower than data suggest and this to me is both the tragedy of cynical thinking those heuristics that we're using and a major opportunity for so many of us right it's a tragedy because we're coming up with these simple uh black and white physics likee predictions about the world and they're often wrong they're often unduly negative an opportunity because to the extent that we can tap into a more scientific or curious mindset to the extent that we can open ourselves to the data pleasant surprises are are everywhere the social world is full of a lot more positive and helpful and kind people than we realize right the the average person underestimates the average person this is not to say that there aren't awful PE you know people who do awful things every day around the world there of course are but we take those extreme examples and over rotate on them we assume that the most toxic awful examples that we see are representative when they're not so we miss all these opportunities but understanding that I hope opens people to uh to to gaining more of those opportunities to using them and and and to finding out more accurate and more hopeful information about each other there does seem to be a salience about uh negative interactions or somebody stealing from us or doing something that we consider cruel to us or to others nowadays with social media we get a window into gosh probably billions of social interactions in the form of comments and clapbacks and retweets and and there certainly is benevolence on social media but what if any data exists about um how social media either feeds uh or impedes cynicism or maybe it doesn't change it at all um and I should say that there's also the kind of um I have to be careful I'm trying not to be cynical um there I maintain the the view that certain social media platforms um encourage uh a bit more negativity than others um and certainly there are accounts I'm trying to think of like accounts like uh on Instagram like Upworthy which it's a whole basis is to you know promote positive stuff I like that account very much um but certainly you can find the full array of emotions on social media uh to what extent is just being on social media regardless of platform increasing or decreasing cynicism it's a it's a terrific question uh it's hard to provide a very clear answer and I don't want to get out over my skis with what is known and what's not known social media has been a tectonic shift in our lives it has coincided with a rise in cynicism but as you know history is not an experiment so you can't take two temporal trends that are coincident with one another and say that one caused the other that said my own intuition and a lot of the data suggest that in at least some ways social media is a cynicism Factory right I mean so so let's first stipulate how much time we're spending on there I mean the average person uh goes through 300 feet of social media feed a day is that right they've measured it in feet approximately the height of the Statue of Liberty yeah so we're we're doing one Statue of Liberty worth of scrolling a day much of it Doom scrolling if if if you're anything like me at least um and so then the question becomes what are we seeing when we scroll for that long who are we seeing and are they representative of what people are really like and the answer in a lot of ways is uh no that what we see on social media is not representative of the human population so there's a lot of evidence uh a lot of this comes from uh from William Brady now at Northwestern and Molly Crockett uh that when people tweet for instance I mean this a lot of this is done on on the site formerly known as Twitter when people tweet in Outrage and when they tweet negatively and when they tweet about in particular immorality right moral outrage that algorithmically those tweets are broadcast further they're shared more and this does a couple of things one it reinforces the people who are already tweeting in that way so William Brady has this great work using a kind of reinforcement learning model right reinforcement learning is where you do something you're rewarded and that reward makes you more likely to do that same thing again and it turns out that uh that Brady found that when people tweet in Outrage and then get egg Ed on and often times I should say this is tribal in nature it's somebody tweeting against somebody who's an outsider and then being rewarded by people who they consider to be part of their group right when that happens that person is more likely in their future tweets to turn up the volume on that outrage and on that moral outrage in particular so there's a sort of Ratchet effect right on the people who are sharing but a second question becomes well what about the people watching what about the rest of us Claire Robertson has a great paper on this where she documents that a vast majority I mean 90 plus% of tweets are created by the 10% of the most active users right and this is in the political sphere and these are probably not representative these folks not representative of the rest of us in terms of how extreme uh and maybe how how bitter their opinions are and so we when we're scrolling that Statue of Liberty's worth of information we think that we're seeing the world we think that we're seeing our fellow citizens we think that we're getting a picture of what people are like in fact we're pulling from the fringes and what this leads to is a misconstrual of what the world is really like this is by the way not just part of social media it's also part of Legacy Media communication theorists talk about something called The mean world syndrome right where the more time that you spend looking at the news for instance the more you think violent crime is up in your area the more you think you're in danger of violent crime even during years when violent crime is decreasing I'm old enough to remember uh when stranger danger was this big uh massive story and every time you wanted cereal the milk carton would have a picture of a kid who had been kidnapped by a stranger and during that time if you ask people how many kids are being kidnapped by strangers in the US they would they would in many cases say 50,000 children are being kidnapped each year in the US 50 can you imagine what the world would it would be there would be SWAT teams on every corner the real number in those years was closer to 100 kids per year now let me be clear each one of those is an absolute tragedy but there's a big difference here and often times when we tune into media we end up with these enormously warped perceptions where think that the world is much more dangerous than it really is we think that people are much more extreme than they really are and because stories of immorality go viral so much more often than stories of everyday goodness I mean I love Upworthy as well but it's not winning right now in the in the in the social media Wars not yet not yet and so this leaves us all absolutely exhausted and also feeling alone people who feel like wow I actually don't feel that much outrage or I don't want to feel that much outrage I actually don't want to hate everybody who's different from me for instance uh I'm just exhausted by all this we feel like well I guess I'm the only one because everybody else seems real excited about this battle royale that we've put ourselves in but in fact most people are just like the exhausted majority right we're paying so much attention to a to a tiny minority of what the journalist Amanda Ripley calls conflict entrepreneurs people who Stoke conflict on purpose that were confusing them with the average so much there um I I have a I suppose a mixed relationship to social media I teach there and I learn there and I also have to be very Discerning in terms of how I interact with it and um you made this point that I've never heard anyone make before um which is that many people feel alone BYT the fact that they don't share in this Waring nature um that they see on social media it's almost like um sometimes I feel like I'm watching a combat sport that I don't feel quite um cut out for yeah and um and then when I'm away from it I feel better um but I like everybody else sometimes will you know get sucked into the you know highly Salient nature of of a combat between between groups on social media it's it's um can be very alluring um in the worst ways yeah um this mean world syndrome uh what's the inverse of that the kind world syndrome I suppose um but attempts at creating those sorts of social media platforms have been made things like blue sky which has other aspects to it as well but um and while it may be thriving I don't know I haven't checked um recently uh it seems like people aren't really interested in being on there as much as they are these other platforms clearly the numbers play out that way uh why do you think that is well we as a species I think are characterized by what we would call negativity bias right negative events and threats Loom larger in our minds and that happens in a number of domains our decision- making uh is Nega is negatively biased in that we'd prefer to avoid a negative outcome than to pursue a positive outcome that's the classic work of kanaman and tersi for instance uh The Impressions that we form uh are often negatively skewed so classic work in Psychology going back to the 1950s shows that if you uh if you teach somebody about a new person who they've never met and you list three positive qualities that this person has and three negative qualities people will very much judge the person on their worst qualities and also remember more about their negative qualities than about their positive qualities and again you can see why this would be part of who we are because we need to protect one another we also tend to by the way not just think in a negatively biased way but speak and share in a negatively biased way in my lab we had a study where people witnessed other groups of four playing an economic game where they could be selfish or they could be um or or they could be uh positive and we asked them okay we're going to ask you to share a piece of information about one of the people you were playing this game with um for a future generation of participants who would you like to share about and when somebody in a group acted in a selfish way they people shared information about them three times more often than when they acted in a generous way so we gossip negatively and again that gossip is pro-social the idea is if there's somebody out there harming my community of course I'm going to shout about them from the rooftops because I want to protect my friends it's a very Noble Instinct in a way but we further found that when we actually showed a new generation of participants the gossip that the first generation shared and we asked hey how generous and how selfish were people in that first generation they vastly underestimated that group's generosity does that make sense in other words in trying to protect our communities we send highly biased information about who's in our community and give other people the wrong idea of who we are and I see that unfolding on social media every day of my life every day that I'm on social media I do try to take breaks but when I'm on there I I see it and to your question you know what do we do here you know why don't positive networks positive information why doesn't it uh proliferate more I think it's because of these ingrained biases in our mind and I understand that that can sound fatalistic because it's like oh maybe this is just who we are but I don't think that we generally accept our instincts and biases as uh as a life sentence as as a as a as Destiny a lot of us well human beings in general have the instinct to trust and be kinder towards people who look like us versus people who don't for instance who share our racial makeup none of us I think or few of us sit here and say well I have that bias in my mind so I guess I'm always going to be racially biased we try to counteract those instincts we try to become aware of those biases depressed people have the bias to see themselves as worthless and to interpret new information they receive through that framework well therapy is the attempt to say I don't want to feel this way anymore I want to fight the default settings in my mind I want to try to explore curiosity to to explore something new so to say that this toxic environment that we're in corresponds with some of our biases is to me not the same as saying we are destined to remain in that situation do you think it's possible to be adequately informed about threats to be able to live one's life in the most adaptive way uh while not being on social media none none of the social media platforms um Can can you have a a great life that way a safe life this is a quasi philosophical question but from my perspective absolutely I mean I think some of the threats that we learn about on social media are simply wrong they're they're they're they're Phantom threats the we're we're we're made to fear something that actually is not happening made to fear a group of people who are not as dangerous as they're made out to be on social media of course I think being informed about the world around us matters to staying safe but again I think we can also more broadly construe what safety is you know if being on social media makes you avoidant of Taking Chances on people if it makes you feel as though anybody who's different from you ideologically for instance is bloodthirsty and extreme that's going to limit your life in very important ways and you can talk about being safe in terms of safe from acute threats but as we've talked about living a diminished and disconnected life is its own form of danger over a longer time Horizon so really you know there is a lot there are a lot of ways in which in in in the attempt to stay safe right now we introduce ourselves to long-term danger I'm not antisocial media but um I have to Circle back on this yet again uh former guest on this podcast one of our most popular episodes is with a former Navy SEAL David goggin who's um known for many things but um Chief among them is striving and pushing oneself and David has said many times that nowadays it's easier than ever to be extraordinary because most people are basically spending time just consuming um experiences on social media and doing a lot less just literally doing a lot less not just exercising and running as he does although by the way he's in school to become a paramedic so he's essentially gone to medical school um and is always doing a bunch of other things as well so um he's also an intellectual learner um now I don't know if I agree with him completely but it's an interesting statement you know if social media is um bringing out our cynicism polarizing us and perhaps um taking away I I would probably agree with David uh at least to some extent taking away our um time where we could be generative writing thinking uh socializing um building in other ways of uh that one builds their life then I guess an important question is do you think social media could be leveraged to decrease sinicism or as you referred to it to generate hopeful skepticism like this notion of hopeful uh skepticism as a replacement for cynicism is something that is really intriguing like what would that look like like if we were just going to do the gonan experiment here like what what would a feed on social media look like that um fed hopeful uh skepticism as opposed to cynicism this here's a far out example I mean I love this train of thought so I'm going to try to take it to a logical conclusion that would never actually occur in real life but but a great way to generate more accurate and hopeful skepticism and by hopeful skepticism I mean skepticism as we've described a scientific mindset a scientific perspective and a curiosity uh a hunger for information and then the hopeful piece I simply mean skepticism that begins with the understanding that our defaults are are often too negative so that I'm going to be open and I'm going to realize that my gut instinct is probably uh leading me towards the negative and can be challenged that I don't have to listen to it all the time so just as a working definition um I think that what I would want in a social media feed would be for it to have more data if you could compel every person on Earth to post to to to social media about what they're doing today about what they're thinking about what they want about their values right if you could compel each of course that's dystopic in many ways but just as a thought experiment and then people's feed was a representative sample of real people on the planet right real people uh and and people who over time right as I scroll through my Statue of Liberty now I see what people are really like I see the people who are extreme and negative and toxic but I also see you know a grandmother who's driving her grandkid to hockey practice um I see a nurse who's coming in to help an elderly patient you know I see somebody who's made an unlikely connection with somebody who they disagree with a veridical accurate feed I think would drive hopeful skepticism and that's again one of the things that has struck me most over the last few years of doing this research is that we stereotype hope and positivity as as you were saying earlier as kind of dim naive a rosec colored pair of glasses but in fact I think what the data show us is that the we're we're all wearing a pair of soot colored glasses all the time and actually the best way to make people more hopeful is to ask them to look more carefully not to look away but look towards in a more accurate and open fashion and you know there's one version of this that we've tried at Stanford in our own backyard so my lab and I we've for years been surveying uh as many Stanford undergraduates as we can about their social health right so how connected are they how mentally healthy are they um and a couple years ago we asked thousands of undergraduates to describe both themselves and the average Stanford student on a number of dimensions for instance how empathic are you how empathic is the average Stanford student how much do you like helping people who are struggling what do you think the average Stanford student would respond to that how much do you want to meet new people on campus how do you think the average student would respond and we discovered not one but two stanfords the first was made up of real students who are enormously compassionate who really want to meet new friends who want to help their friends when they're struggling the second Stanford existed in students Minds their imagination of the average undergraduate was much less friendly much less compassionate much pricker and more judgmental than real students were so again we've got this discrepancy between what people perceive and social reality we found that students who underestimated their peers were less willing to do things like strike up a conversation with a stranger or confide in a friend when they were struggling and that left them more isolated and lonelier this is the kind of vicious cycle of cynicism right but more recently my lab led by a great postto Ray pay uh tried an intervention and the intervention was as simple as you can imagine it was show students the real data we put posters in a number of dorms experimental dorms we called them that simply said hey did you know 95% of students uh at Stanford would like to help their friends who are struggling 85% want to make friends with new students we also worked with uh fros 101 a one unit class that most first year students take and show them the data we're just showing students to each other and we found that when students learned this information they were more willing to take social risks and 6 months later they were more likely to have a greater number of friends to be more socially integrated so here again is a tragic and vicious cycle and but then there's a virtuous cycle that can replace it if we just show people better information you know again I don't imagine that there'll ever be a social media feed where everybody has to post and you see an actually representative sample of the world but if we could I do think that that would generate a more more hopeful perspective because the truth is more hopeful than what we're seeing do you think there's a version of AI that is less cynical than people tend to be the reason I ask this is I I'm quite excited about and hopeful about AI I'm not one of these um I don't know what you call them but AI doomers um and it's here it's happening it's happening in the background now and I've started using AI in a number of different Realms of life and I find it to be incredible um it seems to me to combine neural networks and Google search with PubMed and it and it's fascinating it's not perfect it's far from perfect right but that's also part of its beauty is that it mimics uh human uh lack of perfectness uh well enough that it it feels something kind of like brain like personality like um you could imagine that uh given the enormous amount of cynicism that's out there that some of the large language models that make up AI uh would be somewhat cynical um would put filters that were overly stringent on certain topics um you also wouldn't want AI that was not stringent enough yeah right because we are already and soon to be uh using AI to bring us information extremely quickly and the last thing we want are errors in that information so um if we were to take what we know from humans and the data that you've collected and others have collected about ways to shift ourselves from cynicism to Hopeful skepticism do you think that's something that could be uh laced into these large language models I'm not talking about at the technical level that's be certainly beyond my my um understanding but could you build an AI version of yourself that could forage the internet for news and what's going on out there that is you know where you it's you know tuned down the the cynicism a little bit since it's difficult to be less cynical in other words could it do a better job of being you than you and then therefore make you better wow uh I love that question um I think that there is it I could imagine an opportunity for that I think one one roadblock that I don't think is insurmountable but that you would need to face in that really fascinating goal is that AI models are of course products of the data that we feed them and so if you know basically AI models eat the internet right swallow it and then give it back to us in some form to the extent that the internet is uh asymmetrically waiting right is is overweighting negative content um and cynical content then AIS that swallow that will reflect it as well I think that and I could imagine and it's it's like it's blowing my mind in real time to think about but you could uh imagine retuning the way that AI takes information to account for negativity bias and to correct this is what you're getting at I think right to correct for that negativity bias and then produce an inference that is less biased more accurate and less cynical and then give that as a kind of digest to people right so don't make me go through uh my social media feed go through it for me correct right debias it uh and then and then and then give it to me uh in a more accurate way that's an incredible idea and that's what I want um I was thinking about my Instagram feed and cynicism versus hopeful skepticism versus I guess awe um and I'll use the following examples um I subscribe to an Instagram account that I like very much which essentially just gives me images of beautiful animals in their like in their ultimate Essence it's a account by a guy named Joel sartore who works for National Geographic and he's created What's called the photo Arc he's trying to get images of all the uh world's animals um that really capture their Essence um and many of them are endangered wow um and some very close to extinction others are more um you know more prolific uh right now nonetheless I I think of that account as all goodness all benevolence and then at the Other Extreme I subscribe to an animal account called nature is metal I I we've actually collaborated with Nature's metal on a on a a great white shark grabbing a tuna um video that uh that um I didn't take but someone I was with took and we got their permission to post it in any event Nature's metal is all about the harshness of Nature and then I think about like the planet Earth series hosted by David atenor and so forth which sort of has a mixture of you know beautiful ducklings you know and um but then also animals hunting each other and dying of old age or of starvation and so the full array so I think about that as an example of you know if if you look at Nature's metal long enough you um and it's a very cool account I highly recommend people follow all three of these accounts um but if you look at it long enough you get the impression like like nature is hard life is hard out there and it can be you look at the saror account and you get the impression that you know animals are just beautiful they're just being them yeah right and um and he has such a he's he has a gift for capturing the essence of insects reptiles and mammals and everything in between so when I think about social media or I even just think about our Outlook onto the landscape of real life non- virtual life I feel like the the human brain um potentially can like all these things but what you're describing in cynicism is the people that for whatever reason they're skewed toward this view that like life is hard and therefore I need to protect myself and protect others at all times yeah in reality how Dynamic is cynicism you earlier you described how it can be domain specific but um you know if somebody is pretty cynical you know and they're you know older than 25 they're outside the sort of Developmental plasticity range you know what are the things that they can do on a daily basis to either tune down their cynicism or create room for this hopeful skepticism in a way that enriches them let's just start with them because they're after all they're cynics like that we we can't we can't bait them with uh the good that they'll do for the world but they'll do that too yeah um you know what what are what are some tools that we can all apply towards being less cynical it's a it's a brilliant question and and you're right I mean I think a lot of us are very tuned into the metal side of life and you know heavy metal is great but you know life is not all metal so how do we retune ourselves I I think about this a lot um in part because over the last several years I haven't just been studying cynicism I've been trying to counteract it in myself and in others so I've focused on practical everyday things that I can do uh and I guess they come in a bunch of categories I'm going to try to tick through them but but I I really want to hear your thoughts the first has to do with our mindsets and the ways that we that we approach our own thinking so I like to engage in a practice that I call being skeptical of my cynicism um so that is in essence taking tools from cognitive behavior behavioral therapy and applying them to my cynical inferences so again my default mode my factory settings are pretty suspicious I want to lay my cards on the table it's ironic given what I study but there we are so I often find myself in new situations suspecting people mistrusting people wondering if they might take advantage of me and what I do these days that I didn't do in the past is say well wait a minute Zaki where is this coming from you're a scientist defend your inference defend your hypothesis right what evidence do you have to back it up and very often I find that the evidence is thin to non-existent right so that challenge that just unearthing of wait a minute are you sure no you're not can can tap into a little bit of intellectual humility a second thing that I try to do is apply what my lab and I call a reciprocity mindset that is understanding that yes people vary and how trustworthy they are but what you do also matters research finds that when you trust people they're more likely to become become trustworthy because they want to reciprocate you've honored them in this small way and so they step up it's known as earned trust in economics uh and when you mistrust people they become less trustworthy so in my lab we found that when you teach people this when you teach people to own the influence that they have on others they're more willing to be trusting and when you're more trusting then of course the other person uh reciprocates which which again turns into this positive cycle so I try when I make a decision as to whether or not I'm going to trust somebody I think the default is to say whoa I'm taking on this risk is this a good choice for me and I try to rotate that a little bit and say what am I doing for the relationship here is this act of trust maybe a gift to this other person how can it positively influence who they become in the course of this interaction and then a third thing on the sort of mindset side and then we can get to some behaviors is um what I call social savoring uh I do this a lot with my kids actually you know um savoring is a general term for appreciating good things while they happen it's related to gratitude but gratitude is more appreciating the things that have happened to us in the past that are good savoring is let's grab this moment right now and and and think about it so my kids and I started savoring practices a couple years ago I call it classes so you know I'll say today we're going to do an ice cream eating class or we're going to do a sunset watching class cool I want to are you adopting children applications are coming in now we're evaluating them on a rolling basis I'm already graduate college um but so we'll just sit there you know and eat ice cream slowly you know not so that it melts but we'll say you know what are you enjoying about this is it the texture is it the flavor what do you want to remember about this moment and I noticed more recently while working on this book that all of this was sensory sunsets Sommers salts ice cream you name it but it wasn't very social and what they were hearing from me about other people was negatively skewed because gossip is negatively skewed right if somebody cut me off in traffic while I'm driving them to summer camp they learn all about that person but they don't learn about the people who are politely following traffic laws all around us right which is 90 plus percent of drivers and so I started a practice of social savoring where I try to share with my kids positive things that I notice about other people you could call it positive gossip as well and one thing that I noticed is that that habit of savoring for them changed my mental processing right it it actually changed what I noticed because of course if you're trying to tell somebody about something you look for examples that you can tell them about so a habit of action of speech in that case become became a habit of mind so those three things being skeptical of my cynicism adopting a reciprocity mindset and social savoring those are those are three of the psychological pieces and I can get to some actions but but I yeah I wonder what you think of these oh I love those three and I love the um distinguishing features of savoring versus gratitude because uh there's so much data to support gratitude practices and uh I don't think I've ever heard those two distinguished from one another but clearly savoring things is um going to be is equally powerful uh towards our neurochemistry and our well-being and I I love that you include both sensory and interpersonal aspects to this these are highly actionable and I'm I'm sure people are as excited about them as I am because um you know all this knowledge from the laboratory is indeed wonderful but of course we always want to know like what what can we do um now that you've made such a strong case for um tuning down our cynicism a little bit in order to make ourselves smarter better happier and in touch with with with awe on on a more regular basis uh would love to hear about some of the actions one can take as well yeah so if you imagine the mindset shifts that I've talked about as thinking more like a scientist about the social world then the second step to me is to act more like a scientist in the social world uh the Monk and author Pim maoon this great great writer wonderful um has uh is written beautifully about treating your life like an experiment you know in this moment you could interrupt the defaults you could interrupt the patterns and look around more carefully and I try to do that and I encourage other people to do that as well you know one form of this is what I call taking leaps of faith on other people right collecting more social data requires risk so I try to do that I try to take more risks become less risk averse in a social context now this is not to say you know that I share my bank information with a prince who's going to wire me $14 million right you need to be calculated you need to be smart and safe in the risks that you take but I would argue that many of us are far too risk averse in the social world and there are lots of ways that I try to do this and lots of ways that people can do this one is to just be more open to the social world I'm an introvert Andrew I think you've said you're an introvert as well is that is that true I am yeah and so as introverts we tend to think that the social world is maybe tiring and we need to recharge on our own I it's completely valid I experience that all the time I think that sometimes my introversion morphs into something else where I underestimate the joy of social contact you know there's so many times that before a dinner party I would pay an embarrassing amount of money for the other party to cancel on me I don't want to be the person to cancel but I I would feel so relieved if they canceled but then while I'm there and afterwards I feel totally fulfilled by the experience it's a little bit like running running is another thing that I love but there are many times that before a run I think gosh I really don't want to do this and then afterwards I'm so grateful to have done so there's a bunch of research that finds that people in general are like are like this if you ask them to forecast what it would be like to talk with a stranger um to open up about a problem that they're having with a friend to Express gratitude to try to help somebody even to have a disagreement around on ideological grounds people forecast that these conversations would be awful awkward cringe painful uh and in the case of disagreement harmful even uh this is work from Nick Epley J Schroeder and many others by the way on something known as UND sociality and because we have these forecasts we simply don't pursue the conversations we don't go deeper we stay on the surface Nick Juliana and others then challenge people they say go and do this have this conversation then report back and people's actual experiences are vastly more positive and more fulfilling than their forecasts so I try to remember this in my own life I try to realize when my forecasts are too risk averse and too negative and say let me just jump in you know let me take this chance if it goes badly well fine and if it if it goes well even better the second piece here though is not just to take those risks but to document their effects right I I I call this encounter counting right so in essence Gathering new data from the world is great but if you forget those data well then the effects might be shortlived I try to really remember when a social encounter is a mismatch with my expectations I have a relative who for instance I disagree with politically quite a bit and when I was working on on on this book I said let me take a chance you know we've known each other for 30 years we've never talked politics let me try and so I invited her to have this conversation about an issue we really disagree on and we did not agree by the end of the conversation but it was an immensely deep and mean meaningful conversation and I actually felt like I knew her better even though we've been close for decades and I could just say well that was nice and then forget all about it and imagine that any future conversations on disagreement would be terrible but I tried to write down in my in my journal sort of this is what happened this is how it counteracted my expectations try to lock in that learning from the social world so that pleasant surprises hopefully aren't as surprising anymore I love those practices um and thank you for reinforcing the process of reinforcing the the experiences because many times I'll be listening to an audiobook or I'll think of something when I'm running and I'll put it into my um you know voice memos or notes in my phone and then I move them to this very notebook or another similar to it and I'll go back and read it but many things don't don't get passed through the the filters that um uh I forget because I I didn't do that and we know this is one of the best ways to solidify information is to think about experiences and information after being exposed to it this is true studying this is true clearly for uh emotional learning and and our own personal Evolution which brings me to um uh another example of somebody from the I don't know what to call them is it sort of philosophy Wellness self-help space you mentioned um P Chon yeah um one wonderful writer um there's someone else more or less in that space Byron Katie who um a lot of her work is about challenging beliefs by simply asking questions about our core beliefs um this is something that um I've started to explore a bit like one could have the idea that um you know uh good people always you know I don't know show up on time and wouldn't wouldn't we all love to be punctual and as an academic I confess uh for me everything starts 10 minutes after the hour so we're we're consistently on time but late right to the non-academics my friends from the military have a saying which is uh 5 minutes early is on time on time is late and if you're late you better um bring lunch you know so that kind of thing in any event um the the practice that she promotes um in in essence is to take a core belief and then just start challenging it from a number of different directions is that always true you know are there cases where that's not true what would that look like Etc as a way to really deconstruct one's own core beliefs which is I think a bit of what you're talking about and I feel like this could go in um at least two directions you can have a core belief that leads in the direction of cynicism that you can deconstruct by just simply asking questions um you know is that always true are there ever instances where that's not true um and what would it mean if that weren't true in a given instance this sort of thing and then on the other side where we uh tend to air toward hopeful skepticism as opposed to cynicism um there too I I could imagine it would be useful to explore hopeful skepticism also as a scientist right are there cases where hopeful skepticism here I'm going to be cynical can really get us into trouble for instance anyway these I I obviously I haven't run a study on this just because I I came up with this example on the fly but does what I just described fit more or less into the framework that you're describing absolutely I I think that it's in essence being skeptical about our beliefs putting them through their Paces right kicking the tires on our own beliefs and again this reminds me of cognitive behavioral therapy right a person who's socially anxious might tell their therapist I think all my friends seek secretly hate me they might believe that to their core it might affect every decision that they make and the therapist might challenge them and say well wait what are what's the evidence that you have for that are there any instances in your entire life where that seemed to not be true and to your point from Byron Katy what would it mean if it weren't true so this is the Bedrock of one of the most successful uh forms of therapy for depression and anxiety and phobia in in the world you know I do want to also I guess Zoom in on something that that that you're sharing there about our core beliefs because I think that in addition to testing our core beliefs one thing that I wish we would do more is share our core beliefs because I don't think we know what each other's core beliefs are and I think oftentimes we think that we are more alone in our core beliefs than we actually are so this is true in our politics for instance like the amount of people on from every part of the political Spectrum who want more compr more peace and less conflict is north of 80% in surveys that my lab has conducted but people don't know that and so the the lack of evidence the lack of data about what other people want is a hindrance to the goals that we actually all share this is also true in workplaces so uh in the course of my work I've I've done um sort of some some different projects with school systems Hospital systems businesses and one of the things I love doing is starting with an anonymous survey of everybody in the community and I ask you know how much do you value empathy and collaboration how much would you prefer a workplace or Community defined by cooperation versus competition and invariably and and I'm talking about some places where you might imagine people would be competitive invariably a super majority of individuals in those communities want uh compassion uh cooperation and and collaboration right much more than they want competition or isolation so one of the things that I love to do when I speak for those groups is to say hey look here's some data look around you here you've got 90% of people in this organization who want more cooperation so if you just take a look in your periphery almost everybody around you wants that as well I also survey these communities and say what do you think the average person would respond to these questions and invariably they're wrong and so I say you have underestimated each other and now I'm giving you permission to stop you know and and I think this is one of the other actions that we can take if we're in a leadership position anywhere right I think that looking for more data is great if you're a leader you can collect those data and you can show people to themselves you can unveil the core beliefs of your community and often times those core beliefs beliefs are incredibly beautiful and surprising to the people in them in in those communities and give them what I would call not pure pressure but pure permission to express who who they've been all along I love that and one of the things that we've done on this podcast is to always invite um comments and questions critique and you know and so forth um in the comment section on YouTube and I always say and I do read all the comments and sometimes it takes me a while and I'm still sifting through them but I think comment sections can be yes they can be toxic in certain environments and certain contexts but they can also be tremendously enriching not just for the reader but for the commenter um and to see what people's core beliefs are really about now oftentimes comments are are of a different form and that's okay that's all right um but I think that um because of the anonymity involved I I think I can see that now through the lens of what you're saying as as a license for people to really share their core beliefs about something as something that could be really informative and really enriching although I I much prefer I confess the the model that uh you're presenting where people are doing this in real time face to face as opposed to just online um as long as we're talking about polarization and the Wish For Less polarization um what are the data saying about the current state of affairs we're uh recording this uh you know about what 3 months months or so out from an election or 90 some days or so from an election um presidential election so without getting into discussions about political camps per se uh what do your data and understanding about cynicism and hopeful skepticism uh tell us about uh that whole process and and how the uh two camps are presenting themselves there is so much to say about this I'm going to try to not give a lecture here but but so like so many of the themes in this conversation right I think that the headline for me when I look at the data on polarization and I'm going to talk about perceived polarization as well is twofold one it's tragic because we are underestimating one another and two there's a lot of opportunity here because the Delta between the world that we think we're in and the one that we're actually in is great and and it's it's positive as well so there's a bunch of work on political perceptions this is work done by folks like Mina chakara at Harvard uh my colleague Rob Willer in sociology at Stanford our colleague Rob Willer uh and uh and a lot of this focuses on what people think the average member of the other side is like so if you're a republican what do you think the average Democrat believes what do you think they're like if you're a Democrat what do you think the average Republican is like and so I'll stop talking about Republicans and Democrats here because a lot of these data are bipartisan they their the biases are are pretty even across camps and it turns out that in all cases we are dead wrong about who's on the other side we're even wrong demographically about who's on the other side for instance Democrats think that 25% of Republicans make more than $250,000 a year the actual number is 2% but The Stereotype of Republicans that Democrats hold is that they're wealthy I suppose Republicans vastly overestimate the percentage of Democrats who are part of the lgbtq community for instance again it's just a cultural stereotype so we're wrong about even who's in the other on the other side but we're even more wrong about what they believe and what they want so data suggests that there's perceived polarization that is what we think the other side believes is much greater than polarization I mean first of all we are divided let's stipulate that and those divisions can be really dangerous and and are in some cases existential but the division in our mind is much greater than the division that we actually have my late friend Emil brunau collected some data where he gathered Republicans and Democrats views on immigration he said what would you want immigration to look like where uh zero is the borders are totally closed and 100 is there totally open and he plotted the distributions of what that looks like he also asked people on either side what do you think the other side would respond in if asked that same question and he plotted those distributions as well other side meaning which group if you're a Democrat what do you think Republicans would want and if you're a republican what would Democrats want and the distributions are totally different the distributions of our actual preferences are like a hill with two peaks right so Republic Ians want more closed borders Democrats want them more open but they're not that far apart first of all the means and there's a lot of overlap in the distributions the distributions of our perceptions are two hills on opposite sides of a landscape Republicans think that Democrats want totally open borders and Democrats think Republicans want totally closed borders and this the same pattern plays out for all sorts of issues where we think the other side is much more extreme we think the average member of the other side is much more extreme than they really are there's also work on meta perceptions what do you think the other side thinks about you and it turns out that people on both sides imagine that their rivals hate them twice as much as their Rivals really do there's work on Democratic Norms that my uh grad student Louisa Santos collected where we overestimate how anti-democratic the other side is by two times and Rob has collected data on violence how much do you think the other side would support violence to advance their aims and here the overestimates are 400% so we think that the average person on the other side is four times as enthusiastic about violence as they really are we have an image in our mind of the other as violent extremists who want to burn down the system and again we've talked about the Warped media ecosystem that we're in and that probably contributes here but the fact is that those misperceptions are making all the problems that we fear worse because if you think that the other side is gearing up for War what do you do you have to defend yourself and so we're caught in this almost cycle of escalation that really very few of us want now I want to be really clear here that I'm not saying that we don't have actual disagreements I'm also not saying that they're that that people on on across our political Spectrum are all Peaceable and all kind there are absolutely extreme and violent people around our country that represent their political views in horrible and toxic ways but that's not the average and again I want to get back to this point that the average person underestimates the average person not that we underestimate everybody but that we're wrong about most people and so again to me this is a tragedy and an opportunity Rob and and Mina and lots of other people find that when you ask people to actually pay attention to the data when you show them hey actually the other side fears violence just as much as you do when you show them that actually the other side is terrified of losing our democracy when you show them that the other side doesn't actually hate you that mitigates that pulls back all of these escalatory impulses in essence you can decrease the threat that people feel from The Other Side by showing them who the other side really is I understand this is such a massive and toxic sort of environment that we're in I'm not saying that hopeful skepticism will will solve our our div divided uh political landscape will solve our problems but I do think it's worth noting how wrong we are and that being a little bit less wrong can at least open a door maybe let our minds wander towards a place of Greater compromise and peace which is what most people actually want wow I say that for several reasons first of all I've never heard the landscape described that way and I confess I didn't know that the landscape was um as toward the center uh as it turns out it is uh I have also many theories about how media and social media and podcasts for that matter might be contributing to this perceived uh polarization as opposed to the reality and uh there's certainly a lot to explore in terms of what we can each and all do to remedy our understanding of what's going on out there as a consequence I'll ask um can some of the same tools that you described to better interact with one's own children with one's own self uh with other individuals and in small groups be used to um sort of uh def fragment some of the cynicism circuitry that exists in us around this polarized excuse me perceived highly polarized political landscape I love that clarification yeah absolutely uh I think that the answer is yes there is lots of evidence that we are actively avoiding having conversations in part because of who we think the other side is there was an amazing study that was conducted during Thanksgiving of 200 16 which as you may recall was directly after a very uh polarizing election uh and researchers used geot tracking on people's cell phones to examine whether in order to go to Thanksgiving dinner they crossed between a blue County into a red County or a red County into a blue County in other words are they going into and I'm using air quotes here quote unquote enemy territory for Thanksgiving dinner and they used that as a proxy of whether they're having dinner with people they disagree with and it turns out that people who crossed county lines who crossed into enemy territory again in quotes this is perceived polarization uh they had dinners that were 50 minutes shorter than people who were dining with folks who presumably they agreed with so we're talking about forsaking pie Andrew they're they're giving a pie in order to not talk with people they disagree with and I think a lot of us are very skittish about these conversations because if you believe that the other side is a bunch of bloodthirsty Marauders why would you want to talk with them why have a beer with a fascist you know that's just not a great plan the truth though is that when we can collect better data often times we end up with better uh with better perceptions and I mean better in two ways one more positive and two more accurate right now again I want to say that there are real threats in our political environment I'm not asking anybody to make themselves unsafe in any way but uh in our lab again my wonderful graduate student Louisa Santos ran a study where we had about 160 people these are folks from all over the country who uh took part in Zoom conversations we made sure that they really disagreed about gun control immigration and climate change and they talked about those issues um we asked them to forecast what those conversations would be like and we asked other folks to forecast what those conversations would be like and the forecasts went from neutral to negative some people thought it won't make any difference and other people thought it would be counterproductive some folks in our survey said dialogue is dead there's no point in any of these conversations um we then brought these folks together oh and I should say among the people who were cynical about these conversations and who forecasted that they would go poorly was us the research team Louisa and I spent hours talking about what if people start to threaten each other or dox each other or look up each other's addresses you know Andrew that we have institutional review boards that make sure that we're keeping human subjects safe and the IRB wanted all sorts of safeguards in place because we all thought that these conversations might go really poorly after the conversations occurred we asked folks who had taken part in them to rate how positive they were on a 1 to 100 scale and the most common the modal response that people gave us was 100 out of a 100 and it wasn't just that they liked the conversation they were shocked by how much they liked the conversation they also reported less negative emotion for the other side as a whole not just for the person that they talked with and they reported more intellectual humility more openness to questioning their own views so here are conversations that we as a culture are actively avoiding because of our priors our priors are wrong given the data but we don't know that and we don't we don't give ourselves chances to learn that we're wrong because we don't collect the data and when we do collect the data when we step in and take that leap of faith take that social risk we are shocked uh and humbled and feel more positive and maybe even feel a slightly greater sense of hope that there can be some way out of this toxic environment that we're all trapped in well J Dr zachie thank you so much for sharing your in incredible like can only be described as wisdom into this area of um Humanity right I mean to be a cynic um is uh one potential aspect of Being Human um but you've made very clear that we have control there's plasticity over this aspect of ourselves if we adopt the right mindsets apply the right practices and you know it's so clear based on everything you've shared today that you know humans are operating rationally and yet irrationally at the same time this I'm certainly not the first to say that um but in the context of cynicism and in the context of being happier individuals and families and couples and groups that to really take a hard look at how cynical we are and to start to make even minor inroads into that through belief testing you know I I wrote down as we were talking that uh what I really feel you're encouraging us to do correct me if I'm wrong is to do both internal and external reality testing in an effort to move us away toward internal and external polarization and you know I can't think of any higher calling than that and you're giving us the tools and those tools are supported by data these aren't just ideas they are they are data supported ideas and I just want to thank you for uh your incredible generosity in coming here today to talk about those ideas your book is phenomenal I already learned so much from it and I highly encourage people to read it and what you've shared with us today is phenomenal and I do hope to have you back again to talk about another topic that uh you are expert in uh which is empathy but we'll have to all wait uh with baited breath for that myself included so once again I just want to thank you for your time the incredible work that you're doing and the evolution that you're taking us uh on so on behalf of myself and everyone listening and watching thank you ever so much Andrew this has been an absolutely delightful conversation and and I will say my forecast of it was very high and it has exceeded that forecast um I also just want to take a moment to thank thank you for your work as a science Communicator um as somebody who believes in not just uh trying to generate knowledge but also to share knowledge I think that uh it's absolutely one of the most important services that we can do as folks who have been trained and learned all this stuff to bring that information to as many people as we can and uh I think it's just it's an incredible Mission and clearly has had such wonderful impact so it's it's an honor to be part of that conversation um and and to be part of that effort well thank you I'll take that in and um it's a labor of love and an honor and a privilege to sit here today with you so thank you ever so much and please do come back again I would love that thank you for joining me for today's

Title: Optimal Protocols for Studying & Learning
Published: 2024-08-26 12:00:49 UTC
Description:
In this episode, I discuss science-supported protocols to optimize your depth and rate of learning of material and skills. I explain the neurobiology of learning and neuroplasticity and how correctly timed, self-directed test-taking can be leveraged to improve learning and prevent forgetting. 

I discuss the study habits of the most successful learners, ways to limit distractions, how to set study goals, and how tests can be used as tools to learn, not just as a means for evaluating one’s mastery of learned material. A surprising aspect of tests, specifically self-testing soon after exposure to new material, is that they can significantly improve your ability to learn, apply, and maintain new knowledge. I also discuss tools to improve focus and alertness while studying.

By the end of this episode, you will have learned various science-supported actionable tools you can use to better learn, remember, and apply new information.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today we are discussing how to study and learn that is what the scientific data say is the best way to study in order to remember information and to be able to use that information effectively in different areas of your life so for those of you that are still in school this could be any stage of school today's discussion will be very useful for you however even if you are not formally enrolled in any kind of school at the moment today's discussion will also be extremely effective for you to be able to study and learn better information from say the internet or podcasts or any area of your life where you are seeking to learn and use new knowledge now one of the most important things that you're going to learn today is that learning that is the best learning practices are not intuitive so before we dive in keep in mind that whatever you believe about how best to learn for you is probably Incorrect and I confess this was humbling for me as well when I started to dive into this literature because as somebody who was a student for many years and in some sense still considers himself a student of science and health information because of this podcast and certainly somebody who still teaches University courses both to medical students and graduate students and to undergraduate students at Stanford I thought I understood the whole teaching and learning process but I too learned that it is anything but intuitive in fact most of what we believe about the best ways to study are absolutely false fortunately today you will learn the best ways to study turns out there's a rich literature on this dating back well over a hundred years and the data are absolutely fascinating and Incredibly actionable it's incredibly interesting how the fields of Education the fields of psychology and the fields of Neuroscience have now come together to define the optimal strategies to study and learn before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity I've spoken many times before on this podcast about the critical need to get sleep both enough sleep and enough quality sleep now one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is that your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3° in order for you to fall and stay deeply asleep and to wake up feeling refreshed your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3° one of the best ways to ensure all of that happens is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and with eight sleep it's very easy to do that you program the temperature that you want at the beginning middle and the end of the night and that's the temperature that you're going to sleep at and it will track your sleep it tells you how much slow wave sleep you're getting how much rapid eye movement sleep you're getting which is critical and all of that also helps you dial in the exact parameters you need in order to get the best possible night sleep for you I've been sleeping on an eights Sleep mattress cover for well over three years now and it has completely transformed my sleep for the better eight sleep recently launched their newest gener ation pod cover the Pod 4 ultra the Pod 4 ultra cover has improved cooling and heating capacity higher Fidelity sleep tracking technology and the Pod 4 cover has snoring detection that will automatically lift your head a few degrees to improve air flow and stop your snoring if you'd like to try an eightsleep mattress cover you can go to 8sleep.com huberman to save $350 off their pod 4 ultra eight sleep currently ships to the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by betterhelp betterhelp offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years initially I didn't have a choice it was a condition of being allowed to stay in school but pretty soon I realized that therapy is an extremely important component to overall health in fact I consider doing regular therapy just as important as getting regular exercise now there are essentially three things that great therapy Prov provides first of all it provides good rapport with somebody that you can trust and talk to about the issues that are most critical to you second of all it can provide support in the form of emotional support or directed guidance and third expert therapy should provide insights with better help they make it very easy for you to find an expert therapist with whom you have these critical components of therapy also because better help allows for therapy to be done entirely online it's very time efficient and easy to fit into your busy schedule with no commuting to a

today's episode is also brought To Us by waking up waking up is a meditation app that offers hundreds of guided meditation programs mindfulness trainings yoga NRA sessions and more I started practicing meditation when I was about 15 years old and it made a profound impact on my life and by now there are thousands of quality reviewed studies that emphasize how useful mindfulness meditation can be for improving our Focus managing stress and anxiety improving our mood and much more in recent years I started using the waking up app for my meditations because I find it to be a terrific resource for allowing me to really be consistent with my meditation practice many people start a meditation practice and experience some benefits but many people also have challenges keeping up with that practice what I and so many other people love about the waking up app is that it has a lot of different meditations to choose from and those meditations are of different durations so it makes it very easy to keep up with your meditation practice both from the perspective of novelty you never get tired of those meditations there's always something new to explore and to learn about yourself and about the effectiveness of meditation and you can always fit meditation into your schedule even if you only have two or three minutes per day in which to meditate I also really like doing Yoga Nidra or what is sometimes called non-sleep deep rest for about 10 or 20 minutes because it is a great way to restore mental and physical figger without the tiredness that some people experience when they wake up from a conventional nap if you'd like to try the waking up app please go to waking up.com huberman where you can access a free 30-day trial again that's waking up.com huberman to access a free 30-day trial okay let's talk about how best to study and learn and of course people have different learning styles Some people prefer to learn by reading some people prefer to study in a group Some people prefer to highlight some people call themselves auditory Learners other people consider themselves visual learners but guess what when one looks at the research on preferred learning styles pretty much all of that melts away it turns out that the best way to study and learn is defined not by the medium in which that material arrives whether not it's auditory or visual or combined whether or not you review slides or a textbook or you watch small videos it turns out that the best way to study and learn is to access components of your memory systems that offset forgetting this is a theme I'm going to return to over and over again throughout today's episode rather than think about studying to learn and retain information I want you to think about studying to offset the natural process of forgetting that everybody experiences when they are exposed to new material of any kind cognitive or motor learning musical learning math Etc okay so keep this in mind throughout today's episode the best way to learn is to think about offsetting the natural forgetting of new information you're trying to inoculate against forgetting that is the way to remember things that is the way to gain Mastery over them and I'm going to teach you how to best do that using the data gleaned from the peer- reviewed literature now before I do that I want to talk about what learning is I promise to make this fairly brief because I've covered learning and so-called neuro plasticity before on this podcast for those of you that have heard those discussions this will serve as a refresher for those of you that have not heard those discussions this will be thorough enough for you to be able to digest all the rest of today's information neuroplasticity is this incredible feature of your nervous system which of course includes your brain and your spinal cord which is the ability for your nervous system to change in response to experience so any form of learning involves neuroplasticity neuroplasticity we sometimes hear as neural plasticity two words or neuroplasticity those are the same thing essentially the change that underlies neuroplasticity at the level of cells which we call neurons or nerve cells generally involves three different mechanisms one is the strengthening of certain connections what we call synaptic connections synapses are the location between neurons where they communicate with one another it's actually a gap between the neurons it is technically called the synaptic left it's a gap and within that Gap chemicals are passed across that Gap that allow one neuron to activate other neurons or many neurons to activate many other neurons or to inhibit the activity of other neurons okay so one form of neuroplasticity is the strengthening of connections between neurons another form of neuroplasticity is the weakening of connections between neurons and yet a third form of plasticity which is often discussed in the media but is very rare actually in the nervous system especially the adult nervous system of humans is neurogenesis or the addition of new neurons let's just get this out of the way up front because the addition of new neurons again grabs so much attention in media articles but it's responsible for a near trivial amount of the sort of neuroplasticity that is important for today's discussion or frankly for most all discussions it is true you have a specialized set of neurons in your olda factory bulb that are responsible for smell as well as a specialized set of neurons in the so-called dentate gyrus of your hippocampus an area of the brain that's important for memory in which new neurons appear to be added throughout the lifespan but this is not the major mechanism by which learning and memory occurs in humans rather the major mechanism by which learning and memory occurs in humans is the strengthening of existing connections and the weakening of existing connections or the formation of new connections between already EX existing neurons not new neurons okay now the removal or weakening of connections between neurons being an important component of neuroplasticity is very important for sake of today's discussion I want to emphasize that when we hear about weakening of connections we often think well that means forgetting or that means the brain is getting less good however so much of the neuroplasticity that underlies for instance the acquisition of a new motor skill is actually the reflection of removal of connections so we don't want to project any kind of value onto a discussion about adding new connections removing new connections let's just leave it at this level mechanistically when you hear about neuroplasticity just know that it could be the consequence of strengthening of connections as well as weakening of connections and that neither strengthening of Connections in the nervous system nor weakening of connections can map directly to the formation or remove removal of say memories or information just know that these are the important mechanisms in fact if you look at a baby that is let's say I don't know N9 months old their motor skills are not terrific typically compared to the motor skills that that child will have when they are six or seven years old just look at a kid trying to eat spaghetti or something of that sort or eat anything when they're a small baby versus a toddler versus a young child versus an adolescent or Te You know despite the um poor table manners of some adolescence and teens and some adults for that matter they are still exhibiting far more precise motor movements than they did as an infant of course and believe it or not the Improvement in motor coordination that one observes in humans and other species for that matter from birth until the adolescence and teen years and adult years is largely the reflection of the removal that's right the removal of neural connections as opposed to the form of neural connections however the neural connections that remain become much more robust they become much more reliable okay so that's the mechanistic backdrop for everything that we're going to talk about today which is how to study and learn and as I mentioned earlier in my introduction most of learning and remembering new material is about offsetting the forgetting process that naturally occurs any time we hear new information so in keeping with what will ultimately reveal itself to be the dominant theme of today's discussion right now and for reasons that will become clear later I want you to take a brief quiz now the moment people hear quiz or test typically it spikes their adrenaline they start feeling stressed but don't worry you're going to keep your answers to yourself and you're doing this for a very specific purpose here's my question this is a two question quiz how many different ways mechanistically speaking does does neuroplasticity occur is it one mechanism two mechanisms or three mechanisms or is it four or five okay can you name in your head two of the three major changes that the nervous system can undergo which are reflective of neuroplasticity okay so the answer to question was is that there are three different modes of neuroplasticity as you recall or as you may not have been able to recall and by the way if you were not able to recall the three different modes of neuroplasticity or mechanisms underlying neuroplasticity that is fine as you'll soon realize recognizing the errors in your information retention is another critical and very useful way to retain more information even if you got the answer wrong or you didn't know in fact especially if you got the answer wrong or you didn't know so the three ways are the strengthening of neural connection second the weakening of neural connections and third through neurogenesis the addition of new neurons why did I provide this quiz why did I test you well as you'll soon learn if you look across the total body of research on how best to study and learn it involves doing exactly what we just did which is to periodically stop and test yourself on the material that you learned testing is not just a way of evaluating what knowledge you've Acquired and which knowledge you have not managed to acquire it also turns out to be the best tool for offsetting forgetting of any kind and I'll go into the data that supports that statement in a moment so yes today we're going to get a little bit meta in the sense that we're going to be learning about optimal studying strategies and applying those as we go through this podcast and no there will not be a test at the end although you're welcome to give yourself a test at the end I'm going to provide you with an excellent zeroc cost very fast tool that you can use to evaluate your knowledge and your ability to study and learn better as a consequence of having listened to this podcast versus had you not listened to this podcast so if ever there was an incentive to listen to the end there it is okay let's talk about some of the other practical aspects of studying and learning I know a lot of you out there who want to learn and want to come up with the best studying strategies are trying to think about how to structure your day or how much to study or when to study let's get the most important things out of the way first neuroplasticity and learning that is convert converting your studying efforts into retention of knowledge is a two-step process you probably heard about active engagement that's just a fancy set of words for focus for really attending to the information that you're trying to learn and it is very important anytime you're trying to learn new information so focus goes with alertness you can't be focused if you're not alert this is prerequisite so you need to be alert and you need to be focused in order to pay attention to the information that you're trying to learn in fact it is the process of being focused and attending that cues your nervous system that something is important that something's different about whatever sensory experience you happen to be having when you're focused and attending whether or not it's the information you're hearing or that you're looking at or both that cue at the level of neurochemicals in your brain and body signals to the neurons hey you're going to have to change you're going to have to alter your connections either make them stronger or weaker or a combination of those things in order to make sure that your nervous system can retain and use the information at a future time so that's step one and of course as a part of step one most people when they hear about optimal studying strategies they want to know you know what should they do what should they take in order to learn better well here's what everyone should take in order to learn better which is a great night's sleep the night before limiting your external stress although some stresses good because it cues up your alertness it actually allows you to remember certain things better we'll talk about this a little bit later no one can remove all stress from their life but we know one thing for sure your ability to be alert and focused is going to be greater if you slept well the night before okay so sleep is without question the best neut Tropic right the word neut Tropic means smart drug I don't really like that term because learning involves all sorts of things it's not just about being smart it's about being able to attend it's about sometimes being creative flexible with ideas and information here's the point you're going to need to get your sleep right in order to be able to study and learn at your absolute best and I've done many episodes of The hman Lab podcast about sleep we have a newsletter about sleep that details in a short PDF format the various things you can do to get your sleep optimized so to speak you can find all that hubman lab.com by putting sleep into the search function we don't have time to discuss that material now but get your sleep right so that you can be alert and focused when it comes time to learn now the process of being alert and focused on particular material that you want to learn can be enhanced by just having a silent script within your head silent meaning you're not saying it out loud where when you sit down to learn you're looking at a book or you're listening to a lecture perhaps a podcast like this you're thinking okay I need to learn this I need to learn this you can voluntarily ramp up your level of focus and alertness by telling yourself that information is important don't be a passive participant in learning this is the basis of active learning by expecting the information to be so interesting that it pulls your level of attention and focus out of you rather learn to engage your attention and focus voluntarily volitionally okay when we hear about ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder we know that people with ADHD can attend very rapidly they can really pay close attention for long periods of time if they like a given topic or a given experience or activity they have serious challenges however engaging their attention and alertness if they are not excited about an activity or information and so it is the Hallmark of all good Learners to be able to voluntarily force yourself to attend and to focus and when I say force yourself that means a constant bringing back of your mind's attention to whatever it is you're trying to learn it is meant to feel difficult I say meant to feel difficult because that strain that you feel that encouraging or in some cases forcing yourself to attend sometimes even putting on a hoodie and hat you know literally putting blinders so that you can only attend to the material right in front of you that straining that you feel reflects in part the release of neuromodulators like epinephrine adrenaline in the brain and body which serve to cue the neural circuits that they need to change at a later time okay so the strength that you feel in trying to learn the strain that you feel in forcing yourself to learn how to focus that is good that's a c-tier nervous system that it's going to need to change that neuroplasticity needs to take place think about it if you didn't feel that strain and you were able to perform whatever it is that you were doing or remember whatever information it is that you're being exposed to seamlessly well then your nervous system wouldn't have to change because it already has the capabilities within the neural circuits so that strain that you feel that agitation is great that's a cue that you are learning or that you set the learning process in motion now it's also the case that some people don't have great levels of focus and attention and there are of course pharmacologic tools I would encourage anyone that has clinically diagnosed ADHD to talk to their doctor about whether or not they should use prescription meds and or other methods great sleep is always going to be an important substrate for attention and focus for anybody but especially for people with ADHD I highly encourage anyone that's interested in enhancing their levels of focus and attention to also consider the non-pharmacologic approaches so this is irrespective of whether or not you need pharmacologic approaches yes being well hydrated yes the appropriate amount of caffeine for you that allows you to be alert but not you know shaking and agitated can be very useful however the scientific data also support the fact that doing a brief say five to 10 minute mindfulness meditation each day these are the data from Wendy Suzuki's laboratory at New York University showing that people who do a 10-minute meditation per day where they simply sit or lie down close their eyes focus on their breathing their attention invariably drifts they bring their attention back to their breathing people who do that on a regular basis improve their level of focus they improve their memory and recall ability and of course there are a bunch of other positive effects of that simple zeroc cost tool of mindfulness meditation so if you're interested in improving your levels of focus and attention for sake of learning I highly encourage you to explore the Oho valuable tool of mindfulness meditation just five or 10 minutes per day done on a regular basis you miss a day no big deal just get right back to it the next day does it matter if you do it morning afternoon or night no some people find that doing it too late at night might disrupt their sleep but if you think about meditation of the sort that I just described as a perceptual exercise maybe you don't even call it meditation you're just teaching yourself to focus you could even do it with Eyes Open by focusing on a visual Target allowing yourself to Blink there are good data on this sort of approach as well and then just making sure that your visual attention and cognitive attention comes back to that visual Target over and over again it's a deliberate process of bringing your attention back to a particular location that is very valuable for improving your levels of focus in fact it is known to create significant improvements in your ability to focus which is critical for your ability to study and learn so I know that many people are interested in what to take what to do at the level of kind of um esoteric practices or things to buy there is stuff out there again I mentioned hydration caffeine great sleep and so on but the simple practice of mindfulness meditation or just what I describe as a focusing perceptual exercise of bringing your attention back to the same location over and over again deliberately will train you to train your nervous system to bring your attention back to whatever it is you're trying to learn now I've done other podcasts about how to focus about attention specifically and ADHD again you can find all of those at hubman lab.com simply put ADHD or Focus or tools for focus into the search function and it will take you to the exact timestamps in those episodes that are relevant right now however I want to talk about the second part of neuroplastic which is that the actual changes in the nervous system the strengthening and weakening predominantly of connections between neurons that underly learning do not occur during the focusing and learning or rather the exposure to the material but instead during deep sleep and sleep-like states and again I've done a lot of podcasts and talked a lot about tools for getting better sleep but I just want to remind everybody that the actual reordering of the connections the strengthening of connections between neurons that underly learning the weakening of those connections occurs during sleep in particular during rapid eye movement sleep which tends to predominate in the latter half of the night so make sure that you're getting enough sleep for you for some people it's 6 hours for some people it's eight hours and yes there is something called the first night effect the first night effect is the experimentally observed phenomenon whereby information that you learn on a given day is mostly Consolidated during the night's sleep that you have on that first night after the learning occurs does this mean that if you get a poor night's sleep on the first night after learning something that you are forever going to forget that information that it cannot be Consolidated into your neural circuits no however it's very clear that the first night after learning you want to get the best sleep possible so if you're learning BS you're studying is going late into the night and you're drinking a lot of caffeine be mindful that the sleep that you get after drinking that caffeine late into the day the all nighters that you're pulling those are not serving you're learning well so you need to structure your life as a student of any kind so that you can get focus and attention to what it is you want to learn and you can get sleep to the best of your ability and of course people who are raising young kids or who have stress in their lives for whatever reason perhaps won't be able to optimize their sleep on that first night or even subsequent nights but do your best to get your sleep right it's the single best thing you can do for your mental health for your physical health and for Learning and performance of any kind and it's really worth the effort Now with an understanding of the mechanisms the focus and alertness and the Sleep phase of neuroplasticity what are some other things that you can do to enhance whatever studying and learning you've obtained I already talked about a tool a behavioral tool for enhancing Focus what about a behavioral tool for enhancing plasticity if your sleep is great or especially if your sleep isn't great and there I highly recommend you explore non-sleep deep rest or nsdr there's a script for this in the show note captions nsdr sometimes referred to as Yoga Nidra although those things are similar but different is a 10 or 20 minute practice that you can do to restore your mental and physical Vigor if you haven't slept enough so you could do it first thing in the morning when you wake up if you feel you haven't slept enough you can do it in the afternoon you can do it in the middle of the night if you're not able to sleep and offset some of the Sleep loss that you otherwise would have experienced nsdr is a very powerful tool in order to enhance neuroplasticity and I'll talk more about this in a future episode there's a lot of exciting data coming out about nsdr and yoga Nitra but if you're sleeping well and even if you aren't I highly encourage you to incorporate a 10 or 20 minute nsdr into your schedule someplace again where you place it in your schedule isn't as important as the fact that you do it in order to enhance neuroplasticity that is the reordering of connections between neurons to serve the studying and learning that you're doing now let's talk about how the best students structure their days turns out there are great studies on this there's a really nice paper in fact that surveyed close to 700 students these were medical students approximately equal number of male and female students and analyze the most useful learning habits that is the learning habits associated with the most successful students now anytime you do a study like this where people take surveys there's always the issue of causality in fact we can pretty much set aside any possible causality for instance I'm about to tell you that the very best performing students tend to study for about three or four hours per day but you could easily say Well they're the best students because they study three or four hours per day they don't study three or four hours per day because they're the best students and you'd be exactly right okay we can get into all sorts of discussions about correlation versus causation about reverse causality and on and on however none of that is the point here the point here is to establish what are the habits that the most successful students seem to incorporate over and over again regardless of what classes they're taking regardless of where they are in their Arc of their learning trajectory and so what we know based on this study and I'll provide a link to it in the show note captions is that there are at least 10 study habits that the highly effective students use I'm going to focus on the top five or six just for sake of time because it turns out that most of the effect it appears of being a better student can be attributed to these top five or six habits first of all they set aside time to study they literally schedule time to study now this probably serves several roles the first one is that they are able to clear out other distractions and in fact that's the second thing that they do they are very effective or they make it a point of putting their phone away and off of isolating themselves that's right they're not studying with other people they study alone which is not to say that people who study with others cannot be effective in their studying but the best performing students seem to study alone they put their phone away they tell their friends and families that they are not going to be able to be reached during that time and yes they study for three or four hours per day but they break that up into a couple of different sessions typically two or three sessions so they're not doing a three or four hours studying about all in one shot so they're managing their time they're eliminating distractions and they're studying for a consistent amount of time at least 5 days per week okay presumably they're taking some weekends off although that wasn't made clear from this paper the other thing that they do and this is very important is that they make an effort to then teach their peers to teach other students in the class now some of you may be thinking and I'm thinking back to college here mostly that if you spend all this time learning the information and you are in a competitive scenario with the other students that teaching them the information is kind of kind of a freebie for them and it's harder for you meaning you're putting yourself at a competitive disadvantage or you're giving them an unfair Advantage for not having done the work now while this paper didn't do an analysis of whether or not these students that served as the Learners from the other students got an unfair Advantage it's very clear that students who make it a point to learn material in isolation then bring that material to other students in the same course and teach them perform exceedingly well in comparison to the other students so don't be afraid to be a teacher of your peers in order to test this is key to test and develop Mastery of the material now in my laboratory for years we used to have a saying which I simply picked up from the Laboratories I was trained in I didn't come up with a saying which was watch one do one teach one and that was referring to doing surgeries or suturing or doing an antibody reaction or a western blood or things that you do in Laboratories watch one do one teach one watch one do one teach one of course should be reserved to anything where no one's going to be put in danger by the watch one do one teach one procedure right some procedures especially in Laboratories can be dangerous given the materials you use Etc and of course today we're talking about learning and studying generally so provided it safe watch one do one teach one is an excellent means to learn that is to study new material to develop proficiency and even Mastery and over time perhaps even virtuosity we'll return to that later those distinctions so going back to this idea that the best students set aside time they designate time to study alone without distractions that is sure to help them anchor their focus and attention they know that they're going to need to use their focus and attention during that time and we know with absolute certainty that focus and attention are a limited but renewable resource in the human brain the longer you're awake the more is the buildup of a molecule called adenosine in your brain and body it makes you sleep sley makes it harder to focus when you sleep adenosine levels are pushed down again you're able to focus again you feel more alert you can think of adenosine as limiting your attentional budget which is not to say that some people don't study best in the afternoon or in the evening or even late at night right I recall times during University when I'd study between the hours of 10 p.m. and 2: a.m. I don't do that any longer but scheduling time where you know you're going to need to be focused and attending is perhaps one of the most important things toward being able to focus and attend to the material now if you're taking courses you probably are going to be a slave to the timing of the courses you aren't going to be able to tell the instructor okay listen I want you to do this course at you know 3 p.m. because that's when you learn best or at 8: a.m. because that's when you happen to be able to attend best however to the extent that you have any control over the time in which you're going to study keeping that at a regular time or times perhaps one block early in the day one block later in the day perhaps two blocks early in the day and so on is going to be beneficial it turns out that's also supported by the research literature that the brain just like with its sleep wake cycles that entrain to a regular schedule that is your brain and body get used to being active and inactive at particular times based on your exposure to sunlight your exposure to activities your social rhythms Etc if you regularly meaning for the course of about three days make it a point to focus and study at particular times again pulling your attention back it's not an automatic process but pulling your attention back to a specific location perhaps on a page or that you're listening to in a lecture your body and brain will start to entrain to that Rhythm such that you will be able to focus and attend better simply by virtue of the regularity of the timing of the exposure to the material okay so you probably need about two or three days to break into a regular schedule of focusing and attending and studying at a given time or times allow yourself that transition period but then make it a point to schedule those times to study set aside your phone tell people you're going offline turn off the Wi-Fi if you need to or have to you may need it for your studying I don't know depends on what you're studying but limit distractions at all costs and learn to just focus on the material and this is a skill this is the most important thing to understand it's a skill to be able to focus and study and it's a skill that you can learn very quickly especially if you schedule it for regular times and you give yourself two or three days in which to adapt to those schedules and times and then try and stick to them as regularly as possible perhaps even on the weekends if you're approaching you know the end of the quarter or semester perhaps even on the weekend even if you're not in the quarter or semester keeping those regular times will entrain your nervous system to study and learn at its best at those particular times I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 by now many of you have heard me say that if I could take Just One supplement that supplement would be ag1 the reason for that is ag1 is the highest quality and most complete of the foundational nutritional supplements available what that means is that it contains not just vitamins and minerals but also probiotics prebiotics and adaptogens to cover any gaps you may have in your diet and provide support for a demanding life for me even if I eat mostly Whole Foods and minimally processed foods which I do for most of my food intake it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits and vegetables vitamins and minerals micronutrients and adaptogens from food alone for that reason I've been taking ag1 daily since 2012 and often twice a day once in the morning or mid morning and again in the afternoon or evening when I do that it clearly bolsters my energy my immune system and my gut microbiome these are all critical to brain function mood physical performance and much more if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim their special offer right now they're giving away five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin 3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman to claim that special offer before I move into specific ways to study in order to maximally offset forgetting notice I didn't say in order to learn but rather to maximally offset forgetting AKA learning stably learning material there's one other point that I wanted to pass along from this uh really nice study on the study habits of highly effective medical students that I've been referring to and that is when one examined or these people were asked about their motivation for studying the best performing students had an interesting answer they had a very long-term understanding of how or belief rather about how their success in medical school would impact their family how it would impact their life Arc how it would change them and they weren't particular about the ways in which it would change them or their family in fact it was a rather broad abstract aspirational way of thinking about their study efforts so what I like so much about this paper is that you know in addition to having a fairly large sample size close to 700 students that were evaluated and yes it's purely uh you know self-report and this kind of thing nonetheless it Bridges the two extremes of studying and learning you know it gets right down into the nitty-gritty of how long they study when they study the things they do to limit distraction that we just discussed but it also gets to their underlying psychological motivations and the thing that they use in order to pull them forward through their study efforts perhaps especially when their desire is waning or their uh level of fatigue is increasing I don't know that I'm speculating here but this is this aspirational component of going to medical school which it turns out in the country in which the study was done um only very very select few of the very best students are able to achieve that they have to learn the in a different language altogether which is incredible I always Marvel at that you know I have friends that did their PHD thesis in Italy they're Italian by birth they now happen to run a laboratory in Italy and they had to do their PHD training and write papers and give their thesis dissertation and defense in English even though English was their second language so talk about a challenge and um that's just one example that I can think of there are many examples of that these students students that I'm referring to in this study are not necessarily constantly thinking about how their efforts will transform themselves and their families but they certainly were able to report what it was specifically that they are seeking what they're aspiring to besides just trying to do as well as they can getting into and through medical school so the high level aspirational stuff within you whatever that is for you it's going to be highly individual is certainly important and it offers a bookend to the nuts and bolts kind of stuff that you're going to do I would hope in order to best study and learn the specific material so the specific actions that you're going to take each day to learn specific bits of information that will pull you toward those important aspirations and now again if you love the material you're learning this aspirational component is probably not as important right I can recall during University and graduate school and so on thinking oh my goodness this is like the coolest thing I've ever heard probably say that about a million different topics like oh my goodness circadian rhythms seasonal rhythms melatonin neural circuits dopamine I was just a wash with excitement about what I was learning but of course sometimes I would take a course where the material was I don't know if it was more challenging or not but I had a harder time getting engaged by the material either by virtue of how it was being taught to me or the material itself so the ability to attach to some aspirational goal to pull you through can be very valuable you're not going to love every topic you have to learn however I will say that at least in my experience some of the courses that I look back on most fondly are the courses that I struggled with the most and in fact that's the basis of the next and easily one of the most important studying tools so a key theme in all of the excellent literature that is the peer- reviewed research on how best to study is that studying that feels challenging is the most effective I know nobody wants to hear this everyone wants to hear about flow everybody wants to hear about information just sinking into their brain by osmosis I think it was a Garfield cartoon where he talked about learning by osmosis there's this very cute real world video of a kid in a classroom uh I believe uh it's in China where he's taking the book and he puts it on his head maybe I can find this clip and he's just kind of like trying to wash it into his brain it's super cute clip but guess what that doesn't work I mean it works to put the book on your head it doesn't work to it's not going to get the information into your brain uh perhaps someday there will be ways to rapidly download information into neural circuits right now we know we've known for hundreds of not thousands of years that effort is the Cornerstone of learning so I know there probably some gron about that I know some of you perhaps were hoping that today I was going to tell you how to study so that studying wasn't painful I think I can accomplish that by the end of today's episode but in order to do that let's take another quiz okay so here's the quiz again you can answer these questions in your head you don't have to tell anyone but you could write them down or say them out loud if you want the first question is when during either your states of alertness or sleep does the remodeling of neural connections occur I like to think this is a pretty easy one okay the answer is during sleep the second question is what is one behavioral tool that you can use to improve focus the answer is simple mindfulness meditation which I'd prefer you think of Simply as a perceptual exercise so again just sit or lie down close your eyes focus on your breath when your attention drifts bring your attention back to your breath and so on or if you prefer you can do this Eyes Open by focusing on a visual Target either a foot or two feet or 3 ft away whatever distance is comfortable for you allowing yourself to Blink as needed but forcing yourself to focus on that visual Target for say 1 to 3 minutes maybe even 3 to 5 minutes maybe even 10 minutes again please blink you don't want your eyes to dry both those tools will improve your ability to attend to focus to other material when the time comes okay the circuits for focus and attention themselves are subject to neuroplasticity and then the third question is can you name or List off in your mind three tools that the most effective students have been shown to use I can think of limiting distraction by virtue of putting away phones and telling others you won't be in contact with them two and I'm getting these out of order I realize is to isolate to study alone and the third that I can recall is to teach others in the same course okay you can probably think of a few others now why are we taking these silly little quizzes Well turns out they're not so silly when one considers that hopefully you'll remember the information from today so that you don't have to listen to it over and over again but that if ever there was a strongly research supported tool in the literature in the peer-reviewed literature about how students can learn information better it's testing and I know I know I know we think of tests as a way to evaluate our knowledge but it turns out that testing is one of the best ways to build our knowledge to retain our knowledge and again to offset forgetting now the study of testing as a learning tool not just as a way to evaluate how much information we've learned goes back over a hundred years there's a classic study that was done in 1917 where grade school age children read biographies so they read biographies and then the kids were divided into different groups one group read and reread and reread those biographies over and over another group read the biographies once and then were tested on those biographies but get this they tested themselves on those biographies simply by having to think about the information that they had read and trying to remember the information like what was the biography who was the person who are they married to what did they do when did they go to school what did they do in school what did they do in the world what role did they play in life so they essentially tested their own knowledge simply by going into their own head and asking themselves what they could remember about those biographies now keep in mind here that even though it's fairly apparent that reading a biography to three four times might seem more passive than testing oneself on a biography that they had read just once right you could imagine that thinking about the biography involves more effort and indeed it does but keep in mind also that the kids in the second group were only exposed to the biography once and yet when you look at the percent of accurate recall of information from those biographies the children that read the biography once and then made a deliberate point to think about that biography in their own mind to effectively test themselves on that material just within their heads over and over but an equal number of times as the kids that read the biographies directly on a page over and over vastly outperformed the kids that read the biographies over and over put differently reading and rereading material and re re rereading material is far less effective than reading material and then thinking about that material testing yourself on that material forcing yourself to bring that material to mind in your own mind and this is not just for sake of remembering more volume of material but also accuracy of recall of that material and that at least to me was pretty surprising at first until one starts to explore subsequent studies of the role of testing as a learning tool and then you start to realize that testing yourself is Far and Away the best tool for studying and learning not just for evaluating your knowledge but for actually studying and incorporating that knowledge into your neural circuits okay so I realize that anytime I or somebody else talks about a study that was done in 19 17 we think of people in these you know like wooden shoes and um in these School houses that look so different and uh kids dress so different let's get a little more modern here um keep in mind however that the nervous system hasn't really changed much in tens of thousands of years um nonetheless I think it's nice to think about a more recent study of how best to study and this study which by the way we'll provide a link to in the show note captions as well as a couple of reviews that include results from similar studies again I'm pointing to a body of research not just one study here looked at whether or not studying material four times so study study study study was better in terms of locking that information into people's minds allowing them to use that information flexibly which is an element of creativity essentially giving the Mastery of the material then a different Group which studied once studied the material twice studied the material three times then was tested on the material or a third group that studied material once then took one two yes three tests on the material now so what I just described was three groups all of whom read a passage this was a passage about animals about biology some other topics too in different experiments again three groups one group studies four times they study the material 1 2 3 four times then later they take a test the second group studies one two three times takes a test on that material and then later takes a test the third group studies the material once then takes three tests on the material and then later takes a test so what's analyzed and compared between these different groups is their performance on that final test okay what I put in as the fifth bin there right because it was think about it as ssss so study study study study and then later test or SSS T study study study test and then later test or sttt study test test test and then later test so what's compared and contrasted is performance on the test some period of time later now some experiments made that final test of the material a couple days later other experiments made it a couple weeks later other experiments made it much later month or even a year later okay the point here is twofold first of all based on everything I've told you thus far you can probably guess who performed best on the test that occurred some period of time later okay right the performance on that final test was essentially proportional to the number ofest one had already taken on the material okay that should be pretty much obvious given the way we've been going today in this description of tests as a way to offset forgetting okay so the more tests that you take as a way to expose you yourself to the material the better you're going to perform on that material at some later point now of course at some point you have to be exposed to the material for the first time right that's why it's studying and learning but after one exposure to new material taking more tests on that material even if you don't perform that well on those tests as long as you're able to see the accurate answers to those tests and compare your answers to those answers will lead to better performance on the ultimate test and retention of that material at some later time put differently it's not about how many times you study the material or how many times you're exposed to the material it's about being exposed to the material doing your best to focus and attend to that material and then self- testing yourself on that material or as the case may be if an an instructor is the one giving you the test but nonetheless taking tests on that material not just once but ideally two or three times that's what really locks the material into your neural circuits that's what's going to lead to the most pervasive change the most durable change we should say in your neural circuits that carry that material that hold that material in your mind what we call Neural encoding okay so the the more times you test yourself or that you are tested on material the better your retention of that material now some people will immediately say well goodness what if I learned it and then I'm tested and I'm somehow consolidating the wrong or inaccurate material but it doesn't appear to be the case as long as you learn what the correct answers to the tests are even if you're getting you know 40 or 50% or less accurate on those tests that you take immediately after the studying period that's still going to be a better strategy than rereading the material which ought to be somewhat surprising it certainly was surprising to me but you know what's even more surprising and a little scary and that we all should know and I wish I had learned when I was like in the second grade is that if you ask students how confident are you in the material that you just learned how well do you think you would perform on a test what you see consistently in these studies I'm chuckling because it's kind of mindblowing is that the students who study the the material that is who were exposed to the material four times think that they are going to perform best on the ultimate exam however the students that study the material once and then are tested three times on that material they think that ultimately they're going to perform least well for instance they ask them their confidence how well do you think he would perform on a test of this material in two weeks or in a year or in six months or even tomorrow they report that is the students in the study test test test group report much lower confidence in the material much lower sense of Mastery of the material compared to the students that were exposed to the material four times who are saying yeah I think I would do pretty well or very well and guess what the exact opposite is true put differently when you're exposed to material over and over and over again you think you've learned the material in fact your confidence that you've learned the material increases with each subsequent exposure to the material but actually you haven't learned it at all compared to the people that are exposed to the material and then take tests on the material often times straining to get the answers right on those tests in fact sometimes getting those answers dead wrong and then realizing they get those answers dead wrong or sometimes they just sense it but guess what testing yourself once twice maybe three times prior to the ultimate test of your knowledge of that material is Far and Away the best way to lock that material into those neural circuits now I say I wish I had learned this when I was a student because to some extent I used a self- testing approach the one most Salan example of that is I took a course when I was in college I still remember it was bioscience's 169 L neuroanatomy laboratory taught by Ben ree he's still there I believe and he was known then and I'm sure still now if he's still teaching as extremely challenging Professor extremely challenging not as a person not as personality but a ton of detail and rigor and high high high expectation for this laboratory course in neuroanatomy which involved lectures it involved a neuroanatomy textbook where you'd look at you know essentially panels of different brain sections from different species different types of stains of different brain tissue mind you this is an undergraduate course and then there was a laboratory component hence the L in 169 L where you'd have to go from microscope station to microscope station identifying structures based simply on what you could see down the microscope and therefore you had to know what the stain was you know what was essentially visible to you on the slide because certain stains reveal certain things like the what we call the cell body of neurons versus the um the sort of wires what we call the axons between neurons etc etc I remember thinking this is a really hard course it was a very difficult course and my mode of studying for the course involved of course going to class doing the dissection we dissected a sheep brain at that time um so we're literally dissecting an actual brain we're doing microscope work we're learning about it from the textbook and from lecture and there was a ton of new nomenclature about rostral codal dorsal vent all the stuff of neuron anatomy and then at some point I made the decision perhaps on the basis of sheer overwhelm to study for neuron Anatomy by laying down on my bed in my studio apartment I lived alone and closing my eyes and flying through the nervous system from different entry points through the ear review my coar anatomy through the eye review my retinal Anatomy through the dorsal surface of the brain think about the susai and gyri and then the Corpus colossum and then I got and and I can still see it in my mind's eye so my process of studying for neuroanatomy yes involved exposure to the material but it involved hours upon hours of thinking about the material within my own brain so it's a little bit meta unto itself there as a consequence I like to think in fact I believe um with some confidence that I have uh very high Mastery of neuroanatomy in different species as well now that's my particular area of expertise I don't think I'm any kind of savant with respect to neuro Anatomy I just spent hours upon hours learning the material and then reviewing the material within my mind so in other words testing myself here's what I would do if I were moving down a trajectory of a of a neural tract for instance between say the the hippocampus and a neighboring structure and I didn't know what was next I would then go look it up in the textbook and then I'd go back to this you know mental exercise visualization type studying it really wasn't studying is the point the point is that I was testing myself I was trying to find the points in which I no longer had the knowledge to move further through in this case my mental image of the brain but through the material and this is the key aspect of testing it's not about just knowing how many things you get right how many things you get wrong it's about recognizing exactly what you know and don't know and an important component of testing is running up against those things where you say h i can't remember I don't know what comes next or I'm certain that that structure is the fimbria and then you go and you look and you go it's not the fima but guess what I'll never forget for instance the location of the habenula or what it looks like a structure which by the way since these names are kind of uh esoteric at that time we didn't know what it does it turns out it's involved in disappointment it's key to the depression circuits or the circuits that underly depression in some individuals it is um suppressed by viewing of morning sunlight we know that too and by getting too much artificial light exposure in the middle of the night you enhance activity of the habenula beautiful work not done by my laboratory but other Laboratories demonstrates that so what I just did for you there was hopefully teach you a little something about neuron anatomy and depression but more importantly to just illustrate that how you test yourself can be highly individual to the ways in which you learn best now that contradicts what I said earlier which is that this notion that people have different learning styles and you know some people are verbal Learners and some people are auditory Learners and Etc doesn't really hold up so well anymore but which by the way is not to say there isn't any research to support it it's just that it's heavily contradicted by other research that contradicts that idea but your approach your mode of best testing yourself on material for sake of offsetting the forgetting process and for identifying where you have gaps in your knowledge or where you thought you knew something but you don't or you knew something but it's wrong that can be accomplished through the approach that's best for you which in my case turned out to be lying down and thinking about the material in my head head and still to this day when I read a paper I try I don't always do this but what I try to do is then take a walk in my yard or outside and I try and think about the key components of that paper and think about some of the graphs that are especially important which is what I'm going to do now I'd like to take a brief break to thank one of our sponsors element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means the electrolytes sodium magnesium and pottassium in the correct ratios but no sugar now I and others on the podcast have talked a a lot about the critical importance of hydration for proper brain and bodily function research shows that even a slight degree of dehydration can really diminish cognitive and physical performance it's also important that you get adequate electrolytes in order for your body and brain to function at their best the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium are critical for the functioning of all the cells in your body especially your neurons or nerve cells to make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of hydration and electrolytes I dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning and I drink that basically first thing in the morning I also drink element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing especially on hot days if I'm sweating a lot and losing water and electrolytes if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element.com huberman spelled drink lm.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with the purchase of any element drink mix again that's drink element.com huberman to claim a free sample pack okay so I like to think that we're establishing that testing yourself or testing your students or being tested by your teacher is the best way to offset forgetting let's look at the literature that actually supports that statement directly because in the previous experiment I described it was either study study study study or study study study test or study test test test and then later everybody takes a test at the same time a variant on that was done where they had one group of students study material so this is new material and when I say study I mean they were exposed to the material for the first time and I realize this is a little bit of a problem because we're using the word study when in fact I'm trying to make the point that testing yourself is studying okay so uh forgive me but this is the way it's mapped out in these experiments in these papers should you look them up in our show note captions one group is exposed to the material what we're call studying and then takes a test immediately after they are told what they got right what they got wrong on that test and what the correct answers are and then sometime later after a delay they take a test of the same material another group studies that is they're exposed to the material then there's a delay okay that delay could be days it could be weeks this experiment has been done every which way it seems by now then they're tested and then there's another delay and then they take a test at the same time that group one did okay so again it's study test long delay test for group one or study delay test delay test for group two remember the final test is taken at the same time by everybody or group three study that is they're exposed to the material then a long long long long long delay then a test and then the ultimate test okay the test that everybody takes at the same time can you guess which group performed best and the essence of this experiment if you're listening to this and it's not clear in your mind is you're either expose to the material and test it very soon after and then take a test after a delay say a week or two weeks later or you're exposed the material there's a delay of a few days then you take a test and then another few days and then you take a test so it's more evenly spaced or if you were assigned to the third group you'd study you're not going to see the material or be tested on it until a day or two before the big test then you're tested on it you get your answers back and then you're tested on it again you could imagine that the last group might perform best because they're reexposed to the material they're told what the correct answers are so they know what they got wrong they know what they got right and then the next day they're taking the test again I would have thought that group would perform best but it turns out the opposite is true it's pretty wild the best performance comes from being exposed to material what in this experiment they're called studying okay so they read a passage or they learn some math material or language material or music material or motor learning then they take a test very soon after even same day or next day and then there's a long delay and then they take the test that group performs best put differently test yourself very soon if not the same day certainly the next day or so very soon after being exposed to material for the first time as opposed to the last group which performs worst they perform worse being exposed to material then there's a long period of time then you're tested on that material you are told what you got right what you got wrong and then the next day you take a test again even with overlapping questions to the test you took just the day before and that group performs worst and the group that studied had a gap test that had a gap test they performed somewhere in the middle what does this tell us what it tells us is so important Visa neuroplasticity Vis of V best learning strategies this is something that goodness I wish I had learned when I was in graduate school when I was an undergraduate when I was in high school and Elementary School goodness even when I was in kindergarten I wish IID learned this test yourself on the material that you were just exposed to very soon after your first exposure to it because that offsets the natural forgetting of new material that the brain is exposed to this is absolutely the Hallmark of all the impressive data about testing as a tool for learning testing oneself or your students or being tested if you're the student by your teacher as a tool not just for evaluating performance for knowing what you know and don't know but for consolidating that information in your neural circuits and when I say consolidating that information in your neural circuits I realize it's a mouthful what we know is that this business of putting the testing soon after exposure to new material is about offsetting the forgetting of that material so you might say wait if that's true how come studying the material and then waiting and then then taking two tests right back to back where you're learning the material again during the test that should be the best performing group ah well there seems to be something fundamentally different about first exposure to material versus testing yourself on that material and we don't know exactly what that is there's some interesting neural Imaging data in humans that this has to do something with this notion of familiarity with material this is very simple so this is easy to understand even though it involves a little bit of memory Neuroscience nomenclature familiarity with something recognizing it is not the same thing as having agility with that thing of having Mastery of that thing is not the same thing as having Mastery of the material of having committed it to memory okay so when you read something over and over and over you see it over and over you hear it over and over you think about it over and over of course you're reading it or you're hearing about it and you think that you're learning the material that your neural circuits are changing but it's a pretty passive process or even if it's a difficult chapter to read or a difficult passage of Music the difference is when you're tested on material something happens in your performance of or recalling of if it's just you know cognitive or you're writing it down or you're told to play the the music or do the the motor movement something happens in the error the getting wrong of certain things that cues your nervous system to lock in the information that you have right and to remember what you have wrong so that you then correct it which is Far and Away different than exposure and reexposure and reexposure okay so it's a prerequisite to learning that you need to see the material for the first time you can't just start testing yourself on material you've never been exposed to I suppose you could but you're going to get it I would imagine mostly wrong or all wrong but this business of using testing very soon after first exposure to material as a tool to study in order to offset forgetting is clearly tapping into this difference between familiarity with something for which we know certain brain areas are activated versus recollection being able to take that material and bring it to memory bring it to your focused attention and use that material I realize this is a bit abstract and some of this is still being parsed if you're interested in the Neuroscience of familiarity with something versus your ability to actually recall something and have Mastery of that material there's a really nice review that I provide a link to in the show note caption it's published in the journal hippocampus I always chuckle at the fact that there's a journal that named after a brain structure after all as far as I know there isn't a journal called retina or amydala um and I have a brief anecdote from graduate school whereby I learned that there was this journal hippocampus and I was at a graduate it was my first graduate student gathering in graduate school and the guy who hosted it um turns out is AUM AR in the field of learning and memory and I was saying you know this is ridiculous like there's a journal called hippocampus here I am first year graduate student he goes yeah there is and I said yeah that's so silly like who are the who are the like who are the idiots that name a journal after a brain structure turns out there's also a journal called cerebral cortex and there's probably one about spinal cord so it turns out I I was the idiot saying this and the guy I was talking to who of course was the host of the party said yeah actually uh that's my journal I founded the journal hippoc campus so you can look them up so at this Point you're going to take a test and it's a super easy test okay I realize we're a bit into the material and we're all probably fatiguing a little bit marveling I hope at what an incredible tool testing and in particular self- testing soon after being exposed to new material is and the question is this and by the way this is an open-ended question you're not supposed to know the answer because I haven't told you the answer yet but I want you to think about this if one looks at the majority of data in this whole field of testing as a studying tool how much improvement do you think you get from testing yourself once on new material do you think it's a you know 10% Improvement a 20% Improvement so here I'm just comparing to testing yourself once on material that you were just exposed to For the First Time versus not testing yourself at all okay how how much do you think you improve the answer is about 50% 5 zero and I can say that on the basis of the fact that in studies of musical learning of mathematical learning of language learning of motor learning when subjects are exposed to new material and then tested at some period of time later the percentage of information they get right or that they are able to perform something correctly diminishes over time especially because they're not doing any practice and no testing in the intervening time this was built into these experiments and then you simply ask how much of the material was forgotten if they just were exposed to the material so in the case of say music learning this would be you know your teacher sits down next to you and shows you the scales on the piano but then you're not practicing them in between versus um or perhaps another example would be somebody gives you a lecture about a particular phase in history and then you're not being exposed to the material again and you're not self- testing versus if you just take one test even a self-directed test of the material immediately after irrespective of how well you perform you have the amount of forgetting okay I want you to think about self testing in this way because we're thinking about optimal studying strategies you have the amount of forgetting that would normally occur this is oh so important in fact I don't even know that most neuroscientists think about learning and neuroplasticity this way most everybody including neuroscientists are taught we taught continue to be taught that you're exposed to new material you focus okay then during sleep there's remodeling of the connections all that's true but we really need to think about how most information that comes into our nervous system each day is forgotten most of it is completely discarded there are some rare clinical deficits where people remember everything and I'll tell you these people really struggle in life they do not do well in work in relationships they remember every little detail of everything and it is incredibly disruptive to their quality of life it's nothing you want you want to have a great memory for the right things so when you self test material you have the amount of forgetting that occurs compared to if you're just exposed to the material I want you to keep that fact in mind because that fact is the one that really hit me upside the head and made me realize goodness gracious how I wish that I'd self- tested myself on material that I wanted to remember over time rather than reading it over and over I had this elaborate process for studying that I used all through college and graduate school and it worked pretty well for me where I'd read and highlight then I'd write out my notes then I would write little paragraphs about that stuff now some of that probably mimicked self- testing indeed it had to have and then of course I would take the quizzes and I would go to office hours you know once I got serious about school I got really serious about school and of course I still forget things I've made errors on this podcast before apart from going too fast or making a joke that people didn't perceive as a joke a whole story there but in any case of course I make errors of course I've forgotten certain things and sometimes I misspeak I always strive to get things accurately we correct things in the show note captions if they're called out to us we're now using AI to review the podcast and adjust anywhere using insertion so actually replacing those words if we need to and so on and so forth but yes we all forget things we all make errors but if I had just known that testing myself on material while walking out of class or soon after getting home or later that evening or the next day would allow me to perform so much better on an exam a midterm or a final exam and of course I still would have studied because I was committed and you should still study as much as you feel is necessary to get Mastery of the material for you however if I had known that testing oneself or being tested soon after exposure to material would have the amount of forgetting even out to a year later I definitely would have saved myself a lot of time let's talk about some specifics of ways that you can self test or if you're a teacher or if you have good dialogue with your teacher and they are open-minded perhaps they are open to hearing about what are the best forms of testing oneself as a tool for learning the best tests are open-ended short answer very minimal prompt tests not unlike the type that we've taken today during this podcast as compared to multiple choice tests multiple choice questions allow for familiarity of names of facts you know it's going to be a b c d and sometimes e is you know A and C and so on and so forth and within each of those a b CDE e answers and you're looking for the right answer you're looking for the familiarity the recognition of something yes this not that okay that's the best answer you Circle C okay this kind of thing as opposed to an open-ended question where you have to write out your answer you have to recall the information right it requires a much greater degree of Mastery of the information than does familiarity or recognition of the material so the best tests as study tools are going to be open-ended short answer questions or even long answer questions now there's one exception to this which are multiple choice tests that include tricks okay if you've ever taken the GRE the graduate school entrance exam or the elsat or the MCAT there are some questions in there that are very straightforward but in those standardized tests they tend to include some quote unquote trick questions in which those questions don't allow you to just recognize the correct answer and distinguish it from the other incorrect answers but rather they have answers in there that on first blush look like the right answer and people have a tendency to Circle those and move on or to select those and move on but if you think about the material a little more deeply turns out those quote unquote obvious answers are actually the incorrect answers so there are versions of multiple choice tests where it requires a greater degree of Mastery of the material where simple familiarity won't serve you and you actually have to be able to recall the different components of information leading into that but those are a bit more rare certainly in the context of other kinds of learning like musical learning although I suppose for music theory that could be relevant but when I say Music Learning I'm just kind of fating to the idea of the mechanics of musical learning but of course there's music theory Etc so what I'm effectively saying is the ultimate exam the final exam the midterm exam the exam that's administered to you rarely do you have control over the format of that exam sometimes it's mixed format but the different ways in which you self- test as a form of studying are really key and ideally you would make these open-ended in other words you would not simply rely on multiple choice you would rely on a form of self- testing or that you give your students or that your teacher gives you that requires you to think about the material with some degree of depth with some degree of effort and of course you're going to get certain things wrong now I would hope that if testing is being used as a learning tool as opposed to just for evaluation but here we're talking about using testing as a learning tool that it wouldn't impact at least not at that moment your final performance in the course or whatever it is rather it is testing for sake of learning learning now we know from the literature that students don't like pop quizzes I gave you a few today and forgive me they don't like pop quizzes and we know this in the form of the reduction in teaching evaluation scores okay uh having received teaching evaluation scores of different uh let's say values over the years and I always take the feedback seriously one Salient comment that just leapt into my mind was the fact that I end up mentioning my Bulldog Costello too often in class so here I'm mentioning him again just to get back at that one student that said I mention too much I'll mention him as much as I want the point here is that when students evaluate their teachers they tend to punish their teachers for pop quizzes does that mean pop quizzes aren't effective no but you know what's more effective telling students at the outset of class or telling yourself at the outset of any kind of learning Expedition because this isn't just about the classroom that you're going to take a bunch of exams that you're going to use testing or quizzes whatever you want to call them as a form of teaching and learning and that you can expect five tests or five quizzes during the course of being presented the material or that you are going to test yourself every day after the material now sometimes you have to go from one class to the next class there isn't an opportunity to test yourself but guess what's not going to be helpful walking out of class and getting immediately on to your phone we know that that probably inhibits your ability to remember the material because it's going to enhance forgetting because you do have this key opportunity right after being exposed to new material to help offset the forgetting by testing yourself on that material as soon as possible after being exposed to it so again even though I did not attend school in an era where we had smartphones and texting I recall walking out of class and just walking out of class and going to my bicycle but of course there were people to talk to there were other things to attend to if you're really serious about learning material take a few seconds maybe even a few minutes after being exposed to that material and think about that material test yourself on it and if you find that you don't know the material you're confused by it or overwhelmed by it great you just accomplished the first step in queuing your nervous system to the fact that it needs to learn that material and you've created an opportunity for enhanced neuroplasticity which is really what all of the stuff about testing as a form of studying is about you're going to test yourself so that you figure out what you don't know so that you then look up that material test yourself on it again so that ultimately you forget very little of it if any now there are other components to learning and neuroplasticity that I've talked about on previous podcast that are just too interesting not to mention but I'm just going to mention them in brief things like Gap effects Gap effects are oh so cool and they've been demonstrated for lots of different forms of learning Gap effects are what I just did which is to take periodic pauses in the learning of material as short as 5 to 10 seconds but even as long as 30 seconds during which guess what your hippocampus the neurons in your hippocampus repeat information that you've been exposed to for the first time at a rate 20 to 30 times faster than typical just as it does during rapid ey movement sleep so if you are a teacher and or if you are a learner periodically throughout an episode a class or whatever of trying to learn new motor skills or music skills or whatever kind of learning pause and let your hippocampus generate more repetitions of that material than it would otherwise if you just tried to Barrel through so I realize as we've gone through today's discussion that words like test and quiz evaluation offsetting forgetting all of that stuff can you know Spike people's cortisol it can uh give us flashbacks to uncomfortable classroom experiences related to being called on cold called uh for the answer um a vicious trick that instructors play keep in mind that testing as a form of studying whether or not self-directed or given to you by a teacher is not for sake of evaluation at the level of okay you know you get an exam at the end of a lecture and then you do your best to answer those questions and then you turn it in and it impacts your grade no this is about being told or revealing to yourself how much you know and don't know and then of course being told the correct answers so that you can compare your answers to the correct answers and doing this frequently and ideally very soon after being exposed to the material that's one of the key things that I keep coming back to again and again here um because it's something that frankly was not done well I was in school um for whatever reason and I think that's largely because when people hear the word testing they think of evaluation and if anything at least in the United States over the last 30 years but in particular over the last 15 years there's been this tendency to shift away from formal evaluation you know I personally believe that one can learn in many different styles and many different contexts I of course as a university Professor um believe that for certain topics in particular science and medicine and health but other topics as well of course that formal rigorous coursework is by far the best way to learn information for me but that regardless of whether or not you're learning just from YouTube or you're learning from podcasts or you're learning from books you're learning from the school of life as it were from experience that testing as a form of studying is absolutely key and gosh there's such a beautiful body of research in fact I'll link to several studies including a review entitled testing enhances learning a review of the literature as well as a beautiful article test enhanced learning uh which gets into this and there's a wonderful book about this that I'll also provide a link to in the show note captions um all of course authored by researchers who have worked squarely in this field and compare the data on testing as a studying tool to other forms of studying and learning so it's a really impressive literature that I do believe we all should have known about and that's why I'm passing it on to you now now before we wrap up I want to make sure that I emphasize some of the other key components to studying and learning that have nothing to do with testing as a studying tool and those are the role of emotion the role of story and the role of what's called interleaving now in terms of emotion I think we all inherently understand that more emotionally Laden experiences are remembered more durably we tend not to forget them in fact this is the basis of things like PTSD post-traumatic stress disorder it is the reality that one trial learning that is exposure to something and never forgetting it occurs very readily when the thing that we're exposed to is negative or has a very heavy negative emotional Salient so it could be something we read or something we see sometimes it's something that happens to us you know I I don't like the idea of that but this is true your nervous system is wired such neuroplasticity is such that stressful experiences because they deploy such massive amounts of adrenaline epinephrine as well as other neuromodulators allow very quickly for the milu the environment of the neural circuits that led up to that experience to strengthen their connections with one trial so-call one trial learning this is why sadly although at the same time from an Adaptive perspective we say fortunately if you were to step outside today and God forbid see somebody get hit by a car you would remember that chances are you would remember that forever now that does not mean that the emotional components of that memory are necessarily going to stay within you there are tools for the treatment of PTSD such as the different ones that come to mind are you know systematic exposure therapy where you're reexposed to that idea or memory sometimes even circumstance with of course the support of a trained professional typically a psychiatrist or psychologist and the emotional load of that experience is gradually uncoupled from your M Mor of the experience there's things like EMDR there are pharmacologic approaches some of these are combined with the sorts of things I've described I've done entire episodes about stress and PTSD again you can find those at hubman lab.com by putting stress PTSD into the search function however we know that it is the same neuromodulators mainly epinephrine and norepinephrine deployed at massive amounts in those moments where something very stressful happens that allows the neural circuits that led up to the circumstance as well as the neural circuits that encode that visual scene and scenes like it or sounds like it to be locked in and linked to the stress response now what this is really all saying is that negative stuff is remembered typically the first time and every time and very durably over time as compared to positive experiences which as far as Peak experiences go right birth of your first child a wedding a wonderful um professional or person experience those two can be one trial learning and memory but most things that we are exposed to are not at those extremes either negative or positive however we know that any kind of story any kind of emotional emphasis on material either in the delivery of that material but certainly in the way that that material is perceived by you like getting really excited about something you want to learn or thinking something's really awful is likely to be more readily and stably committed to your memory and that's because of these neuromodulators like epinephrine and norepinephrine but other neuromodulators as well that wire those experiences into your neural circuits again these neuromodulators epinephrine norepinephrine we also hear about acetycholine dopamine Etc they can operate at low levels and sort of background levels they can create subtle fluctuations and mood focus and attention or they can create massive shifts in mood focus and attention depending on their levels their time and much much more Point here is that if you're a teacher Andor if you are a learner paying attention to your internal State as you're trying to learn is very key we've all had that teacher that lecture that just kind of drones things out in monotone if you need to learn the material coming out of a source like that person or otherwise you're going to have to ramp up your level of internal attention consciously in order to bring about some emotional salience some intensity to the way it's perceived and you can do that just through your own thinking as opposed to the situation whether you have a super Dynamic teacher who's telling you things with wide eyes and perhaps even cracking jokes by the way the teachers that crack jokes get lower teacher evaluations than those that don't crack jokes or swear did you know that the teachers that crack jokes and swear they're perceived as more likable but they get lower overall evaluations typically they're seen as less professional and therefore less good teachers by their students that's why I try not to make too many jokes or swear in my lectures the point being that we all have those really wonderful Dynamic teachers yes it's much easier to learn and remember that material you still need to test yourself on it but it's much easier to learn that material for the very reasons I say it before it's a lesser example of more deployment of the neuromodulators in you the learner that is exposed to that material okay so emotion matters so much so that in a beautiful review about learning a memory from the Great James maau one of The Luminaries in modern neuroscience and psychology of memory he talked about a medieval practice this is pretty wild whereby people and kids kids are people of course but adults and kids were taught information and then thrown literally thrown into cold water why to deploy adrenaline and consolidate memory of the material they were exposed to now I know we've covered deliberate cold exposure on this podcast before no I'm not saying you need to do a cold plunge after being exposed to new material but guess what they were doing that many hundreds of years ago and it makes sense logically based on all our understanding of the neurobiology underlying things like PTSD underlying emotion Laden memory formation and consolidation and our ability to remember things that were emotionally Laden much better than things that were less emotionally Laden so if you want to take a cold shower after learning some material or even better testing yourself mentally on that material while in a cold shower or cold plunge you certainly can just don't stay in there too long use best practices if you want to know what those best practices are for deliberate cold exposure you can check out our deliberate cold exposure newsletter at huberman lab.com it's completely zero cost you don't even need to sign up you simply go to newsletter in the menu tab and you can find that PDF and now because you are becoming proficient in an understanding of neuroplasticity and learning and testing and neuromodulators like epinephrine yes drinking caffeine will increase your levels of EP nephrine not strikingly so but enough that it probably helps you learn things a little bit better should you drink the coffee after listen that's getting a little bit too down in the details the most important components to learning are that you be alert so that you can attend so you can pay attention to the material you're trying to learn and then testing yourself later and of course the other component which is getting sufficient amounts of great sleep each night and I highly recommend doing nsdr I mentioned Gap effects before those are very very cool I just used another one now and the final tool for studying that I believe is not discuss enough and is a bit counterintuitive so it's a fun one to just mention and that perhaps you can explore in your own studying and learning Adventures is interleaving of information this one's kind of wild actually turns out that if your instructor or you takes information about something that they're trying to teach you or you're trying to learn maybe it's piano know maybe it's Neuroscience maybe it's how to learn better and every once in a while throws in a little anecdote about something let's just say or mention something about the Olympics or incorporate something that seems pseudo random because it's not actually related to the material you're trying to learn turns out that that acts not as a gap in the same sense that Gap effects which are times in which you do nothing in order to get more repetitions of the material you just heard in your hippocampus but rather those breaks of interleaving information not just getting a steady barrage like drinking from a fire hose of new information from start to finish turn out to enhance overall learning ability probably we think at a mechanistic level because the neural circuits are able to generate more repetition similar to Gap effects but actually in a very interesting way also because by injecting other information that seems totally unrelated random or pseudo random it allows the brain areas that are responsible for encoding information to take whatever new information you're learning and to incorporate it with existing knowledge or even distantly related knowledge so does this mean that you should learn math and history in the same lecture well I think that might be a bit overwhelming kind of like drinking from Two Fire hoses here we're talking about interleaving challenging information that's new to you with little anecdotes little bits of information that perhaps are new to you but don't require a lot of challenge which is of course why every once in a while I throw in a little anecdote about my Bulldog or learning neuroanatomy or something of that sort it's not just to provide a break it's to provide examples that are related but not Central to the material that we've been talking about today which is all about how to study and learn optimally okay so I realize that many of you are not students any longer although some of you are but in many ways we are all students we are all constantly being exposed to all sorts of information out in the world and goodness knows um thank goodness we don't remember it all but there is of course information that we would like to remember that we would really like to consolidate in our memory and be able to have some Mastery over earlier I said I would distinguish between unskilled skilled Mastery and virtuosity and I'll do that now unskilled of course means that we have limited understanding let alone um ability to use information skilled typically means we know and can recognize and use information in basic ways or even Advanced ways Mastery typically means that we have you know close to the full depth of knowledge in a given area and that we can use it pretty flexibly and virtuosity at least my definition of virtuosity is where we actually have such Mastery of material that we can use it in ways that we still don't even know how we can use meaning that we can inject elements or we even invite elements of uncertainty and kind of spontaneity into the use of that material here I'm thinking of great musicians I'm thinking of great athletes where they know all the plays they know all the moves it's all scripted into their nervous system and they can deploy those at any time so they have real Mastery but in order to display their incredible abilities their virtuosity they actively invite in The X Factor the uncertainty such that sometimes they find themselves playing their instrument or singing or performing athletically or mathematically or what have you in way that even surprise them and that of course is a lot to expect of ourselves I think most of us would be uh content to have skill and Mastery of the things that we care about and you know should we achieve virtuosity then wonderful but one of the main points of today's discussion was to arm you with an understanding of neuroplasticity in the context of studying and learning to really understand that so much of learning stably and consolidating information over time is to offset the forgetting process and that testing is not just a tool for evaluating our knowledge but rather a tool for evaluating and reinforcing and building our knowledge put differently that testing is an excellent tool if not the best tool for studying and I think that's an important reframe that others have brought about and that I really want to highlight underline and bold face during today's discussion it's one that I certainly wish I had applied more in my educational trajectory and it's one that I plan to deploy further in my seeking out of new knowledge in terms of the podcast and Neuroscience but in other areas of my life as well because from the existing literature and hopefully from the way it was presented to you today you probably realize that it is near infinite if not infinite that we can apply testing as a tool for studying self- testing testing of others using testing as a way to really probe what we know and don't know and to really offset that forgetting process and in that sense it is is really nicely aligned with what we know about neuroplasticity and it's also something that we can use freely and that you can use covertly that you can apply in your own seeking out of knowledge and new skills of all kinds classroom or otherwise if you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast please subscribe to our YouTube channel

Title: Dr. Teo Soleymani: How to Improve & Protect Your Skin Health & Appearance
Published: 2024-08-19 12:01:06 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. Teo Soleymani, M.D., a double-board-certified dermatologist and specialist in skin cancer and reconstructive surgery. We discuss science and clinically supported protocols to improve skin health and give your skin a more youthful appearance and structure, reducing premature aging and skin cancer risk.
 
We discuss the impact of sun exposure on skin appearance and aging and the surprising relationship between sun exposure and skin cancer. We explain how mineral-based (inorganic) sunscreens differ from chemical (organic) sunscreens, whether sunscreen can minimize premature skin aging, reduce cancer risk, and if there are any health risks associated with sunscreen use.
 
We discuss skincare routines to significantly improve skin appearance and how to select skincare products. We discuss how caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and stress impact the skin and describe how nutrition and anti-inflammatory diets can improve skin health. We also discuss the causes and treatments for common skin conditions, including dandruff, acne, rosacea, eczema, psoriasis, and vitiligo.
 
Our conversation also covers topics such as the use of retinoids, laser treatments, red-light phototherapy, supplements, and how to best monitor for skin cancer. This episode provides numerous actionable protocols, most of which are zero-to-low cost, for improving skin health and appearance, reducing cancer risk, and treating skin problems.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Teo solmani Dr Teo solmani is a double board certified dermatologist and dermatologic surgeon he did his training at Stanford University and he was a clinical professor of Dermatology and dermatologic surgery at UCLA that is is the University of California Los Angeles today we discuss all things related to skin appearance skin health and skin longevity for instance we discuss sun exposure and the impact it can have on both the appearance and health of one's skin in reference to that we discuss sunscreens which ones are safe which ones perhaps elicit a bit more concern or perhaps should be avoided and we discuss the surprising relationship between sun exposure and skin cancer we discuss laser treatments for the skin both for the appearance of skin in order to make it appear more youthful as well as to prevent certain forms of skin cancer we discuss retinoids we discuss supplements and nutrition all in reference again to skin health and appearance thanks to Dr soloman's incredible depth of expertise as well as Clarity of communication about the dos and do Nots that relate to skin care and appearance and to avoiding and treating skin cancers by the end of today's episode You Will Be armed with an immense amount of knowledge that is the very latest in our understanding of how to improve and protect your skin before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Roa Roa makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of different challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly from moment to moment Roa understands all of that and has designed all of their ey glasses and sunglasses with the biology of the visual system in mind Roa eyeglasses and sunglasses were first designed for use in sport in particular for things like running and cycling and as a consequence Roa frames are extremely lightweight so much so that most of the time you don't even remember that you're wearing them and they're also designed so that they don't slip off even if you get sweaty now even though Roa eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed for sport they now have many different frames and styles all of which can be used not just for sport but also for wearing out to dinner to work essentially anytime in any setting I wear Roa readers at night or Roa eyeglasses if I'm driving at night and I wear Roa sunglasses in the middle of the day anytime it's too bright for me to see clearly my eyes are somewhat sensitive so I need that I particularly like the hunter 2.0 frames which I have as eyeglasses and now as sunglasses too if if you'd like to try Roa you can go to roka.com huberman to get 20% off your purchase again that's roka.com huberman to get 20% off today's episode is also brought To Us by ju ju makes medical grade red light therapy devices now there's one thing I've consistently emphasized on this podcast is the incredible impact that light can have in our biology now in addition to sunlight redl and near infrared light have been shown to have positive effects on improving numerous aspects of Cellar and organ health including faster Muscle Recovery improves skin health and wound healing even improvements in acne reducing pain and inflammation improving mitochondrial function and even improving Vision itself what sets juv lights apart and why they're my preferred red light therapy devices is that they use clinically proven wavelengths meaning it uses specific wavelengths of red light and near infrared light in combination to trigger the optimal Cellar adaptations personally I use the ju handheld light both at home and when I travel it's only about the size of a sandwich so it's super portable and convenient to use I also have a ju whole body panel and I use that about three or four times per week if you'd like to try ju you can go to ju spell jv.com huberman juv is offering an exclusive discount to all huberman lab listeners with up to $400 off select ju products again that's ju jv.com huberman to get $400 off select ju products today's episode is also brought To Us by Helix sleep Helix sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are customized to your unique sleep needs I've spoken many times before on this other podcast about the fact that getting a great night's sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance now the mattress we sleep on makes an enormous difference in terms of the quality of sleep that we get each night we need a mattress that is matched to our unique sleep needs one that is neither too soft nor too hard for you one that breathes well and that won't be too warm or too cold for you if you go to the Helix website you can take a brief two-minute quiz and it asks you questions such as do you sleep on your back your side or your stomach do you tend to run hot or cold during the night things of that sort maybe you know the answers to those questions maybe you don't either way Helix will match you to the ideal mattress for you for me that turned out to be the dusk mattress DS I've been sleeping on a dusk mattress for gosh now more than four years and the sleep that I've been getting is absolutely phenomenal if you'd like to try Helix you can go to Helix sleep.com huberman take that brief two-minute sleep quiz and Helix will match you to a mattress that is customized to your unique sleep needs right now Helix is giving up to 25% off mattresses and two free pillows again that's helixsleep.com huberman to get 25% off and two free pillows and now for my discussion with Dr Teo solomani Dr Teo solomani welcome thanks for having me it's awesome to be here very very privileged to be here thank you oh well it's an honor to have you let's talk about this amazing organ we call skin so skin of course covers our other organs it's its own living biological entity and just for sake of educational purposes and to frame the rest of what we're going to talk about how much turnover is there in our skin meaning the skin that I'm wearing right now is that going to be 100% 50% of the skin that I'm going to be wearing a year from now I'm 49 years old so well you look great for 49 so whatever you're doing keep it up so the Skin's an amazing organ just like you said it's the largest organ and the largest Dynamic organ we have in our body you have new skin brand new skin every 28 days so the surface of your skin turns over about every month now the stem cells which are in the lowest portion of our epidermis uh remain and they generate the skin cells but you have brand new skin the same way you have new gut lining every 28 days it's amazing for many reasons because the skin is one of the few organs that can regenerate because of this so you can grow new skin you can test things on skin if your skin gets injured it will regenerate and heal itself whereas many other organs cannot do that and because of this it also allows us to use it as a model platform for studying diseases of all kinds so Skin's an amazing organ I mean I guess I'm biased but well uh I find a 28-day turnover just to be incredible the skin as I understand it is inated that is it receives connections from the nervous system so I think for many people their interest in skin is skin appearance although we will also talk about skin Health but in terms of skin appearance how much does stress shortterm and longer term stress impact the appearance of our skin and how does that work I could imagine that the neurons release certain things into the skin um does stress make our skin age faster does that mean it turns over more quickly or turns over more slowly maybe could link these two aspects of our biology for us yeah that that's a great question so in order to understand that we have to just look at the the structure of the Skin So this skin generally is three layers the epidermis the dermis and the subcutaneous fat and the dermis is where most of the biologic activity resides that's where our blood vessels are that's where the nerves that inate sensation and movement reside that's where our hair follicles oil glands and sweat glands reside so stress has two components there's what we call acute stress meaning stress that happens within a short period of time and then there's long-term stress or chronic stress and both have different uh processes in the skin and you see the results of stress both immediately in the skin with release of certain chemical Messengers in an autocrine paracrine and holocrine fashion and then you see the long-term delerious effects of stress in a different mechanism in which there's actually breakdown of the skin the easiest way to see this is when people are stressed and they lose their hair and the hair obviously is an extension of our skin it's a biosensor of our well-being and we see this all the time you know I see students during finals time where they're really stressed out and they're coming with their hair falling out or after a large medical illness or a pregnancy patients will come in and say their hair is falling out so that acute stress is seen right away and that's due to several different reasons and release of Messengers and and hormones and and chemical mediators that that do this long-term stress is usually mitigated or caused by cortisol and everybody knows cortisol it's the you know fundamental stress hormone of our body it falls in the same family as drugs that we give like prednizone um falls in the same family of cholesterol testosterone and estrogen but cortisol does something very different it breaks things down to allow our body to utilize it in times of stress because unfortunately our body doesn't understand the difference between 21st century stress and old stress so us being chased by a lion to our to our B's messaging system is the same as meeting chronic deadlines at work and what happens is cortisol is responsible for the breakdown of things like collagen and elastin thinning of vessel walls which allow our skin to look Supple and healthy so as we have a lot of stress and a lot of cortisol release we see aging and there's accelerated aging studies that look at patients and people who are under high periods of stress a great example of studies we look at presidents in which they appear to have aged much more rapidly than matched controls in a four-year period of time so stress plays a really important role you see it both immediately and long term I guess people rarely are sympathetic to presidents for aging quickly because I guess if there were a president who did not age quickly we would worry they did not work hard enough or something of that sort but um the relationship between stress and skin fascinates me because not just of the direct relationship like when we see people in their stressed like it seems like that their whole the power of their skin changes um the kind of level of of uh gleam in their eyes change and of course the eyes are a direct you know piece of the nervous system really they're as close to the brain as one can get viewed outside the skull but it also suggest because of the dynamic turnover of skin every 28 days that if people were to to become less stressed that their skin health and appearance might improve is that also the case for sure it's why you see people have a glow after vacation but you can't quantify that in a test tube or a lab so in the immediate phase there's a big shift in blood flow to the skin and when you're feeling you know very stressed out immediately there's a fight ORF flight response that constricts the blood vessels in our skin to shuffle them to muscles and places where we need to our body thinks we need to utilize them more that's why when people are really stressed out they may look p haale or gaunt and that's the we we see that right away um and then as as that builds up over time the health the actual quality of our dermis and and fat deteriorate from chronic stress changes mainly due to cortisol and and its sibling hormones and messaging systems in our skin so for sure I mean stress is like something that is impossible to quantify in a lab measure but very easily seen on exam just looking at your skin I can tell you've had either a rough day if you didn't sleep well you can see it in your skin your eyes so absolutely I mean that's why everybody likes to live a stress-free life and we see changes and Improvement in skin Health when people move away from that stressor whether it's a physical stressor emotional stressor psychosocial stressor there's actual quantifiable improvements in skin health and that's pretty fascinating it is fascinating uh it also speaks to the value of having some immed immediate and long-term stress reduction techniques just as a sort of first principle of taking care of one's skin there are some other things that cause Vaso constriction the the basically the tightening of the vessels and capillaries to the skin as I understand maybe we could just um tick through a few of these and and get your sense um I consume caffeine every morning usually Yerba tea some coffee a little bit later those will increase basil constriction to some extent uh although chronic caffeine intake may cause Vaso dilation so I'd like to know the relationship between caffeine and blood flow to the skin and skin health and appearance that's the first question and then dovetailed with that question is nicotine which is also thought to be a vasoconstrictor it raises blood pressure um because it's a vasoconstrictor what are the effects of caffeine both acutely and chronically and nicotine let's assume that nicotine is consumed either by smoking or oral ingestion um on skin appearance and health that's a good question so caffeine is a known Vaso constrictor fortunately when it's consumed in quantities that we have in coffee tea and you know equivalent beverages the amount that affects the tiny capillaries and arterials in our skin is minute and transient so you may get a a transient Vaso constriction with high caffeine intake but usually there's a compensatory vasod dilation as a result um so the effects on skin are not as atic as people may make it seem now one thing that we do see and it's a little unclear as to why is that people who have chronic high caffeine intake tend to produce more sebum In Their Skin and it may be a result of Vaso constriction may be a result of something that we don't understand that's compensatory as a result of those changes so a lot of people who consume coffee may experience a little bit oilier skin that being said the data is equivocal as to whether or not caffeine has a dilus beneficial or net neutral effect on the skin I drink a lot of coffee I haven't found that the Vaso constriction is something that's noticeable but there are people who have different skin types patients who have rosacea for example who are much more sensitive to those changes they may notice that change in the color in the Vaso constriction more with caffeine consumption what used to be thought was that caffeine itself was a problem for flushing and redness and now we've realized it's actually not so much the caffeine because the concentration that reaches the skin is so minuscule it's actually the temperature of the bever beverages we drink so hot beverages can affect the color of your skin can make you flush more make the redness more pronounced cold beverages tend not to have that effect so it used to be an old adage and people who had like rosacea for example we'd say don't drink coffee don't drink tea it's actually the temperature of the beverage not so much the caffeine content interesting and what about nicotine so nicotine great question it is a known Vaso constrictor now the concentration of nicotine when smoked is higher in the skin because of inhalational effects and the local effect of nicotine on our skin so you do see a measurable Vaso constriction in the skin that becomes a problem which is why patients who smoke age faster patients who had surgery who smoke have a higher risk for poor wound outcomes for poor healing because of that Vaso constriction usually people who who use or consume nicotine aren't doing it once a week most people are using it daily or multiple times a day so that chronic Vaso constriction adds up and has a net negative effect on the skin so if you want to keep your skin healthy if you want to look younger I would refrain from nicotine use what about vaping nicotine or oral use of nicotine so nitin gum mints pouches and let's let's touch on vaping first because that's becoming more common so with vaping we see the same problems in the skin we don't know if it's um an inhalational issue or if it's actually the same concentration of nicotine that's reaching local skin causing the effect but we see the same Vaso constriction when you match cigarette smoke with with vaping if you have the same nicotine content now for patches and gum it's less of a problem and why that is is the concentration of nicotine that reaches the skin is much lower usually when you chew it it has to go through your digestive tract then enter your bloodstream then reach the surface of the skin when you have a transdermal patch it still goes through the bloodstream then ends up in the skin so because of how much it has to be processed the concentration that reaches the skin is much lower when we operate when we do surgery whe any surgery of any kind we try to transition people who smoke or vape to at least gums or patches to mitigate their withdrawal effect but um you know so they don't have the feelings but you know it doesn't have the same constrictive effects on their skin what about alcohol you know question did an episode of this podcast on alcohol which somewhat to my surprise you know uh was very widely shared only to my surprise because I've never been a big consumer of alcohol um but apparently many out there are and the data came back at least to my understanding that zero alcohol is healthier than any and that up to two drinks per week is probably okay as long as you're an adult of drinking age and not an alcoholic you don't have issues with alcohol use disorder as it's now called probably okay but beyond that you start running into some health issues that can be offset by better behaviors of other types but what about the Direct effects of alcohol on skin in the short term does it increase blood flow and therefore improv skin um um are there long-term indirect effects I could imagine that alcohol disrupts the gut microbiome which then disrupts skin Etc so maybe we could break this down into direct acute effects meaning immediate effects that are really direct from consuming alcohol that day that week let's say versus chronic effects through other systems like disruption of sleep and microbiome yeah great question um alcohols alcohol and skin connections complicated convoluted but generally thought to be negative both shortterm and longterm so first alcohol tends to be a mild diuretic so it makes our body dispose of water a little bit more frequently um what happens short term is that one you get a almost a mild diuretic effect from alcohol consumption which is why you tend to be thirsty in the middle of the night and wake up in the morning tend to be parched as a result you see that diuretic effect on their skin you see a little bit of hollowing in areas that you'd have normal volume and suppleness which is why there you know people tend to see bags under their eyes or they look like they had a hangovers from that mild diuretic effect also as a compensatory mechanism the skin produces a bit more sebum to compensate for that drying out effect so in the acute phase your skin dries out you look look a little bit worse because of that diuretic effect in patients who cannot or people who cannot tolerate alcohol um and there are genetics in Asian populations and Southeast Asians that have a difficulty in breaking down acetal dhide that is a a toxin that shows up in the skin and makes the skin vasodilate as a result so that common College term that we used to hear you know the flush or the glow or you know incorrectly called the Asian glow is as a result of the inability to break down alcohol and that usually you see immediately people get a very bright red uh flush in their skin because of the acetal theide buildup in the skin long term one the diuretic effect becomes a problem so over time your Skin's producing constantly more sebum to keep the skin Supple your skin is drying out and as a result you run into things like breakouts and you know congested skin you know blackheads whitee heads things like that but long-term alcohol use is also associated with lifestyle choices that may make your skin Health worse generally speaking when people are out Bing drinking they tend not to come home and do things that'll maintain their skin now that's not a fixed rule but most of the time when you're out you know having a few beers or cocktails at the bar you tend to come home and not do your diligent skincare routine or you may not be up you know with your hydration status or your dietary habit so that's something we can't quantify easily but contributes significantly to faster aging poor skin Health then the gut microbiome question this is a great question because the data is widely variable for alcohol consumption and the effects or changes permanent or transient in the gut microbiome there are some alcohol products like kombucha that has u a higher alcohol concentration that's healthy for your gut then there's hard alcohols with a higher concentration that act as anesthetics and act as gut paralytics so one of the things we see in people who consume a lot of high percentage alcohols is actually gut immobility and gut paralysis partly because of the anesthetic effect partly because of the analgesic effect of alcohol and also because it affects gut motility as a toxin so generally speaking gut the gut health depending on your consumption patterns use and concentration can be very dilus some people are very sensitive and they have changes that reflect in the skin as a result of drinking a lot and then there are some people who tolerate it more or maybe consuming things that are um healthier for the gut microbiome like things like um fermented alcohols like kombucha and things like that so generally speaking the higher the concentration the greater the the problems the higher the percentage of alcohol the greater the problems that includes the diuretic effects that includes effects on the gut microbiome that includes lifestyle habits if you're drinking a lot of higher percentage alcohols you tend to feel the effects you know not just in the skin cognitively behavior-wise that can affect you whereas sometimes lower concentration alcohols depending on the setting and lifestyle may be net neutral may be positive unclear on that part but I'm not hearing any positive effects of alcohol on skin Health generally not generally not it it same as what we've seen with other organ systems the brain the liver the skin reflects the same thing if anything it may be a net neutral most of the time it's a net negative and what I'm pulling from all of the discussion we've had up until now is that improved blood flow and strong hydration status are both important do you recommend patients drink a certain amount of fluid each day or maintain adequate hydration as a means to build or maintain skin health and appearance great question so that's that's another common misconception that I see in that thinking drinking a lot of water will or drinking a lot of fluids will directly affect the hydration status of their skin and while there's a certain degree of Truth to that if you're dehydrated and that you need replenishment of fluid you know systemically the every study that's looked at transepidermal water loss has not shown a great connection with regular you know fluid intake and water intake and skin hydration stat status we find that that tends to be genetically defined and genetically encoded some people have drier skin they need more methods to moisturize their skin some people have oilier skin and their sebum provides that moisturization now if you're doing things if you're active if you're an athlete if you're doing things in which you are dehydrated then totally different story but if you're living a more or less Balanced Life or a sedentary life and you're doing all the regular things drinking a lot of water or fluids has not been shown to improve skin health so that's why generally speaking most dermatologists will recommend some sort of moisturizer to replenish that but you got to know your skin for example my skin I tend to be oilier I don't usually need a moisturizer as much whereas somebody who is drier will need some sort of barrier protection to allow to minimize that transepidermal water loss what are some of the um parameters for selecting a moisturizer um yeah you know people people are immediately going to go to say what what constitutes a good moisturizer what should it have in it what are some things to avoid yeah it's a crazy Market there's a lot of things out there I mean you can Google skin snail moisturizer and you'll find people putting snail mucin on their skin as a moisturizer telling me before this uh recording started there are people who and forgive me for those that cringe when I say this um that put placental extract human placenta as a means of rejuvenating their skin health I don't Advocate it or don't say anything against it but um I probably wouldn't recommend it there's better safer more cost-effective ways of doing this simple things you want to look for one is it non-comedogenic that's a word you want to look for for any moisturizer that's been tested not to clog your pores that's a basic thing to look for where you won't cause another problem in trying to fix one problem number two how oily or dry are you generally speaking there are three flavors of moisturizers there's ointments there's creams and there's lotions ointments are greasy they're like petrolatum jelly or Vaseline based those are the best for moisturizing your skin but they're greasy then there's creams which are water emulsions with oil um suspended in it and then there's lotions which are generally powders that are resuspended with water we as dermatologists tend to like the greasier the better it provides the best barrier protection but you have to know your skin if you're somebody that is eczema prone you will need something that is an ointment that does better to protect the skin from drying out if you're somebody that is acne prone you won't tolerate greasy things you'll break out more so you want to look for a lighter moisturizer that's non- cogenic so in a long story short it's very you know personto person specific you got to know your skin but the fundamental things you want to look for is has this been tested to not not um clog pores and is it in a pump bottle or is it in a jar jars tend to be more occlusive they tend to provide more moisturization but they can lead to problems like acne and breakouts whereas things in a pump bottle because they're suspend their powder in suspension and they have to put alcohol in the product to allow it to come out of the pump mechanism they tend to be lighter and not provide as as much moisturization I see so when I think about something in a jar think of something like um aquafor or something which is pretty thick thick stuff so that would be fine for someone with eczema not okay for somebody with acne yeah exactly exactly the greasier the more ACC clusion it provides but in doing so it clogs everything now if you're one that has some sort of skin issue in which you need that it's the best thing if you're one that is breaking out all the time you want something lighter I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 by now many of you have heard me say that if I could take Just One supplement that supplement would be ag1 the reason for that is ag1 is the highest quality and most complete of the foundational nutritional supplements available what that means is that it contains not just vitamins and minerals but also probiotics prebiotics and adaptogens to cover any gaps you may have in your diet and provide support for a demanding life for me even if I eat mostly Whole Foods and minimally processed foods which I do for for most of my food intake it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits and vegetables vitamins and minerals micronutrients and adaptogens from food alone for that reason I've been taking ag1 daily since 2012 and often twice a day once in the morning or midm morning and again in the afternoon or evening when I do that it clearly bolsters my energy my immune system and my gut microbiome these are all critical to brain function mood physical performance and much more if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com to claim their special offer right now they're giving away five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman to claim that special offer why do people wake up with bags under their eyes if they just slept for six or eight hours yeah well maybe you need a little bit more sleep or maybe you had a wild night I can't tell but generally the bags are caused by two things one fluid retention so there's some lymphatic change that occurs under the eyes that's most noticeable because the skin under our eyes and on the surface of our eyelids is the thinnest so fluid changes are seen the quickest there and as we're in a supine or prone position fluid moves from our extremities back to our Central ner Venus system and it's easier to collect in the face so we see it around the face the other thing that we do notice with bags is just age related fat herniation that shows up more um as we wake up because of positional changes so if you've had you know um a heavy meal the night before something that has a high salt content you're going to retain a little bit more water um because of that solute shift you may notice your eyes are puffier in the morning um if you have allergies uh seasonal allergies you know um asthma eczema they run in a family that tends to make your skin retain a little bit more water as a result of that allergy response so people you know will notice Springtime or fall time they their eyes are swollen or their eyes are puffy especially when their allergies are flaring it's a it's a product of water retention from all the histamine release and and changes that occur in the skin skin cleansing is a topic that gets a lot of coverage um and I sometimes get um Chuckles or even attacks for saying um I've always just used unscented did Dove soap the bar not the liquid soap or like a Cetaphil soap um and this is because when I was younger like much younger I had very sensitive skin when I was like a kid seven eight nine years old I think I just started using unscented Dove soap at some point and things like it gentle you know uh soaps without fragrances what are your thoughts on on those and I ask not for my own purposes I'm going to stick with it because it works for me unless you tell me I shouldn't but I see this enormous market for skin cleansers that includes a range of costs from relatively low to near astronomical yeah and um if you tell me that this uh unscented Dove soap or Cetaphil soap is the way to go and by the way I'm not sponsored by either of those I don't even know who they're manufactured by so there's no commercial angle here um but I'll be relieved because they tend to fall on the lower end of the cost bracket relative to some of these Aston om priced um cleansers skincare is a incredible multi-billion dollar market that being said there is not a shred of evidence that anything more expensive works better than anything costeffective so that's first and foremost number two Dove white bar soap is amazing it's what we recommend for newborns and kids with sensitive skin generally when we say sensitive skin especially in in kids toddlers and adolescents there's a component of some sort of eczema or atopic dermatitis that is not bad enough to have a diagnosis but enough to say you know I had sensitive skin so Dove white bar soap is what I use for my kids and I'm not sponsored by anybody either but I think it's an amazing uh product because it's safe it's effective it has the least amount of ingredients no fragrances these are all things that can irritate or cause an allergic response to skin that is sensitive meaning you your skin mounts an immune response to some sort of environmental allergen or trigger that's what we generally mean when we talk about sensitive skin I personally use Cetaphil that's my face uh wash I have oily skin I use the one that takes off more of the oil so what you're looking for is defined by what bothers you or what your skin predicament is what I do see is a problem um nowadays is particularly in the United States where a hyper hygienic Society so what what people tend to do is over cleanse and they over cleanse for several reasons one because they are told that cleansing will fix their skin issue or number two they're told that some sort of organism is on their skin or some sort of bacteria that needs to be cleansed off to keep their skin healthy neither are true the first thing you want in terms of a cleanser something that's mild fragrance-free and has been tested to be hypoallergenic or non cogenic that's first Cetaphil Dove Cate great great stuff um no association with any of them the unscented non-f fragranced versions of them exactly exactly um that's first fragrances tend to be a problem for sensitive skin patients who have atopic dermatitis or eczema they tend to trigger allergic responses or exacerbations of their eczema flare so we try to avoid fragrences by all means then things that are gels or liquids tend to have preservatives in them to increase shelf stability whereas bars tend not to so if you are going to pick something that is uh a gel a liquid look for one that's been tested by dermatology group or verified by the American Academy of Dermatology as one that is not uh allergenic or um has multiple preservatives because that's another wellknown but unidentified source of problems um well known to the Dermatology world not known to the late you know the average person that the preservatives in our cleansers are a problem over cleansing becomes really problematic in in eradicating the skin microbiome so what we see a lot of times are cleansers that are either um bactericidal bacteria Statics things like benzol peroxide things like salicylic acid things like certain astringent toners that are alcohol-based and what they do is not only do they stret the normal oils from our skin that keep our skin Supple and healthy but they eradicate the normal host skin microbiome those are all the microorganisms that live on our skin and we have trillions of them actively surveying our skin living in in normal symbiotic homeostasis meaning there're there are friends they're living there for a reason they don't cause any problems but when you cleanse them off you open up a a an area for pathogens to take effect and that's when when we see a lot of problems more so in industrialized countries the United States is a notorious place for washing especially after covid wash wash wash wash more use a toner wash some more and that becomes really problematic because it sets up for organisms to take seed when they shouldn't be there so overall cleansing is great and the amount that you need to cleanse is based on how oily or sebaceous your skin is the older you get you may not need to cleanse as much there you know older patients don't need to cleanse their skin at all every day because they don't produce as much seam or oil as younger patients but everything should be defined by your Skin's characteristics so if you are one in which you notice by the end of the day I'm I'm oily I'm breaking out cleansing may be something that's beneficial for you to take off that excess sebum if you're one that has dry skin if you're one that had sensitive skin as a child then over cleansing is going to be a problem you're going to want to minimize that and and keep that moisturization or that barrier protection going so does that mean that people should bathe probably once or twice a day but the people that are bathing three times a day it's probably excessive I mean are we saying that you can't get into water I mean when you say cleansing you're talking about face cleansing I realize this is going to be highly individual but you know some people um are just out of habit you know shower and use cleanser you know twice a day or once a day I think uh for me it's in the morning or in the evening sometimes both if I do a workout I try and shower yeah as close as possible after the workout as soon as possible after the workout rather because um otherwise I will break out you know so it sounds like one has to kind of learn what their cadences and that's going to vary by age um there's a lot of factors to this I I I think Ashton Kutcher and milakunis famously said they shower I think once a week or something like that and it stirred up a lot of conversation when that came out truth be told you don't have to cleanse every day if your skin is otherwise fine and healthy and you're not bothered by anything you live a lifestyle in which you're not sweating excessively or producing a lot of sebum I myself same thing I work out so I I shower after working out and I usually shower before I get into bed because after a long day of work I tend to have you know things on my skin that shouldn't be there that's only fitting for me because if I don't I tend to have problems I tend to break out I tend to have things that you know shouldn't happen because of my hygiene habits that said there is no indication or no medical necessity to have to cleanse your skin even once a day often times older patient patients cleanse or shower once a week and they're totally fine but it'll have to be defined by your skin and what problems or ailments are specific to you generally if you work out if you let sweat dry on your skin it causes several problems number one is irritation itself from the salts that crystallize from the sweat drying off number two the sweat itself as a source of food for certain yeast that are normal symbiotic yeast that live on our skin so it contributes things like dandruff um what we call tinia versicolor which is a type of yeast that grows on our skin so generally if you work out try to wash those you know things off also if you are one of you know acne prone skin if you're an adolescent if you're a teenage if you're an adult dealing with acne the sebum that your body is producing is food for the bacteria that cause this so you tend to want to clean some of that excess sebum off those are simple indications to cleanse both your face and your body body but if you're not having any problems you actually don't need to do any of that in Europe they shower and cleanse at a fraction of the frequency that we do in the United States and when you look at incidences of the most common skin conditions there's the same including things like acne psoriasis yeah you know most people think about shampooing for sake of hair but there's the scalp component and since you're an expert in skin we should probably uh spend a bit of time on this um for people that tend to have a dry or flaky scalp uh what should they do about that my understanding is that some of the more um typical commercial anti-dandruff shampoos can contain things that might cause issues for hair itself so they might help with the flaking and drying of the scalp but damage other aspects of you know either appearance or health of hair yeah um what are some really good options for people that have dry scalp what are some great options for people that have oily scalp yeah um and let's leave aside the frequency of use and just um perhaps just put it on the Shelf as uh as much as you need it but not more so that could be once a week it could be daily could be twice a day if in extreme cases it sounds like so when we think about the scalp when we think about dry or flaky scalp we think about two main conditions either CC dermatitis which is medical grade dandruff or or the medical name for dandruff or psoriasis they're two different entities but they generally contribute to the same problem which is redness flaking and dry of the scalp now it's important to note that the hair on your head is dead it's not alive the only area that's alive is 2 and 1 12 millim in the skin so the hair that we see on our scalp is not a living entity so there's a common misconception that you can affect the health or quality of your hair by putting things on the hair and I'll go into that in just a just a minute um but the hair itself that you see is is is not living the only area that's living are the stem cells in the Pilla of the hair and in the Bulge region of the hair which reside in the skin so nothing that you put on your scalp will make you lose your hair will make you grow new hair for the most part um why that's important when we treat dry or flaky scalp we treat it with several things the most common cause is an overgrowth of yeast from the sweat and oil that is produced from our our scalp and that's CC dermatitis that's the medical name for dandruff and so we treat it by one lowering the amount of that yeast that's living and that's usually with shampoos um that are prescription or over-the-counter you know things like zinc or ketoconazol shampoos are very common things and then the other thing that we do is to dampen the immune response to this overgrowth of yeast so the reason our skin Flakes and gets red and prolifer Ates is our immune system is responding to something it's either responding to the yeast or it's responding to itself which is what psoriasis is it's an immune mediated over proliferation of skin cells because the immune system is overactive in the skin and the way we treat that is just topicals or certain medications that suppress the Skin's immune system or immune activity none of that affect the actual hair itself what does happen is shampoos tend to have things that strip oils as a mechanism of cleaning so when you take a cross-section of the hair there's seven layers and the the layer that provides that color Sheen and structure is called the cuticle as we age we lose the cuticle and that's that's a common problem what we see in male and female patterned hair loss or androgenetic alipas we lose that cuticle which makes us lose the shine and the structure and the strength of our hair our body tries to replenish that with the oils so when people wash their hair sometimes they feel like their hair becomes more limp or dull or lifeless it's because we've taken that artificial oil coating uh that replaced the cuticle and and washed it off so good news is you're not going to do any harm putting any of the topicals on your scalp bad news is you probably won't bring a lot of it back to life either but when we treat flakiness you know redness things like that we're treating two entities usually with topicals and because we're either trying to treat over proliferation of something or trying to calm down the Skin's immune system got it so it sounds like the best options for cleansing skin for shampooing really stem from knowing whether or not your skin tends to air oily or dry figuring out how often to cleanse and then as you pointed out before even though there's an enormous range of cost for these things none of the solutions that you're describing sound like they fall on the high end of cost or even in the middle end of cost which is a bit surprising to me this might be one of the few areas where you know like if I had a magic wand I would make for all uh you know organic uh nonprocessed and minimally processed foods to be very inexpensive but it turns out those things tend to be more expensive you can go to farmers markets and cut back on the cost Etc but there seems to be um unfortunate tradeoff between availability and cost and benefit or at least risk but it doesn't sound like that's the case with skin care or scalp care that one can exercise really excellent skin and scalp care without having to go into a range of of spending an outrageous amount of money no I think one you're absolutely right there is the more expensive does not mean better if in fact they sometimes become more problematic because there's more ingredients in the more expensive products including elegant fragrances and stuff like that which can be problematic that's number one the second thing to know is that generally speaking there's some connection between skin Health skin care and this realm of beauty which people overlap a lot in and there when we Trend into this realm of beauty glamour Etc price and objectivity are taken out and that's why you see a lot of skincare products that are so expensive because they draw towards another level of desire that's not just medical it's aesthetic and that's where you'll find creams that are $2 $300 for a little amount of cream that does the same thing that your jar of petrolum or Vaseline or aquafor does that part is really hard to mitigate but in general almost everything that we as dermatologists and skin cancer surgeons and um experts in the field recommend are really cheap coste effective and they have the least amount of ingredients in them and that's what I would recommend that's what I recommend for my family and for my patients you don't have to spend a lot to have excellent skincare and you don't need to have it be a multi-step routine oftentimes people overdo it you know the more steps there are there's more chances that something your skin will respond to negatively the more chances you are to have a bad outcome to an ingredient of a product you're putting on your skin so keep it simple keep it cheap and you'll do great it's going to be very reassuring to many people it's also going to be um uh somewhat uh destabilizing to people who are really attached to the idea that the more expensive products are really doing something that much more beneficial for them not much at all not not anything and another important thing to to consider when looking at skin care skin health and then trending into that area of Aesthetics and beauty is that most active ingredient ingredients if they're really active tend to be controlled by the FDA so most things that are sold over the counter have actives that are not at a concentration high enough to be considered therapeutic because that's when you get into the definition of a drug so looking at things like anti-dandruff shampoos you know anti-aging creams you know um acne medications they work a little bit if they worked perfectly then most Medical Dermatologists would be Ahad of a lot of patients and we see a lot of skin disease that's still continues because the active ingredients aren't at a concentration high enough to provide therapeutic benefit so save your money if you really need something to change some part of your skin see a good dermatologist see an expert and see what they can come up with so this seems like an appropriate time to ask about sun exposure and then we'll also talk about sunscreen sunblocks skin cancer sure but what is the relationship between sun exposure and skin Health specifically meaning how much sun exposure is healthy for our skin I'm a big believer in getting sun exposure to the eyes early in the day blinking as needed to protect the eyes of course but in order to set one's circadian rhythm for elevated daytime mood focus and alertness and improv nighttime sleep there's just so much data to support setting one's circadian rhythm properly ly for sake of health and there's so much data to support the fact that sunlight viewing in particular is the best way to do that and sunlight viewing in the early part of the day in particular is the best way to do that but beyond that how much sun exposure to the skin is good for us is it zero is it five minutes does it depend great like great controversial question and it depends on which school of thought or Camp you belong in as a skin cancer surgeon and a somebody who's developed a reputation for seeing some of the worst most complicated life-threatening skin cancers in in Los Angeles obviously I see some of the consequences of long-term sun exposure and chronic chronic photo aging that being said I absolutely think that getting sun is healthy for us now why the studies that talk about vitamin D and we'll touch on vitamin D as its own entity and then overall health as another entity but most of the studies that look at Vitamin D synthesis from UV exposure on the skin suggest that you only need about 15 minutes and that you don't need a broad uh surface area of exposure you can get enough vitamin D formation with just about 15 to 20 minutes of sun on your forearms so there's a whole school of thought by a lot of experts who think there's no amount of UV exposure that's healthy for the skin and I tend to be on the other camp for several reasons one there's a component of feel goodness if that's a word from being in the sun that affect overall skin and physical biology when you're out in a sunny day you tend to be less stressed you tend to be a little happier now it's it's a generalization but most of the time when you get Outdoors you get outside and it's a nice sunny day you feel better and although you can't quantify that feeling better there are some parameters that can be measured decreases in core disol response improvements in skin appearance and texture um the other important thing about being out in the sun is finding out your own tolerance right so I have a little bit more olive skin and I can tolerate the a little bit longer than somebody who is fairer and lighter eyes in my opinion I don't think and in most of the evidence there isn't a finite amount of time because that time is dictated by your Skin's ability to tolerate the UV but I absolutely do not think that sun avoidance is a healthy thing and this is coming from somebody who operates on head and neck skin cancers literally every day I think there is a component of sun exposure that's not just for vitamin D synthesis but something that improves your overall Wellness that is visible and maybe not laboratory measurable but um you definitely are healthier when you're feeling better and you're happier I lived on the east coast in places that had lower uh days of sun and I had Seasonal effective disorder it bothered me my mood was lower I felt not as healthy you know I'd come home my family would say Hey you look sick and it just I wasn't sick I hadn't had any sun I was lighter than I was and my family interpreted that as not being healthy you know my wife on the other hand didn't she didn't mind the grayness so there's a timeline for biologic processes like vitamin D formation that's helpful people can argue that you can get it through supplementation and food and that's that's correct but there is a component of sun exposure that makes you feel better overall and provides some sort of Wellness that you may not be able to quantify but you see in appearance and in discussion and Longevity so absolutely I think you should be out the sun I don't think you should burn and I don't think you should be out long enough where your skin starts to turn red that's the first sign that you're reaching kind of critical mass in terms of UV exposure but I absolutely think the sun is a good thing for us so even midday Sun you know maybe if there's some cloud cover or if we have some sunscreen on or a physical barrier like sun and long uh excuse me like hat and long sleeves then getting some sun exposure in your mind is good for our overall well-being mood Etc yeah I think I mean midday sun has a higher UV index so you're more likely to burn and have a problem with prolonged exposure but yeah absolutely I think you know there's been numerous studies that that have looked at people who go out for a walk in you know busy Urban cities and work environments if they go out for a walk in the sun they feel better their stress responses are lower their questionnaires in responding to life stressors and day-to-day stressors are decreased there's a lot of studies that look at being outside as a measure of well-being mental health well-being um is improved with outdoor sun exposure so there's a lot of that now can I quantify it in the skin hard to say one thing we do know is that obviously too much sun exposure like anything too much of a good thing can be a bad thing but I really do think that being out in the sun for the amount that your skin can tolerate is a good thing I'd like to take a brief break to thank one of our sponsors element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium in the correct ratios but no sugar now I and others on the podcast have talked a lot about the critical importance of hydration for proper brain and bily function research shows that even a slight degree of dehydration can really diminish cognitive and physical performance it's also important that you get adequate electrolytes in order for your body and brain to function at their best the electrolytes sodium magnesium and pottassium are critical for the functioning of all the cells in your body especially your neurons or nerve cells to make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of hydration and electrolytes I dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning and I drink that basically first thing in the morning I also drink element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing especially on hot days if I'm sweating a lot and losing water and electrolytes if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element.com huberman spelled drink lnt.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with the purchase of any element drink mix again that's drink element.com huberman to claim a free sample pack what about sunscreens and sunblocks and I think uh we should distinguish between those two labels um you know in the old days as I understand sunscreen was the word used to describe stuff that you put on your skin that absorbs UV and then sunblock is the stuff that you put on your skin to reflect UV um typically nowadays people say sunscreen more than they say sunblock or they use them interchangeably without any knowledge of the underlying mechanism um so first of all let's clarify sunscreen versus sun block yeah so a lot of the nomenclature data understanding chemicals um things that were considered okay to be used came from an original FDA 1999 manuscript and that data hadn't changed for almost 20 something years and more recently in 2021 the FDA released a proposed final order for the term sunscreens as a whole now when we talk about sunscreens sunscreens are considered an over-the-counter nonprescription drug so they're regulated tightly by the FDA they're in the same category as any over-the-counter drug so before this this decision ruling there was a lot of nomenclature wording confusion sunblock seemed better than sunscreen suntan um suntan oil all of that's been changed recently or has been proposed to get rid of to unify the field and make it very clear what the goal is so no longer do we use the term sunblock although in the past that had been used for things like zinc or zinc and titanium based creams like the old 1980s or 1990s white lifeguard noses if you remember that used to be thought as sun block whereas less less um protective chemicals were used as sunscreen now that's changing and the FDA 2021 proposed order says we need to unify everything and call it a sunscreen now sunscreens being regulated drugs take a lot of scrutiny for many reasons they take scrutiny from the FDA in terms of proving efficacy and safety they take a lot of scrutiny in society for being dangerous or not dangerous effective or not effective causing Downstream effects or not causing Downstream effects so that's been a big point of contention in terms of the population the American Academy's stance dermatologists stance and then the skin cancer patients beliefs the beauty experts beliefs and average person's opinions um sunscreens generally fall into creams lotions topical products that protect the skin against sunburn we used to be able to suggest that they reduced the risk of skin cancer um prevented premature aging but that can be a little convoluted and the FDA is rewarding that into not being able to say that anymore in their proposed order but what sunscreen's intention is is to protect the skin against excess UV exposure and they come in two flavors they come in mineral-based sunscreens which tend to be in the category of zinc and titanium minerals and they tend to be chemical sunscreens which are a bunch of different chemicals mineral-based sunscreens are sometimes called inorganic correct inorganic or physical sunscreens whereas the chemicals are considered organic or chemical sunscreens totally right is the mechanism for these two the same because um I was under the impression that the mineral-based inorganic sunscreens um reflected back UV rays um whereas the chemical-based sunscreens absorbed UV rays but there's a bit of a online debate about this um claiming that they all absorb UV rays yeah so historically it had been thought that mineral or physical sunscreen zinc zinc and titanium sunscreens worked by basically acting as a metal reflecting shield and for the most part that thinking is not incorrect there's uh there was a new study that showed that they work by actually absorbing them um but not having any sort of chemical change so the way chemical organic sunscreens work is they absorb the ultraviolet radiation they undergo a chemical reaction to reduce its energy and dissipate that energy as heat so chemical sunscreens work by actually absorbing it and undergoing a change whereas mineral or physical sunscreens don't do that I still think of them simply as minerals basically Shield the skin like armor whereas chemicals act as a sink and undergo a change to reduce that energy so that's kind of the simplistic way that sunscreen topical sunscreens work so what is your recommendation about protecting oneself from the Sun and maybe for the moment let's just set aside sunscreens and acknowledge that a physical barrier like hat long sleeve long pants provides a pretty good barrier to the sun correct yeah in fact physical barriers like shade clothing hats have been shown to be more effective um than topical sunscreens for several reasons but there are many ways to protect your skin and you have to ask why you're protecting your skin so is it because you're worried about premature aging uh photo damage and things like of that nature or you worried about your risk for skin cancer um do you have a sun sensitive skin condition like lupus or PM that is sensitive to UV exposure so the first question is why are you worried or why are you taking protection and then you customize your approach to that now sunscreen topical sunscreens are not the only form by and large there there are many other forms both physical blockers and certain things in the supplement uh world that can protect your skin for example I myself take a product called Sun powder that provides an internal sun shield allows me to be in the sun longer um without the need to reapply or if I can't reapply but you know by and large the best way to protect your skin is some sort of Shield whether it's clothing hat or some sort of cream that you put on now for patients who are worry or for people who are worried about premature aging they don't have a strong family history of skin cancer they've never had one before themselves then the approach to that is a little bit different than people who are worried about skin cancer development strong family history of skin cancer they're worried about you know losing a part of their ear or or part of their nose to skin cancer development and that's very different from medical conditions that are very Sun sensitive by and large the patients who have medical conditions that are sun sensitive the large one being lupus for example need the most sun protection because they're so inherently sensitive to UV exposure something that's very interesting we know without a doubt that every common skin cancer there's many many skin cancer types but the three most common are you know basil cell carcinoma squa cell carcinoma and melanoma those are the three most common ones we see they have all been shown to have UV mutation signatures when we sequence the tumors however in every single clinical trial and every single randomized trial that looked at topical sunscreens as a means of reducing risk there has not been a single study that showed any sort of risk reduction in the development of the most common skin cancer which is basil cell carcinoma one in four Americans will developed this also there hasn't been a single study to date that showed that diligent sunscreen use topical sunscreens will reduce disease specific death or dying from skin cancer so if you think every skin cancer is sun-driven there are UV mutation profiles in these tumors then by using sunscreen should reduce that right and it's not that clear we don't understand fully the drivers of this so why I bring this up and why we talk about sunscreens and barriers to blockade first sunscreens topical sunscreens are not the only form you know in fact clothing and shields you know shade and hat are in my opinion better and a lot of studies suggest that they're better there are oral supplements that can also protect your skin from burning and and reduce your skin cancer risk and number three not everything is Su driven we do know that diligent sunscreen use decreases the incidence or the amount of melanoma formation and sasil formation but we still don't know whether that reduction has changed the number of patients dying from that we also know that it has no bearing in the development of the most common skin cancer which is basil cell so we go back to the drawing board and scratch our head saying hey what is the trigger you know the genetics loads the gun for example and maybe even pulls the hammer but what in the environment is the trigger is it strictly UV is it some other culprit so sunscreens are a really hotly debated topic so many things to talk about in terms a sunscreen so if I understand correctly you're saying that the use of sunscreen can protect against premature aging let's say sun block because I think we're going to arrive at mineral-based sunscreens probably being the better option but we can uh make sure that we double click on that so to speak but that sun exposure itself perhaps is not linked to the most deadly of skin cancers that tells me two things it doesn't tell me that I can just spend as much time as I want in the Sun but it does tell me that I should probably look into the things that cause the most deadly skin cancers yeah okay but I'm also hearing that regular application of sunblock and or physical barrier will protect my skin against some forms of premature aging caused by sun exposure but will not necessarily protect me against the most common forms of skin cancer that is peculiar uh in the sense that that or even baffling um to the you know non- dermatologist me um because we already know that sun exposure causes UV mutations mutations in the DNA of cells is one of the kind of core components of cancer so how do we Square all of this great question and the more we dive into this and the more experts we we look at and the more data we we collect the more we're scratching our head as to we don't know and why this occurs now I am not saying don't use sunscreen let's just let that be known I I think sunscreens are excellent forms to predict against premature photoaging and signs of sun damage I think sunscreens help reduce the incidence of common Garden variety skin cancers but they are not the only form of protection and they seem to not be as important or have as much effect in reducing the incidence of our most common skin cancer which is basil cell carcinoma moreover I would say and the data unfortunately shows that the majority of skin cancers that we see that end up hurting people or or killing patients don't arise in chronic sun-exposed areas to begin with you know I have a 27-year-old patient right now dying of a metastatic melanoma that arose in completely Sun protected skin I have a 56-year-old mechanic right now who's dying of aamil carcinoma that arose from the back of his ear and most experts who have this type of type of experience dealing with these patients have the same observation so the question is what's pulling the trigger for the most part UV plays a big role the the mechanism in which cancer forms if we believe this the basic high school biology is you know hyperplasia metaplasia dysplasia carcinoma so there's a a trajectory of changes that are occurring as a result of cumulative mutations in the skin if we believe that trajectory then every skin cancer should see that um change and we just don't see that also we know that skin cancers that arise in Sun damaged skin behave differently than the ones that are very lethal so why I bring this up I I think sunscreen is very helpful but we have this unfortunate Trend in medicine particularly in dermatology to guilt people into thinking that they cause this to themselves and I don't think that's right nor okay and I I I don't like that because they make it seem that oh the sun you got in 1987 that one sunburn in Hawaii did it to you and that's absolutely not the case there are many things that play fundamentally your genetics and immune system that play a huge role in skincare development that sunscreen cannot address and will not address now the the wild card is okay what are my genetics and that's the part we don't know which is why dermatologists say okay let's at least control the thing that we can which is UV exposure but I bring this up because PE you know don't feel bad about getting some sun and don't feel guilted into something that if if something bad occurs it's not your fault some of it is is out of your control and that that's really important because I see a lot of very bad skin cancers in my practice and I I hate this feeling of patients feel feeling like they did it to themselves I think most people would prefer not to have the premature aging caused by sun exposure yeah so yeah what should those people do um I've taken on a practice of putting a mineral-based inorganic sunscreen on my face my arms if they're going to be exposed back of my neck tops of my ears if I'm going to be out in midday or late day sun that feels intense and I'll do that every single time I go out now um on overcast days not so much uh for viewing morning sunlight I don't do that in fact when the sun is low in the sky I don't tend to wear sunblock that's me that's been my choice it um there were a few years there where I didn't put on sunscreen or if I did it was like on a camping trip or skiing or something where the sun felt very intense and in that case I would just reach for whatever sunscreen or sunblock was available because I wasn't aware that some of the ingredients and certain chemical based sunscreens may be problematic yeah yeah so um I think I fall into the typical category of a lot of people um but of course there's the category of people that are like nope sunscreen sunblock is terrible all the time or they're just too lazy or uninterested in applying it but then there's this whole category of people that are putting it on every single time they go outside in hopes that that's going to keep their skin much appearing much younger and just generally are kind of afraid of the Sun a lot of good points so there's that famous New England Journal of Medicine picture of the truck driver that got chronic sun exposure on the left side of his face and you see all this wrinkling and modeling of the skin on the left side and nothing on the right side so by absolute measure sun protection or UV protection will reduce premature aging now interestingly that guy did not develop anything in that area so again it goes back to well SK canc so the question is what's pulling the trigger is it truly UV or is there something else we missing if you tell me that he got skin cancer on the opposite side I'm really going to gasp but no I I I I don't know if he's had any on the opposite side but in that photo it's purely uh premature aging so things that you want to do obviously know don't let your skin turn red take some sort of some form of barrier protection whether it's a sunscreen uh supplement like poly iium something that protects your skin from the inside out and skin changes are cumulative um so what we can tolerate in our teens and 20s is very different than what we can tolerate in our 40s 50s and 60s because there's a cumulative mutation profile burden that we see interestingly there was an eyelid study that was published recently that looked at eyelid skin that was removed during you know cosmetic surgery upper eyelid lifts that was otherwise discarded and when they ran genetic sequencing on normal eyelid skin they saw the same mutations that they would see in matched skin cancers but the eyelids didn't have any skin cancer so we know UV triggers these mutations and we know UV degrades collagen and elastin it thins blood vessel walls as a mechanism of um of its effects on the dermis the data is equivocal as to how those mutations trigger skin cancer formation but in terms of premature aging absolutely so you want to take some form of protection now what type of protection do you take depends on your genetics how much you can tolerate and what your family lineage looks like some people have the genetics of early aging it's part of their skin biology and you can't change that but you can mitigate that risk with more strict UV avoidance some people you know they look young longer you know some family lineages just have great genetics In Their Skin they can tolerate a little bit more sun in terms of physical sunscreens versus chemical sunscreens that's a hotly debated Topic in my personal practice and for my family I tend to only recommend uh mineral zinc or zinc and titanium sunscreens for several reasons in the original set of sunscreens that were approved by the FDA that came out in 1999 there wasn't enough data to look at biologic effect efficacy internal organ involvement Etc fast forward 20 years and we've gathered a lot more information about these chemical organic compounds there is an amazing 2020 study that looked at absorption of chemical sunscreens when they're applied onto the skin they looked at absorption with single application and they looked at absorption over 4 days of application now the study they applied a little bit more than you know Real World Experience would but even with single application they saw blood plasma absorption of these chemicals that were 100 to 500 times greater than the upper threshold defined by the FDA now the question exists okay what does that mean is this healthy is this not healthy is it neither that's still up for debate but in looking at the more recent literature and looking at the chemical structure of these compounds a lot of these are phenolic compounds meaning they they have one or two usually two Benzene Rings attached together and they they look very similar to one another there's been a lot of basic science animal study and retrospective human studies in the last 2 or three years that suggest that some of these chemical compounds particularly o o benzone particularly octocrylene particularly um Octon oxinate um that can have endocrine disruption or affect the nervous system because they mimic a lot of biologic phenolic compounds and a lot of biologic hormones if you actually look at the structure of oxybenzone it looks very similar to the structure of bisphenol a which has been now banned in a lot of the lining of plastic bottles why because of the same concept now the data is not 100% one way or another but there's enough smoldering evidence that makes me think H we should reinvestigate this and in fact the fda's proposed final order in 2021 changed these chemicals from Grace generally recognized as safe and effective to not Grace because of these concerns there's data that suggest that the chemicals are found in breast milk amniotic fluid blood plasma urine so there's a lot of things that we don't know and I always say this in science we take two steps forward and then maybe one step di diagonally or sideways because we ran into unexpected things I tend to recommend mineral sunscreens because they don't have any of that data they haven't for the last 30 40 years they're considered safe and in fact for young kids particularly those six months and under the American Academy of Dermatology and the American Academy of Pediatrics generally recommends avoiding chemical sunscreens why children's skin particularly infants and toddlers behaves more like mucous membranes than adult skin their barrier is not as tightly woven so they absorb these things at a much higher concentration so if you are to apply something on kids especially young kids 6 months or under we recommend minerals to begin with so I say if you have a pool of compounds that has maybe even smoldering evidence on the basic science level that something's off versus a a group of uh compounds that have really no data which one would you pick and they do the same thing I naturally gravitate towards that so the takeaway for me is physical barrier no issues mineral-based sunscreen safest so that's zinc oxide titanium dioxide up and that's mineral not like powder not mineral powder but mineral topicals because mineral powders are a whole another issue we'll talk about but okay and then chemical-based sunscreens um probably best avoided um and then you mentioned polypodium so this is a pill it's a supplement basically that one can take I only call it a supplement because um it's not a prescription drug correct yeah um that protects your skin from UV damage from the inside yeah so exactly right mineral based creams and lotions I tend to prefer and recommend in my practice and most people will if you're worried about any risk any consequence chemicals I tend to personally avoid now this may not be in line with all my Dermatology colleagues but I tend to avoid them and I don't not recommend them for kids in terms of things that you can do in addition to provide sun protection polypodium is a fern from the Amazon rainforest that was discovered when they studied an indigenous population that would eat this Fern before they would go on their fishing Expeditions on the Amazon and they'd be gone for 3 Days they'd eat this Fern and come back not burned so a lot of studies were done on this Fern in the last 5 10 years that showed it increases your Skin's minimal athema dose the amount of redness your skin gets from UV exposure that's our general barometer for Effectiveness without any topicals it's taken or ingested orally I personally use a form called Sun powder that also has nicotinamide in it we can talk about nicotinamide later but if in and of itself it works great in conjunction with topicals you get the best of both worlds you get internal shielding and external shielding now it is a supplement so it's not a controlled drug the way the FDA regulates sunscreen so it isn't really a sunscreen but it's a way to prevent sunburns increase the amount of time you can be outside and increase the efficacy of your topical so if you're somebody who is very fair skinned who burns all the time or if you're somebody who has like what we call Sun hives or or PE um prickly sun rash pmle um this is an added thing that you can use that will boost your sun protective factors it's awesome and if you're somebody who's active like you're in the water or you're you know exercising or you're playing a sport you can't reapply I I love polypodium for that added benefit what are the dosages of polypodium that are useful and are there any side effects great question so there's been a wide variety of doses um investigated anywhere from 500 240 480 generally you said 1500 no uh sorry 50 milligrams 100 milligram 240 480 uh um somewhere in the between 50 and 400 80 milligrams is what's commonly used the most common side effect can be a little um upside stomach if you can't to at the plant forever it's taken you can either take it daily as a method of preventing premature photoaging and pigmentary change or you can take it as an as needed an hour before you get sun um to Shield you from the Sun um the other thing that it helps prevent um that some sunscreens cannot particularly the chemical sunscreens cannot is the effects of visible light so there are certain skin conditions the most common is melasma which a lot of women have you know it's I think the bane of their existence it used to be called The Mask of pregnancy and melasma is something that is very sensitive to both UV and visible light chemical sunscreens don't do a good job blocking visible light polypodium has been shown to help block the effects of visible light as well which makes melasma worse it's this discoloration that we see mostly in women usually after pregnancy or women who are on birth control is really challenging to treat and sun protection is the first line like diligent sun protection but we found that supplementing with polypodium enhances this and makes patients treatments more effective interesting and you mentioned Sun powder as a potential that's a brand name so yes Sun powder is a brand it's um a product that I helped formulate with one of my colleagues um over at Harvard who's a a laser and aesthetic dermatologist Harvard trained and this is something that we came up with when I was up at Stanford and it's a it's a supplement dedicated to skin health and it does two things I take it daily myself as a single scoop it helps reduce your skin cancer risk your non-melanoma skin cancer risk by up to 30% and the data was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in a phase three randomized trial for one of the ingredients the other ingredient obviously is NI is polypodium and I take that one to prevent you know Sun rated Chang ches but also help reduce my risk of burning often when I personally find the need for sunscreen it's when I can't apply always at the water I'm swimming you know my my son he's seven he races on a swim team I cannot get this kid to reapply sunscreen so this is a supplement that I I give him and we it took us several years of formulation and testing including me testing which is minimal athema dose testing to come up with it's easy over the- counter and it's one of many supplements that contain polypodium I just like it because it's a single scoop and I mix it into my morning drink and I'm done terrific I think we both agree that the mineral-based sunscreens are going to be the best option of the ones out there if one is at all concerned about some of these chemical components and chemical sunscreens ABS absolutely agree yeah so within that category are there particular things to look for um I'm not necessarily trying to aim for particular brand here but given that I have no relationship to any skare products um I would just like to know which one to look for or will any zinc oxide Andor titanium dioxide containing sunscreen provided there are no chemical components in there besides the inactive ingredients of course um will any suffice because in that case people can just shop for cost or availability yeah so I tend to take a pragmatic approach in this my my recommendation is a brand that that you will use because if I recommend a brand and you don't like it it doesn't feel good or smell good you're never going to use it and it's a waste of your money and time so number one any brand that is mineral-based is fine you what you're looking for is broadspectrum coverage which almost all mineral-based sunscreens provide broads Spectrum meaning UVA and UVB and we know these two UV forms do different things in the skin we know that UVB is more implicated in redness and some early skin cancer changes we know UVA is linked to uh premature uh photoaging and certain melanomas so you want something that provides broad spectrum coverage you're looking for a number the SPF we talk about you're looking for a number above 30 why why 30 because every study that looked at defining the SPF required you to put a certain amount on the skin generally it's an entire shock glass worth of the product on sun Exposed Skin most of the time in real world uh practice people don't put on that much they put on maybe half that so what you're really getting when you buy something that's SPF 15 is like an SPF of eight so if you're looking for something that provides protection SPF 30 or greater is higher higher the zinc concentration the better it protects against UV invisible light the chalkier it may go on so that's kind of where you find that balance that's actually where the chemical sunscreens came about is the cosmical industry finding things that felt nicer on the skin so that people could put makeup on without that grainy chalkiness but in doing so we ran into some issues um yeah what are some if any of the concerns that some of the components in chemical-based sunscreens can cross the bloodb brain barrier it's not um unjustified to think that they are organic phenolic compounds they are Hydro phobic they're lipophilic meaning they can cross membranes very easily which is why they run into this endocrine disruption and some nervous uh system disregulation whether that's been validated to be problematic in humans has yet to be seen But at least in vitro studies in certain animal models we see this so when you apply a certain concentration and with that 2020 study that showed that we're seeing it in the blood at levels that are 200 to 500 times the upper limit of normal as defined by Suns green criteria now we have to scratch our head where is this circulating where is this going are we collecting it in our adapost tissue if we're collecting it there we may be collecting it up here we may be collecting it in the nerves so it's a it's a really fascinating world to see where we're going with these and in fact the 16 most common chemicals that in 99 were everywhere from you know spray sunscreens and bottles and things like that are now being defied as H question mark maybe not safe by the FDA the very company that regulates it another call for the mineral based sunscreens just as a you know why why take the risk or even you know shade hat clothing you know if you're really worried about putting something on an absorption you get excellent protection by actual barriers this seems like a good time to shift a little bit of our attention to nutrition and the gut microbiome yeah now this is an infinitely large topic um you we could spend several episodes discussing this but if you were to um provide us some of the kind of like major takeaways as it relates to nutrition and skin Health Nutrition and skin appearance gut and skin health and appearance uh what would those be so there is an incredible connection between the gut microbiome and skin health and the skin microbiome of which we're only now just understanding the gra Gravity the extent in the connection we know from many studies many elegant studies a lot of studies done out of my colleagues Labs up at Stanford that modulating the gut microbiome affects inflammatory conditions of the skin meaning if you control the disregulation of the gut microbiome if you have an anti-inflammatory dietary habit actual skin disease decreases in intensity and severity psoriasis eczema acne and this is not just subjectively it's measurable and quantifiable and reproducible so the the connection is fascinating now how we modulate it that's the unknown we know in many different studies that some patients got microbiomes are wildly fluctuant to what they do from their environment in terms of dietary habits antibiotics things like that some people's gut microbiomes or Rock solid nothing changes them and deciphering who will benefit from what is the hardest part in terms of nutrition overall obviously everybody's told you this since you know the dawn of modern medicine is a well-balanced diet is good for everything unfortunately in the 21st century there are a lot of diets there are a lot of fad diets there are a lot of restrictive diets and that's where we see nutrition play an important role in both appearance and actual skin disease health and there's so many different Avenues to discuss this things like dietary habits and changes for acne things like dietary habits and changes for anti-aging things like dietary habits for rash disorders like psoriasis and eczema it's so much to explore so my understanding and we'll get into this more as it relates to acne um is that patterns of eating either content food volume that is caloric load Etc that increase insulin and things like mtor are sort of pro acne they're going to aggravate or increase acne whereas the things that tend to lower circulating blood glucose insulin and reduce inflammation tend to be kind of anti- acne or so pull in the other direction towards a reducing acne load but if we were to just step back and say okay the typical person who wants to have the healthiest best appearing skin who's not dealing with any specific issue cuz we will get into those specific issues can we say they should eat you know a vegan diet a vegetarian diet is it okay to be an omnivore some people are on the extreme of this you know kind of carnivore type diet some of those people actually report you know elimination of certain skin conditions I don't know I've never tried one of those um extreme diets but um you hear this but then again you hear a lot of things so seems to me that the relationship between keeping the gut microbiome healthy and ingesting sufficient amounts of fiber is pretty clear sure the relationship between keeping the gut microbiome healthy and overall that is systemic inflammation low is pretty clear and that eating foods that are mostly unprocessed or minimally processed keeps inflammation on the lower side as opposed to eating more processed foods but you know assuming you would you agree or disagree with feel free to disagree please yeah so so assuming that that's all true is there any evidence that the ingestion of specific foods can make skin healthier like you'll see this stuff like oh you know if you have two cups of blueberries a day your skin is going to be healthier or is all of that indirect by virtue of specific micronutrients that are in those Foods so there's a lot of layers to un unravel on this so if you're going to pick one simple diet for optimal skin health it's a high protein anti-inflammatory diet so high protein animal Source proteins fruits and vegetables based on your ability to tolerate the fibers and the fruits and vegetables things that are inflammatory are inflammatory for two reasons one the glucose insulin pathway but number two the the bacteria in our gut process and release byproducts of metabolism of certain things and those byproducts basically their digestive products can be very pro-inflammatory so often you hear these anecdotal stories of I eliminated tomatoes and my soris got better that person may have had an inability to tolerate tomatoes because of their gut microbiome's ability to digest the lopen or whatever it is we do know for certain that anti-inflammatory diets do improve skin Health that are measurable and seen in clinic so absolutely high protein you know a complete protein um when I say complete protein tends to be animal-based products eggs meat chicken fish less so plant proteins just because of bioavailability and complete um amino acid profiles you want a high protein anti-inflammatory diet that's number one in terms of what you can introduce to your skin to improve one or two parameters I don't think that's real why I bring this up we see a lot of talk and you've had a lot of people discuss collagen for example and this is an incredibly popular product in the skin world because it's claim to fame is it does everything keeps you looking young and keeps your skin healthy etc etc well we know collagen is essential to our skin Health literally it's what our dermis is made of that give us our suppleness or youth no wrinkles you know things like that collagen is made of three amino acids it's glycine Proline and usually hydroxyproline or hydroxy line okay those three amino acids are non-essential amino acids meaning your body has the ability to synthesize these from sugars and fats that it eats so collagen supplementation is not an essential protein unlike animal proteins which provide all 20 amino acids including the essential ones your body cannot synthesize now you may ask okay well I see all these studies that suggest collagen supplementation improves skin Health skin appearance there's several reasons for that I don't think it doesn't I think there is some benefit the question is what are the confounding variables to this were the people in the studies on restrictive diets because they were thinking about beauty and aesthetic were they restricting patterns of food dietary food things like that in which they weren't getting a sufficient amount of prote source to begin with so when they supplemented we saw improvements in their skin and a lot of these studies are patient recall or patient questionnaire studies in which there's inherent subjectivity in confounding variables in this when people take an intervention that says hey you may look better or this may approve the appearance of your skin not only do you have a placebo effect and saying yeah I do look better you may also do other things during your day change your behaviors and lifestyle to fit the gold that you subconsciously want so that's one number two there is a component in for example collagen supplementation that is forgotten about quite a bit and that's the increase in Blood osmolality and I learned this in the fitness world I was really big into Fitness in college and and it was my Escape you know from Life stressors and we found that people who supplemented with any powdered protein Source doesn't matter collagen Albin whey and more so with people who supplement with creatine that there is an increase in blood o or plasma osmolality so the solute concentration increased in the blood which draws water in that's predominantly how things like creatine make you look bigger and I know we're going a little bit on a tangent but one of the reasons the way collagen works as your blood osmolality increases you draw a little bit more water into the vessels which plumps up the appearance of the skin so there is a hydration component from the water draw and this is measured you can draw patients blood after consuming collagen protein whey protein and see this spike in uh plasma protein so there's that component as well which is not truly a benefit but it's an aesthetic benefit why that tends to be a problem is sometimes people who supplement with collagen end up actually having high blood pressure and they're otherwise healthy um and this was something that we saw in the Fitness World a lot is that young college athletes high school athletes that would come in they would otherwise be completely healthy and would be running high blood pressures if you took away their protein and uh creatine supplementation their blood pressures dropped interesting and it's really fascinating stuff and you know I used to work out at UCLA with a uh one of the professors of fisi who was a really big dude and we worked out together and we did all these studies and looked at you know you know young otherwise healthy people so that's one component the other question is do any of these food changes actually quantifiably increase skin collagen density skin elastin density there's no evidence that taking these things will traffic or meaning will go to where you want them to it's kind of silly to think if I drink this it's going to go into my stomach go into my intestine be absorbed and then know to go exactly to my cheek usually doesn't occur that way and when we've looked at histolog comparison studies the data is equivocal some Studies have showed a slightly increase in collagen density and you wonder are those patients one that are on restrictive diets to begin with and then there are some studies that have shown there's really no density change in collagen and elastin so the supplements really don't actually make a physical difference now the other question is is that study too short of term how long do you stay on these data is wild and there's a lot to understand but we do know high protein complete protein anti-inflammatory diets absolutely critical for skin health I guess the most direct question is do you yourself consume collagen proteins in a supplement form or make it a point to eat things like bone broth which contain High percentages of collagen great question um I do supplement only in Sun powder which is my daily supplement it contains bioactive collagen peptides aside from that I think natural sources are better so you know my wife cooks a lot at home bone broth um beef bone broth chicken bone broth um a lot of animal Meats my diet tends to be more in the guess old school you'd call it keto um Atkins or keto diet where I eat a lot of proteins and mostly fruits and vegetables I'm not very restrictive but I know that's what's made the biggest difference I know that if I go on a sugar binge in a few days I'm breaking out it's it's like clockwork for me some people are not as sensitive my body is and that's that's where the personalized medicine comes in is there a role for omega-3 fatty acids like fish oils and things of that sort for skin Health specifically yes and no yes there is some evidence that um omega-3 supplementation and tends to be better in fish form than you know um non-fish formats but Omega-3s tend to be anti-inflammatory so there's an improvement in skin health because of that one thing we do see is they thin the blood so people tend to bruise a little bit more so actually in my practice I have people stop Omega-3s before any sort of surgery because they bleed more what about some treatments that are known to be beneficial for the appearance and health of skin that people are not as aware of right because I think people who are concerned with their skin health and appearance you know they think about sunscreen we've learned a lot about that from you but what are some things that really work to improve skin health and appearance that perhaps require a visit to the dermatologist but that you don't hear enough about yeah so two big categories so we know the skin turns over right it turns over every 28 days so in theory if you keep turning the skin over you can get rid of those mutations that occur in the skin that's stacking up and hope to bring out more vital youthful skin that's not just appearing vital but actually biologically healthier and there's two categories of things you can do the first is the family of retinoids amazing medications amazing drugs been around for 50 years they come in oral form and topical form and these increase the time or they shorten the time they increase the skin turnover from 28 days to somewhere between 7 to 9 days and in doing so they've been shown to decrease skin cancer and pre-cancer formation they've been actually shown to grow new collagen they've been to increase elastin in appearance and this has been histologically verified in study after study meaning we take a biopsy of the skin have them start a prescription retinoid rebiopsy the skin and stain it for collagen or elastin and you see a market Improvement it's every dermatologist's well-known tool and for some reason it's still not wellknown in the population its original indication was for acne and still is first line for acne because of what it does is it dries out the oil glands but in doing so it also helps repair skin so I recommend every single person to be on a prescription strength retinoid which is different than over-the-counter retinol and there's a lot of Confusion And I think the confusion is intentional in the cosmical world as to why this is but everybody should be on a prescription strength retinoid usually topicals is all you need the most common are things like tretinoin adapalene or Tartine and there's oral forms the most common is acutane or isot trein and to a lesser known um a lesser known drug called acitretin or sorotan and I usually Reserve that for my high Sun damaged skin cancer patients it really makes a difference but I'm going to touch back about retinol versus retinoids so many many years we we studied retinoids the way retinoids work is they're actually they activate trans description factors their nuclear messaging um hormones so these compounds bind retinoic acid receptors and they activate uh the transcription of certain genes one of the genes we know that it can affect is the Sonic Hedgehog pathway and some of the embryologic genes why that's important is when we first studied retinoids in oral or cream version we notice that these can affect the development of a fetus and they can be passed through breast milk and through sperm or semen so because of this issue the FDA regulated it very tightly and it's pretty regulated worldwide because the effects are devastating you know missing arms missing legs type of birth defects because the medication was so effective and we saw an improvement in both quality and appearance of skin The cosmical Beauty World said oh okay this is awesome we need to figure out a way to get this on the Shelf but not be a prescription out came retinols with an O which is the inactive version of retinoic acid which is retinoids and what has to happen is retinol needs to be converted in a two-step process to become active retinoic acid otherwise it's a completely inactive prodrug which is sold over the counter at concentrations that are not biologically active that's how cosm tical companies can get away with prescribing this for people of childbearing age in my opinion if you want a r noid get a prescription for it the over-the-counter stuff is not very effective if at all the Shelf stability many Studies have shown that almost all retinoids over the counter retinols over the counter um are basically unstabilized by one year so you don't even know what you're paying for the prescription is easy to get you can see pretty much any dermat ologist and it's the only version that's truly effective so everybody should be on it protects your skin keeps you looking young reduces skin cancer risk grows new collagen literally the only consequence is that when you first start your skin may be a little bit red or peely as the skin acclimates or turns over other than that nothing why do you think given the immense interest in skin appearance and health that we don't hear more about this because that's a great question so we hear so much about retinol every magazine you open that has anything you'll see like intensive night cream intensive Eye Serum uh Regenerist eye repair and all of them have retinol none of them have retinoid or tretinoin for many reasons originally it was made for acne and the patients that came in to get the get them for acne were not necessarily in the same line of thought of you know premature aging and Longevity this would be things like retina yeah retina exactly or Accutane or um different these are the brand names for these products so there is a disconnect between the people seeking the anti-aging um effects and the people getting it as a prescription that's one and number two as soon as cosmical companies figured out a way to Market overthe counter inactive versions that went haywire so you can Google retinol and there's million things when you Google troan you only hear about acne so there's a little bit of a disconnect much like all in medicine between what docs know and think that you know population knows and what the population actually knows but that's the one thing I think we've been doing a great job on you know in modern day social media is advocating for these for these medicines now that's one realm of things that you can do to absolutely improve the quality of your skin long-term Health appearance um actually Revitalize the skin then there's a whole set of procedures that you can that can be done that have been shown to improve not only the appearance but actual biologic health so that's where we fall into the laser world and somebody who's you know been in photobiology um albe a slightly different realm you know the effects of light um and the incredible changes that it can have in biology most of what we understand for lasers in medicine came out of Dermatology studies you know a lot of the understanding of laser biology came out of the Wellman Institute over at Harvard where many of my colleagues are and we now know that certain laser devices certain resurfacing devices not only app improve the appearance of your skin clinically they reduce your risk of skin cancer by 20% maybe greater and even more amazingly is when you do microarray Gene studies they actually activate the genes of more youthful healthy skin cells that were quiescent as we age so there's genetic verification clinical verif verification and aesthetic verification these things are awesome now laser is a big umbrella term some of the devices we use are not lasers they're actually light Broadband light or uh intense pulse light some of them are laser some of them are uh ablade some of them are nonablative and we get into the nuances of these things but there are a few lasers that have been shown to make these dramatic differences so if you're interested I mean see a see an expert so this would be go to your dermatologist ask for some is it laser resurfacing yeah yeah so laser resurfacing it tends to be and what's really popular there's two forms of laser resurfacing there's what we call nonablative meaning it doesn't burn or vaporize the top layer of skin and then there's ablative resurfacing which vaporizes the top layer of skin obviously ablative ones are much more aggressive much more effective a lot more downtime and a lot of riskier because you're literally peeling the face off or any part of the body and it regrows without any scarring that's also the another beauty of the skin is you can literally peel it off entirely and have it regrow as if nothing ever happened so people have this done once a year or so yeah for for not for a blade of resurfacing it's like once every five years or so on it's it's pretty dramatic and how long is the downtime for a blade of resurfacing uh two weeks usually two weeks you're pretty raw and sore it's fallen out of favor in most big cities because of the downtime and the inherent risks but it's still used in the right patient nonablative resurfacing meaning it doesn't vaporize the top layer but drills holes into the dermis and targets certain parts of the epidermis without causing burn injury that's become much more popular because the downtime is markedly less people can go back to work and enjoy their activities while having pretty much the same benefits albeit a little bit less than a blade of lasers these we generally recommend annually or biannually depending on what you're trying to Target a large Harvard study just came out that showed that non-ablative fractionated laser resurfacing particularly with a device called fraxel actually Cuts your skin cancer risk by 20% because it eliminates those mutations and gets rid of those cells that had been collecting the stuff it's amazing how is this different than exfoliating skin like if one were to just try and um you know scrape away some of the dead skin through some you know semi vigorous buffing of the skin with a like a sponge I've never done I've never done either of these procedures like I said my skincare routine is very basic it's the unscented Dove soap the shower once or twice a day and your skin looks great so keep doing what you're doing I mean I feel pretty good I mean I I think um you know sleep seems to play a significant role uh for me um I do get probably a bit more sun exposure than most people I'm conscious of checking for skin Cancers and we'll talk about that um because those do run in my family um but and I try and eat right and exercise right haven't consumed much alcohol in my lifetime so look your skin will tell you if something's wrong so that's the first line now you talk about you know dermabrasion or microdermabrasion the good old St Ives apricot scrub that every dermatologist you know frowns upon but ironically I use myself after a heavy workout at the beach and I'm all greasy but don't you know don't get mad at me for using that stuff the depth is key so when we do microdermabrasion or some sort of dermabrasion the only thing we're really scraping off is really the stratum corneum which is the highest layer of skin cells that don't even have a nucleus they're dead skin cells that's all you're scraping off whereas lasers Target through the epidermis and into the dermis and you control for that depth and what you control for is the amount of heat energy delivered to that depth to Target a certain thing so in theory what you describe in terms of dermabrasion is the same premise the old school ablade of lasers do they just fry everything off and you grow new skin and in frying everything off it fries off sun damage wrinkles precancers and skin cancers but in doing that you're a bloody mess for a few weeks not popular for many reasons but very effective we did a ton of this at Stanford and we did a ton of the other one at Stanford in my practice I do a lot of laser work as well the nonablative stuff picks and chooses that was the beauty of ident learning about laser and photobiology is how we target a certain structure and avoid damaging all the other ones that the theory of selective photothermolysis that came out of rock Anderson's lab at Harvard that was the game changer we can now pick any appendage in the skin and find a way to Target it and leave the rest undisturbed so if you have broken blood vessels you decide to use bpc 157 and it work great and the blood vessels started to grow and you're like I don't like the look of them there is a laser that targets solely blood vessels is that the IPL laser IPL is okay IPL stands for intense pulse light it's somewhat effective but not very effective the the gold standard is what we call the pulse die laser or the vbeam laser and that is a 595 nanometer laser that targets oxyhemoglobin I've had that actually because I had an an angioma yeah had it three times and the third time they hit this thing it went away but not without a very significant bruise lasting almost a month a like you know I mean it was pretty dramatic done it right but it did eliminate the the vessel that was very by any means necessary right it's just new so as long as we're on the topic of photobiomodulation what about red light and near infrared light is there any evidence that it can benefit um skin health and appearance nowadays you can find um masks that will emit red light some people will purchase red lights they stand in front of I think they're very effective I think they work great the question is to what extent is that Improvement objective and measurable and what extent is subjective that being said there's a lot of evidence that shows that red light therapy in improves vascular flow in the skin we use it for things like hair restoration post-procedure recovery um Improvement in skin Health after UV damage we actually found a recent study that looked at red light therapy and um irradiating a mice and if you pre-treat the mice with red light therapy before they get UV exposure compared to controls the pre-treated group had much less of the changes with UV exposure so very fascinating stuff how it works uncertain we think a lot of it has to do with increased vascular flow which is why a lot of times we recommend it for postprocedure we recommend it for hair uh regrowth there's some evidence that if you increase blood flow to the dermal Pilla of the hair it grows new hair that's how minoxidil or rain Works um but I I like it I think it's a great product um a great great um group of products or devices as a standalone uncertain as to how effective they are and one of the reasons of the heterogenity and the data are like so much different is there's no regulation in terms of the energy the density of light the the type of light the duration of treatment so some devices have high wattage high energy output high density of lights they may be more effective than its equivalent counterpart and until that gets defined U more uniform in in accessibility I don't know which device to recommend you know there I I obviously have preferences one way or another um but there's so much on the market that's marketed as red light that is not effective and some stuff that's really good so probably looking for something that's at least endorsed by dermatologists Mak sense absolutely and I should say here I I have no no angle into this I what these masks emit red light or I don't have any business relationship to them so that's not why I bring it up I was just very curious I see them in my Instagram feed probably by virtue of doing public facing health and science information um and my interest in light yeah what about oh yes EXC I was going to say the panels tend to be much higher in energy much more effective and most of the studies have looked at the big wall panels the battery powered face masks just aren't powered enough to have much improvement we do see some improvement when and blue is used together mostly for acne proin skin because blue light alone has some antimicrobial properties so when used in conjunction you can get some improvement in actual skin illnesses but the masks alone with just red light most of them are not powered enough they don't have enough energy but there are some that are good the wall panels tend to be better thank you for that and full disclosure I I was accurate in saying that I don't have any relationship to any red light mask companies or products but um this podcast is sponsored by juv which makes medical grade panels for red light and near INF red light and I do own one of those and I use I have a small portable one I use and then I have a panel I stand in front of so that includes my face and then I'll turn around and so do a whole body um panels juv is a good company it's been around for a while and you know most of the experts in laser and photobiology you know agree that panels are the way to go if you if you want red light it's interesting when um people see and hear about red light and near infrared light therapies I think a lot of people think oh this is kind of like nextstage biohacking but there was a Nobel Prize given for photobiomodulation for the treatment of Lupus in the early 1900s so this is you know a long-standing thing the use of light of particular wavelengths or combinations of wavelengths of which red light and blue light are of course in order to Target different layers within the skin to get some desired effect yeah yeah light has been around for a long time I have a phototherapy unit in my practice and which we use narrow band ultraviolet be light to treat conditions like psoriasis to treat conditions like Vitiligo there's a very strong immunomodulatory effect of light on the skin it actually suppresses overactive immune activity it can help increase vascularity in the skin it can improve blood flow so depending on the wavelength you pick and where it overlies on the absorption curves makes a big difference it's interesting that we talk about light and as a skin cancer surgeon this has always been interesting to me in that we use UV light to treat certain conditions and we assume UV light is purely pathogenic and I don't think that's the case and why I bring this up is one of the most common things we use like light therapy for is patients with Vitiligo which is this autoimmune condition in which your immune system attacks the cells that produce our color and the standard treatment is certain creams that suppress the immune system in the Skin phototherapy ecer Laser which is a UV laser and then now the new world of um immunotherapies by pill form the Jack Inhibitors have made a huge difference but if we thought and I go back on this tangent because the more we think about it the less we know if we think UV is truly dellarious then patients with Vitiligo should have an higher incidence of skin cancer and in fact the opposite is true they have a lower incidence of skin cancer even when you match them for amount of UV exposure over time so it goes to tell us that there's so much about light and skin we don't understand so much about sun and UV and skin we don't understand and a incredible component about our Skin's immune system that we're only now figuring out that play an important role you know patients who have transplants for example transplant patient in the early 90s the number one cause of death for transplant patients that was not related to their transplant was metastatic skin cancer and this was in patients who were strictly Sun protected so we we talk about you know biology photobiology LED UV and skin health and there's so much we don't know as we gather more data and look at populations and cohorts so I don't know why I brought that up as a tangent but well I think it's a very relevant because the relationship between immune system function and skin is very clear and these conditions that you're referring to Vitiligo acne psoriasis eczema Etc have interesting relationships to the immune system so that's actually a perfect segue for what I'd like to talk about next sure so let's start with psoriasis what is the story with psoriasis what is it what can make it worse what can make it better psoriasis is like the quintessential skin condition I have it myself on my elbows and knees and for about a hundred years it was thought to be a problem a rash that is caused by too much skin turnover or excess skin proliferation and for a hundred years we treated it the same way we gave medicines that basically took the skin off what we call katol litics we found that that wasn't very effective and some people can be hospitalized and it can be life-threatening if psoriasis involves the entire body usually looks like red patches or plaques with kind of a silvery scale on the surface and starts usually elbows and knees or the scalp um but can involve pretty much the entirety of the body and what we found in the last 30 years with a lot of elegant studies and a lot of very very nice basic science um research is that it's actually due to overactivity of our Skin's immune system so there's overactivity of certain inter lucans which are these messenger that our immune cells produce that makes the skin turn over faster than it should and this Epiphany was remarkable because we found that instead of targeting the skin we can Target the immune system and we can eradicate or treat psoriasis entirely and in the '90s and early 2000s that targeting was very crude it was a very umbrella approach we suppressed the entire immune system and ran into the consequences of that so medications that we gave for that increased risk for infections and you know skin cancers Etc now we have amazing drugs that Target one or two molecules messenger molecules of our immune system and clear up people's psoriasis I mean we have drugs now you take three times a year and you could have head to toe psoriasis and be completely clear it tends to run in families there is a very strong hereditary or genetic component to it and it tends to be associated with arthritis psoriatic arthritis um so psoriasis is like the quintessential skin condition that people see dermatologists and even rheumatologist for so these drugs that Target these specific interlukin seem like the most direct way to treat psoriasis some people for whatever reason have an aversion to prescription drugs I I'm um not necessarily one of those people but I like everybody else would like to know what we can do to reduce symptoms of things like psoriasis without having to quote andquot take anything yeah I should probably backtrack so psoriasis obviously comes in severity there's mild disease which majority of people have there's moderate and severe and generally speaking the most common things that we treat mild uh psoriasis with is creams and lotions moisturizers sometimes low potency topical steroids or high potency topical steroids and then things like catalytics like salicylic acid that take that excess scale off we also know that there because it's an immune inflammatory condition that diet plays a big role in improving mild or moderate cases and we also know that weight loss plays a very big role in improving the appearance of psoriasis so as we lose weight as there's Improvement in insulin resistance and as we transition diets and Lifestyles from inflammatory to anti-inflammatory psoriasis tends to clear without any intervention needed without any medical intervention needed if there's still continued you know rashes and skin activity then you look at topicals like you know cortisones um imoan like aquafor and Vaseline you know things with some sort of acid or retinoid to get rid of that excess scale that's the fundamental Cornerstone of treating psoriasis and then when it gets bad we talk about additional pharmacologic interventions also interestingly one of the earliest um conditions in which phototherapy was used is psoriasis we know that when we shine UV light on the skin that it suppresses the Skin's immune system and clear psoriasis and that's an excellent way to treat it without pharmacologic intervention without any creams pills injections or otherwise medication it used to be used in the Dead Sea PE people would go lather in the mud in the Dead Sea and sit out in the sun and that was the first crude way to use phototherapy to treat psoriasis that was my question since the sun emits UV why not just get some additional sunlight exposure for psoriasis so you can I most dermatologists wouldn't recommend it I think it's actually not a bad thing my psoriasis clears in the summertime and flares in the winter time the problem with pure sunlight is that it's a mix of rays right there's xrays gamma rays which generally don't penetrate the atmosphere there's UVC UVB UVA visible light infrared light so that heterogeneous light some have no improvement in psoriasis and some have great improvements so we were able to figure out which wavelengths make a big difference and it's around the 311 312 nanometer range but sunlight does clear people's psoriasis up that's why we see in Northern latitudes where there's less Sun intensity the incidence of psoriasis is markedly higher than equatorial latitudes and patients will say their psorasis gets better when they're on a beach vacation and when they go back home their psorasis flares there's also some component with vitamin D as well but I think that's just secondary to the lack of UV exposure what about Vitiligo um this is something I did not cover in the solo episode about skin Health um but I got a lot of questions about um Vitiligo of course being this typically patchy um nonpigmented regions of of skin um that you said is at least some cases are related to the immune system um these people get skin cancers less often is that right yeah so Vitiligo is uh autoimmune meaning your immune system is attacking itself depigmentary skin disorder meaning it's a condition in which your immune system attacks and kills the melanocytes which are the cells that produce our Skin's color and we've found that it's an autoimmune from many basic science and elegant studies it's also very closely associated with other autoimmune conditions so patients tend to also have atopic dermatitis autoimmune thyroid disease autoimmune anemia there's some sort of immune disasa that involves vialo patients and what happens is the immune system at first paralyzes these cells with you know immune activity attacking them and over time these cells no longer survive and die off the Cornerstone in treatment has always been you know some way to suppress the Skin's immune response when most of the time Vitiligo tends to be focal single areas or segmental unfortunately in certain cases it can be whole body or completely depigmenting very uncommon but we see this we treat it by doing things that'll help quiet the immune response in the Skin So topical creams topical steroids Etc topical calcineurin Inhibitors which are you know non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications we also use certain wavelengths of UV light to treat this ecer laser at 308 nmet uh UVB UVA and then the the Renaissance in Vitiligo has happened in the last three or four years with the identification of Jack Inhibitors which are these drugs that block the Janis kyes pathway and we found that the Jack St pathway plays a really important role in autoimmune mediation of melanocyte so new creams and actually oral medications have come out for patients who have very refractory Vitiligo the immune component is very fascinating because understanding immune biology and the immune systems effect on skin health comes from studying these patients when patients have Vitiligo they lose all of their color so you would assume that they're much more susceptible to sunburns which they are but when you look at incidents of skin cancers they have a significantly lower incidence of skin cancer and this is because of the immune phenomenon in immune surveillance of cancer and that occurs throughout the body but the skin is a model platform for this what happens is your immune system surveys for mutant changes that occur whether it's UV related Etc infection toxin whatever and patients who have V Lego have overactivity of these immune cells and over surveillance so they are able to clear a lot of these precancerous changes before they form into something so that played a big role in not only understanding how to treat viigo but some of our new medicines actually the medicines that won the Nobel Prize in 2018 for treating melanoma came from understanding immune activity and cancer pathogenesis it's fascinating again speaking to the fact that skin is far more than just this protective Outer Outer sheath it's a um it's a reflection of so much that's going on internally and and we know that um intuitively also by observing others I think this is one of several ways that parents can communicate well with their children or their children with their parents rather in terms of how they're feeling prior to language you know they they'll look at uh their skin yeah um their stool obviously fussiness and mood and those things too but we seem to have developed an intuitive understanding that a shift in the kind of like tone of the skin or some other features of the skin signal to us Wellness or lack of Wellness yeah the Skin's a biosensor the entire skin hair nails is a biosensor so you can utilize the skin as the first barometer of illness I mean from acute illness to chronic illness acutely you can see changes in just like looking pal you know with palar looking gasly things like that but chronic illness as well you know when you used to go to the pediatrician and they would do this to look at your ey eyes what they were looking for was the color of the conjunctiva if it was white or pale they knew you had iron deficiency you know when kids get handf foot and mouth syndrome and they have a high fever they lose their fingernails when college students are stressed out they lose their hair the body's amazing ability to tell you it's under stress is shown in the skin hair and nails what it does is it says why am I wasting energy producing something that is not necessary because I'm fighting something else let's just shed this and you can tell right away I mean we used to in clinic when I'd see you know medical students or college students come in I knew it was finals week they'd come with clumps of hair and as soon as finals week passed uh usually took a few months their hair grew back it's awesome the Skin's a really cool biosensor and you can tell a lot it is so cool what about acne acne seems very common you know as uh we progress through puberty there seems to be more acne sometimes it's transient sometimes it's not yeah um what are some things that people can do to prevent or reduce acne another quintessential Derm problem that is affects so many people um acne tends to be a condition that is bodal meaning we tend to see it in adolescence we tend to see it in 25 to 35 year olds and for the unfortunate group of people that bridge that Gap we see it anywhere from 12 to 35 acne is a condition that's usually seen by pimples you know what we call blackheads or white heads zits or boils and it's thought to be caused by three important things it's an overproduction of sebum which is the oily stuff that comes out of your skin and that's dictated by your hormones your hormones will increase the output of sebum and that usually occurs in puberty but can also occur if you're taking medications like prednizone cortisol testosterone anything that is a hormone driver so sebum is the first cause sebum is the food for the a for the bacteria that cause acne so as there's more food the bacteria proliferate and in proliferation it recruits an immune response your immune system says hey there's a little bit too much of these organisms let's go and take care of them that's where you get that red zit so in treating acne you got to treat all three components to get really effectively clear skin somehow reduce the SE them get rid of the bacteria and calm the immune system down that's done with creams oral medications um of combination of both sometimes certain lasers can help eradicate the oil glands that feed the bacteria um but acne is a a fascinating condition almost everybody will have it at some point in their life is it true that eating a diet that is of slight excess in calories um because it will tend to push the insulin glucose regulation system more into the positive as opposed to let's just say higher levels of insulin in circulating blood glucose than one would observe at say maintenance calories or sub maintenance calories that you know overeating a little bit could cause acne um that any foods that promote increases in glucose and Insulin so sugary Foods um high glycemic foods um these sort things can that actually increase acne fried foods yeah so it's not the calor caloric deficit or the caloric Surplus it's the glycemic index or the amount of insulin response so we know that high glycemic index foods will make acne worse in almost every study that we've looked at in sugary processed foods will flare your acne there's some component of that inflammatory response that not only drives even production and bacterial growth but actually worsens the Skin's immune response the Skin's immune response is a little feisty when you're eating pro-inflammatory things the other thing that I do hear a lot about is dairy and there's this misconception that Dairy causes acne what we really see when we looked at a a really cool study that was done out of Penn State is that it's not so much whole fat dairy products but skim and nonfat dairy products that can make your acne flare and the reason for that is usually in the United States the there's an emulsifier that's put in nonfat or skim products to give the same mouth feel as full fat so people feel like they're getting the same without the calories and that has a glycemic response so it's usually sugary Foods non-fat skin um dairy products that will make your acne flare what about rosacea I hear so much about this and I'm going to assume that we can mark off at least one thing as clear which is that alcohol can exacerbate Rosa maybe directly but certainly indirectly by you know impeding some aspects of the microbiome disrupting sleep rosacea gets worse but what are things that people can do um dos and don'ts that is for rosacea um if it's mild rosacea like excessively uh Ruddy cheeks or um superficial riding capillaries that um seem to bother a lot of people I I know that it bothers a lot of people because they asked about this quite a lot questions when I when I solicited for questions so R rosacea commonly known as adult acne tends to come in four flavors the first form is the redness form what we call aritic form or the rudiness broken blood vessels redness of the cheeks and flushing that's by and far the most common form there's also the papulopustular form which is the pimple form which is what we think about an adult acne there's also the fitus form which is the enlargement of the nose that kind of looks like toad skin we used to think it was a sign of alcoholism or Sailors or um you know construction workers that would have these enlarged nose we we thought it was a product of their environment that's actually a form of rosacea and then there's ocular rosacea which affects the Eyes by and far the two most common that I we see people in in practice for is the redness form redness and flushing or the pimple form you're absolutely right in that alcohol can contribute to it and worsen it for two reasons one alcohol itself is a vasodilator and acetal ahid is a much more potent vasodilator so when you drink you flush also chronic impairment of the gut microbiome and lifestyle changes that make you drink more probably will exacerbate your rosacea but things that trigger the redness include UV light because of vasod dilation uh spicy foods hot beverages emotions life stressors all the things that make you flush what triggers the breakouts is a little bit different and why that's important is how we treat them so what triggers breakouts is thought to be both organisms that live on our skin including bacteria and certain might mites but also immune disregulation in our skin that we don't really understand or just now elucidating um how the immune system in the skin becomes dysfunctional to show those breakouts in terms of treating redness we have some creams that are okay at temporarily blanching those vessels out but they're not great and they're temporary we don't have great treatments for them but we have great lasers for redness so when patients come to see me for redness or any dermatologist for redness generally there's a discussion about laser destruction of those blood vessels when we talk about breakouts or pimple form of rosacea we have excellent medications in terms of both creams and oral medications that suppress both the bacterial and M growth as well as the immune response in the skin so you kind of have to take a look at what form you have and what will be the best treatment eczema umbrella term for what we generally consider as atopic dermatitis or what used to be you know colloquially ter termed as sensitive skin in childhood and that's a very prominent skin condition also dictated by the immune system but in two forms eczema tends to be caused by three major prongs the first prong is a genetic barrier defect in the Skin So patients with eczema tend to have a microscopic weave of their skin that's not as tight as somebody without eczema and that's usually defined by a gene called fagron that's the first reason to develop eczema the second reason is an environmental allergen or trigger that's able to get through these weaves easier because of this genetic change the third thing is an aarant immune response to these triggers so patients with eczema tend to have an immune system that responds a little bit more vigorously or over actively to the same environmental trigger probably because there's more trigger getting in through the barrier defect than somebody who doesn't so the Cornerstone in treating eczema is treating these three things why dermatologists make a big stink about moisturize moisturize moisturize for Eczema is to seal that barrier with a moisturizer because we're basically putting the mortar back in between the bricks which are the skin cells to seal the skin off to not allow the environmental allergen to get in that's the first the second is to avoid environmental triggers so fragrances preservatives seasonal allergies pollin things that trigger that immune response we try to mitigate now obviously trying to control environmental pollens is hard but using things like we talked about earlier you know fragrance-free cleansers fragrance-free detergents fragrance free skin care products nonpreserved based skincare products will mitigate the environmental triggers and then the third thing is just calming the immune system down and that can be done in a variety of ways most commonly it's topical medications like topical steroids that dampen the immune system in the skin and when eczema is really really bad there are uh biologic medications that control certain inter lucans and they've made an incredible advancement in in eczema control people we can control patients for life with some of these injectable medicines a couple things that you taught me that I just want to pass along in short form and please correct me if I have this wrong uh one if you can avoid popping pimples definitely avoid it because it can cause damage recruitment of these Matrix Metallo proteases which essentially digest some of the deeper layers of the skin leave scars yeah yeah totally so it's I mean it's very gratifying and you want to do it there's like some subconscious desire to like pop a pimple I have it myself anytime I see a pimple I'm like man I got to I want to get at this thing I think is to eradicate the infection type of thing you know even if it's not an infection I think possibly like a like a evolutionary reason yeah very very possible um the reason we don't want to do that um and the reason why we always say don't pick at your skin is when there's an in immune response in the skin the immune system is trying to fix something and fight something and in doing so it recruits different enzymes the most common enzyme is what you exactly describe Matrix metaloproteinases which are these enzymes that eat apart collagen and elastin to allow it to remodel when you cause physical trauma in the skin you recruit a much larger immune response than what was warranted for that that insult so these mmps these Matrix Metallo protases enter at a much higher amount and they eat away the collagen and elastin that's what leaves an acne score now people are going to pop their pimples whether we want to or not so if you're going to do it I don't recommend it but if you're going to do it generally what we recommend is if there is no tip don't even think about it if there is a small white tip and not much pain or induration you can use a warm compress to see if you can soften that and see if it'll expel itself pushing we don't recommend stretching can sometimes unroof a pimple tends to cause less trauma but again if you listen to one thing don't do it and if they pop on their own can't believe we're having this conversation but that's a skin health and appearance episode after all if they pop on their own then uh cleaning it with a gentle cleanser is probably the best way to go no um topical antibiotics is that right no don't use any hydron peroxide it's a common misconception thinking it fights things peroxide doesn't let wounds heal it just kills anything living so no peroxide and no topical antibiotics that are over the- counter most of these don't have any antibiotic properties anyway because most organisms are resistant to them because of the widespread availability and use and two they cause a lot of um allergic contact dermatitis and rashes and people who are susceptible to them so we just say if it pops on its own leave it alone may want to put a little ointment on there if you have a sore but otherwise ignore it and what about the use of corticosterone cream like if somebody has a red bump and they're headed to an event or something and they want to you know um yeah eliminate some of the redness and bump so a common thing we see a lot of people for it's like a day before their wedding or a day before a big social event they have a zit on their forehead and they say you know what can you do for me I need this gone so exact like we talked about topical corticosteroids and to a greater extent injectable intralesional corticosteroids suppress the immune response temporarily so you can use them cautiously if you have an event within the next you know day or two long-term use it causes multiple problems it causes thinning of the skin and uh can increase the risk of the acne scar forming and you can have rebound acne from topical steroids used all over the face often times we see a lot of people who are in the public eye um asking for steroid injections of their acne I as a surgeon usually see a lot of the consequences of that so I tend not to utilize steroid injections for acne um the reason for that is if you place just a little too much and we're talking less than .1 milliliter difference you can have a permanent atrophic uh divot uh in the skin that is only fixed by surgery so I see a lot of young patients that come in who had an acne spot injected here and now that divot is left and that's permanent if it's going to be done it should be done by a dermatologist who knows what they're doing low concentrations usually bottom half of the face can be effective in getting rid of a a really bad pimple that needs to be gone immediately you just got to know the risks assuming sterile technique and other safety measures in place are tattoos inherently bad for skin no I don't think so I think tattoos are an awesome form of Art and I think it used to be linked to you know stereotypes that are no longer true I think the challenge with tattoos is to things making sure that what is being placed underneath the skin is not an allergen we see this mostly with Reds that use cinemates they produce a lot of granulomatous reactions or foreign body reactions one making sure obviously they're using Clean safe equipment that's sterile you know you don't want the bloodborne pathogens the real challenge is surveying for growths in patients who have a lot of tattoos it's hard to see small skin cancers form or changes and moles because usually the tattoos are of dark color so the surveillance part becomes a little bit more challenging so if you have a lot of tattoos just make sure to see your dermatologist and somebody who feels comfortable and confident in screening um but other than that no they're they've been around for hundreds and hundreds of years and I think they're fine if done correctly that's a good segue into surveying for skin cancers earlier you talked about some of the more common forms of skin cancer um Squam cell carcinoma basil cell carcinoma but then there's the the one no one truly wants which is um melanoma melanoma yeah so I was taught to keep it eye on my moles yeah if they change change in Border change in size Etc uh to notify a dermatologist um I get my moles checked about I don't know I just had it done less than a year ago um but what about getting all skin checked I mean what do you this is your area of expertise so so if you had a magic wand yeah um to help prevent skin cancers what would what would you have people do that's a great great question so obviously there are many forms of skin cancer but the three most common like we talked about basil cell carcinoma squa cell carcinoma and melanoma there are other types like Merkel cell and Etc but they're far less common now historically melanoma has been our number one killer for skin cancer until about a few years ago around 2018 when the Nobel Prize was won for the new drugs that treated melanoma this year we expect three times as many deaths in the United States from sell carcinoma than we do melanoma but nobody talks about that we lose a patient every about 62 minutes to melanoma but one every 37 minutes to Sasol carcinoma first and foremost the thing that you want to look for in terms of skin cancer risk and predisposition is look at family history your family history in your genetics plays the largest role in predisposition for skin cancer development if you can gather a family history you can understand your risk in developing it and it can help dictate your screening now if you can't get a family history or you don't know your family history not a problem generally we recommend an annual skin exam by a good reputable board certified dermatologist and that includes every square inch of your skin including you know your hair between your toes in the genital area we can develop a skin cancer anywhere Bob Marley died of a melanoma on his toenail that was thought to be a soccer injury you know Jimmy Buffett died of a Merkel cell carcinoma one of these rare types that occur in Sun exposed areas anybody can get them obviously there's predispositions in higher risk populations but it's such an easy non-invasive exam to do that everybody should get one at least once a year the other reason why I bring this up is skin cancers can develop in Sun protected areas one of the areas that I see a rapid increase in skin cancer development is in genital areas as and in the mouth due to HPV and we see this a lot in younger and younger patients probably in the last month I've operated on six or seven young patients under the age of 40 with sisol carcinomas caused by HPV in the genital region this is obviously not Sun driven it's not something you can put sunscreen or take a you know product to protect you from but it's something that's easily monitored or surveyed so I would say at the very minimum get a family history or a personal history get an annual surveillance exam if you have a lot of moles I used to direct the pigmented lesions and melanoma clinic this is something that was really hard for a lot of dermatologists and patients to follow when they when they're covered with moles see which one is changing there are tools that can be utilized including whole body photography mole mapping and some new AI based softwares that basically track the moles and look for changes as you feed the software more and more pictures from the patients it's fascinating a lot of the stuff is developing from our our well I should say my alma moer but up at Stamford is these AI based um software apps that allow us to survey some of the most challenging patients so if you have a lot of moles your screening may be more than once a year if you have a lot of moles you inherently have a slightly increased risk for melanoma now we always use these terms interchangeably melanoma skin cancer basil squamous Etc importantly to know for every one melanoma there's 10 non-melanoma skin cancers that's namely basil cell and squa cell about 5 million Americans will be diagnosed with one of the non- melanomas this year alone five million 5 million it's a big number yeah it's about one in four uh one in four Americans at some point in their lifetime will develop a skin cancer encroaching one in three Americans by the end of their by the end of 2030 so it's a lot majority of these are not life-threatening but they're functionally and cosmetically disfiguring they arise on sun exposed areas so surveillance is really important for the HPV that eventually becomes Squam cell carcinoma yeah is the HPV vaccine effective even at older ages yeah great question so the we are seeing HPV become a real problem in many cancers in the body not just the original cervical cancer which was the number one killer in young women for cancer until the vaccine came out but we're seeing it now as the number one cause of throat cancer in young adults and sexually active adults uh in significantly increased risk of sasel carcinomas in Sun protected areas immunosuppressed patients the vaccine the gardisil vaccine which which treats or builds immunity to HPV covers the strains that cause cancer 16 18 31 33 and so on I recommend anybody who is either sexually active or anybody who you know in population literally anyone should get vaccinated the new um guidelines have extended the age up until I think late 40s for both men and women it used to be only for young young women because the cervical cancer risk but now we found that so many things are implicated with HPV that the the on label use is up to the late 40s so if if you have any concern I I highly recommend getting the vaccine as I recall planters warts yeah which are these warts that burrow a kind of root into the bottom of the foot they're very painful that actually um can be caused by HPV it's a form of HPV and it's not sexually transmitted it's um locker room transmitted yeah so HPV comes in about 200 strains or like 190 strains strains one two and four for example cause warts on the hands and feet what you see like gym goers and kids you know they get warts HPV 6 and 11 for example cause genital warts HPV strains 16 18 31 and 33 cause cancer the question is when you get something does it come with its its brothers or its siblings and that's the question we don't know the vaccine was made to treat highrisk strains but because of cross antigenicity we see that patients who get vaccinated their warts go away and we saw this in the hospital and Transplant patients who were covered with warts because of their immunosuppressed effect when we would vaccinate them their warts would get better so warts on their fingers warts on their planters warts on their feet yeah transplant patients and anybody who is immunosuppressed um they have a tough time fighting plantor warts you know finger warts any sort of viral based um condition because their immune system is pressed from medications or otherwise so they usually have a tough time fighting these things they have a higher incidence of a lot of things but the vaccine was cool and eradicating it now I'm not saying go get a vaccine because you have a plantar wart that's silly and Overkill usually you know warts we treat with you know freezing in office procedures easy things but cler warts can be burnt out yeah we burn them or freeze them or scrape them use a little medication but the vaccine does improve some of the burden of disease even though it doesn't Target that strain do you think soon we will be in the landscape of vaccines for all forms of skin cancer I think we're on the Forefront and the term vaccine is a really big umbrella term loaded term too yeah I know it's going to Garner a lot of questions I think yes absolutely there was a new study that showed that um uh an mRNA vaccine and that is already pretty controversial was shown to improve melanoma survival after surgery and chemotherapy so what the goal of all these things is to prime your immune system and have the immune system know what to Target it's to teach the immune system hey this is bad next time you see this go attack it it's like showing a blood hound a steak and then going on the hunt The Blood Hound now knows what to sent for and what is normal and what isn't so the vaccines have a lot of controversial things I think for medicine and cancer biology it's going to be revolutionary we see it for brain tumors we see it for gly blastoma incredible changes with dendritic cell vaccines we see it for melanoma now and in the future may be used for all uh skin cancers with an asterisk depending on how much we can activate the immune system to Target it fascinating and uh good place for us to probably pause until the next time we have you back to talk about where that technology evolves because today you've taught us so much about skin what it is you know it's Anatomy its physiology what it reflects in terms of our internal workings health or in some cases challenges with health we talked about various conditions such as psoriasis acne eczema dandruff as it's sometimes called uh and what we can do you know the the RO of nutrition avoiding certain things like excess alcohol nicotine Etc but also some of the newer and more exciting treatments that exist for um all these conditions some merely cosmetic and uncomfortable some truly life-threatening and dangerous like melanoma so for all those reasons and also for taking time out of your very busy clinical schedule to come talk to us I really appreciate it and I want to voice my appreciation both for myself and for those listening and viewing I know people will have many many questions so we will refer them to your uh social media accounts and answer and links to your clinic and so forth so that they can have those questions addressed and who knows maybe we get the chance to work with you appreciate in the meantime I just want to say thank you for this public education gift that you've given us um I'm thinking about skin very differently now and I plan to do and not do certain things uh in light of today's convers ation no pun intended so thank you for the opportunity I'm incredibly grateful to be here I think I think teaching is really important having evidence-based discussions is really important challenging Dogma is also important done in the right way in the evidence-based way I love what I do I love everything about the skin I love you know seeing patience and also you know challenging you know the status quo on certain things so thank you for the opportunity it's been a lot of fun there's a lot to talk about skin you can probably talk for a decade if you let me but I appreciate it thank you well we will certainly bring you back to further the discussion meanwhile thank you ever so much Dr

Title: Why Kids Shouldn't Have Smartphones Before High School
Published: 2024-08-12 18:00:57 UTC
Description:
Dr. Jonathan Haidt discusses the recommendation against giving children smartphones before high school and suggests alternatives like flip phones to limit internet access.

Transcript Language: English
No smartphone before high school. You can give your kid a flip phone. The millennials had flip phones, they came out fine. No access or no smartphone of their own. Your own, your own. You can't have your own. And that would even go for an iPad. If you give your kid an iPad and say, "Here, Billy, this is your iPad, you can keep it in your room and use it anywhere in the house, and you can take it outside even," although maybe no Wi-Fi, whatever. The point is the internet is an amazing thing, and you know, you can have a computer in your living room or kitchen when you have young kids, and they can do things on the computer. But you do not want to give your child the entire internet in his or her pocket, and you do not want the entire world to be able to reach your child whenever they want to. So it's just insane that we're giving children even before puberty a smartphone. Let them have a flip phone or a simple phone, watch, something like that, that's rule number one.

Title: Dr. Layne Norton: Tools for Nutrition & Fitness
Published: 2024-08-12 12:00:08 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. Layne Norton, Ph.D., one of the world’s top experts in nutrition and training for physical fitness. We discuss how to evaluate scientific evidence and the validity of different practices aimed at achieving fat loss, muscle strength and hypertrophy, microbiome health, vitality, and longevity.

We explore many hotly debated topics, including fasting, seed oils, saturated fats, sugar, red meat, artificial/low-calorie sweeteners, and GLP-1 agonists (e.g., Ozempic). Additionally, we delve into the timing of protein and carbohydrate intake relative to fasting and exercise, fat loss and sleep, and the benefits of dietary protein and fiber on overall health.

We also discuss how to accelerate hypertrophy and fat loss, improve strength, whether we need to train to “failure,” how to enhance exercise recovery, and how to manage pain. We cover training before versus after age 50, whether metabolism changes with age, and the connection between muscle health and longevity. We also address why certain behaviors and supplements might work for some people but not others.

Listeners to this episode will benefit greatly from Layne’s science-based expertise on a wide range of topics, including health, nutrition, and fitness.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Lane Norton Dr Lane Norton did his training in Biochemistry and nutritional sciences and is one of the world's foremost experts in exercise and nutrition he is also an expert in the topic of supplementation and other tools to augment Health today we discuss a large number of very important topics in these categories and we start the conversation by establishing what Dr Norton's thresholds are for what he accepts as evidence in particular actionable evidence so what follows is a description of what Dr Norton really believes is worth paying attention to versus what he believes is worth ignoring in the Realms of nutrition training and supplementation so you can be certain that as we start to go through the topics of sugar glp1 agonists things like OIC artificial sweeteners whether you should train to failure or not during your resistance training sessions how much volume of training you need to do cardiovascular training and its different forms in terms of how they benefit Health span and lifespan and body composition protein and its different sources and on and on indeed we cover many Topics in this episode you can be sure that all of the information you hear from Dr Norton is being filtered through that extremely stringent filter that Dr Norton is so well known for and thus by the end of today's episode You Will Be armed not only with the latest information on nutrition training and supplementation but you'll also be armed with your own filter to determine what sorts of Health Protocols are actionable for you before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is matina matina makes loose leaf and ready to drink yerbamate yerbamate has long been my preferred source of caffeine not just because it tastes great and provides that stimulant effect that caffeine provides for focus and alertness but it's other many benefits that are unique to Y bate such as regulating blood sugar high antioxidant content and it can improve digestion and of course course I drink yerbamate because I simply love the taste while there are a lot of different choices out there in terms of yerbamate drinks my personal favorite is matina yerbamate because it's made with the highest quality organic ingredients and it has a very rich but clean taste and given maa's Great Taste and commitment to Quality I recently became a part owner in the company and I've helped design some of their drink products in particular I love the taste of maa's canned zero sugar C Brew y bam mate which has a slight Taste of lemon and I personally help develop that drink I drink two cans of matina yamate C Brew in the morning and I often drink a third can in the early afternoon if you'd like to try matina you can go to drink maa.com huberman right now matina is offering a free one pound bag of loose leaf yerbamate tea and free shipping with the purchase of two cases of their C Brew yerbamate again that's drink maa.com huberman to get a free bag of yerbamate loose leaf tea and free shipping you can also find matina at all sunlife locations and aroan location so please be sure to look for it both at sunlife and at Awan today's episode is also brought To Us by eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity now I've spoken many times before in this podcast about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts of quality sleep each night one of the best ways to ensure a great night's sleep is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3° eight sleep makes it incredibly easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment by allowing you to program the temperature of your mattress cover at the beginning middle and end of the night I've been sleeping on an eights Sleep mattress cover for well over 3 years now and it has completely transformed my sleep for the better eight sleep recently launched their newest generation pod cover the Pod 4 ultra the Pod 4 ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity higher Fidelity sleep tracking technology and it also has snoring detection that remarkably will automatically lift your head a few degrees to improve your air flow and stop your snoring if you'd like to try an eightsleep mattress cover you can go to 8sleep.com huberman to save $350 off their pod 4 ultra eight sleep currently ships to the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by m Nei venison Maui Nei venison is the most nutrient-dense and delicious red meat available I've spoken before on this podcast about the fact that most of us should be seeking to get about one gram of quality protein per pound of body weight every day that protein provides critical building blocks for things like muscle repair and synthesis but also promotes overall health given the importance of muscle as an organ eating enough quality protein each day is also a terrific way to Stave off hunger one of the key things however is to make sure that you're getting enough quality protein without ingesting excess calories mauii venison has an extremely high quality protein to calorie ratio such that getting that 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight is both easy and doesn't cause you to ingest an excess amount of calories also Maui Nei venison is absolutely delicious they have venison steaks ground venison and venison bone broth I personally like and eat all of those in fact I probably eat a mauii venison Burger pretty much every day and occasionally I'll swap that for a Maui Nei steak and if you're traveling lot or simply on the go they have a very convenient Maui Nee venison jerky which has 10 gam of quality protein per stick at just 55 calories while Maui Nei offers the highest quality meat available their supplies are limited responsible population management of the access deer on the island of Maui means that they will not go beyond Harvest capacity signing up for a membership is therefore the best way to ensure access to their highquality meat if you'd like to try Maui Nei venison you can go to mauii venison docomond to get 20% off your membership or first order again that's mauii Venison docomo and now for my discussion with Dr Lane Norton Dr Lane Norton welcome back thanks for having me back before we jump in I want to get your stance on what constitutes evidence because I think a big reason why you are considered one of the if not the most trusted person in the realm of nutrition and training is that you set a very high bar for what you consider science-based fact that motivates action so to just kind of break this down based on my read of the landscape online it seems that there's a group of people I don't know what to call them purists or something who unless there's a randomized controlled trial so that means Inhumans or several that points in a particular direction they are very unlikely to adopt a new practice say removing a given food or nutrient adding a given food or nutrient training a certain way not training a certain way okay that's one group then there are the people who if they are told something could be of value they hear it's worked very well for somebody maybe they see some before and afters and it gets mapped to a mechanism that EX in humans and animals like oh there's this molecule and if this molecule increases um X Y and Z happens and training in this way or reading this way increases that molecule for instance but no randomized control trial then they're willing to try it or adopt it and then there's a third probably a fourth category as well where people say they don't trust science anyway science is flawed or the the controls required to design a really good experiment are so constrained that they don't mimic the real world well enough and so they're really just interested in what works so they look to people that seem to have achieved the results they want feel free to add another group but which group would you consider yourself in personally and then where does your evidence that you put out uh online and today come from and I already know the answer to the last question but I think it was important to kind of spell out the landscape so everything you just mentioned would fall into the category of evidence everything that we can obser deserve is evidence but I think what people really struggle with is the idea of different levels of quality of evidence and if I had to put myself into a group I have definitely been on the side of well there's a case study in this journal and we're going to try that now because it must work and or you know my friend tried this and and they said it worked so I'm going to try it and then I've also gone to the group of well there's no human randomized control trial so I don't believe it and I think now you know I'm 42 now and I've been doing this for two decades I think where I'd fall into is it really depends on how the individual is talking about the evidence okay so you as you can probably imagine I get sent a lot of stuff for people to like oh debunk this and a lot of times people will send me things and I'll go hey this person said this is their opinion it that's fine like I may disagree with their opinion but I like I'm not going to like rake them over the C for them saying this is an opinion or this is my personal experience that's evidence it's lowquality evidence but it is evidence I think I kind of fall in a a line of I ideally want to see human randomized control trials but there's also as you mentioned practical limitations with how things are implemented and I think one of the things that gave me a very unique perspective was the fact that I was doing my PhD nutrition after I did a bachelor's in Biochemistry so I had that mechanistic understanding and then I had a an absolutely wonderful PhD adviser Don Layman who just shout out to him got a Lifetime Achievement Award by the American Society of nutrition 20 years too late but uh he was just incredible at being able to understand the small things but how they impacted the big things and what it looked like overall it's like a conductor looking at a symphony right and understanding how the trumpet sounds affects everything else but then not getting so tied up in that that he can't hear all the music right and he was so good at that and was so good at getting me to think that way and so I think where people out in the landscape trying to dissimilate this really struggle is they don't really know well this person decided to study and they equate that as evidence that's equal with any other evidence right and as a researcher you know not all evidence is created equal not all Journal articles are created equal and I mean honestly people who don't have research background it's hard to unpack this stuff so what I would say is you have to be very careful with people who cite studies and one of the things I'll say too is there's nothing more dangerous than somebody who's read a biochemistry book because they're going to see pathway biochemical pathway there must be an outcome so out outcomes are what we really care about right at the end of the day and when I say outcomes uh gaining muscle mass losing fat Mass um risk of cardiovascular disease insulin sensitivity cancer right these are hard outcomes right and those outcomes are the summation of dozens if not hundreds if not thousands of biochemical Pathways all summing up up to an outcome and just because something has a biochemical pathway doesn't mean it will create an outcome but if there's an outcome there's absolutely a mechanism to explain it now let me give you an example of why this stuff can be so complicated and why it's so easy for people to if you want to create a narrative you can always find a study to create a narrative aspirin we would agree is an anti-coagulant um there's a reason they give it to patients who are at risk for heart disease or a heart attack it's because it reduces blood clots reduces coagulation it also activates procoagulant Pathways but the overall outcome is anti-coagulation but if I wanted to create a narrative that aspirin was bad for blood clots I could say We'll look at these biochemical Pathways it activates and you see this like for example I could create a narrative that smoking is not bad for you okay I I remember reading a meta analysis of the effect of smoke smoking on the risk of adental carcinoma right and there's a force plot with probably about 50 studies and most of those studies are to the very far right of the line which is increases risk and I think the overall effect was like 3 or 400% increased risk of adenocarcinoma but there were two studies that were to the left of the line not by much and it wasn't statistically significant but I could say hey look I could cite these two studies pmid um you know they showed no increased risk of idental carcinoma actually might be slightly protective and by the way did you know that smoking decreases the risk of Parkinson's by 30 to 40% and by the way that's very consistent in literature yeah that's true so I can start creating this narrative that Smoky but we know smoking is not good for you it's not good for you raise the risk of lung cancer all different kinds of cancers uh cardiovascular disease massive increase in Risk right but I could you I could thread the needle of science using using these cherry-picked studies and so what I'll tell people is if I go into a topic or if I go into something what I'm looking for highest quality of evidence is first off do we have some meta analyses on this topic right you want to just explain for the general listener what a metaanalysis is just in kind of top Contour absolutely so a metaanalysis is basically where you're trying to compile studies that ask similar questions and look at what is the overall effect do we have a consensus in the literature and usually they they're going to show some kind of force plot of all these studies and however far right or left of the center line is kind of giving you an idea of how powerful the effect was in that study and then you can see the confidence intervals in terms of how much V variability there was and then you can see the thickness of the dot on there which shows how much it contributed to the overall uh analysis by usually how many subjects were in it right one study with 10 subjects would have a very small dot compared to a subject with 500 subjects exactly and so you're trying to now you can do a bad meta analysis based on inclusion criteria you know and that's where it's important to look at but let me give you an example of a meta analysis I cite pretty frequently um the inclusion criteria is very important to make sure that you answer the question that you want to answer and I say this when you're reading scientific studies I'm like listen just because there's a headline in even a paper just because the conclusion says something that is the author's opinion okay you need to check to see did they actually test what they're talking about and are the tests they use valid right so this meta analysis was looking at low lower carb diets versus higher carb diets or low fat diets and the inclusion criteria this was done by Kevin Hall the NIH back in 2017 I want to say and I I thought he did a great job at the inclusion criteria which was we're only going to include controlled feeding trials where the food is provided to participants because obviously we know the limitations of you know Free Living studies with nutrition right self-report people sneak people forget yeah we are going to make sure that these studies equated calories for the reasons we talk about you got to compare apples to apples right so a lot of studies will come out saying fasting produce more fat loss low carb produce but then they didn't control calories and it's it's very likely these people just ate less so they controlled calories and they controlled protein which is also important because protein changes the composition of weight loss protein has a thermic effect uh protein increases lean mass retention so that can change how much fat you lose and I think that also had a requirement of like a minimum of four weeks right and the outcome was looking at changes in fat Mass not fat oxidation not energy expenditure it actually looked at the outcome that they cared about and they they showed no difference right so I thought well that's a very well done metaanalysis because the inclusion criteria make a lot of sense for the question that they want to answer which is not is one diet easier to stick to not is it um you know more practical the question was mechanically do these diets produce differences when we're comparing Apples to Apples in actual fat loss and the answer was no right so and and then when you look at the the other meta analyses that have been done they tend to kind of support that right so the first thing I'm going to look at is all right these meta analyses tend to be looked at as kind of the highest form of evidence right because you're compiling a bunch of different studies which listen we know there are bad studies that get done I think the amount of studies that get like just straight up faked is probably much lower than people think um but one hopes but yeah yeah I I would agree I think that um people make errors um I do think that a lot of quote unquote bad papers or let's just say false conclusions arise from um elimination of data that did not fit the person's uh desired outcome and the reason I say that is I think it's impossible to control for so you've got the student or postto doing the experiment the results don't come out the way they would have preferred and then they're you know let's just say I've observed before never in my laboratory fortunately but cases where people um come up with reasons why that particular experiment wasn't valid because you know the mice were initially sick or the drug the lot of drug that they used wasn't it was heading towards expiration they come up with reasons to exclude MH rather than outright data fabrication where people literally create results that aren't there yeah um and you know and there are a number of different examples throughout history that where people have done that but I like to think that those are more rare I think that's probably pretty small my experience is the same as you I didn't see much of that or I never saw it observed uh usually end up reading about that in the form of retractions right in journals that come out nowadays more close to the Publications because of ai's ability to scan images and things of that sort yeah I I think um you know usually if I see a paper and the conclusion like just straight up I go oh I don't know about that when I go in and I read the methods and I read how they analyzed it and I read how they measured things 99% of the time I walk away and go okay okay it's not I'm not surprised they found what they found right because again a lot of and this does happen and it shouldn't but a lot of studies are set up to kind of find what people want to find you can bias things in a certain way well and what nobody talks about where it's not discussed enough is that a lot of times the way the paper is written poses a question after the results are in I mean I mean and this is a this is a a really a not correct way to do science I mean in clinical trials one has to wage a hypothesis excuse me wager a hypothesis from the outset and you go test that hypothesis you're not asking a question say what you're going to measure right exactly whereas in more typical laboratory science people will design an experiment they have hypothesis but then depending on how the experiments work out or don't work out often times they'll change the question they'll modify the hypothesis and one wouldn't as a reader as a journal as a as a reviewer one will never know and so that that's a that's a slight of hand that is I would say unfortunately is very common in B science but I will say like there's very rarely I say this was a bad study often what I'll say is you know I don't agree with their conclusion based on their data and their design um but the data is the data you know I I was just very fortunate again sh to my PhD adviser I have so much gratitude because he just right away was like hey I'm good with I'm if we're wrong about something that's fine you know and I I'll give you an example of how results can seem to conflict but um you know how things are designed we actually wanted to test does protein quality make a difference and we wanted to look at it at like not low but like just kind of like RDA levels of protein um and we saw that protein quality did make a difference at those levels of protein but if you look at experiments where people are feeding like high levels of protein like 1.6 to two grams per kilogram of body weight you don't really see much difference in you know lean mass or protein synthesis with looking at different protein sources well that's because it's much more regulatory on a low end because you're closer to those thresholds that trigger that signaling and so you know we wanted to show at that level that it made a difference but then we also acknowledged okay at this level it probably doesn't make as much of a difference but people can read those things and say well I don't believe studies because they're conflicting but no when you read how it was designed I can easily set like I remember there was a somebody sent me a study and said well how does this fit with your data which they were comparing Rice versus whey protein and found that both stimulated protein synthesis to the same degree and I said well they used 40 grams of protein like if you get protein high enough you can max out protein synthesis regardless of the of the form of protein you're using and so that's just like one of those examples right so when I'm looking through this stuff I'm looking at okay does there seem to be a consensus in the data and then is it like in these met analyses does the inclusion criteria make sense and then if there's no real agreement amongst the uh metaanalyses then I'm looking at okay what do the most tightly controlled studies show like in the randomized control trials and then I'm kind of like basing opinion off that but you know you you know the the hierarchy of evidence the pyramid you got meta analysis systematic reviews randomized control trials you have cohort data epidemiology and then animal studies tend to get kind of lumped in together and then you got like case studies and so on and so forth right and so all that stuff is valid it's all valid I think where I spend a lot of time on social media is for example I'll give you a great example um someone saying well you don't want to eat cruciferous vegetables because they have isocyanates in them which can bind to iodine and that is going to impair your thyroid function lower your metabolic rate and cause you weight gain and so that's a that's a pathway that's a mechanism is it possible possible I suppose it is possible right that pathway does exist iodine is important for thyroid function isocyanates do bind to iodine you can take any food even organic food and you can find a compound in it that if you fed it in a high dose it would have weird effects right and so the question is not if you eat something are there compounds in it that maybe activate negative biochemical Pathways the question is what is the overall outcome and so when these pathways are promoted versus let's see if we actually have randomized control trials in humans that measure what we actually care about and so we do have like in that particular case we have randomized control trials looking at okay cruciferous vegetable intake and thyroid function and there's no difference in the outcome and so what that says and then no difference in BMR and then actually people who eat more crucifer vegetabl actually tend to be a little bit leaner but that could be a little bit healthy user bias and they probably just eat less calories because they're more satiated but it's certainly not going the opposite direction right and so the point is again if an outcome exists there is absolutely a mechanism to explain it but just because a mechanism exists does not mean you're going to produce an outcome and I got exposed to this very early because I cut my teeth on the bodybuilding message boards back in the day where it was a bunch of you know nerds arguing with each other mostly who had no background arguing but there were some actual like sports scientists and professors who would get on those every once in a while this was before social media existed and I remember I was in Biochemistry class this is 2003 and they're talking about how caffeine inhibits glycogen phosphor which is a mechanism and it exists caffeine inhibits glycogen phosphor and so I I made this post where I on the forums and I said well we should be having caffeine after a workout then because it'll help with glycogen resynthesis because it'll keep you know glycogen phosphor from breaking down glycogen and somebody came in and said you're really like zooming in on a blade of grass instead of zooming out and looking at the Forest right and biochemists I was guilty of this and biochemist by trade we get very focused on Pathways but if you think about what caffeine does overall activates the sympathetic nervous system it it it's its function is to like you're liberating fuel like you and and some people when they take caffeine actually have a rise in blood glucose so that is the outcome is actually counter to what that biochemical pathway is and so we've got to be really careful with how we promote these biochemical Pathways I mean I did a really funny post on Twitter where uh myself and Joseph zundell I'm not sure if you're familiar with him but he's a a cancer biologist great guy Y and we were joking back and forth I said you know what I bet I could like come up with a uh a pathway to get people to eat poop like I could make a compelling argument for just eating poop and then he goes goes I'll bet I he's like I'll take that bet I'm like okay let's give it a shot so I'm like what is the some of the most common compounds in human feal matter and one of them is butyrate Right which is a short chain fatty acid produced by um fermentation butyrate so I I did this post where I'm like here's why you should eat poop to lose fat butyrate increases fat oxidation I think it activates Brown fat increases insulin sensitivity decreases inflammation it's been shown to actually amarate uh the development of obesity in um the in studies and I cited all these PBM ideas now what I didn't didn't tell people was those are all mostly in rodents right and it's giving an amount of butyrate that You' need to eat about 50 to 100 pounds of fecal matter a day in order to get right is sounding like a worse and worse idea by the moment but that is very similar to a lot of the content that is out there which is find isolated compound scare people or promote it to be the best thing ever and then link it to an outcome and then sometimes you can tie an epidemiology with it as well to support whatever you want but again like I'm not saying I do things in my training and my nutrition that don't have randomized control trials to support right they don't really have anything to support it's just it's how I how I've kind of fallen into doing things um so that's okay but what I wouldn't do is come out and say what I do is the best thing ever and here's why especially if there was human randomized control control trials to the counter that is the biggest thing right if we have human randomized control trials and they're going the opposite direction of a case study or an observation there's a reason human randomized control trials I scream about them all the time and why they're considered the gold standard of evidence when we look at cohort data you're just observing people there's no inter maybe explain what cohort data are is it comparing two groups sure so cohort data you're comparing groups but you're you're not having an intervention so you're tracking them over the course of over what period of time a lot of cohort studies like looking at cardiovascular disease cancer these people decided to be vegan these people decided to be uh let's just say omor those are some of the classic experiments right and there was they weren't assigned to this experiment they agreed to join the experiment they've been eating this way for a while right you ask them a bunch of questions and you look at okay over 10 years over 20 years who gets whatever more often or less often right and then we try to figure out and about calculate okay what's the effect and is this real the problem is you're you have a lot of bias with those sorts of studies meaning people don't do single habits they don't isolate habits uh I was I actually put up a real the other day from my appearance on Steven Bartlett's podcast where he said if I want to fix my diet I go to the gym because a lot of people do that if they're training in the gym they don't want to waste their effort by having a subpar diet now in reality eating a healthy diet is more important if you're not going to the gym right because at least you're getting something but people do this habit coupling and so it's really hard to disentangle those sorts of things now the reason that human randomized control trials are important is if you're designing an experiment and you randomize what you are doing by randomly assigning people to groups you're washing out that bias because you can assume that whatever in inent characteristics that might be coupled to whatever you're going to try are going to be randomly distributed and evenly distributed across the groups therefore we say human randomized control trials are kind of what's needed to establish causation because by randomizing you can assume whatever differences are observed between the groups are due to your treatment and not due to random chance or data artifacts now randomized control trials especially nutrition have very strong limitations which is you you can't do a randomized control trial for 30 years you can't I mean I think the longest randomized control trial I heard about nutrition is like two years long right and even then it's not going to be a very tightly controlled randomized control trial I mean and if you're doing if you're talking about like the tightest level of control like a metabolic W study four six weeks maybe because you're keeping people in food jail and I think where some of this confusion comes from is I think people think that there's just like this pool of people waiting around to be selected for experiments like yes I'm ready I've been waiting here no there are people like you like me like just the average person walking down the street who saw a flyer and goes okay I'll volunteer for that and the more control you try to establish over their lives the less likely they are to do it and you probably got to pay them you know I don't know anybody who would do a metabolic W study without getting paid for it I mean you're basically giving up four or six weeks of your life to go do that and so while I love human randomized control trials for some things they're not always appropriate for example if you're trying to look at heart disease and you want to do a one-year human randomized control trial looking at say you know saturated fat LDL cholesterol those sorts of things well how many people have heart attacks within one year after age 60 I mean it's going to be a really you're going to look for really small differences between really small numbers right and the problem with that is you have no idea about their diet 40 years leading up to that and we know based on now the melan randomization trials that the risk of LDL is more of like a lifetime exposure risk it's not just in this narrow sliver of time and so I love human randomized control trials but it's also I try to tell people never turn your brain off just because something gets published in a certain Journal just because a certain researcher said something just because uh it was a certain design it doesn't make it infallible okay science is perfect science science is perfect science is what is but it's done by humans and humans are fallible imperfect people with their own personal beliefs and biases and that's why I look at consensus of data first because yeah you could maybe some of experiments got faked or maybe they had but when it's done over let's take something like creative monohydrate right you have thousands of experiments done over Decades of time in hundreds of different Labs with many different funding sources in bunch of different countries under a bunch of different conditions it works right like if you go to consensus and you type in does creatin build muscle it's like 92% yes right which is crazy right consuming 5 to 10 grams of creatine monohydrate per day is going to benefit strength and muscle mass and likely cognition to some extent yeah yeah I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor ag1 by now many of you have heard me say that if I could take Just One supplement that supplement would be ag1 the reason for that is ag1 is the highest quality and most complete of the foundational nutritional supplements available what that means is that it contains not just vitamins and minerals but also probiotics prebiotics and adaptogens to cover any gaps you may have in your diet and provide support for a demanding life for me even if I eat mostly Whole Foods and minimally processed foods which I do for most of my food intake it's very difficult ult for me to get enough fruits and vegetables vitamins and minerals micronutrients and adaptogens from food alone for that reason I've been taking ag1 daily since 2012 and often twice a day once in the morning or midm morning and again in the afternoon or evening when I do that it clearly bolsters my energy my immune system and my gut microbiome these are all critical to brain function mood physical performance and much more if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim their special offer right now they're giving away five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman to claim that special offer I realize I've been on a long diet tribe no no this is It's I I wouldn't even call it a diet tribe I think for those listening like this is pure gold because never before certainly on this podcast or other podcasts has anyone ever really spelled out how to discern differences in quality of evidence right and every it's mostly a free world most places uh and people can do what they want but I think they need to decide what their thresholds are for Quality yeah and uh I think the one other thing I'll tell people is I saw this the other day I saw somebody post I think it was a comment on one of my post I actually commented back they said you know I just I know I can trust you and I just whatever you say I know it I can take it to the bank and I said I appreciate that but I am a flawed human like anybody else please don't turn your brain off like and one of the things I've really tried to do now in this stage of my career is I want to teach people how to think because if I just give you the information and I'm giving you a fish great but I'd rather you understand how I came to these conclusions you can see my logic and how it tracks and then you can start applying that elsewhere one of the things I say to people is I'm like if you want a quick and dirty back for knowing who to follow try not to listen so much to exactly the information people say but listen to how they say it okay I was just telling you I was on a podcast the other day where I said you know here's this study um I might butcher the details and if I get the math wrong if uh experts out there want to comment and correct me please do that like that is a way of talking about something where you're saying hey I could get this wrong or hey I might be uncertain that's very different than saying you know just hard pure you know real experts don't really talk like best worst always never like they don't really use words like that um and one of my favorite phrases that I tell people it's actually from an economist named Thomas Soul he said there are no Solutions there are only trade-offs and for for example um you know there's data out there that if you lower saturated fat it may lower your testosterone but there's also data out there that that saturated fat raises LDL which is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease okay well there's trade-offs there right like what do you value more I would argue that probably the decline in testosterone isn't really physiologically meaningful for most people but again there's there's not a good or bad there's trade-offs and I think when people get talking about biochemical Pathways one of the things I I really try to hone in on it's like hey there's not there not really good or bad biochemical Pathways either like all these things exist for a reason like people like one of the things popular is like well inflammation inflammation I'm like hey you know like inflammation does some things that we really need too like you just don't want like no inflammation like it's actually important physiological process right now you don't want it to run away for sure and so again I I just give my PhD adviser a lot of credit of he's like know what you know but always question everything even the things we feel most fundamentally are true cuz that is the job of a good scientist and I'll give you one more story and we'll move to another thing when I did my first experiment well actually sorry no this has been like my 15th experiment cuz my first 14 blew and didn't work um a typical graduate career yeah yeah and again very patient man very supportive I I I honestly cannot give him enough credit um and if you look at the the people that came out of that lab a lot of studs um so I I did a uh an experiment looking at whey protein or sorry complete meal with wayy protein ingestion and how long the duration of muscle protein synthesis was because we most people kind of measured at 60 or 90 minutes like the the snapshot post prand for protein synthesis looking for a peak and we're like is that really where the peak is we don't know we're we're basing this off of a purified Solutions so let's do a duration experiment right and my hypothesis was well however long bline is elevated in the blood is going to be how long protein synthesis stays up and when we got the data back on protein synthesis protein synthesis had come up peaked at 90 minutes and by 3 hours had come back down to Baseline and I went to run the plasma Amo acids and I'm like okay well this is what we're going to see and that's not what we saw so plasma amino acids not only were still elevated they were like maxed out or plateaued at the highest they would level they would be at 3 hours where protein synthesis was back to Baseline and so I said okay well it's got to be mour signaling intour signaling is got to be turning off or something's happening nope inor signaling was still elevated right um and we saw this through phosphorilation of The Binding protein 4 ebp1 which is a proxy for mtor Activation um and then I said okay well maybe Lucine isn't getting into the cell maybe that's why so we looked at intracellular Lucine followed the exact path of plasma Lucine and so then I kept rerunning the plasma data over and over I probably ran it five times right and Layman finally calls me into his office one day and he goes so where do we stand with this duration experiment and I said yeah it's almost done I just I I got to run the data again because the plasma data has got to be wrong and he he I saw his like little eyebrow go up you know and he goes why do you think that let me see your data he goes your standard air bars are good this looks to be relatively tight data um how's your Tech and I'm going through like how I you know all the steps of to analyze plaso acids it's not like CSI by the way everybody you don't just like take a pipet put something in a cuge and all a sudden you get back data there's a there's many steps in here um and so I I showed them all that and he goes you know it sounds like you are trying to get the data to fit your conclusion and what you need to do is change your conclusion to fit the data and that one line again it just opened my whole world up to one I if I'm wrong okay cool like I care more about getting the right answer than being right and that's why we were talking earlier I'm like there's so much stuff that I just don't believe I want to see 10 20 studies before I go yeah you know and the other thing I'll tell people is hey I don't plant my flag real strong very often so when you see me do it I'm not saying I'm not not fallible but if you see me do it you probably should pay attention cuz I don't usually do that I love that description but now my curiosity is peak and you got to tell me so if 90 minutes after ingesting protein protein synthesis Peaks and then it drops to Baseline at 3 hours but lucing one of the key amino acids in mtor which is in the pathway of cellular growth and protein synthesis are still elevated 3 hours what is the conclusion that explains the discrepancy yeah so we actually looked for this for years um so a few things there was some other studies that supported that uh we called it a refractory response actually we didn't name it that there was another lab named it that basically that protein synthesis was becoming refractory to the signal for protein synthesis so Ju Just for real quick I'm going to try and explain this easily so protein synthesis you know this sounds like probably a very abstract thing but it's how you make your body makes more protein and whether it's in skeletal muscle whether it's in the liver whatever you have your DNA which is your genetic code right and then that gets transcribed to an mRNA by the way I'm leaving out a lot of steps here but just bear with me that mRNA gets translated by a ribosome into a polypeptide chain or a protein so a ribosome is basically attaching to the MRNA and then based on the MRNA sequence is bringing in amino acids to match that sequence so all the proteins in your body are coded for in your DNA right so when it comes to to this process there's a complex called eif4f which acts as a scaffold for the ribosome to hook on to the MRNA and e4f the formation of it is basically rate limited by the Association of two proteins called eif4e and eif4g and eif4e is bound by a binding protein for ebp1 and when you stimulate when Lucine stimulates him Tor intor stimulates the phosphorilation of 4 bp1 which makes it unavailable for binding with e4e it combined to eif4g that eif4f complex can be made brings the ribosome onto the MRNA and now it can read it can translate it so there's a little uh cellular biology lesson if people didn't follow that um don't worry about it what Lan's describing is that the presence of a bunch of molecules involved in protein synthesis is necessary but not sufficient for the protein synthesis right a few other things have to happen and apparently those other things are not happening after 120 minutes so another lab called it the the muscle full effect basically the the idea is like once you've initiated that signal it kind of runs and then it's done right and just pounding more amino acids into the system is not going to further stimulate in fact there was a there was a study done back in I think it was 2001 by I want to say by renie um another very well-known protein lab and they infused essential amino acids for six hours and looked at scal muscle protein synthesis and they found it went up and then came back down by by two hours and then never went back up right good experiment yeah very interesting so we looked at a bunch of different things the only thing we found that perhaps explained it a little bit and I'm sure there's other labs that would argue with me on this and and again this is in Rat skeletal muscle which by the way is a good model for human protein metabolism but still we looked at at intercellular ATP levels and actually found that they were declining kind of in concert with the decline in muscle protein synthesis and muscle protein synthesis is an ATP dependent process but the the process of protein turnover is energetically expensive it's one of the reasons that protein has a higher thermic effect of food and so our hypothesis was perhaps by the effect of protein stimulating protein synthesis to start this Machinery is inter i al expensive enough that eventually you kind of run out of steam and so you have the signal there but it just kind of ends right now there have been other experiment like Jordan trlin just published a paper a few months ago that got a bunch of you know you know feedback 100 grams of protein after a m after a resistance training exercise and saw you know that it was basically like a lot more of it was used than we thought would be used right because for many decades it has been purported believed and propagated that the maximum amount of protein that you can utilize after a meal is 30 grams you became the the holy number and this study essentially showed that more than 30 grams can be used yeah not just as energy but for the sake of protein synthesis in muscle correct yeah and it and how did that study land with you given that it's one study without going into all the details I did did that inspire you to change anything about your protein intake after training so what I tell people is I don't make big shifts in my opinions based on single studies yeah why does that not surpris me it shimmy it shimmies me a little bit right so and what even before that study came out what I had said is I think protein distribution matters but I think it matters much much less than total protein intake per day because all we need to do is look at some of these resistance training studies with intermittent fasting where people are eating all their protein in an 8 Hour window and theoretically you would think they would get less muscle growth especially based on this refractory data because less times to stimulate um but at least in the studies out of Grant Tinsley's lab we I think there's two studies that were very well done where we don't see that now important to point out they trained during their feing window and they had three they made sure they ate three high quality high protein meals during that eight hour time right so at least in that context there was no difference in the amount of lean mass gained between intermittent fasting groups versus continuous feeding groups now and in the continuous feeding groups the uh do you recall what duration they were eating their meals over was it probably 12 hours or so I I don't recall specifically but I I don't recall an actual defined time I'd have to go back more than eight hours for sure you know I'm so glad we're Landing here because my first um let's just call it sort of operational or actionable question which came from um uh you know asking on social media for questions for you was um many many people if not in the thousands asked how to make sure that they're getting enough protein if they're doing something like intermittent fasting and I myself fall into this category um I don't do it for any specific purpose this was long before sain Panda started doing his work on Tim restricted feeding AKA intermittent fasting but I don't tend to want to eat any food until about 11:00 a.m. right occasionally I wake up hungry like this morning and I had you know some eggs was particularly hungry but that's I think that's representative of a lot of people I want hydration and caffeine in the morning I want a train in the morning and then I want to eat pretty soon after I train but what that means is that I'm eating in during an 8 to n hour right feeding window and if I only manage two meals in there and a snack and I can only assimilate or excuse me I can only uh put 30 gram of protein per meal toward protein synthesis we have to be careful not about using it for energy but protein synthesis does that mean that I'm not going to hit my uh Target of one gram of protein per pound of desired lean body mass because I'm 100 kilograms I weigh about 220 PBS I can easily eat 220 grams of protein in a 9h hour period like give me three ribey I'll eat all three I love ribeye steak right but the question is can I use that so and I'm going to bring this back around to that particular experiment so over time and and when I left grad school my position was that it matters protein distribution matters so I'll give you the straight down the line scientific answer and then I'll give you if you inject me with true serum what I really think answer um and in so we did an experiment again in rats uh we fed them uh completely same diets same total calories protein carbs fats but uh in one group they got that pretty much evenly across three meals and the other group 70% of their protein was coming at their last meal and then the other two meals for like 15% protein 15% of their daily protein and 11 weeks again 11 weeks out of a rat's life rodents live 18 to 24 months um that's a big chunk of their life right and we did see about a five to 10% difference in the weights of the hind limbs uh in terms of muscle mass okay in what direction uh favoring equal distribution right now again hard to repeat that study in humans right and for the duration it's done so I came out saying you know what that's actually less than I thought we were going to I thought we're going to find bigger differences than that you know because I mean if you're thinking about number of times you're stimulating protein synthesis I mean one per day versus three per day I mean shouldn't there be like a pretty significant difference there and it was I mean it reached the level of significance but again I I thought the effect size was smaller than I thought and so I kind of walked out saying you know what total protein intake is the most important thing per day and then if you can distribute it relatively evenly that's maybe the last five to 10% right and you've seen some human studies where it seems to matter most seem to show it doesn't M really matter that much here's here's what I think if you're measuring an outcome like lean mass that doesn't change much in 8 weeks unfortunately it's very small differences and so I think it's going to be hard to detect that but what I'll tell people is can't if you asking can you build muscle intermittent fasting absolutely can you build a lot of muscle probably if you are a bodybuilder specific population or if your goal is to be the most muscular strongest human being you can possibly become I think you're probably better off not doing intermittent fasting just because those last that last 5% may make a big difference and you're never going to be able to pick that out of a human randomized control trial in eight weeks at least I don't think you will and so again I don't have any human data to really back that up but just based on what I know about signaling and the effects we saw on animals that's kind of a recommendation but most people don't fall in that category most people are just worried about hey I want to look good build a little bit of muscle intermittent fasting is perfectly fine tool for doing that I will say you know obviously we haven't studied some of the more extreme forms of fasting in terms of building muscle right like the 168 has been studied but like I'm thinking of a study that was done without resistance training alternate day fasting versus continuous kind of normal feeding one day no eating next day eat right so they did brutal or at least for somebody like me I can't think of anything worse I'd rather fast for three days in a row and then eat for you know four days in a row simply because I know that by day two it's probably going to get easier not not hard but on off fasting eating's got to be just torturous so the way they did it was they did um The Continuous group gr was getting 75% of their maintenance calories per day so in a deficit and then the alternate da group was doing 150% and then zero right so you're getting an average of 75 and they actually saw differences in lean mass at the end of that study the continuous feeding group uh lost less lean mass than the alter day fasting group so what that's only one study and it didn't have resistance training it's possible that resistance training could attenuate some of that stuff but what I'll say is you know the more extreme forms of fasting probably aren't optimal for a lean mass right also can you imagine training complet on a day of complete fasting after three hours after that you're going to be dying you can say well you could just train on the days when you eat but then if you ever train legs hard which I know you do or if anyone does and then the next day you're not going to eat anything right the day after training legs properly I'm my appetite's increased yeah so I think this is where the rubber kind of meets the road in terms of straight down the line the randomized control trials say this but I still do something a little bit different right uh because the randomized control Tri say protein distribution doesn't really seem to matter right but again you inject me with true serum I think it probably does matter a little bit right now does it matter as much as total protein absolutely not uh that is by far the biggest lever but again if my context is I want to become the most muscular strongest human being I can be which I do because that's where I compete um I'm going to distribute my protein probably over four to five meals per day right and so for you just personally uh what what time of day do you wake up and when's your first meal so well it's summer right now so kids are off of school so we're usually getting up around like 7:30 8:00 in the morning and um my first meal is usually within an hour um and then I usually eat within an hour of going to bed then I'll have two or three meals in between those so I usually I have about four meals a day um sometimes I'll have five if it's just a longer day or just how my timing kind of goes or whatever and does each one of your meals include approximately 30 plus grams of quality protein some starchy carbohydrate fibrous carbohydrate and and some fat I mean sometimes they end up being like mostly protein or or whatnot but for the most part there's a mix in each one um and usually around 50 grams of protein at a meal I eat about 235 grams of protein a day some people would argue that oh that's more than you need the research is shown that 1 Point six gam per kg maxes out the response here's the thing and again this is where like scientific experiments are big blunt instruments okay they will tell you what not to do more often than they will tell you what to do okay when it comes to protein my personal opinion and this is just I guess a little bit of intuition based off of 20 years of studying this stuff is that I don't know if there's an actual amount of protein that maxes out the protein synthesis response I would bet if I was a betting man that it's kind of an ASM toope you're familiar with Y so your not everyone's watching I just drew an ASM toop um an ASM toot plot but for those not watching just think about a um a plot quickly Rising very very high and then essentially stays stable at the high level yeah um maybe with a slight bit of taper yeah so it's it's so it's easy to explain if it's going towards zero so an absm toope might be okay you start out you have 10 then five then two and a half okay so you're running in the opposite direction still ASM toope going from high to low so asmt can go from low to high can go from high to low correct so I'm I'm trying to explain it because it makes more sense when people kind of go this way you never reach zero but it keeps getting incrementally closer on the other end I don't think protein synthesis ever maxes out I just think the increment of increase becomes so small that practically there's no difference and you wouldn't see a difference in outcome right and so I think that you know one you know there's debate over is at one .6 G per kg 2.4 G per kg I I and there's even been a meta regression that showed up to 3.3 G per kg had benefits I think a lot of this is with protein synthesis you're looking for small differences between small numbers it's not a very sensitive analysis to be quite honest with you and again we would never be able to pick out those differ I'm thinking about there was a study by Stu Phillips who if people don't know who Stu Phillips is this is he's the best researcher going in protein metabolism right now um but one of the best sorry I don't want to take anybody off um and he he did a study probably 15 years ago where they gave uh people different levels of egg protein and they looked at 5 10 20 and 40 grams of egg protein and their conclusion was that 20 grams of egg protein maximized the protein synthesis response but that's because straight down the line if there's a P value of more than 05 you you can't say there's a difference right but if you looked at the absolute difference between 20 and 40 G I think it was like 11% and if you look at the the the graph it almost looks like the start of an ASM toope right now this was one study wasn't a huge subject number but that's kind of where my personal thoughts land on it that there's that kind of also support this okay 100 grams at a meal you know could still be utilized um is I'm not sure if there's a max out I think there's a practical max out where you get to a point where hey you're like slamming down 50 grams more protein for 0.00001% more protein synthesis it doesn't make sense um but yeah we'll never be able to I I doubt we'll be able to pick those numbers out in actual scientific experiments and the other thing to keep in mind with this whole protein metabolism picture is we're really only talking about one side of this equation so net gain or loss of skeletal muscle mass is the balance between protein synthesis and protein degradation and most of us protein researchers just kind of stick our fingers in our ears and go la la la when it comes to protein degradation because it's so incredibly hard to measure and so yeah like when we start to put all that stuff together it's like now this picture gets really complicated so what I tell people when it comes to that kind of stuff is listen you could really get into the Weeds on this stuff the big rocks are about a ground per pound of body weight if you want to really for all intents and purposes max out the anabolic response you're going to be fine one gram per pound of body weight which is what Dr Gabrielle lion also essentially recommended right I'm probably like you know real sticklers might be like no it's actually more like 7 or 08 and then it's well it's actually based on lean mass which I agree with but just for all intents and purposes you could say you know your body weight ideal body weight whatever it is that number is is going to be very sufficient for maxing out muscle building for the majority of people and we should probably point out not just for muscle building um unless you disagree uh and feel free to of course not that I need to tell you that uh Dr Gabrielle lion uh when she was here made a really um key point which is that ingesting sufficient quality protein each day isn't just about building muscle even for folks that don't want to build muscle and perhaps even particularly for women who assume that um you know building muscle is it can be a runaway process that maybe they're going to build too much muscle that's a false false Assumption of course that ingesting one gram of protein per pound of body weight or ideal body weight is going to be beneficial because it's going to improve muscle quality one's own muscle quality the health of the muscular tissue and and then she did an excellent job of relating the health of muscular tissue skeletal muscle that is to overall Health and Longevity so I I just raise that because I know that many people listening to this probably want to add a little bit of muscle here or there um some perhaps want to keep the muscle they've gotten loose fat and some of course want to add a lot of muscle but it sounds like the recommendation is always the same since we need to eat sooner or later one gram of quality protein per pound of lean body mass or current body weight or desired body weight that's going to be a good starting Place yeah for sure and I I think I would tend to agree with her you know that the process because when you eat protein you're not just going to start laying down slabs of lean tissue just from eating protein there has to be a stimulus which is resistance training um or some people would argue you could stretch really hard and get the same thing which there may be some evidence of that with weights and lift them in between stretches no I'm just kidding which is basically weight lifting there actually are studies now where they like put people in like really kind of Hardcore stretching for you know several minutes and they actually see hypertrophy with it um yeah very interesting we could talk about those if you wanted but the the the the point is either way it's mechanical tension right so that's the that's the stimulus to build muscle to to lay down lean tissue um but the process of remodeling is probably beneficial for multiple reasons so when you eat protein like we said synthesis goes up degradation goes up right because you're stimulating that process you're stimulating protein turnover one that's that's relatively energetically expensive all things being equal so that's where the thermic effect of protein comes from uh CU people say well it's the Ura cycle and this and that most of those most of those atps you you get back in different phases of that cycle really I in my opinion the thermic effect of protein is due to like kind of activation of this futile cycle of You're Building more protein but then you're also breaking down more protein and so part of that is you are remodeling you are making sure that that protein is higher quality in that tissue by continuously breaking it down and building it back up and so I I would probably agree with that um and then it's it's again even if you're at a resistance training program where you're not really building much more muscle anymore the process of remodeling is probably good for you you know and I I would just say try to Ally some of these concerns um from people who are concerned about gaining too much muscle so I have been lifting really hard consistently for 25 years I am very comfortable saying I train harder than almost anybody else you can possibly imagine and anybody who has trained around me will back that up back me up in the comments I'm I train very hard and in a shirt I look like an athletic guy who lives I I don't look like a monster you know like you might see pictures of me when I was a bodybuilding show like very very lean and that looks you know over the top but for the most part I just look kind of athletic and I spent my entire adult life trying to get too big right so for most people unless you're on performance-enhancing drugs or you just have incredible genetics that's not going to happen and if it starts to happen just back off on your lifting easy fix so yeah I think most people's concern with that is is is a little bit misplace and the other thing I'll tell people is like hey some of these like Fitness like especially like for women a lot of these fitness models you follow they they show you certain workouts they do they built that physique by lifting weights right and you're you're thinking that's a ton feature now that person is actually pretty muscular right and so again especially for women there are exceptions some PE some women have very great genetics for building muscle they usually wind up in track and field that sort of thing but it's very hard to get too muscular for a woman and and what I'll say is like you know typically muscle look s good and fat is what makes you kind of look bulky you know so again I don't want to play it with too broad of a brush but I would say that you don't really have too much to worry about when it comes to to getting too muscular I'd like to take a brief break to thank one of our sponsors element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium in the correct ratios but no sugar now I and others on the podcast have talked a lot about the critical importance of hydration for proper brain and bodily function research shows that even a slight degree of dehydration can really diminish cognitive and physical performance it's also important that you get adequate electrolytes in order for your body and brain to function at their best the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium are critical for the functioning of all the cells in your body especially your neurons or nerve cells to make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of hydration and electrolytes I dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning and I drink that basically first thing in the morning I also drink element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing especially on hot days if I'm sweating a lot and losing water and electrolytes if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element.com huberman spelled drink LM nt.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with the purchase of any element drink mix again that's drink element.com huberman to claim a free sample pack since we're sort of in this realm of protein maybe we build out from there cuz I lot of questions related to um something uh akin to the following so okay so somebody strives to get uh one gram of quality protein per pound of body weight per day um and I realize that whether somebody follows a pseudo intermittent fasting thing where their first meal does you know around 11: and they end you they finish up eating around 8:00 p.m. or a more traditional eating schedule really is just the addition of one more meal like in the morning it's like whether or not you eat breakfast and of course some people will shift it the other way they start with breakfast and they don't eat dinner but um I would argue that in order to if you have kids or a social life of any kind the the most people can deal with um sitting across the table W with someone just having a cup of coffee for breakfast but it's sort of awkward you limit yourself a lot in life if you if you can't eat dinner with other people I don't know at least and that's and that's again where the rubber meets the road with what is practically doable because there's been some of these like circadian rhythm studies that suggest well maybe early Tim restricted feeding is better than late time restricted feeding the more high quality more rigorously controlled uh randomized control trials we're coming out now seems to show that it doesn't really make a big difference um and and some of the again the measurements you use matter right so there was actually a very recent study where they looked at 12 weeks they provided all the food to participants equal in protein calories the whole deal the only difference was one group was eating 80% of their calories before 100 p.m. and they had a 8h hour feed window in total the other group had a 12-hour feeding window and we're eating over 50% of their calories after 5 p.m. I want to say and so really like based on some of the the chrononutrition stuff we've seen from some of the Lesser well-rolled trials we were they were expecting to see differences in like glucose metabolism and whatnot and they just didn't really see a difference in anything and the only the I think the only thing they saw a little bit of a difference was was in fasting blood glucose and here's what I tell people when you see a difference in fasting blood glucose but not hba1c you're you're looking at a transient difference and and what I mean by that is hba1c is such a great measurement because it's a SP an area on hemoglobin that can be glycosilated and so that is very dependent on what is your overall concentration of glucose in the blood over a 24-hour period of time because it's exposed the entire time it's in your bloodstream so whether you're getting it you know glucose spikes at meals where you have higher fasting blood glucose it's going to be very reflective of the overall 24-hour area under the curve right so why did they see why do some of these studies see a little bit better Improvement in lowering fasting blood glucose whereas hba1c doesn't show up well think about it if somebody's early Tim restricted feeding and they finish most of their food intake before 1 p.m. they have an extra like six seven eight hours that they're not hardly eating anything it doesn't surprise me that the next morning because they've technically fasted for longer you have a lower blood glucose now I can't I can't really back this up straight up because nobody's ever me measured it but that I think is a logical explanation while you see some of this stuff and that's why I tell people you know the measurement you take really matters I think fasting blood glucose is a useful measurement but I put much more value on something like home IR um ug glycemic clamp or hba1c um so anyways I I think the early versus late time restricted is kind of doesn't doesn't matter too much great you answered a future question right there um see i' I've you're telepathic uhuh that's what you didn't know about them um the uh so so the the scenario here is whether or not meals are distributed evenly through the awake day or um stacked a little bit more toward the morning or stacked a little bit more toward the evening if somebody gets that one gram of quality protein per pound of body weight then they need to make up the rest of the calories with other stuff MH um and we have broadly speaking starches fibrous you know fruits and vegetables starches and of course fats right and weight gain and weight loss I think we both would agree is or weight maintenance is going to largely be dictated at this point by not you consume more calories than you burn or not so assuming somebody's getting that 1 gram of quality protein per pound of body weight is there any data that support or do you believe just by your own experience that there's some value in stacking the starchy carbohydrates toward the earlier part of the day versus the later part of the day and this has been an ongoing debate like I for instance like a nearly pure protein and fat meal for the first meal plus maybe a salad some fibrous carbohydrates and then as I get towards evening I like more starches and I actually taper off the protein I find personally that matches what I need to do with my brain I'm more alert when I'm drinking caffeine and hydrating on a backdrop of slightly lowered carbohydrates but then as I get towards evening taper off the caffeine of course for me because I want to sleep well start ingesting some more starches it's not starch heavy but I sleep like a baby but everyone would tell me and does tell me eating starches late in the day is going to make make me fat eating starches late in the day is going to do all sorts of terrible things I find the exact opposite for me so is there any real evidence that where one places their starches throughout the day matters and let's just forget resistance training for the moment because there is this posttraining window where I'll if I train first thing in the morning I will eat starches at that time but I'm let's just remove resistance training for for the moment so again we're rubber me to the road in practicality versus what Hardline research says um so I am not real convinced at all that it really matters when you eat your carbohydrate intake thank you thank you my goodness I knew I brought you here today for Reon no I brought here for many for many reasons but my bias has been validated I can leave now so I really try to get people focused on the stuff that matters the most right so this is if we're worried about carbohydrate timing even if there are differences we are zoomed way in on the blade of grass right we're not zooming out all the way and I think hey if somebody likes to eat more carbohydrate in the morning and that fits their lifestyle and that is easy for them to continue to do then I would would say do that and and could I add um in terms of not focusing on a blade of grass but something that I consider a major lever if eating fewer carbohydrates in the afternoon and evening doesn't impede your sleep then you're okay but I would argue if anything is interfering with your sleep on a consistent basis you've got a serious problem y so there are no Solutions only trade-offs right and when it comes to carbohydrate intake you'll hear people say the DAT is all over the place okay in terms of like timing and how people feel some people say well I feel sleepy after I have carbs some people have I feel great after I have carbs like I'm I'm ready to go lift I'm I I have a big carb meal before I go lift you know it seems to be all over the map now here's the thing what I'll tell people because people ask me how I eat people have wanted me to do a you know a full day of eating video and I've kind of put it off for a while because I'm like so much of the stuff I do I'm not gonna to give you guys a citation for you know and and I know you're gonna want it and some of the stuff I do because I just like doing it that way right like I I grew up in the era of bodybuilding magazines where they said you got to have a big carbohydrate intake and a big meal before you go training and a big meal after you train so guess what I did I got in the habit of eating like that and it still sticks to this day I don't try to tell people it's better doing it that way plenty of people have told me um hey I I don't feel good with a lot of my stomach when I go train or I if I have a carb heavy meal in the morning I feel tired the data doesn't really support that in terms of like you know on an average response but if you know that you feel that way then by all means avoid right like uh there's I remember one time I um so I used to go to massage therapist in Tampa who would do cupping and there's really no data to back up the efficacy of cupping is right yeah not much but she did it I like the way it felt and I'm like okay whatever so I I post a picture of me flexing one time you know and and there's the cut marks all over and everybody's like going crazy like how can you do this you're I'm like hey hey hey hey wait a second I never said this does this and I never made any claims about it she does it and I like the way it feels I'm not saying it does anything actually one of the things about being a scientist is like now I'm impossible to Placebo which is really annoying cuz I would love to be able to Placebo myself a little bit more cuz placebo effect is powerful it's powerful and it's one of the I was telling you earlier before we started filming I'm like it's one of the reasons I just don't believe a lot of stuff because I know how powerful the power of belief is I mean you had uh Sean Mackie on here your beliefs about pain change your pain like actually change how much pain you get it changes your pain experience so one of the things I've become big on recently is hey what happens in the mind affects the body and what happens in the body affects the mind so just because I don't have a randomized control trial to support something if we know the rcts don't say it's worse right then you do whatever you like right and I think a lot of people get been out of shape when I say well you know when they control the variables that need to be controlled there's no difference between intermittent fasting or just regular old calorie restriction or there's no difference between lowfat diets and high fat diets what people hear is low carb sucks intermittent fasting sucks he said they don't work no no no this is great this is great news for everybody it means you have all the tools at your disposal and you get to pick the one that fits in your lifestyle best because that is what makes the difference is what your overall lifestyle looks like and we have way too many people worrying about the minutia who just don't even exercise on a consistent basis or they don't sleep well on a consistent basis or they don't manage their psychological stress well or they try to be perfect with their nutrition then they fall off the deep end and what I'm saying is like no like be imperfect but be consistent with what you do right and so for you obviously carbs at night have not made you fat like I have eyeballs so we can just dispel that myth right now yeah I would say eating eating the way I eat now I'm leaner at 49 even than I was 10 years ago or 10 years before that I was pretty lean then and I don't put a ton of attention to uh tracking calories although and I want to be very very clear I this I was not paid to say this like I I've purchased and use Lane's carbon app he happens to be wearing a shirt that says carbon today but I've talked about this before on other on other podcasts and social media and uh it's absolutely true that I there's no endorsement relationship I but I love the app because that was really the first time probably since College because I started lifting when I was 16 running end lifting has always been my thing since I was 16 but um since college that I uh used a tool in this case carbon to um you know basically track what I'm eating like exactly what I'm eating and what I like about it is that I can just click on different boxes of things like it um within the app and really you know it makes it very easy say oh like I ate this thing that you know white rice from this package and like and it it generally knows products it knows Brands and it did a really good job of letting me check in and just see how many calories I was consuming how much protein how much fat and from what sources but one of the major takeaways that at least I got from carbon was that you can arrange your diet in any number of different ways in fact it has like a really nice little slider where you can put in um you know you want to eat more carbohydrates and less protein even or you want to have a vegetarian diet which I I don't I'm an omnivore I'm an omnivore my dad's Argentine I like I like meat I like meat in fact I don't even really like fish that much or chicken I just like I like eating meat and eggs those are like my preferred sources and whey protein okay fine um but you can arrange things within the context of different types of diets and I think there's real value to tracking precisely what one eats for even short periods of time and then I confess I I stopped using the app for it but then I went back to it you know um and not because things want to drift I think some people really need that consistent checking other people um need to perhaps just kind of eyeball it for themselves um but for me I found that knowing exactly what I'm doing for some period of time allows me to explore things in a way that's really effective and so I just want to you know I just want to you know give a nod to to carbon um and I don't do product endorsements on this podcast you know I read I do ad reads and that kind of thing for things I love but I say that because I think it's it lands squarely in the context of what we're talking about which is that I know what works for me I also know that some people really love like a giant carb meal in the morning some people don't like meat some people you know and I think what's so beautiful about the way that you've been talking about science and nutrition in particular over the last few years and still here now is that you don't really seem to care whether or not people are vegan vegetarian omnivore or even carnivore dare I say it's just a matter of how people are couching the advice for sure and the reason I keep coming back to this is that I I really think that you this discussion but you in particular are best poised in this whole field of public facing Health nutrition advice to really change the way that the messaging occurs and the way that people hear that messaging and I say that with with the utmost like respect that means a lot to me thank you because most people are not going to go read The Meta analyses right and most people don't know how to parse data but I think that paying attention to the the words that are spoken right before the advice should be we need to think come up with something like that's like the the Norton the Norton method pay attention to the words provided right before the advice yeah I I think how you say it uh makes all the difference right and even you know take somebody I've had you know conflict on social media with which is be Paul salino which you know when he would say something like well I I cut vegetables out of my diet and I felt like my Eczema got better okay that's your exper you can't go f on average that's definitely not reflected in the research you know but hey if you know that you did this thing and you felt better that's fine but how we're overgeneralizing to the population is the problem right and so I think I mean again I'll say hey I I calorie cycle a little bit which again you can do using the app right you can change your days and whatnot give you more calories some days more calories other days and I was I showed a screen shot of it one time and somebody goes so why do why do you do it like that like is that because it's it's better this way for like muscle growth and fat loss and I go uh no cuz I had a uh uh a get together with friends on Saturday and I knew I was going to have a couple beers and I knew that there was going to be some fatty food so I put 4,000 calories on that day and less the rest of the week and they're like that that's it that's your reasoning yeah like compliance is the biggest one I I will tell people I'm like the reason that I and we talked about this earlier like I've never used performance- enhancing drugs I've never even even when pro hormones relievable I didn't use them I've never and you're not on trt we need to distinguish this uh because people um nowadays like kind of put trt well as long as it's keeping someone's testosterone in the normal reference range which is somewhere between 300 and 1,200 NRS per Des or then they're like they're not you you've never injected a synthetic version of a hormone no and like my testosterone even from like a 18 when the first time I had it measured up until like even a year ago the the lowest it's been I think has been like 750 and the highest it's been was like 1050 and so I obviously don't need it you don't you're you're well you're on the upper you're you're high normal right yeah so the reason that I've been able to have so much Su and I get the skepticism I really do um so many people say I mean look at how many people are out beating their chest saying they're drug free and then it comes out that they weren't right um but I have been brutally consistent for 25 years in 25 years the longest I ever took off of resistance training was seven days and it was after I won World Championships in 2022 uh for m193 kilo you know I so I've been able to be really consistent with my training and I always give this comparison of and I think it just really highlights how powerful consistency is and it relates back to my favorite quote I've ever heard the magic you're looking for is in the work you keep attempting to avoid the work is the hack if people and I liked what our friend Peter AA said this when he was talking about biohacks and why I didn't like the term biohack he said I don't like that it occupies so much mind space right you get people really focused on the minutia which is fine if they're already doing the big stuff if they want to kind of level up a little bit cool for me minutia is where I live because the difference between me winning a power of thing meet and me losing World Championships is 1% right but for most people we just got to get them consistent if I said Andrew I want you to become the best three-point shooter you possibly can be but you can't get any coaching you can't even watch any tutorials right but all you did for 10 years was go out and shoot three-pointers for two hours a day you probably won't go to the NBA but I bet you'd be pretty good at three-pointers right and I feel like if people could just get that message and internalize it more no it's it's not that you didn't have your carb to Fat ratio perfect no it's not that you ate your carbs at the wrong time no it's it's not that you didn't get exactly this much protein it's you just stop being consistent you stop doing it you you yeah you were really consistent Monday through Friday and then Saturday and Sunday came and you blew out right like if I'm consistent with my budget Monday through Friday but then I blow it on the weekend hey guess what that weekend money still counts and calories are the same way and you enjoy resistance training I love it I love it do you do cardiovascular yeah defined as because people get I'm starting to catch Flack these days when I say cardio um Believe It or Not uh repetitive motion movement designed to elevate your heart rate for 12 minutes or more so I'll usually do like a FIV minute warmup on the bike before I train and then I will um I will also make sure I get at least 10,000 steps on average per day um I usually average more closer to like 11,000 uh but don't do a lot of purposeful cardio now what I will tell you is my average heart rate in lifting sessions is about 140 to 150 um so if the definition of cardio is that then I'm getting cardio and actually when we when I've had you know most my markers of metabolic Health assessed I'm very metabolically healthy um I've got good actually it was funny um I I just competed at Nationals in late May and go won so I won and actually again very cool kind of Side Story you we talked about the injuries I've dealt with and and so I'm 42 now it's been an eight-year journey and I mean going from I've had back pain so bad I couldn't even get off the floor needed a cortisone injection in my spine at one point just to be able to stand up and multiple hip injuries and a lot of chronic pain I dealt with and I'm very proud of myself that I never gave up because in my heart of hearts I felt like I haven't hit my last PR yet and at Nationals this past year I actually set a national deadlift record for my age and weight congratulations and um it was actually an unofficial world record and qualified for World Championships but the one of the team uh USA coaches his name is Matt Gary him and his wife Susie are like in evidence-based powerlifting they are the goats and they are there is no better game day coach to pick attempts than Matt and Susie Gary other than maybe my coach Ben escrow shout out to Ben um but they were at the meet and we we've known each other for 15 years and the next day I came down into the lobby and they're down eating breakfast and Matt's like your ears must be burning we were just talking about you and I'm like oh what he goes you know what I'm impressed with he goes your cardiovascular fitness and you know a pting meets nine lifts right you get three attempts on squat bench press deadlift and so I kind of like looked at him weird he goes we were there between warm-ups and finishing it was about 4 hours you never sat down you were yelling the entire time you're talking the entire time because I'm a very extroverted active person then when I'm firing myself up it it comes out very EXT he's like you're yelling the entire time and you never were tired you're you're and and I again when I look at my heart rate and I was at the meet I think the average was like 150 or 160 and so you know some people would not consider that cardio but I would say my cardio vascular system does all right so I would argue it might be related to your not getting sick very often you know it's very clear that activation of the sympathetic nervous system is one main driver of the immune system um this is why often people observe that they go through a very stressful period of life and then they go on vacation and they get sick or they're taking care of a loved one and you know that person either gets better or passes away or you know they some ending to that caretaking and then they get sick um I've observed that exact thing when I went through my first divorce um I was also getting I was also involved in a lawsuit with a A company that I used to own a portion of it's a very long story ended up having a good ending for me um and all that stuff kind of resolved itself the divorce the lawsuit everything resolved itself in about a six week time period as soon as it resolved I got sicker than I ever had been in my entire life I got the actual influenza you know I tell people after that experience in 2018 I go here's words I'll never use again I think I might have the flu no you know after you've had it for sure you know and um I mean it but it was like my body had just I maybe it's a little bit of woo but it was like my body I dragged it across the finish line and then said okay we'll see you in a couple weeks cuz we're taking a break you know you think about human evolution I mean these are just so stories anytime people talk about human evolution by the way like no one really knows but the idea that you know if there was a famine or you need to take care of children in famine the idea that you would be more vulnerable to disease at those moments sure but uh it's also true that the cacam meines dopamine epinephrine nor epinephrine activate certain components of the immune system that protect you against things I mean it's not going to protect you against everything but it's when you relax and rest finally that you are more vulnerable to incoming infection we see this with pain too right like um you had SE maon talking about this stuff where you know I forget who was talking about this I remember listening to a podcast with it wasn't him but it was another pain expert and they said um you know because your beliefs about pain your stress level your sleep like your psychological milu actually matter in terms of your pain experience in fact the single biggest lever I've pulled to get me consistently training and painfree was becoming more relaxed and less stressed out all the time and managing my psychological stress better you know when you're not vibrating and spun up all the time your body has again this is a little woo wooy but I think you have more energy I mean if you makes sense it makes sense I mean those catacol Mees I mean there are other molecules involved too but that you know uh dopamine epinephrine norepinephrine you know cocktail is driving us forward in motion and thinking it you know all the time and if you're putting thoughts into one set of things they're not going elsewhere like you said it's all trade-offs I I read something from a PhD in Psychology who said stop thinking about your problems the problem is you're thinking about your problems too much thinking about them doesn't solve them and just ruminating on them makes it worse and actually again if you look at like pain literature uh fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome very close ties to psychological stress um and we were talking earlier about like if you look at the the data on mortality cardiovascular disease cancer on with Aces scores which is adverse childhood event scale so zero being best you were loved as a child that sort of you had no real big worries 10 being basically abused there's like a a very uh I don't want to say very tight but there's a a dose response of Aces scores on the risk of mortality so what happens in the body affects the mind and what happens in the mind affects the body and we we were talking about with pain literature what happens if the Mind affects the body in your pain experience and even just something like sleep there was a study done where they looked at um uh military members and they had 8 hours of sleep versus 4 hours of sleep and they looked at the risk of acute injury 236 per increased risk in the people getting four hours of sleep versus eight hours and now here's where people get this wrong people somebody reached out to me say well I got four hours of sleep last night should I no no no one bad night of sleep doesn't do that sleep is a cumulative effect just like if you have a week's long worth a bad sleep but then you sleep 12 hours on the weekend you're not making up that sleep debt it's more about what you're doing time over time just like nutrition just like training exactly and so this actually brings me to I know we kind of have gone down the rabbit hole here but when you look at um Ben Carpenter did a great example of this um he has a good social media account he had a um a jar of like blue marbles and a jar of green Marbles and he said let's pretend that this is all junk food these blue or these green marbles are all junk food Ultra processed this blue is minimally processed Whole Foods right if my diet is mostly junk and I add one good meal and he puts a Blue Marble in the green did it change things no and everybody knows that right like if you eat a mostly a junk diet you have one good one salad or one you know good meal it's not going to change things so why does everybody think if we take one from here and put it over here that it drastically changes things because it doesn't it's about what you do consistently over the course of time and so um speaking of we're talking about the Mind affecting the body but then the body also affects the mind and so there was just a study published I just covered it on my on my channel where they took men with general anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder and they had them resistance train two times a week for 25 minutes a session 50 minutes total eight weeks it's not much training I think it was like 6 hours and 40 minutes of total training over the entire two months now in statistics you're familiar with an effect size which is basically how meaningful is an effect because you can have a a significant effect that isn't very meaningful if you have enough subject number so when we say things like an effect size 02 is considered small 0.5 is considered moderate and 08 is considered large anything above 08 ssris are typically in the. 3 to 0.5 range um I think in like best case scenarios I get around a 08 7.8 the effect size for resistance training two times a week 25 minutes a day for eight weeks was a 1.7 wow on major depressive disorder wow anybody who's a scientist out there if they hear effect size of 1.7 they do exactly what you did their eyebrows go up and they go they you know they sure that's right you don't see effect sizes like that very often and I want to be very clear I'm not saying do resistance training in place of ssris that's a very but these and these uh individuals had not trained they hadn't trained yeah they were they were healthy or I actually don't know the specific characteristics but I knew they were coming from like not training right now hey like listen both these things can be true maybe somebody needs to get an SSRI because like depressed people don't even want to get out of bed a lot of times right so getting them to the gym even if they know it's going to help them is a hard it's a hard swing so maybe coupling that but that's just resistance training and that affects this right so I think one of the biggest revolutions we're going to see in science is the broad application of biopsychosocial across a bunch of different disciplines and stop thinking about well your body's a bag of meat and it's attached to your brain and if you poke the bag punch the bag burn the bag cut the bag brain goes owie and I think we're going to start thinking about things much differently and I think it's going to open up a lot more in science and in fact honestly if I had to go back and do a PhD again it it would be in some sort of like psychology or or whatnot because I just think there's so much untapped in that realm and I was actually talking about this with um somebody the other day and it's pure anecdote I'm completely speculating I have yet to see an interview with somebody who's in their 90s or hundreds who sounds really stressed out they're they're mostly like dgaf right and when you ask them what they did like most of them say I drink wine every night or I the one thing I remember she was like0 she like yeah I drink Dr Pepper every day or whatever it strikes me that and again genetics matter their lifestyle matters I'm not saying that stuff doesn't matter I I don't see at least in my experience people who make it old age they not usually very spun up all the time I I just I haven't observed that I don't know if you've seen similar observations or they seem to enjoy life I have a grandfather on one side that died um earlier but a grandfather on the other side who lived into his 90s and he ate a steak every day he smoked till pretty late in life before he eventually uh quit he had ice cream dessert uh after every dinner is Argentine so they they stack their meals toward the end of the day definitely like walking did I guess the point is that he was always interested in what was in the newspapers but he wouldn't get riled up about it he liked walking he really enjoyed life like if there's one you know key characteristic to describe him is he really enjoyed life um now he didn't take the best care of himself in the in the sense that had he perhaps never smoked or quit earlier or you know dropped the excess calories he might have lived in additional two or three years but he was really happy until the end and that's the lesson there is we're not saying that that stuff doesn't matter he would have gotten better results if he hadn't smoked if he had you know paid more attention to his nutrition that sort of thing but we have to keep in mind like what is the the hierarchy of importance and the power here right and so I I'll give you an example it's it's a it's we're going to zoom in on the blade of grass but I believe it relates back to this this conversation we're having so we know creatin works because we've got thousands of double blind Placebo control trials showing that creatin works right but there was a study where they gave people creatin or didn't give them creatin and then randomly told them if they got it or not meaning you had people who didn't get creatin got creatin who didn't get it told they didn't get it people who got it told they got it and people who got it told they didn't get it and what they found was the results and I forget what they actually specifically measured but the results basically were like not what they got what they told them okay now people will misinterpret that as see creatin doesn't work no no no it works it just means your beliefs about what creatin does are more powerful than what it actually does just like actually there's a similar trial with caffeine and um I'm thinking about um there was a study um braad I don't have the specific citation but they they had two groups of men train drug free one group they told they were getting steroids that group gained significantly more strength than muscle mass now I would argue that's probably because they're going into training sessions believing that they can train harder believing that they will recover better but that goes to show the power of placebo and the power of belief when I say Placebo people think what I'm saying is you're lying about your experience that is not what I am saying at all I think your experience is probably quite valid what I'm saying is it may not be due to the thing you think it's due to but your beliefs about the thing and so where I get really focused is let's do the big stuff right because so many people are so worried about little stuff and one of the things I'll tell them is hey I have no data to back this up but my intuition tells me that the amount of stress you're spending on these small variables is probably killing you faster than if you got those variables wrong and if we could just focus on the big rocks first and and and if we can pick up some Pebbles after we get the big rocks great but don't drop the big rocks trying to pick up Pebbles I love it and I love this example of uh the creatine experiment because just to repeat the conclusion um because I want to make sure that people don't take away the wrong conclusion creatine Works absolutely but your belief about creatine Works more in this case yeah so two things can work one more than the other and the placebo AKA belief effects are very very powerful exactly I completely agree with you there wonderful way to set the stage for some of the specific questions that were uh asked when uh I said on social media I'm going to sit down with Lane Norton again um and I'm very curious about some of these as well so I'll I'll inject um some of my own experience and questions training to failure and Reps and Reserve we should um Define these a little bit before we get into it um it's fun to have these kinds of conversations nowadays about resistance training knowing that both men and women should resistance train people who want bigger muscles and who don't should resistance train because in the past it was always about like bodybuilding and preseason football and people going to the military I think thanks to the great work that you've done but I'll just give a particular shout out to some of the women in the nutrition and fitness space namely Dr gabri lion uh in terms of uh menopause per menopause Dr Mary CLA Haver and women in that sector are really um emphasizing the key need for resistance training they're other names as well but you know really championing the importance of resistance training training to failure in my book means when you can't move the weight by whatever means um anymore in good form MH in proper form that's failure so we're not talking about for stps we're not talking about um swaying the upper body or or using momentum when so train to failure you can't move the resistance anymore in good form and Reps in reserve my understanding is one's own subjective understanding about how close they are to that point of failure do I have that right yeah so you Define failure the way I Define failure which is you cannot take the weight through another concentric repetition without breaking form um reps and Reserve would be an R of one means you stopped one rep shy of failure rf2 you stop two repy of failure and so on and so forth right and so I would define those that way okay so with those definitions in mind is training to failure more effective at generating strength and hypertrophy increases than if one keeps a few reps in reserve and of course we have to balance this against all the factors related to recovery Etc but assuming that one follows a program of doing and I'm really just trying to cut us right through the middle here let's say two or three exercises per muscle group and does after a sufficient warm-up let's say two to five sets that we're going to call work sets you could imagine an extreme scenario where every single work set is taken to failure you could imagine taking only the last set of each exercise to failure you can imagine taking none of them to failure yeah assuming adequate volume is achieved across the week my understanding is this is 10 to 20 sets per muscle group across the week it could be distributed across different workouts or all done in one workout is training to failure going to generate more strength and hypertrophy than leaving some repetitions and Reserve so let's start with the extreme scenario I go to failure on every single set and I do what I need to to recover mhm doesn't matter if it's a one you know only doing that muscle group once per week or spread out multiple times per week I'm I'm doing what I need to to recover in between my genetics my hormone status my sleep my nutrition on and on is going to failure more effective than not going to failure this going to generate a lot of discussion in the comments I can't wait to see it um so I'm going to cite uh quite a bit of work from my power lifting coach Zach Robinson because he is at FAU just finished his PhD and did a lot of meta regressions and analyses uh on this exact topic so I'll give you the answers first that are straight down the line scientific answers and then I'll explain things for muscular hypertrophy you need to get close to failure uh but you probably don't need to train to failure to maximize hypertrophy but you got to get pretty close you can be stronger but to maximize strength you're probably better off not touching failure very often so there are a few studies now looking at this showing that I think there was one study recently and I can't remember the exact details but that that I remember it being pretty welld designed and the takeaway was hypertrophy was similar between the groups but the group that went to failure or stayed a few reps shy of failure actually got stronger compared to the group that was taking um most sets to failure and did they control for total volume of work okay cuz I can imagine not going to failure you can do more sets because you've got and that's exactly more quote unquote gas in the tank right practically that may be a benefit of stopping shy of failure right but uh yeah they control for those variables so when we talk about volume the way we Define that is essentially number of hard sets which a hard set would be a set close to failure the general consensus is within five reps of failur is considered a hard set now um what I will tell people is that may not sound like much most people have never truly pushed themselves to failure okay and I'll I'll give some practical examples of me so my best set of squats ever I did 530 for 10 this was long time ago yikes um I when I finished that set I actually somebody had to come save me because I couldn't fully lock out my Lumbar and I couldn't get the bar on my right side all the way back up somebody to run over in the gym and help me after that set I laid down and I physically hardly couldn't move for about 15 minutes so this is you know gun to the Head yes do as many as you can your family's been kidnapped if you don't get these 10 reps you're you know all those mental games that that sort of thing um and I mean I was done you know what I mean and so one of the things I'll tell people is the first five reps of that set were still hard they still felt hard right and so people who will say oh you stop a reper too shy failure you you're training like a I'm like so you're telling me if I stop two reps shy on that one that that's an easy set cuz it's not I can tell you that and then the the reason I'm I'm giving this background is because in research studies where they have people who are like uh beginners or intermediates and they ask them to rate their rir they tend to underestimate their R right so they they'll say you know during a set say your R and they might say two and what they find is when the researchers push them to True failure yell at them crank the music get them really psyched up they get five more reps than they think they'll get on average right so most people if you've never actually taken things to True failure you actually probably don't know what it is so I do think it's useful to train to failure at times I think you make a very important point which is that occasionally training to failure gives you a sense of what failure really is for you and and no one can really tell you that only you can tell you that and experience that but if I understand correctly earlier you said once you know what failure is for you than if strength gains are your goal and I think more and more people by the way are training for strength who don't want hypertrophy at least not across every muscle group I think when I talk to the general public which I do a lot I get the sense that men in women are like yeah I'll I'll lift weights I I can see the value of that um would love a little bit more muscle here a little bit more muscle there but they don't want to be generally larger MH and yet they can understand and appreciate the value of getting strong everywhere right because being strong across your whole body is one of the kind core definitions of Health being strong is fun um so again for hypertrophy doesn't seem to matter if you take every set to failure or stop a couple reps shy I would argue that probably you you'd want to leave most reps most sets shy of failure and if you're going to take one to failure take the last set of an exercise to failure uh because then you can get whatever benefits might be there but if you take the first set to failure I mean imagine if I did that like set of 10 with you know 530 on squats as my first set to to what am I going to get the next set if I try to do 530 I can tell you based on how I felt maybe three reps maybe you know um and so your performance is just going to really drop off a cliff if you're going to True failure on like a compound exercise isolation is a little bit different um and so I would say whereas if you you probably could have done like sets with you know six seven Reps for multiple sets and then have gone to failure on your last one right now it may seem a little bit counterintuitive why would it be the same for hypertrophy but different for strength well with strength you also have to think about stimulus fat to fatigue ratio because fatigue will Mass strength right and I know this because I've like when I overreach for power lifting competitions which is basically like we're taking me a little bit past my point of what I can recover from I mean I've had literally before Nationals in 2017 I was warming up on deadlift in my last heavy deadlift session like 10 days before the meet and I went to pull my final warm-up which is 585 and I couldn't budge it off the ground I was so tired sore I couldn't get it was like I couldn't get my body to do what I wanted it to do 10 days later I pulled 716 right it it's amazing what what fatigue will mask and so if you're always training to failure you're going to be training under pretty high fatigue circumstances doesn't really matter for muscle growth because it's really just about doing enough hard sets and putting that mechanical tension on the muscle with strength you also have to think about like what is the most pure form of strength it's Force production right and force is mass times acceleration so you have a you have a mass component you have a you have a speed component and so this is actually Zach Robinson and his company D data driven strength who I've been coaching with for three years I heard them on a podcast and he was giving his like hypothesis of how to optimize strength in a powerlifter and I remember thinking I really like the way this guy is thinking he's thinking outside the box and it makes a lot of sense so one of his things was if you're training close to fatigue all the time uh and the goal is strength think about what that means in terms of your Force production so let's let's say you do a set of eight reps right your first few are pretty fast and then by the end they're pretty slow the load hasn't changed so what happens to your Force production your Force production is going pretty far down he said I don't really want my athletes grinding reps in training I I want them to hit some heavy singles and doubles and triples because they need that because that's a skill you have to have those neurological if everybody's done this with they go I hit this for 10 reps and here's what my one rep max should be and then they go in and get stapled with it right because it doesn't necessarily translate because a one rep max or the purest form of strength is a very specific skill if you've never trained it it's very difficult to get accustomed to so we want to hit some his idea was you know in workouts we're going to hit a heavy top set heavy single double or triple or whatever it is and then our back off sets instead of taking those close to failure instead of doing say well we'll do you know 75% of your your training Max for uh sets of eight and have you getting pretty close to failure instead of doing three sets of eight why don't we just do like six sets of four with that weight because now you're doing those first four reps which you can move that weight faster you're having greater force production and creating the same good stimulus but with less fatigue and so again that was kind of the hypothesis is and he did uh a met analysis metal regression that supported this and now some of the randomized control trials have come out and shown something similar and in my experience I was honestly shocked at because he had all kinds of stuff to deal with when he first started training me because I still was dealing with a lot of back pain a lot of hip pain I hadn't really gotten that under control yet and when I got ready for worlds in 2022 which I think we did our first podcast like the week after I had won worlds I worked up to being able to do like two or three hard sets of squats a week and deadlifts and that was all I could do that was all my body could tolerate before I get pain and so we did a lot of low load relatively low low for me you know 60 to 70% 1 RM for low rep number sets but trying to move it as fast as possible to keep that pain under control for me but to get the stimulus and I was shocked at strong I got because before in 20145 when I was winning open national titles I mean I was doing 15 20 hard sets of squats and deadlifts a week and and way more for bench press and so I always thought well that's how much I need to get to that level of strength and even now like so we we've been able to keep progressing it now I'm doing probably more like six seven harder sets of those exercises per week and I'm basically back to the the strongest I've ever been doing way way less sets and I think a lot of it is we have learned to find The Sweet Spot with managing that stimulus to fatigue ratio so all that to say if your goal is building strength it's mostly about you know doing enough like heavy lifting that you actually do get stronger and then if you want to train closer to failure you can because again most my audience isn't trying to be a powerlifter right no but I think a lot of the audience would like to be stronger and not necessarily gr their muscles bigger except in a few specific places on the body and so this would be the protocol there we go protocols little plug um this would be a protocol for probably not necessarily like growing the most muscle mass but getting stronger because you're not training so close to failure um but you know obviously you're trying to move as Zach says you whatever that given load is you want to move it as quickly as possible and so uh and there's actually also data to show that like if you train slower purposefully that it's not as good for strength um so they actually there was a I think a met analysis recently where they looked at either concentric repetition of slower than two SEC of more than two seconds or less than two seconds and saw strength outcomes were better and people taking less than two seconds to complete a rep interesting that's the concentric phase of the lowering phase the Ecentric phase yeah we're not sure about that yet interesting so so I mean we do we do use some Tempo training and my training but it's mostly because like me doing a slower Tempo squat if my back starts acting up I can uh do some squatting and not really hit that pain trigger as much so but I'm still trying to move the concentric as quickly as possible and so I I you know I don't know about that doesn't matter how slowly you move the concentric versus how fast you move it um but yeah what I would say is you know when it comes to building muscle really the world is your oyster the the the research really shows machines versus free weighs Low Reps High going low reps High Reps going to failure stopping a few reps shot it all builds the same amount of muscle for the most part um but you have to work hard but you got to work hard yeah you got to be consistent with it obviously like the the the theme of this podcast right but you can do it anyway and if we look at the I mean obviously anecdotal but if we look at the history of the Mr olympias they all train very differently you know I mean Ronnie Coleman I mean I'm sure you remember when the unbelievable came out the his DVD back in like 2001 where he's tossing around 200 lb dumbbells and he's doing 7 800 lb squats 600 PB front squats and everybody's just looking at this like my God and then you watch somebody like Phil Heath train who again one of the greatest Mr olympias of all time Phil mostly did machines but he built obviously a great amount of month now people will say Well they're on steroids all those guys yeah it's all controlled trust me it's an equal playing field right cuz they're all doing they're all doing it right and the research shows anywhere from whatever you know 5 to 30 repetitions can generate hypertrophy as long as the final few repetitions are really hard and correct you know and volume is is adjusted I I really like there is no hypertrophy rep range like people used to think oh it's like six to 15 reps is hypertrophy now I think practically it makes sense to do a lot of your sets in that range because you know if you're trying to do 30 reps getting close to failure I mean gosh I'm going to run out of breath if I'm doing you work out in a uh boring for me yeah and if you work out in a gym where there are other people like be kind you know like other people are going to need the the space and the equipment so you know it could take forever you know you know uh you know 10 sets of 30 like that's that's a that's impolite um so we're only half kidding there um one of the more common questions is about training for people 50 years old and older and I love the fact that we're talking so much about strength this seems to be one of the key Evolutions in this field again in my opinion um the people have come through this podcast as guests Dr Gabrielle lion um yourself um Andy Galpin who now is his own podcast the perform podcast like more and more discussions about strength and training for strength for the general public not just people who want to be powerlifters so I think there's a lot of carryover there and I think the more that people hear us say that resistance training can be really powerful for Health and Longevity and getting strong is one of the best things you can do for your Health and Longevity injury protection Etc peteras talked about this and it's not just about building muscle want to know how they should adjust their training if at all if they are 50 and older so obviously one of the key things to getting and staying in great shape over time I always say is you know avoid getting hurt could we say okay don't don't try anything to kn and crazy without e easing into it could we also perhaps but I would say that goes for anybody quite frankly okay could we also say perhaps find the movements that you can do without injury and just keep doing those over and over is there is there any evidence that that mixing up the exercises is important meaning doing new movements or if you find two or three movements that work well for you can you just stick with those and just work on Progressive overload I think you can stick with those I think you know muscle the whole concept of muscle confusion muscle knows tension and how long it's under that tension and for how many sets it's under that it doesn't it's not like well this is a I can tell that this is an inclin bench press versus an inclin dumbbell I mean you know you might move through different ranges of motion and whatnot but the tension on the muscle is the tension on the muscle so what I'd say to people is I think most people probably change up things too much because there is like a neurological adaptation to doing a specific exercise where you get stronger at it and so now you're using more load you can create more mechanical tension but if you're always changing things up you you might not take advantage of that full you know kind of neurological adaptation but if you're always doing the same exercises it's too easy to get comfortable and fall into well today I do three sets of 10 and I always do three sets of 10 and I use this weight and that's what I do and now you're no longer progressively overloading so I think there has to be a balance between enough changing of exercises to kind of promote some novelty because as you know novelty there is a reward center in the brain for that just changing something and think about anytime You' going to try a new workout you get a little excited about it you know when I was going to try Zach's way of training you know three years ago I was like oh I was very very excited about it you know so I think there is a place for that but I think people tend to fall into a little bit too much of doing the same thing over and over or constantly changing things because they're always faing that novelty and I think that the reality is probably somewhere in the middle but specifically for older over 50 I think whatever you can do with low pain level and be consistent with that you enjoy that's what's best for you I mean I I always tell this story I had a client who they loved CrossFit they loved doing CrossFit and they said you I want to but I I want to build muscle and I know it's not the best workout for building muscle I said it might be for you because if you hate bodybuilding training and you're not motivated to go do it and you don't enjoy it you're probably not going to work hard at it and so maybe for you a crossfit workout is the best muscle building workout because if I try to get you to do something else you'd hate it and would lose motivation right it feeds back to that consistency principle that you talked about before exactly so when we look at like I think this is might be interesting for some of your listeners so when we look at how much muscle you can build after a certain age you can build the same amount of muscle as a percentage of your starting skeletal muscle mass okay so what I mean by that is once you're 50 60 you've usually lost some muscle okay and if you've never lifted before if you go into lift as a percentage basis it appears that you will still gain the same amount of lean mass but for example if somebody has 80 kilos of starting are most of your podcast listeners are USA assume so let's say somebody has 150 PBS of lean mass when they start just throw a random number and they gain 10% over a couple years now they have 165 pounds of lean mass they've gained 15 pounds but they the percentage is 10 if somebody starts and they have 100 say 20 pounds of lean mass 10% of that is 12 pounds they gained an absolute less amount but as a percentage it was similar or same and we actually see that with women too women actually develop as a percentage of their starting lean mass the same percentage increase in lean mass as men when they do the same level of hard training so what I tell people who are I'll he people say well you know I'm too old to start resist no no now is the perfect time to start right now um and honestly it doesn't take a huge dose I mean if you want to be like you know go get into powerlifting and like compete at compet yeah now it takes a bigger dose right but what it takes to get and I'm just going to throw a number out 80% the majority of the benefits for health strength resistance training you could probably get in three four sessions of 30 to 40 minutes you know you don't have to have a huge input of time and just look at the depression study we talked about obviously that's not like muscle and strength but two sessions of 25 minutes I mean it is a uh absurdly low dose that you require and I think a lot of people I tried to be careful about this too we'll see how I train which is 2 three hours a day for 5 days a week and think that's what's needed no no that's what I want to go win a world championship that's what's needed for that it's not needed for you to build muscle and get stronger and even uh when I was at grad school across the street they did a study in fril elderly where they had them basically they had trouble like standing up from a seated position and by the end of a 12we study of them like progressively overloading them which was basically like them just lowering the seat at first right and then maybe adding like a little little bit of weight they saw these people built muscle built bone uh got healthier better quality of life and these are people in their 70s and there was a study in Australia that actually got on the news Peter AA talked about it um with uh elderly women who I think they were above age 70 and there's some of them in there deadlifting like 150 like like upper hundreds in deadlift you know it's incredible how I I took a class called uh skeletal muscle structure function in plasticity your skeletal muscle is so adaptable it is such an adaptable tissue it's amazing the same thing that can allow somebody to squat Jesus Aliva shout out squat over a th000 pounds is the same tissue that can allow somebody to run a 100 miles like David Goggins think about that that's really incredibly adaptive and so what I'll tell to people regardless of your age your sex whatever demographic you are in resistance training for just a couple times a week for a short period of time will drastically improve the prospects of your quality of life your longevity I mean if we look at hand grip strength we look at lean mass they're all inversely associated with mortality especially the older you get becomes a stronger Association and I always tell people I'm like it's not about the hand grip strength this is a proxy for just strength overall right there was a study where they looked at push-ups and found push-ups were inversely associated with mortality it's not that doing push-ups is Magic it's that that is a proxy for that person being strong and we focus so much of our attention especially like on Falls and the elderly right of well if they had more bone mass they wouldn't break their bones what if they didn't fall in the first place cuz they were strong enough and had good enough gate and balance to catch themselves and oh by the way nothing better for increasing bone mass than resistance training so I am a huge fan and and then we already talked about like the metabolic like skeletal muscle Gabrielle touched on it was one of the first things Don Layman said when I came in his lab he goes skeletal muscle fits every definition of an organ and we don't talk about it like an organ we talk about like it's this inner tissue that just sits there and it is not it sends out signals to other tissues it integrates signals from other tissues it is an endocrine organ and so many people have unhealthy skeletal muscle and if we treat and what happens when you resistance train what happens when you build muscle muscle is a metabolic sink it is greedy right it's sucking up it's incred you can take people who are type two diabetic and if you get them on a slight calorie deficit you get them to start exercising it is incredible how fast they're blood markers will start to resolve like they can still be obese and you'll see their blood markers start to resolve within like you'll see improvements in weeks uh Layman did a I want to say a 16-week study in uh either diabetic or pre-diabetic women back in like 2003 I want to say and he said within four weeks he said we already saw these blood markers start to resolve like your hba1c hasn't resolved but a lot of these other markers started resolved because at a fundamental level at least in my opinion and other metabolism people may disagree I'm a big fan of aam's Razor which is plainly stated the simple all things being equal the simplest explanation is typically true the the the actual hardcore scientific definition is the the hypothesis that requires the least amount of assumptions is usually true you're putting in so much energy into a system and you're running out of places to put it so you have skeletal muscle mass you have liver these other tissues in the periphery and then you have adapost tissue and did you know they actually show people who have more adipocytes are actually more resistant to type 2 diabetes so they have more smaller fat cells that can soak up more of this stuff and since type two diabetes is basically too much glucose in the blood right and uh a lack of insulin sensitivity small adipocytes are more insulin sensitive and so what happens is we at least in atopos site physiology we used to think of of adapost as also an inert tissue and now we know that's not true either and lots of different cell types to just think that there was you know Brown beige and white fat cells and subcutaneous and intval and now they've done you know sequencing of different white fat cells and like 25 probably Now 50 different I mean different genetics among those cells that respond differently to insulin I mean fat is a very interesting and heterog tissue tissue yeah but most fat cells at least based on the literature I've read and again I'm happy to have somebody correct me who's an expert in this but they can expand to a certain point where they it really becomes difficult for them to get bigger the Integrity of the cell because you still got a cell wall you plasma membrane everything and you have an extracellular Matrix that is scaffolding this fat tissue on your body and so at a certain size of osy it basically becomes you just can't pack any more in there okay and so if you can't put any more in muscle because muscle isn't you're not active and muscle's not moving and churning through uh substrate and you can't pack any more into atopos where does it wind up it's in your blood you can't care and now when your blood levels of it's interesting because there are some people who have all these theories about like one person uh researcher was like well I think Branch T amino acids actually cause insulin resistance because we see them elevated in the blood in type 2 diabetes and I was actually in a I was I was in a um I was a grad student watching this person present and I put my hand up I said isn't everything elevated in the blood in type two diabetes you know why are we why are we picking on Branch amino acids so you do have some people who are who can become type two diabetic who aren't obese they tend to have not as many fat cells which sounds like it'd be an advantage and if you're lean or sorry if you are not overeating right and getting enough exercise in it probably is an advantage because you have less overall fat Mass but you are going to reach that critical mass of an atoy of about 100 microns I think it is faster because your your overall fat cell number so at the same fat Mass your fat cells are bigger and bigger fat cells are less insulin sensitive in fact one of the treatments for type 2 diabetes um Sano uras I think they're called they P gamma Agonist they actually increase the production of fat cells they create new small fat cells now you have a place to put stuff and you lower your blood glucose so very a reservoir exactly and I'm overgeneralizing to be sure um and again I hope if I've butchered anything somebody will come and correct me no they will but what's amazing is this stuff in the blood you just got to get stuff moving like because you start doing exercise start controlling your calories a little bit guess what you're oxidizing things to the KB cycle you're oxid you're going through glyco you can now start to pull things in right you're you're using this substrate you can start to pull things in and because you're pulling things in now atopos can start to release some of its free fatty acids into the or some of Tri triog glycerides into free fatty acids into the bloodstream which can also facilitate this this muscle so using muscle you are it is a partitioning effect and it doesn't take long to start lowering this glucose blood lipids these things in the blood it can actually resolve you know at least those markers can start resolving themselves pretty quickly which is why you know when we look at Weight Loss what level of weight loss they say is clinically relevant it's only 5% right which you'll have obese people and they'll say well 5% weight loss you see these big benefits in like blood lipids and metabolic Health you wouldn't think with just 5% weight loss you would get that but you do because just you're just giving a little bit of space to get that stuff in the blood out now again this is my I want to be very clear this is not a proven thing I I feel pretty strongly that this explains a lot but again this is my personal opinion about how these diseases develop and whatnot but it is I think it's relatively simple yeah using thinking about muscle as an organ thinking about feeding muscle we talked about that earlier thinking about moving muscle and in particular training for strength resistance training of different kinds hypertrophy yes and but I you know I'm kind of given a little bit of a a biased vote for more strength training out there across the pop population for really for the longevity reasons I mean peteras pointed out that uh the percentage of people who die after a fall um not because of the Fall itself but because of a hip injury or a wrist injury and then they're they go immobile not or they're just not exercising as much anymore then they get an infection and then it it Cascades in fact I had a conversation with one of my parents recently on their 79th birthday I said you know in the next five 10 years your biggest risk is probably going to be going downstairs or stepping off a curb not going up but as Peter's pointed out going down so that that Ecentric movement break you know being able to sustain a fall being able to not fall to catch yourself so to speak well practically you fall farther going downstairs and you do going exactly and this and that pattern of falling while going down precedes a lot of infections and that end up deadly right so um and you know hats off to Peter for really pointing out the relationship between those things and to you for encouraging people to strength train also I love the idea that I don't have to go to failure if I'm in strength training because I like training heavy but the the training to the point where the the muscles are quaking it even though that's how I initially started training because I came up in the Mike mener uh you know uh Camp um I actually find that it eats into my recovery in a way that um maybe is a little more subtle but meaningful nonetheless which is that I feel fatigued later in the day whereas if I complete a training session where I can complete every rep I notice I don't get into that quaking um thing I actually have a lot of mental and physical energy later in the day and it's psychologically and emotionally fatiguing as well maybe this one could be kind of a brief answer or maybe not I don't know um are there true age related changes in metabolism that are independent of of decline in muscle mass you know I I saw a paper I think it was published in science a few years ago that said that metabolism actually doesn't slow that much as we age of course total muscle mass so you mean BMR BMR basal metabolic rate in general you know I well I should just say up until that paper came out I thought okay as we get older our quote unquote metabolism slows then of course we have to remember that puberty and and childhood is sort of like um being on performance-enhancing drugs in the sense that protein synthesis is just massive and ongoing but in a let's just say from age 30 onward let's say between 30 and 80 assuming that somebody's doing things to maintain muscle mass is there any reason to believe that their their basil met metabolic rate actually goes down just as a function of age yeah you're stting the work from Herman poner um and uh really great lab looking energy expenditure that he he does a lot of great stuff um and so that study was looking at several thousand people I think looking at their total daily energy expenditure and and really found it's pretty flat from like age 20 to age 70 and then it kind of starts to go down but you can tie it to the loss of lean mass and same thing for Basil metabolic rate when they do IND indirect ketry um if you look at and this goes for so older people also women versus men and then also um type two diabetics versus non-type two diabetics obese versus non- obese 80 I think the the number is like over 80% of the variance in BMR is completely explained by the lean mass by the amount of lean mass somebody has and by the way the last 20% probably is explained by where that lean mass occurs because liver for example is a more metabolically active tissue gram per gram than pretty much any other tissue um skeletal muscle is more metabolically active than like than fat tissue but for a lean tissue is actually somewhat like metabolically slow because its turnover rate it's only like one two% per day you just have a lot of it yeah right right but on an absolute amount of calories you burn you burn a lot in muscle because you have so much of it great Point um so things like gut liver tissues per gram of TI tissue are very active so yeah there just doesn't seem to be a for a long time we spent so much time focused on the metabolism side of things when we're looking at aging when we're looking at obesity and we just didn't really find impressive stuff even so obese people don't have slower metabolisms on average the the the research shows that actually uh on an absolute basis they're faster than people who are normal weight when you standardize for lean mass it ends up being about the same uh people who are typee 2 diabetic same thing when you standardize for lean mass if anything they have a little bit faster BMR and so if you think about it it actually kind of makes a little bit of sense on a biochemical level because if you're insulin resistant you're also insulin resistant in fat tissue right so like okay so it makes sense that maybe you like waste some more energy because you're not able to put it where you want to put it right so the people get upset about this because oh no it's it's got to be metabolism metabolism and then glp1 mimics have really kind of shown no the answer to this question is very much on the appetite side of things it it's like we tried to make a bunch of different drugs that would increase metabolism we tried to do all these things to increase metabolism and nothing seemed to really make a big difference and then we came out with the most powerful appetite suppressant in the history of mankind and people are losing large amounts of weight and keeping it off so I think you know people got too focused on that metabolism side or or what I hear a lot of um is from like uh like postmenopausal women I'll hear somebody say my metabolism dropped what probably happened you're sleeping less you're more stressed you don't feel as good because the hormonal changes you don't feel as good and so you spontaneously became less physically active and didn't realize it because our neat like our non exercise activity thermogenesis our our nonpurposeful physical activity that we do fidgeting pacing is actually a large portion of our daily energy expenditure and and people get this wrong you can't make yourself do more neat because then it's just exercise if you're purposefully doing its exercise it's all it's all subconscious right but if you're not sleeping as well and you're feeling worse spontaneously you'll just not move as much and I know that people like that feels like there's like a lot of judgment shame associated with that but it it's it is the truth it is a practical limitation and it may not be metabolism I guess I'm a little bit pedantic with that but it still contributes to your overall energy expenditure and so again they they've looked at this and um I mean there there is some evidence that like if your estrogen drops and you replace that with supplemental estrogen that that can like help out with like maybe 50 to 100 calorie energy expenditure per day so if you're replacing something that's like now clinically low but my guess is that it would also drive more activity feeling better more activity sleeping better more activity and that's where it's hard to to disconnect that right so yeah I I think metabolism wise the results ended up being pretty underwhelming for all this stuff that we just assume well if somebody's overweight it's because they slow metabolism the research didn't pan that out but I still think it was very interesting and again it speaks to like the power of the mind and the connection in the mind of how some of these drugs act but I do tell people people when they say well you know I you know calorie deficit didn't work for me and I I I you know obviously my metabolism was messed up cuz you know I had to get on OIC to lose weight I'm like well it doesn't really do anything to metabolism like the speed of your metabolism what happened is you just you no longer mindlessly snack you feel you you you are now in touch with your satiety signals and and that's why you're losing weight and that's why these drugs they work all right so speaking of OIC munaro and similar let's talk about these drugs that are reducing appetite and you know In fairness have allowed millions of people to lose substantial amounts of weight and keep it off this topic tends to uh get people a little bit riled up on social media because I think for some reason people believe that if one gives these drugs the nod you're essentially saying you don't need to exercise but I didn't see anywhere or hear anywhere that the use of any compound drug or otherwise um is mutually exclusive with taking good care of oneself in other ways too so what are your thoughts on these compounds and what you're seeing out there I think my take is pretty balanced on this which is I think they appear to be great tools for people reducing their intake and reducing body fat and it functions through appetite I mean the drugs are glp1 mimetics and so gp1 is a hormone secreted by the gut in response to feeding and it acts on the gut as well as the brain to reduce appetite uh you know slow motility uh so it's a it's a society hormone essentially now it has a very short halflife in the body so the reason a lot of people will come out say well there's things you can do naturally to increase your glp1 this is like talking about I mean yes a BB gun fires a projectile and a tank fires a projectile but there's a pretty big difference right so with glp1 mimics what's happening is they are taking that protein and changing out some of the amino acids in that protein and basically just gives a much longer halflife that's why people can take it you know once a week or whatever it is because it just stays around much longer and so if you think about the food environment we live in which is free access to cheap hyper palatable Foods our brains for the most part are probably not equipped to regulate appetite in that environment and it really actually is kind of incredible how resilient the human body is because if you look at when the Obesity crisis started we already had Ultra processed foods available we had cakes cookies all these sorts of things but the difference was you had to go to the bakery and get it or you had there there there had to be some small barrier right and then you know I think kind of the the barrier that got flipped was basically now you know in the last 30 years you can go anywhere and get access to cheap Ultra processed hyperpalatable calorically dense foods and they just don't have the same effect on satiety that normal food does where like in Kevin Hall's study at NIH where they took people from a miny processed diet and switched them to an ultr processed diet and they spontaneously increase their caloric intake by 500 calories a day like overnight that may sound like not a big deal to some people listening that is a very big deal it's about a pound of we per week of increase in body weight yeah I mean you know assuming assuming that there's no increase in energy expenditure which we know happens over time but um with these glp1 mimics they're slowing down motility they're acting on the hypothalamus they're reducing appetite and it's a very powerful effect now some of the side effects are like nausea some people reported kind of like a not freezing but like too slow motility essentially um so there's some GI side effects which are kind of to be expected with something like this and and you know on one side you've got it's so funny how thing everything gets politicized these days but on one side You' got people saying oh these drugs have no side effects whatsoever and you know I think everybody should be on gp1s because uh they we're not made to live in this food environment and then on the other side you got people saying well this just obliterates the need for hard work and these people don't take accountability and I don't really think either of those messages are really useful I think there's a lot of nuance here and I mean it's a drug and every drug is going to have side effects some worse than others for different people and so for some people it's not going to make sense to take it based on their lifestyle and side effects they get but for other people I did a post on this where you know I talked about um how much weight people lose on average and so many people in the comments said you know I've lost 100 lb or I've lost 80 lbs or whatever it is taking monjaro or yeah one of these gp1 mics and again going back to our conversation of big rocks people worry about lean mass loss they worry about there was a study in I think rodents where they saw an increase in thyroid I want to say thyroid cancer or something like that but it was at a not really a physiological dose and again it's it's rodents people say well we don't know what the long-term effects of these drugs are well they've actually been around for um diabetes treatment for a couple of decades now but I mean do we know what they do in 50 years I guess not but we know what obesity does so uh I'm going to take Ron White's line which is shoot the alligator closest to the boat I think if somebody's very overweight or obese and they've tried a bunch of different methods and they just people say well they just haven't been consistent okay so we can live in fantasy land or we can live in the real world which is maybe some people just need some more training Wills than other people okay if we could stop putting like an ethical judgment on how easy or hard it is for certain people to do certain things I mean it's easy for me to say just be consistent because nutrition has never been a problem for me I've never struggled with my weight um but I struggled in other areas of my life that why can I just be more consistent why can't I just do the things I know I need to do I'm sure you would feel the same way about certain things in your life where it's like well I know logically what to do but it's hard for me to do it right and so if we look at the burden on the Health Care system of obesity and these dis type two diabetes and then all the metabolic diseases associated with them it's hard for me to imagine a scenario where this is not a big net positive to be quite Frank now I want to this is as my friend John delone says it's both and okay some people this is really going to help them and it should be done in concert with lifestyle changes and lifestyle education because we don't want people to go from eating a lot of a crappy diet to a little of a crappy diet right we want them to make better choices overall but sometimes again habit coupling people don't get motivated and then get results people start getting results and then get motivated right and so a lot of times people will start losing weight and now they're motivated to go to the gym they're motivated to eat better it's it is it doesn't happen in a linear path these things are kind of like you know like the opposite of a vicious cycle where this is you're getting into a good cycle right and a lot of people tend to fall into these categories where when things go bad they go really bad because it's a vicious cycle when things go well they go really well because it's a good cycle and so what I would say is with the concerns about gp1s the one I hear most is loss of lean mass so in studies people who use glp1 Medics they lose like 30 to 40% of the weight from lean mass which is a concern but by the way that is similar to the amount of weight from lean mass people use who diet without resistance training or exercise so I I don't think that it's a unique problem to glp wants and my guess is when we start getting studies that combine exercise with gp1s and look at um lean mass retention we'll probably see pretty similar results so I'm not I'm not super worried about that on a practical level I can see some concern with it because if you don't have much appetite you're usually not selecting protein as kind of your first you know line of what you're going to pick and additionally fiber you're not usually going to select as your first so I think again these are great kind of like if we think about like training wheels I think these are great training wheels for people and through natural just having less appetite um people start controlling their intake better and then all these other habits start to fall in the pl for some people and um I talked to a friend who uh she's a nurse practitioner and she tried a go1 a medic um just cuz she's like I'm a nurse I want to see what this stuff was like for me and then um she talked to a lot of her clients and the the anecdotal feedback that popped up a lot was it stopped the food noise in my head I wasn't thinking about food all the time I just stopped thinking about it so much and if you look at obesity I mean again it really is on the appetite side we we know that obese people have lower sensitivity to sociiety signals they get a greater reward from food like I just posted about a study the other day where they gave a a milkshake to people and they didn't really see a dopamine response and but in people with binge eating disorder when they give something like that they do see a dopamine response so a lot of it is contextual right and so I think a lot of is contextual around obesity of okay these are people who get a greater reward from food on average they're thinking about food more often they've probably also dealt with people telling them their entire life however long that they need to lose weight and so food is always on their mind in one thing or another it's kind of like uh in Ghostbusters where they say you know don't think about anything bad what's the first thing you're gonna do you're gonna think about something bad right and so trying to calm down food noise while knowing that you need to eat less food is probably pretty difficult so on the whole I think these drugs are positives I think it's going to lower the health care burden and I think it's going to help a lot of people and the other thing I'll say is like there's been a lot of push back in the fitness industry by by Fitness influencers why do you think that is like as if it's going to take their jobs away it's like the same way that people fear AI like it somehow like like this stuff is here to stay it benefits many many people I feel this way about these gp1 um mimics and I mimetics excuse me and I feel the same way about AI it's like these things could be yes potentially used for evil but but you know also for good if I think back about when I might have had that sort of reaction I was in my early 20s and that's when I thought obesity was a choice um I still think there is personal responsibility involved in obesity um but I think my feelings about obesity at that time were when some if somebody's obese they're making the choice they don't care about the stuff they eat that mindfully they're choosing to eat these Foods knowing this is going to be the outcome like self-inflicted Yeah and I don't think that's the case at all I think a lot of people's habits and behaviors are are on autopilot you know I can remember very clearly I I dropped my kids off at school one day I stopped at 7-Eleven um to fill up with gas and like grab something from the store a drink and there was somebody there was a obese woman in front of me and she was getting two slices of pizza at 8:00 a.m. and at first I kind of had that knee-jerk response of H so lazy of course you're over and then I thought you know what this is probably something she's done for a long time this is probably a very habit where she goes to 7-Eleven she gets pizza or on Tuesday morning at 8:00 a.m. she's around this area and she goes to 7-Eleven and gets pizza and maybe not but I think a lot of people out there are like that where their habits and behaviors are very much on autopilot it's not this mindful mindfulness that we think they're doing and that translates into other areas and the other thing I I realized is I'm like it can't be laziness like all of it because there's obese people who are very successful in other areas of their life so they know how to work hard and so at least not for everybody that can't be the explanation and I think with Fitness influencers or people who have you know actually they've worked hard they've built a good physique it's almost like how dare you get results with with with without doing it yourself without I did this without any help you know and the reality is you might have had help because your upbringing might have not been food focused you might not have had a mother who was always on you about food or you might not had parents who shamed you if you didn't clean your plate you you might have had genetics that made you more sensitive to satiety signals you might have had a phenotype where if you overeat you tend to just become spontaneously more active that's part of the obese resistant phenotype and so you might have had an advantage and you just didn't realize it so I think if we could just get away from the Judgment of stuff and look at take the Judgment all that stuff out of it does this seem to help people and is it going to be a net positive on society Thomas Soul said in order to have make compassionate policy you have to have dispassionate analysis of the data and the data says this is going to be massive for our society and it's it's a huge benefit so regardless of my personal feelings of hey somebody should be able look look at Ethan suple lost 300 lb doing it through all hard work and exercise I I'm pretty sure I've talked to Ethan about this and he said I think this is great you know because it's hard to get people to believe if people believe what they can see and so if they start seeing results then they can buy in and yeah I I think overall it's a net positive so I mean maybe studies will come out in 10 years and people are falling over dead from this stuff and we'll say whoopsies but I mean you have to shoot the alligator closest to the boat and right now the biggest burden on our health care System I think I'm correct in saying this and the biggest threat in a lot of ways is how metabolically unhealthy our society is getting yeah I think also when people hear about these drugs they think about the person who's slightly overweight or who is already fit who wants to be even thinner and that's not what we're talking about here and you I have a good friend who is a air traffic controller he works very very hard very stressful job obviously um High consequence job uh and he's very overweight he's got to be more than 300 lbs by by a significant margin and he's really struggled over the years and for years he talked about getting his you know quote unquote stomach stay you know sometimes referred to that way couldn't afford the surgery this sort of thing and I asked him about it I was like you know what's that about he's like I just need something that's going to allow me to move without pain or a little bit less pain every time he tries exercising he injures himself and he's probably going about that incorrectly but he doesn't have a lot of time and he literally has lives in his hands he's married now you know he may have kids soon so I haven't spoken to him recently about these drugs but to me it seems like that's like the perfect candidate for these drugs if he could eat less with more ease and lose some weight and then also start exercising I think that'd be a significant win for him so scenarios like that are what I think of and then also you know it's a mostly free world and many places not all um so if people can afford these things and they want to take them like who am I to say they shouldn't take them you know I I just like I feel like the amount of judgment involved um to say that somebody should or should not use a drug is um that's safe and potentially helpful for them is like kind of uh I mean that's that's almost offensive in in a way yeah I mean if you had something that like if we came out with a drug and it's like it looks like for a lot of people this can fix opioid addiction right yeah you'd give them that drug we'd be shouting from the rooftops and celebrating right we wouldn't say well you just got to gut it out and work harder you know you just got to you just got to want it more it's like no like there's some there's yeah there is some personal responsibility there and there there are choices and things that can be made but why are we trying to make this barrier so high for people like let's lower this barrier I love that on the other side of the coin you've been pretty vocal elsewhere about the fact that sugar is not a drug yeah you know um because sometimes people will say you know sugar is a drug I I would um sort of put in the soft argument from my side soft argument that highly processed foods or let's just call high density of taste Foods right that combine you know processed carbohydrates and fats you know at high Heats that can be consumed in you know where you can easily consume several thousand calories you know almost unconsciously right I mean unless you're asleep or in a coma you can just pop these things in your mouth and keep going they I don't even know if they taste that good but people just keep going that there's a there's a bit of kind of lack of awareness and compulsivity to them very different than addiction of course because people aren't necessarily going out robbing um robbing people but maybe just touch on your view of sugar as a substance we're not talking about the sugar in fruit we're talking about candy ice creams desserts quote unquote hidden sugars yeah what are the real risks of these things if people are consuming them still within the confines of their daily caloric needs so they're not eating excess calories what's the deal with sugar okay so this is where it's very important to give the appropriate context and nuance and I'm glad you set it up the way you did so I always tell people when it comes to almost anything have guidelines not hard rules because hard rules will get you to do things that are kind of dumb right so for example if you say I'm never going to eat processed foods uh well whey protein is processed but if you look at the data on whey protein it improves metabolic Health it increases lean mass body composition even lowers inflammation so I mean if we're just going to say all processed foods are bad well isn't then then way bad so guidelines in that nature same thing for sugar because obviously okay well added sugar is it's not it doesn't have a big satiety benefit um it's calorically dense makes food very palatable I'm going to come back to that because it's contextual but fruit has sugar and biochemically not really that different I mean if you're talking about sucrose okay it's a molec Fu of glucose and fructose okay a lot of fruits have glucose and fructose in them right so if sugar has some inherent lipogenic biochemical toxicity addictive quality whatever we should see similar effects across different sources of sugar and we don't see that right and even when it comes to some of the the processed foods people don't realize what goes into create making something hyper palatable is complex it's not just sugar it's not just fat it's not just sodium it's texture mouth fuel you mentioned temperature all these things matter and in fact there was actually a study a while back that suggested that texture might actually make a bigger impact on the palatability of a food than even the sugar content interesting and let's take it more from a mechanistic level from your example if you're in the confines of your calories what happens I would say a high sugar diet is still not ideal because it's going to be hard to get enough fiber in a high sugar diet but I long time ago beginning of grad school I was under the opinion that sugar and high fructose corn syrup were calorie per calorie more fattening metabolically unhealthy now is that a a graduate mixer with a professor named Manny Nakamura who was at Illinois and he had done some of the feeding studies in rats with uh fructose and seen these weird metabolic effects right and I've overheard him having a conversation with another professor and I was shocked by what he said because he's the one that did this some of this research and the other professor said so you know high fructose corn strip is bad and fructose is bad he goes no it's really just the calories that are in it it's it's easy to overc consume consum people consume it through soda and you know they just eat too much and and the guy was like well you showed all these things in the in these mice he goes we fed them like over 50% of their calories were from Pure fructose that's pretty much impossible to get through the diet unless like you're literally doing nothing but drinking soda and he said you know we showed a pathway but that's not practical in terms of like the application to humans and so I I got curious I really started going down to literature on sugar trying to okay was is he okay is he right about this is it is it really not you know calorie per calorie more damaging than than non sugar carbohydrate when you look at sugar intake it is associated with increased levels of inflammation It's associated with obesity but there are what we call confounding variables which is people who eat a lot of sugar tend to eat a lot of calories so if we look at here's my favorite human randomized control trials where we control total calorie intake and sugar intake what do we see and probably the best example of this was a study from surt back in I want to say 1997 and the reason I'm going to pick out this study is because it had the best controls in it so they provided all the food to participants the protein carbohydrates and fats were all the same it was a I think it was a 12200 calorie diet and they provided all these meals for 6 weeks and looked at fat loss and some blood blood lipids and those sorts of things and they found that so one group was getting over 100 gram of sugar a day I think it was around I mean it was based on some like body weight energy expenditure stuff but it was I think it was around like 110 grams of sucrose per day right lot of sugar other group like around 10 so 10 times different sugar and at the end of the study there was no difference in Fat Loss there was no difference in lean mass retention there was no difference in almost any marker they looked at the only difference they saw all the blood markers improved the only difference they saw was that LDL cholesterol improved a little bit better in the low sugar group and that is probably a function of the fact that the low sugar group had more fiber we know fiber canbin to L to to cholesterol and lower LDL cholesterol in the blood so when I saw that I was like oh man and then when I look through all these other studies with similar kind of controls they pretty much show the same thing across the board on metabolic Health on um inflammation like inflammation really isn't different if calories are controlled with high sugar versus low sugar as long as you're getting enough fiber what about feelings of satiety because um well that's the that is the real downside if you're eating a lot like if you're eating a 1,00 calorie diet and 400 calories are coming from pure sugar I mean you're probably going to be kind of hungry right yeah I'd be extremely hungry I mean I consume artificial sweeteners for the record but there are enough data and I have enough experience with them to know know that sometimes they will curb my appetite like they'll get me over the bump but I've come to associate it's probably just pure paired Placebo Association if there is such a thing where if I drink a Diet Coke pretty soon after that I want to eat something now I've challenged that by not eating something because I have pretty good discipline um and it passes but I think I've come to associate the the sweet taste with wanting to eat something and nothing to me is more delicious well there are many things like a diet coconut slice of pizza if I'm in New York or a Diet Coke and a burger or you know there are these food associations but I don't think for instance that sweet taste necessarily stimulates appetite but I could imagine if I only had as you said 1,200 calories a day to eat and I'm getting you know 400 of those calories from sugar like you said there's not going to be much I better be eating a lot of broccoli as well or else I'm going to be pretty hungry just based on my learned relationships between sweet taste and food consumption what I tell people is I would focus Less on like sugar intake I mean if you want to focus on added sugars that's fine um focus on calories protein and your fiber content right because if you're if you're getting enough fiber it's going to be hard to eat a lot of junk doing that right and when we look at um the sugar intake and calorie levels all that kind of stuff actually a great example would be the case of Dr Mark CB are you familiar with him he's a Kansas State he's a nutrition Professor um in 2011 he got the name the twinkie diet Professor I'm not sure if you saw this but he I know about the the twinkie defense right so he he he asked his students what they thought mattered more for for fat loss the calories you eat or the food choices you make and they said most of them said food choices and he said okay let's do an experiment do you think if I do an 1 18800 calorie diet from ultr processed foods exclusively that I will lose weight and get healthier and most of the students said no and so for 12 weeks he ate 1,00 calories he called it originally the 7-Eleven Diet he basically like if I couldn't get at the 711 I didn't eat it he now the caveat is he had multivitamin and he had some way protein so that he was getting enough protein because it's hard to get protein from some of those ultr processed foods and but 1,00 calories and he lost 27 pounds and all of his blood markers improved and his insulin sensitivity improved now that seems crazy to a lot of people but for those people who have worked and looked at blood work with weight loss and whatnot I mean it's not that surprising that is the one of the biggest levers for metabolic health and so when they asked him afterwards well you that what a like what a great diet like you could eat all the all this junk food and he goes well not really like it's 1,800 calories of junk food it goes really fast I was pretty hungry and honestly like first week it was like oh this is kind of nice and then after that I was like you know I'd really like just a really big salad you know just something satiating so again no Solutions only trade-offs there is a benefit to being able to go well I can if I can fit into my calories it's okay as long as I get enough fiber and protein all yeah the tradeoff is it's a it's a high budget cost right um same thing with people's um you know the data on like moderate alcohol consumption shows that it doesn't impede fat loss it it doesn't if you account for the calories in it but I'll tell people like hey do you really like if you have like two craft beers do you really want to spend four or 500 calories on like 24 ounces of fluid that's not going to impact your satiety at all and so I think a lot of people view this for a very black and white lens right where it's like oh Lane says or this person says I can eat sugar and lose fat so I can eat as much sugar as I want no no no no no because there are practical limits to this right but take somebody like me right if if my calorie intake is my budget I train 2 three hours a day my maintenance calories are anywhere from 33 to 3,400 calories a day which is a not crazy amount but a healthy amount for somebody of my size I have a decent size budget right if I if I can still get my protein in get my fiber hit my micronutrient targets and I have calories left over for energy filler sure just like if somebody makes a million dollars a year and they want to go buy a sports car it's not a great investment it's not a good investment at all why wouldn't they just Bank every single scent they make well because maybe for them having that little reward motivates them to keep doing what they're doing and making that level of money right but if if you're making you know let's take loans out of it right if you're making $100,000 a year does it make sense to spend $90,000 on a sports car if it means you can't pay your mortgage and you can't save money for retirement you can't meet your obligations no it's it it doesn't make sense right and so if you're a small woman small lean mass wise who is trying to lose some weight does it make sense if you're eating 1,200 calories a day to lose weight to spend 300 calories of that on some Ultra processed junk food I don't think it does but if you're an Olympic athlete who's burning four or 5,000 calories a day good luck eating that level of calories from good minimally processed foods you're going to feel full all the time there there does seem to be a kind of a requirement in books in um sometimes even in podcast or to take a stance like to be anti something y um because saying you know what I personally believe based on my read of the data is that most people should strive to get anywhere from 70 to 90% of their food from nonprocessed minimally processed Quality Foods and then allow some space for the you know some processed food highly processed foods and sweets and things like that but mostly to get the the macros right as we've described them earlier and what the range will depend on age will depend on activity level depend on prior health history I mean there are some people who have um enough issues that relate to diet and lack of exercise that when I've seen them get it right and undergo such incredible Transformations that like I also know these people's capacity to fall off the train right like and you want to say you know maybe make that number 100% so you never go back because I've seen them slip before and they and then the guilt and then they come back excuse me so there are two ways to look at it one is you just tell people listen you don't have to be perfect right cuz if if Perfection is the goal you're going to fall off but then there are those individuals like severe alcoholics who quit drinking you don't say like hey like you going to have a beer on Christmas you don't say that right it's all or none but anyway um here we're getting into the psychology of it but I think that that's what you're saying right there is that's where the individualization comes in right like it's it's it's contextually dependent and it's dependent on the individual and what makes sense for them and I I think we as people if we find something that works for us we're a little bit too quick to want to evangelize everyone else around us because we want we do want to help we do have good intentions for the most part and we overgeneralize and I've you know for me again like counting macros flexible dieting when I I I dealt with a little bit of Bing eating when I was young when I first got into bodybuilding because I was trying to you know eat clean and I would end I was in college so my buddies would order pizza or whatever and I end up eating like an entire Pizza by myself right and so once I allowed myself to just have that the foods I wanted in moderation I just got brutally consistent right so it that for me that was the switch that flipped but other people that may not be the right solution and I think we we we make a bunch of uh well that diet worked for me we we assume physiology when actually I think it's much more psychology and just trips that compliance algorithm in somebody's head and it makes sense and if we could just if we could just be willing to say more often hey this is what I do but I I like this and and you don't have to do it maybe try it yeah oh and and everyone struggles with different things and everyone finds certain things easier like I I'm not an alcoholic I'm an adult so I can have a drinker too I just don't like it so everyone assumes because I did this episode on alcohol that I'm like anti-alcohol like I'm like if you're an adult you're nonalcoholic you don't have issues with Al you know um alcohol use disorder or something like be might guess like just know the data right um but there are certain things like steak I'm never giving up like you could tell me it takes 10 years off my life and I'm not going to give it up I'll do other things to offset whatever and that you know decrease in longevity might be I don't think that that's a real thing um but I'm just not going to give it up it's Central to my enjoyment in life yeah like the period Speaking of which um when if one really wants to weade into the Waters of strong opinions and conflicting data we covered this a bit last time you were on the podcast but the questions were replete with requests to discuss seed oils I'm sure seed oils and I must say this whole thing about seed oils has really gotten in my head even though even though I'm a scientist like the the other day I went to my sister's for dinner and she made a really nice dinner it was for her mom's birthday and then she made a really nice salad and I love fruits and vegetables so it's was like salad and then I looked I was like she's made this out with like grape seed oil and I was like why' you use grape seed oil instead of olive oil and she's like well I ran out of olive oil and I I found myself like looking at the at the salad like is this safe to eat I was like I heard your voice in my ear I also heard Paul's voice in my ear salados all these people I thought well I ate the salad by the way I really enjoyed it was good grape seed oil doesn't taste as good to me as olive oil I generally try and use olive oil butter things like that when I when I cook but um what's the deal with seed oils I understand that they are calorically dense you told us that last time I understand people tend to overc consume them and then blame them for a bunch of things that are not related to their seed oiless rather than their calorie containing this these aren't real words of course but you get the idea but are there any data out there that have your you know ears kind of pricked up to the possibility that assuming equal equal calories that there might be something bad about seed oils or is there zero and there's no pressure here to answer one way or the other not that you would respond to pressure for me anyway um so I think it's all about making the appropriate Apples to Apples comparison right because if we're looking at addition studies of you know adding something to a diet adding Omega sixes um L lolic acid linolenic acid whatever well if you're adding those you're adding calories which is a confounding variable right so ideally what we what the real question is because the the debate tends to be the people who are anti-ed oil tend to be very pro- saturated fat and so the question really is okay if we swap out these things in a one:1 ratio what is the outcome right so not like when outcome I mean metabolic Health um inflammation those sorts of things so in the studies I have yet to find a good human randomized control trial where they give polyunsaturated fat in place of saturated fat you know exchange it a one:1 ratio and see negative like actual outcomes what about swapping with mono unsaturated fats like why why are we talking about seed oils versus lard and butter why aren't we talking about seed oils versus olive oil yeah that's um I've looked less into that just because people ask that question yet less um but it seems like both pufas and mufas are better than saturated fat in terms of metabolic health and uh risk of C vascular disease those sorts of things does anyone have a problem with olive oil I'm sure you could find somebody with a Terri terrible way for me to pose the question is there any reason to think like like for the person who isn't sure about seed oils cuz they just heard enough negative things even if there's no basis for it like me who's like I like butter and I also assume that eating too much butter might not be good for me just cuz I'm a rational human being based on my read of the data anyway uh so I have some butter yes but I like olive oil olive oil is tasty I'm told it's good for me is there any knowledge about anything in olive oil that says listen even if you consume it in concert with your caloric thresholds meaning you're not eating too many calories is there anything bad in olive oil I'm not aware of anything um but I will say like if you extend the logic of the the seed oils crowd or anti-ed Oils crowd which actually I'm going to make a new logical fallacy which is just appeal to seed oils cuz I so many times when I've laid out this data I have people go basically like have a freak out and go but it's seed oils how dare you defend seed oils and I'm like I'm not defending them I'm just talking about data people on x when I put out questions for your coming on this episode literally there were multiple people that claimed that you are paid off by this by them by big seed oil and I was just like I have to laugh out loud I was like there might be a lot of companies that are large that make seed oils but I I guarantee they're not paying Lane Norton to say what he say um so I find this actually very funny as somebody whose research was funded by the national Dairy Council the egg nutrition center and the national Catalin beef Association that somehow I would be the person who would be you know Def and all these things act in opposition too it's like well you think I'm Pro seed oil but then over here I've been defending meat with this thing right and then over here I've been defending not sorry defending is the wrong word discussing the data on sugar which by the way those would be in opposition to each other because you're and you're very Pro fiber right so yeah so and even when I talk about sat fat I don't like say it's toxic and it's going to I say hey it raises LDL cholesterol which is independent risk factor for heart disease I'm just discussing it right so I'll say what I said online which is uh I don't defend nutrients they don't need defending there's not ethical considerations here if you want to eat them I don't think you're less of a person um and I find it curious that some people get so uh emotionally and um just like ethically entrenched around certain nutrients so the the the the logic goes something like well you have these multiple double bonds and so they can be oxidized and so that oxidation is going to cause an increase in inflammation which is going to cause heart disease and cancer okay well olive oil is a monounsaturated fat it still has a double bond so by that logic it would still be worse than saturated fat so when we look at trading out and and mufas would fall in this too I believe um if you look at the cohort data polyunsaturated fats substituted for saturated fats have a stronger effect on reducing heart disease than than monounsaturated fats but monounsaturated fats do still tend to have an effect of reducing the risk of heart disease compared to uh compared to saturated fat okay so that would be trading out um butter and lard and meat fats for you know more olive oil right and and just to add some Nuance to it not all saturated fats is created equal there like steric acid I believe doesn't raise LDL cholesterol like it but in general saturated fat is going to be something that raises cholesterol more it also again and I'm thinking of several randomized control trials where they feed the same calories they feed the same amount of fat and they just have people either eat you know saturated fat or polyunsaturated fats you see either neutral or positive effects on inflammation you see neutral or positive effects on liver fat you see neutral positive effects on basically overall metabolic health and insulin sensitivity so again and and uh Paul actually countered this one time and he he recited a study looking at uh I think it was I don't want to say it wrong but it was like giving Omega sixes and they saw an increase in lipid peroxidation I don't think they were comparing it to saturated fat I could be wrong but again this is an example of a mechanism right so lipid peroxidation mechanism we can try to project what that might mean down the road but when we look at actual levels of inflammation actual risk for cardiovas dises actual insulin sensitivity actual levels of liver fat these are outcomes we can actually if we're worried about those we can actually measure them and again some studies show no difference some studies some some of the studies I've seen on like inflammation between uh polyunsaturated fats and liver and and saturated fats don't really show a difference in inflammation but I'm not aware of any that show it going in the opposite Direction Where substituting in polyunsaturated fats actually raises inflammatory markers like CRP and il6 those sorts of things um and actually one of the things I tell people when they're worried about you know fructose activates the Nova lipogenesis in the liver and I'm like well here's this study where they overfed fructose and saturated fat by the same amount and saturated fat increased liver fat by 70% more than fructose so if you're worried about fructose you better really be worried about saturated fat now again both that's an overfeeding study they were eating excess calories but again calorie per calorie saturated fat was worse for liver fat um so that's kind of where I land on it I just you know maybe I'm missing some data but when you're when you're looking at these studies again I'm looking at not one study not two studies I'm looking at 50 studies or however many studies there on the topic and I go on this Forest plot where do they land and when they're almost all on one side or neutral I feel pretty confident that that's something not to worry about right so let's let's take another discussion to tie this in I think this will help people understand how I come to a conclusion about this sort of stuff so I do not necessarily think red meat is carcinogenic even though the IRC has classified it as probably cogenic right um because when you look at the studies you can find studies that associate red meat with cancer and you can find studies that show no associate of red meat with cancer and so it's kind of all over the place now there's probably more that show the association than don't but when you look at like studies where they control for overall diet quality so I'm thinking of a study out of uh Canada back in 2020 I think the author was uh maximova I want to say they looked at different levels of red meat intake and incidents of cancer but also with different levels of fruit and vegetable intake and so what they found was at low levels of fruit and vegetable intake lower red meat consumption reduced the risk of cancer relative to higher red meat consumption but at high levels of fruits and vegetable consumption I don't think there was a significant difference but actually the high level of red meat consumption was lower risk than low red meat high fruit and vegetables I believe I'm I believe I have that correct in terms of the absolute risk and I don't know if it was statistically significant but what that says to me is red meat is more of a proxy of poor overall diet quality and if you control for that with some Diet proxy of fruit and vegetable intake you know if you're eating a lot of red meat and a lot of fruit and vegetables there's not really a whole lot of room in your diet for a bunch of crap you just described the way that I eat and that anytime a friend of mine and this happens a lot uh comes to me and has you know 20 to 50 lbs to lose and well make it as easy on yourself as possible you can eat meat eggs vegetables and fruit and that's all you're going to do for two months and most of those guys in this case they were guys lost a substantial amount of weight and kept it off they all exercised as well and of course it's choric restriction related but but they're not touching pasta they're not touching bread they asked me all the things that can I do this and I just said listen if it wasn't in the list I just gave you you're not eating it sounds restrictive the good news about something like that is that fruit generally tastes good and steak is very satiating it's delicious yeah um if you don't like meat I suppose this wouldn't work but um but I don't think there's anything magic about that diet it just gets people below their maintenance calories with relative ease well it's simple you could probably still do it at a restaurant right because you just ask for meat and vegetables right socially compatible so there's there is some beauty and simplicity there's Beauty in what I do which is I track everything and I can have whatever I want you're going to have to have some form of restriction to lose weight you you pick the the kind of restriction that you can stick to right so bringing that all back so you have this data that's all scattered on meat right and then let's look at something like dietary fiber okay because people say well you you can't establish causation this is some people might say well the the carnivores might say well it's all healthy user bias if it was healthy user bias there'd be some disagreement in the data and there's no disagreement in the data I am not aware of any study looking at dietary fiber intake or fruit and vegetable intake that doesn't show reduced risk of cancer reduced risk of cardiovascular disease reduced risk of mortality usually in a dose response and it is very consistent now some studies might show more of a risk reduction versus other studies but if we're doing a line of a force plot and this is risk reduction this is increased risk everything's on this side right eating more fruits and vegetables can only be good for you right so um and there's like kind of a dose response so that's when I become even without randomized control trials necessarily that's when I get pretty confident okay this is a very consistent effect and there's a dose response and we're seeing a bunch of different populations across a bunch of different countries in a bunch of different Labs okay I feel confident and so for somebody to make the claim that seed oils are toxic or that they're bad for you independent of the calories I mean you're basically relegated to using animal studies um inv vitro mechanisms and then epidemiology which trying to like tie those all together I mean that's not really high quality evidence really high quality evidence is the you have the mechanisms okay there's a mechanism right because if there's an outcome there's a mechanism the animal date agrees with it there's a dose response the human randomized controls TR support it and then the epidemiology supports it like in order for something to really truly be strong evidence we need that now let's take our example of fiber again right epidemiology supports it we have mechanisms in terms of short chain fatty acid production in terms of like insoluble fiber moving like getting food through the gut faster might be actually better because there's some some I don't want to use this word lightly but like some semi toxic in products of like metabolism in the gut that if they stay around too long it might have negative interactions with some of the the the chorti cells and that may be one of the reasons that insoluble fiber helps decrease the risk of colcy cancer so we have the mechanisms the animal studies show it when we do the human randomized control trials looking at shorter term surrogate markers they show it move in the right direction and the epidemiology is in the right direction that's when I become very confident about something so I'm not ready to say like hey seeds are really really good for you and you should have a bunch of them I'm not saying that obviously they're calorically dense right people add oil to stuff and it adds calories but so anybody trying to claim that they strong evidence that they're bad for you it we have very different definitions of what strong evidence is and you have to apply your logic symmetrically if you were going to use a certain level of logic for one thing you have to apply it to another thing right and I I'll give you an example of this um like the the the when they were talking about the cruciferous vegetables and isocyanates and it reduces iodine I said well you know this person was advocating for a meat-based diet and I'm like okay well there's nue 5gc in meat which by the way human uh they found antibodies for that in human thyroid now I'm not saying that meat's going to mess up your thyroid but if you're worried about this stuff in cifer vegetables don't you have to worry about it in meat too because if you're applying that logic symmetrically I would actually argue that there's stronger evidence that the you're worried about the nu5 GC in meat since you actually see those antibodies show up so with the the seed oil stuff I'm like okay let's apply this logic to saturated fat for a moment all right so do we have a mechanism we do saturated fat raises LDL cholesterol well LDL cholesterol can penetrate the endothelium we know this so there there gets to be this debate about small oxidize versus large fluffy both can penetrate the endothelium even large LDL can pen penetrate the anthium now small oxidized penetrates more easily but it carries less total cholesterol deposits less cholesterol in the indel large doesn't penetrate as easily but per unit of LDL cholesterol it's depositing more cholesterol because it's bigger the net effect is both are equally atherogenic in the end so we have the mechanism right now let's look at the epidemiology well the epidemiology tends to support it as well and then if we look at the the really what for me changed my mind because I used to be somebody who was on the side of ah it's not LDL doesn't really matter it's HDL to LDL ratio and was when I saw the mandilion randomization studies which for those who aren't familiar you're basically looking at natural polymorphisms on genes that cause differences in secretion of LDL right and since LDL is a lifetime exposure risk meaning if you're doing a a two-year randomized control trial looking at LDL levels it says nothing about what they ate before and you know in that time frame what's the likelihood people are going to have heart attacks or some sort of myoc Carter Andia it's pretty low now that we have all these like data banks of you know blood samples and whatnot from people from all these old studies they go back and do these analyses and when they look at LDL cholesterol and plot it so lifetime exposure to LDL cholesterol and plot it against the risk of heart disease I mean you can pretty much draw a straight line through it and so to me that's pretty strong evidence if you're if you want to apply the same logic of well we have this you know and LDL by the way can cause inflammation in the endothelium so you have that damage to it because of the apoo protein that attracts inflammatory marker so people are getting some of this cart before the horse and then the other thing that sealed it for me was again like HDL they looked at the same thing at HDL turns out HDL is just kind of a marker of metabolic Health it's good to have high HDL but it HDL itself doesn't appear to be protective because if they raise it with drugs or look at people who secrete more or less it doesn't seem to independently modulate risk of cardiovascular disease so all that to say saturated fat is really only an issue I would say for the LDL the fact that it can raise LDL and there is some evidence it's not necessarily good for the gut microbiome because the bio salt in products from emulsifying saturated fat because it requires more bile that those might be toxic to some beneficial species of bacteria but here's what I'm not saying not saying don't eat any saturated fat what I'm saying is again your overall diet quality is what matters I think it's fine to have some saturated fat I think probably try to keep below 7 to 10% of your daily calorie intake what also matters is there's no Solutions only trade-offs and so if somebody says to me you know I was able to lose 50 pounds on low carb and everything got better but my LDL went up a little bit and they felt like that was the only thing they they were able to be consistent with I'd say on balance they're probably better off with that slightly elevated LDL than they would be if they' kept the 50 PBS on now I would argue if they had lost the 50 PBS and lowered their LDL their overall risk would be lower than it is now but again we have to look at what can somebody consistently execute so all that to say I'm not saying you should consume seed oils I'm not saying that there's no negative downsides but if we look at comparing it to a comp terrible molecule of saturated fat there's a much more compelling argument that saturated fat is bad for you versus seed oils thank you for that very thorough and very clear answer and I just will highlight that you ate a steak last night so you were by no means anti- meat or saturated fat ate a steak right in front of a vegan so it was uh not to not to aggravate them just because they they approve they stuck to their principles you stuck to yours I was originally going to order fish and they said it's okay if you want to get a steak and I said okay if you say so now they did make a a couple of comments in just during the during the meal fair enough fair enough let's talk about artificial sweeteners sweet uh that's the other those are the other people that pay me um that's right uh he's kidding folks goodi um you and I got into it wasn't a scrap we got into a little disagreement about this um years ago so long ago that it's probably not even worth mentioning that you know I was um somewhat in enticed by the data from Dana Small's laboratory then at Yale I think now she's up at McGill um looking at some kind of pavlovian conditioning of artificial sweetener so basically um children children in that case um consuming a high amount of I think it was either sucralose or sacran MH in combination with a meal kind of standard meal and looking at the insulin response and then removing the food component sometime later and what they essentially observed was a conditioned insulin response so they you then have these kids just have the the sweet tasting non-caloric drink minus the food and they still s and they then saw an elevated insulin response in other words the same way that Pavlov got dogs to salivate in response to a bell that was paired with food then you removed the food and then they just simply salivate in response to the Bell the idea was well maybe you can um create a conditioned pavlovian like response to artificial sweeteners okay I thought it was kind of a cool study looking back I I probably wouldn't have covered it the way I did because it's not a typical scenario I think the more important questions are is there any evidence that artificial and low calorie or zero calorie sweeteners like Stevia we have to be very careful here not all artificial that they are somehow dangerous in any of the following ways one do they alone increase insulin to levels that are problematic two do they stimulate appetite in a way that's problematic independent of insulin or maybe as a consequence of insulin and then three what's the story with their potential effect on the gut microbiome I think those are the three categories that come to mind they're probably other categories and I just want to say for the record then and now I'll consume some aspartame every once in a while in the form of a Diet Coke Stevia seems to be in a lot of the things that I consume and I don't have a problem with that um so I'm not anti- artificial or lowc calorie sweetener although for reasons that are entirely personal and have no scientific basis whatsoever I avoid things with sucralose in them I don't really like the taste of it and I have kind of an aversion to it for an interesting reason and and that's a great way to couch that of I don't have data for this this personally I don't do it yeah if I see something I'm like yeah no aspartame fine Stevia gets a thumbs up by me um and I will choose low calorie or zero calorie sodas or drinks or energy drinks when I have the option to have something with sugar it's just kind of but I'm not anti-sugar either I just developed this as a habit yeah i' prefer to get my calories from food yeah you'd prefer to have a steak as opposed to having the cola right steak strawberries blueberries oatmeal rice butter olive oil and all the other delicious wonderful things as opposed to a Coke I'd rather just have a Diet Coke and eat a bit more steak so let's take the insulin thing first um so it's interesting mechanism that they're showing there um what I would say is there's been a couple metanalyses now looking at different non-nutritive sweeteners and their effects on insulin and they they don't show an effect so there's no there's no real effect and let's just kind of play it out logically a little bit if there was a significant effect on insulin one of two things is going to happen you're going to see a drop in blood sugar because you're not eating anything right so most of us if we eat if we take drink a diet soda we don't then go hypoglycemic right or if there is an increase in insulin if blood glucose isn't dropping then there must be a corresponding increase in glucagon which is basically offsetting all of insulin's issues I don't think either of those things happen I I think it's it's inert and that the research the metaanalyses tend to show this there was a I'm thinking of two meta analyses where they looked at these they looked at glycemia they looked at um insulin sensitivity they looked at insulin release and they just didn't see any effect now when it comes to what was the second point so we have insulin we have does it stimulate appetite in ways that may or may not be related to insulin you ruled out insulin increase so um like could there be a pairing of like okay every time I eat I have a diet soda then if I have a diet soda on on its own does it stimulate the desire to eat Allah the Dana small study but and by the way that study was halted mhm they this is the problem with that study is it was being done in kids the increases in insulin that they saw in a subset of the kids were so dramatic this is the way she described it in a talk so I feel comfortable saying this maybe she's changed her tune but in this online talk and academic talk the increases in insulin were so dramatic that they were concerned about the kids becoming pre-diabetic so they halted the study which means the totality of the data never came in means there was it's hard to draw a conclusion okay when we talk about studies we're always talking about means and averages right I I leave open the idea that there could be subsets of populations that there could be individual responses I I leave all that open so on average if that's true and there is a condition response we're worried about well one is there effect on appetite where there people are going to eat more even if those things don't have calories they're not going to make you fat there's no insulin release okay they're stimulating you to eat more well if we look at the randomized control trials where they tell people hey instead of regular Cola drink diet cola if that was true an actual an actual outcome we would see people on diet soda either not lose weight or gain weight definitely compared to water and probably similar compared to a regular Cola um maybe a little bit less but we would expect to see weight gain we actually see the exact opposite thing so we have several randomized control trials now where people like comparing not just diet soda I don't want to just say diet soda a lot of them are low no calorie beverages is kind of the what they talk about cuz not everything's technically diet soda but I think people know diet drinks in particular where they're comparing them they tell people either switch out either have Cola either have diet soda or or sorry diet drink or just use water now they absolutely every single one of these trials they lose weight going to diet drinks um usually a pretty significant amount of weight yeah and usually as I recall pretty sign significant amount of of diet drink like a two liters a day even like the person will carry around a liter or a two liter of of diet drink and sip on it whenever they get thirsty or hungry y yeah so then what's really interesting is they they've done direct comparisons to water and some studies don't really show a difference but several studies and several metaanalyses now have shown that when people if they have either them use water in place of regular soda or diet drinks in place of regular soda that people actually lose a little bit more weight and it's statistically significant with the diet drinks now I don't think diet drinks are fat burners okay they're not causing you to have increased energy expenditure but if you are somebody who is used to a sweet taste if you switch to water perhaps you're seeking out that sweetness elsewhere and so maybe those people are are consuming a little bit more sweet food or whatnot whereas in the diet drink group maybe that's filled that sweet taste for them so I don't get into the back again this gets like people get very like ethically charged about this what's wrong with drinking water there's nothing wrong with drinking water if you can drink water you feel satiated and you maintain your B I'm just chuckling because if drinking water becomes an issue online then I might quit no no it already has not quitting but that's that's that's ridiculous yeah well so again perhaps that mechanism exists but at least on average it's obviously washed out by the fact that for whatever reason for most people who do this they get a little bit more satiety out of consuming a diet beverage as opposed to substituting water for a beverage now again if you're somebody who you can drink water and you don't have an inclination for diet drinks then don't do it it's you don't need it um but again I look it at as we need to lower the barriers for people to start getting healthy and unfortunately a lot of people with the message of just drink water and they'll say well Diet Coke is just or diet soda is just bad for you as regular soda or it's worse for you the regular soda their intention might be I just want people to drink water but the outcome is people go I can't iag give them my soda so I'm just going to drink regular soda then right and so while your intention was positive POS the outcome is actually kind of disastrous right and so we have to disconnect what the intentions of the message are from what the what it actually produces and so that's why I say hey if we're moving levers th if somebody if somebody is obese and they came to me and they're like well you know I drink five colas a day I'm like fantastic because I'm thinking five diet sodas instead and now we have just saved 750 calories and you're going to start losing weight just by doing that right which again people say well what about a hundred years down the road or whatever I'm like well most of these sweeteners have been around for decades now we do have quite a bit of data on them but let's say that there is something we don't know again I'm shooting the alligator closest to the boat right like we know what obesity does so and and people who do these diet drinks lose weight they get more metabolically healthy so again if it comes down to soda or diet soda by all means let's do the diet soda and if there's some small negative effects to it we'll deal with them so that brings me to the gut microbiome most of the research studies in humans where they use reasonable doses don't really show much effect on the gut microbiome however there are a few with particular sweeteners like sucrose that do show an effect now there was one that got a lot of play and you and I actually talked about this I think we actually talked on the phone about this and it was an interesting study I thought it was well done but I want to be careful about how overgeneralized it was so the first part is in this study they selected for people who basically they did a very very like intense selection process where I think there was over 1500 people who were like originally included in the study and they riddled them down to like aund something because they wanted people who had really hardly ever used artificial sweeteners in their life and that's a pretty small percentage of population what they found was a lot of people submitted saying I I don't use them I've never used them and then when they did dietary recall logs like oh well actually you're using it here and you're using it here so they selected all these people out and they found that when they gave them sucros that the compensation of their microbiome changed and they called it disbiosis and I'll I'll come back to that because that's a scary sounding word um first off what's interesting is if you're somebody that population that there selecting those are probably people who have been specifically trying to avoid them because if you're not even if you don't try to consume them they're everywhere so if you haven't been consuming them it's likely that you're specifically trying to avoid them which probably means that you have negative thoughts and beliefs around artificial sweeteners and again we've discussed the power of belief before I'm not saying it was a bad study because of that I'm just saying we have to be careful about how much we over interpret this research data are you saying that the the potential that those subjects had to believe that zero calorie sweeteners or lowc calorie sweeteners could be bad for the microbiome might have actually made their gut microbiome more dis biotic maybe I mean again we've talked about the power belief is very powerful now I have I have no way to support that right I'm just saying be careful before we overgeneralize plus it was a twoe study and just two weeks yes it was two weeks um now again two week is two weeks is enough time to show differences in the gut microbiome actually a few days is typically enough time and only for sucalo so Stevia no change there was another there was another sweetener that I think had a change it might have been sacran sacran and sucrose are the ones that seem to always show the biggest effects quote unquote and I don't know how often those are used in diet drinks these days I mean less and less I mean it's usually aspartame Stevia more in the kind of Wellness Health Fitness craft drinks sucrose is pretty ubiquitous in a lot of diet products and whatnot but I like like being frank my way protein powder with outward nutrition is sweetened with sucralose I mean it's it's a great sweetener um and so some people will take that as well of course he's going to defend sucrose because in his protein but if I thought it was really bad I would just use a different sweetener so what I will say as well is gut dysbiosis sounds bad but it simply means that the gut microbiome changed and I have several friends who are gut microbiome experts and they'll when we sit down and talk about this stuff they're like I mean their takeaway is yeah like 50 years we'll we'll probably have a really good idea of this stuff but right now we like we just know that certain things change it we don't really know like if it's a good change bad change um so I'll give an example in there was another study that did show a gut microbiome shift with sucralose and they showed some of the species of bacteria that were increased or decreased and one of the species that was increased I believe I'm going to butcher this so badly I think it was blodia ctis was was the name of it or at least how I tried to read it right because these are very like strange Latin words yeah the the names of bacteria are really difficult to to pronounce now what's interesting is this species of bacteria was associated with better metabolic Health lower risk of obesity um better insulin sensitivity and so I kind of walked away saying well couldn't you make the argument that sucos actually changed the gut microbiome for the better based on some of this data and so I'm not saying that what I'm saying is the following we don't really know if that change to the gut microbiome is a good change bad change or neutral we just know that it changes so if you want to avoid fine but if you're somebody who really struggles with moderating your intake and a sucralose is or an aspartame or whatever have you helps you moderate that intake then again you're shooting the alligator closest to the boat let's let's focus on the big stuff right and that's kind of where I land and again I I hold open that perhaps my mind will change and adjust but su's been around a long time the the other thing people bring up is canc they'll bring up cancer with artificial sweeteners and I'll give you an example why I'm not worried about this um first off you have to keep in mind the negativity bias in the news all right things that are negative are much more likely to get play than things that are positive okay think about how much you hear about this causes cancer this causes heart disease versus this protects against this this protects against this it's also safer to when the media warns people off things as opposed to to WS things because if they push people towards things there's more liability right push people away from things R rarely uh are they responsible for the opportunity cost there or the trade-off as you as you referred to it right so you hear a lot people are like oh man all these studies say that these cause cancer so again I'm going to give a shout out to consensus because it's a great AI tool that basically will give you like if you ask a question um and there's some filters that help with that it will give you kind of like this percentage of studies say yes this percentage say possibly and this percentage say no I've used it a little bit yeah it's a great tool and if you type in does aspartame cause cancer for example 80% say no and then like I think the split is like 13% say possibly and 7% say yes right but you would never know that from like listening to Social Media watching the news but I I want to point out one study in particular that did show an association of aspartame intake with cancer and it was from the neutri cohort I think that was out of France like 100,000 people and they looked at uh like people who didn't use it versus people who were like low moderate users and then people who were like high users they categorized them into tertiles and between the no non-users and the low moderate users there was like a I believe it was like a 15ish perc relative risk increase in cancer incidents and that's what got reported in the news and then that dropped to like a 6% increase risk in the High group so it did thish which I'm not aware of any carcinogens that they actually decrease in terms of the risk like can carcinogenesis as they go up in like the concentration and so to me you know one of the things you've got to realize my my PhD adviser used to say if you torture the data enough it will confess what you want it to say and so if you go through a large group of people and you start trying to associate things with other things you'll find things but you got to be very careful with how strongly you interpret it and so for me again if I'm if I'm feeling strongly about for me to feel strongly about something there has to be some kind of dose response or at least like if there's a bell curve sometimes you see that but you know very rarely especially with with cancer stuff usually this is kind of a linear effect and so again that's where I land right now on artificial sweeteners I I land on them as a a useful tool for a lot of people um I don't think they're magic I think they occupy that sweet taste for a lot of people and if you can completely avoid them and abstain from them and you're perfectly happy then by all means do that but if they help you maintain a healthy body weight then by all means do that love it you've dealt with some injuries you've dealt with pain you talked a little bit about how reducing your stress and interpretation of the pain could help I want to talk about pain and pain management but before we do that a more general question that relates is about recovery tools many many people want to know okay if we were to create the Pyramid of uh the hierarchy of tools for recovery after training and here let's change out or let's use resistance training and cardiovascular training inter interchangeably some people run hard other people lift hard or do do both from the moment that session ends what do you have in your in your kit of things to maximize recovery over the shortest possible amount of time and I can immediately think of sleep as critical but what are the things that you can do starting from that final repetition so I I think it's not so time dependent and like I said it's more about what you do over the course of 24 hours and you know in your day-to-day lifestyle but uh sleep as you said uh also your nutrition so being consistent with your nutrition and you don't have to get in you know Ultra fast digesting carbohydrate and you know 50 grams of wheight isolate right after you you know but it's it's probably a good idea within a couple hours of finishing your workout that you have you know a meal with high quality protein and that you're just eating an overall healthy diet throughout the course of a day and we've kind of discussed that at at at at length you could do it immediately after your workout yeah you can absolutely um quick I'm going to layer in an additional question is there any evidence that fruit is not good at replenishing glycogen as compared to starch because the reason I asked this is that um you know like if I finish a workout and I have some like a whey protein shake with a bunch of berries in it and a couple bananas assuming equal calories is that going to replenish glycogen the same way as if I have a couple scoops of whey protein and a bowl of oatmeal or rice this is going to circle back to our mechanism versus outcome and and this is one where I changed my mind because of seeing outcomes so the reason this comes up is you fructose your muscles and other tissues lack the enzyme to turn fructose into muscle glycogen your liver has that enzyme so your liver can take fructose and turn it into liver glycogen so that has led some people in sports uh science or or Arch to say well don't have fructose after a workout and actually fructose is kind of a a dead carbohydrate right because it's not going to replenish muscle glycogen and then I was reading a study from Tracy and Josh Anthony which were they came out of Layman's lab and they actually are responsible for really flushing out a lot of the intour pathway a lot of that translation initiation pathway very very brilliant people and I was glad I got to see them a few weeks ago when my adviser got his award Tracy personally taught me how to Western blot so thank you Tracy they did a study where they looked at glycogen replenishment after exercise giving either sucrose which is 50% glucose 50% fructose or pure glucose and actually if I recall correctly they actually got a little bit better muscle glycogen replenishment with sucrose now this how do you explain it that seems completely counterintuitive and there I believe again it's been some time since I read this paper but I believe the explanation was by providing some fructose what you're doing is you're kind of satiating the liver's need for glucose and so that glucose that does come in from sucrose can then kind of just bypass the liver and be available for muscle whereas if you're getting pure glucose the liver is going to start picking things off now it wasn't a if I recall correctly it wasn't a big difference in the rate of glycogen replenishment but um the other thing is people don't realize well even though fruit ose can't be used to replenish muscle glycogen directly you forget about how the body operates in terms of whole body metabolism and you can store fructose as glucose glycogen in the liver and then the liver can release that glycogen at some point into the bloodstream and then that can be taken up by the muscle and turned into muscle glycogen so again when it really boils down to us what are you doing on a 24-hour basis and and what I will say too is the rate of glycogen replenishment gets really tossed around a lot as something really important for the most part the rate isn't so important if you're eating enough total carbohydrate on a total daily basis and enough calories you'll replenish your muscle glycogen and most these people I always say dude you you're weight training for an hour you're going to do it again in 23 hours you got plenty of time to replenish that glycogen you don't need cyclic destrin or dextrose or whatever and so I'm not really worried about that I think where the rate of glycogen replenishment really matters is when you're dealing with athletes who have multiple events in a day right where it is they're going to perform and then they need to replenish quickly before they go to their next event or you know people obviously doing like endurance exercise where like Iron Man's triathlons and that sort of thing where you know getting in that replenishment and keeping it going is very important but I think for the average person who's just exercising once a day not really a big deal just make sure you're eating enough total carbohydrates so for you the berries and and the fruits in the in the Whey Protein afterwards excellent okay and then perhaps and then typically I'll do a meal that includes some starch a little bit later in the day y great so nutrition post-workout or in the hour or two post-workout making sure you eat enough in the following hours um do you include any kind of stress down regulation are you you are do you do anything else besides nutrition and sleep to accelerate recovery so Stress Management like you said so um I I am blessed enough that I currently live in a home on Tampa Bay and I get to watch the sunet over the water every night and that might say that might seem like a a weird thing but I really feel like that has helped with my stress level viewing Horizons we know puts you into panoramic Vision we know this from stuff my right your wheelous right here oh yeah panoramic vision is is a will you know come off the the accelerator of the of the uh sympathetic arm and the autonomic nervous system which is just nerd speak to say enjoy those sunrises and sunsets they are very calm I was uh talking to a friend of mine we're sitting out I said well you know Andrew would approve of the uh Sunset viewing he might not approve of the bourbon I'm having with it but you don't need my approval anyway yeah so whatever gets you just slow down a little bit you know and just decompress and feel better and so I mean another thing I'll do is I'll you know once the if I have the kids once I go to bed I'll go downstairs and I'll lay on the couch with my cat and I'll play a video game nice you know just relax decompress decompress you know things you enjoy yeah I think things you enjoy like obviously like you can't drink a 12-pack of beer and have that be conducive to to to that sort of thing but the other thing I will say is I think a lot of people focus too much especially with resistance training there's some evidence that being just overall active lifestyle like going out like I remember when I was first getting into lifting like back in the early 2000 guys like I go in and I lift and then I lay down the rest of the day right cuz I got to I got to I got to recover right I think the research actually suggests that you're better off like having kind of an overall active lifestyle you know that that yeah it's important to rest and recover but it's probably important to move your body throughout the day you know active active recovery does have some good data on it awesome earlier we were talking about protein actually several times we talked about protein and I neglected to ask a a question that is very timely because I just did an episode a solo episode of this podcast recently about skin health and appearance and I looked at the data on ingesting collagen could be from bone broth or other sources of collagen typically it's powdered collagens anywhere from five to 30 grams of collagen and I was kind of surprised at the results I also talked to some dermatologists basically the results say in these papers these metaal The Meta analysis I looked at and in speaking with dermatologists that the conclusion was that regular consumption of collagen on the order of anywhere from 5 to 30 gram per day with a little bit of vitamin C a couple hundred milligrams of vitamin C for whatever pathway related reason seemed to improve skin appearance fewer wrinkles reduction wrinkles more skin tautness appearance of moisture Etc these are subjective measures right I don't think they were caliper in the skin and looking at tensile strength and things like that but um people felt they look younger Etc and I was surprised really surprised because without making this too long a question or story a few years back there were some claims by not to be named individuals on Instagram saying well if you want to improve the function of your liver eat liver if you want to improve the function of your heart eat heart if you want and and you and I were just like no okay you're the nutrition biochemistry guy I'm the Neuroscience guy have a little bit of a background in cold physiology that I rarely talk about but in any case but you know physiology yeah I mean there is we both agree there's like zero evidence that ingesting a protein which of course is broken down into its amino acid constituents in the gut would somehow lead to selective shuttling of those amino acids from liver that you ingest to your liver that just is like a there's only one word for that it's like a crazy unsubstantiated claim and then some papers were sent my way which were in a different language and like I was trying to anyway zero minus one evidences I would say yeah and yet the whole notion that consuming collagen protein which Dr Gabrielle lion told me is actually a pretty low quality protein on the kind of protein quality scale it's like tendon and toenails and all this stuff gross but yeah that's what it is um somehow leads to improvements in actual collagen which is of course is a native protein of the body right so I went digging I just want to up before I get your your answer I went digging and I found again a not to beamed individual has this kind of wild story on the internet that ah well this is because um it's broken down into the dipeptides and tripeptides in the gut that somehow inform the body that there's an injury in the collagen and we have quote unquote breakdown of collagen AK injury I don't know breakdown of collagen and elastin in the skin all the time and then the body recognizes the presence of those dipeptides and tripeptides so little groups of twos or three peptides not just one and sends those selectively to the skin and so it's like once again it's like it makes sense as a mechanism if it were true but like I just had to like roll my eyes I was like oh no okay I'm going to pitch this over to Lane as I am right now so Lane take it away what's the story does ingesting collagen improve skin appearance and does it do we have any idea what the mechanism might be okay sorry for the long uh question folks but had to set the stage well first off I will never make somebody apologize for giving a long- winded Preamble right because you know how long I'm about to go well we're both scientists so I will tell you I actually like after I commented on that post I went and looked up some more research and I've actually changed my mind a little bit okay which which probably wouldn't surprise you that haven't completely changed my mind but I've shifted a little bit so first off my first thought was exactly what your thought was this is all getting broken down to constitutive amino acids it's not like you're taking collagen and just like putting it in the place you want it like just you know like that sort of thing so my and my skepticism was also because one of the highest quality protein metabolism Labs out there where Jordan tromlin is is is Luke vanloon Luke Van loon's lab is one of the best protein metabolism labs in um the world and they were publishing research back when I was in graduate school in fact I think Jordan and I were actually in graduate school at the same time so they did a study where they looked at after exercise giving either whey protein or collagen protein and they looked at sheld muscle protein synthesis and they looked at connective tissue protein synthesis right and they saw no difference between whey protein and collagen protein in connective tissue synthesis after exercise and so but by the way collagen did not stimulate muscle protein synthesis even like 25 grams I think it was which most protein sources even like plant protein sources will stimulate muscle protein synthesis at like 25 gr so so it's very low quality so it's low quality in terms of skill of muscle anybody who's telling you like you're like col is good for building muscle um I mean it's better than no amino acids but it's one of the worst you can get in terms of all protein sources so that study I I again since I know this lab I have a lot of trust of the data that comes out of there right and it was a well-designed study it was well executed study but then there's these meta analysis out there looking at skin looking at you know even like some were trying to make associations with uh nective tissue injuries and whatnot and again I'm always a little bit have the heebie jeebies when we we jump straight to we have an outcome but we don't know what the mechanism is right and then I started reading uh a review by Luke vanloon actually and was talking about like the so the collagen is um three Alpha helixes so if you think about DNA right it's it's a it's a double helix right so think about three helixes and an alpha Helix just refers to the way a protein is shaped and they are they have a very large amount of glycine so glycine is a non-essential amino acid and every third residue in collagen in the three Alpha helixes every third residue is a glycine molecule so 33% of collagen is glycine and then I want to say 10% is Proline and then another like 10 perish is hydroxyproline so Proline that's had a hydroxy molecule added to it and that's done apparently the the hydro nobody needs to know this but just for fun stuff uh the hydroxyproline helps stabilize the structure because of the hydrogen bonding with the hydroxy molecules which I found interesting so you have these three amino acids and amino acid derivatives that make up over half the amino acids in the collagen protein and well my next thing was well a lot of non-essential amino acids if you give them in the diet They Don't Really raise non-essential amino acids in the plasma because the gut liver extract a bunch of them glycine is different if you give there was a study looking at giving just one gram of pure Glycine and looking at the rise in plasma Glycine and it I think it went up like I think the the like native level of glycine in the plasma something like 250 micromolar and after giving a gram of it it went up to like 400 micromolar I'm I'm I'm giving my best estimate based on the graph I saw and so then I got thinking okay that's I guess possible if you have more Glycine and Proline I didn't look I didn't see the proline data but if you have more Glycine and Proline that's winding up in the plasma not that they're being directed to those tissues but since those tissues use so much of that amino acid perhaps it does help and then if you look at like whey protein versus collagen and the content of glycine and Proline I I think collagen has like three to 10 times the amount of glycine and proline in it compared to whey protein so am I ready to say collagen helps skin and connective tissue and what I'm not because I'm still you know this study looking at connective tissue synthesis doesn't show anything so the mechanism is incomplete but there is a plausible at least they've shown that glycine can go up in the plasma from taking it in and it is a big component of collagen so why aren't we just suggesting that people take glycine instead of collagen that well I think what they would say is like there's because you're getting hydroxyproline in the collagene in the collagen that you're taking that probably I don't know how much hydroxyproline is typically in the diet you know um but I would say again I am a little bit nervous about like a lot of these subjective measurements of skin appearance and skin tightness I mean I'm not saying faking data I'm just saying that data is easy to get wrong because it is subjective right it's less the the more B the more subjective things are the more bias you introduce so I hold open the idea that supplemental collagen could help with skin hair nails I'm not convinced by the data and I'm not going to tell people to spend their money on it just yet but I'm going to stop short of saying that I think it's BS uh and I I've actually changed my tune slightly on that uh from looking in this dat a little bit further thank you for that very thorough answer and very clear answer if nothing else it tells us that collagen protein is going to be least ideal for post-workout protein because of the fact that it's you know it lacks significant amounts of Lucine Etc so might be good might be good for skin um definitely not a great protein for dietary protein reasons no it's very very low in the branch amino acids like the lowest in lucing of any protein Source I'm aware of I think it's like 2% locing which is like most even like the worst plant-based sources of Lucine are like 6.5% Lucine so like the worst sources of protein in the diet are still like three times more Lucine than you get in collagen protein so in quality weight protein would be the highest Lucine avable be 11 12 133% yeah eggs whey protein eggs are going to be around 9% Lucine um you know beef chicken most your animal sources are around 8% and and then most of your plant sources are 8% and under great well Dr Lane Norton thank you for coming back here for the second time on the podcast I I must say it's a true pleasure to sit down with you and discuss training nutrition supplementation recovery pain management stress life advice uh and for so many reasons a you're a you know a serious scientist you know in our business of science um that that that really means something you're serious about the science and you're a light-hearted guy in the right context and you're but you're you're a serious scientist you you believe in the process and you provide the Nuance even though that might not be convenient to what what somebody wants or convenient to the discussion like by the way not convenient for me either I'd rather this stuff be so simple you know right sure sure you're like the rest of us and at the same time I I really appreciate it because we are now also colleagues in the public health public facing uh landscape social media it sometimes called but a lot of Landscapes podcast YouTube Etc and it's required it's needed uh that people like you exist and I will go so far to say that you know and I'm not alone in this right because I've talked about this with with Rogan and with Gabrielle lion Dr Gabriel Li excuse me and others you know in an ocean of noise some of which has validity right um but in an ocean of noise about nutrition and training and all these different things and how to evidence-based blank and science-based that uh you re really clearly are pure signal like you're you're going to take as much time and as much effort to communicate the real signal and you today have really defined for us for you what is real versus not real which versus a maybe and I just want people to hear that loud and clear because I think sometimes people pay attention to how spirited you are and they miss the fact that in that spirited nature and in the nuance and in the look we're both long-winded at times like I know because I know this for myself but I certainly know it for you that that's comes from a place of respect for the science and respect for your audience that is not being dismissive that's actually respect for them it would be disrespectful to just give them the answer they want or give them a quick answer with without the explanation so I just really want to extend like a a real voice of gratitude for you for what you did for us today just far too much to list off um it's all so valuable uh just so so valuable and also what you do on social media and the way you do it and look I also really love and respect your um your fighting spirit because you're fighting you're fighting for truth you're fighting for good and I also love the posts and the the pictures of your kids they're delightful and it's great to see that the balance in your life you've created so I could go on and on but I'm going to cut this short by just saying a a giant thank you for being the signal among all the noise well uh speak for yourself of being longwinded because I'm not but I honestly I I I appreciate that that means a lot to me um you know I I recognize how you know valuable your platform is and how many people want to be on it and the fact that I've been asked to come on again I really appreciate it and uh to be able to have the opportunity to disseminate this information and not just talk about the studies but talk about hey here's a here's a method of thinking here's a way to approach this stuff and I mean you kind of pointed out like I would love to be able to say yeah seed oils are bad like I'd love to give you that answer I can't I can't do it I can't make myself do it because I look at the evidence and I'm glad you said spirited I I do feel like I I do have some fighting Spirit but uh at the end of the day I I tell people you know you know I'm human I've got my own biases my own beliefs um and I like making money like anybody but I and I like to be right but at the end of the day I I want to help and I believe that if I continue to execute on that mission that you know Financial stuff will take care of itself and at the end of the day I just want to be want to be a net positive on the world so thank you for giving me that chance oh it's been a true pleasure and you're absolutely more than net positive on the world um and we'll just have to have you come back and uh talk to us again before long thank you so much anytime thank you thank you for

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Martha Beck Dr Martha Beck did her undergraduate Master's and PhD training at Harvard University she is also considered one of the foremost experts in the personal development field having authored many best-selling books including her upcoming book beyond anxiety curiosity creativity and finding your life's purpose I must say that today's discussion is a truly special one I've long benefited from Martha's teachings and I assure you that during today's episode you will benefit from Martha's teachings she describes and we explore practices in real time that will allow you to truly understand what is most important to you and what you ought to spend your time pursuing you will hear a rich discussion about how to frame the thoughts And the emotions around any topic including pain points in life as well as your goals and the things that you are in pursuit of you will also learn how to figure out exactly what is most essential to you and indeed how to explore what Dr Marthur calls your essential self those deepr rooted desires that are unique to you and your history and what will make your life most fulfilling by the end of today's episode You Will Be armed with new intellectual and practical knowledge and you will be able to adopt the best possible stance for you as you navigate forward in your life before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is better help better help offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online now I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years initially I didn't have a choice it was a condition of being allowed to stay in high school but pretty soon I realized that doing regular therapy is extremely important to our overall health there are essentially three things that go into great therapy first of all you need to have great rapport with a therapist so you need to be comfortable with that person you need to be able to trust them and talk to them about all the issues that are relevant to you second and this is what people normally think of when they think of a great therapist that therapist needs to provide you support in the form of emotional support or directed guidance and third excellent therapy has to provide very useful insights insights that you can apply to be better not just in your emotional life and your relationship life but also your relationship to yourself better help makes it extremely easy to find an excellent therapist for you one with whom you resonate with have excellent rapport with and that can give you those three essential benefits of therapy if you'd like to try better help go to betterhelp.com huberman to get 10% off your first month again that's betterhelp.com / huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by Helix sleep Helix sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are customized to your unique sleep needs I've spoken many times before on this other podcast about the fact that getting a great night's sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance now the mattress we sleep on makes an enormous difference in terms of the quality of sleep that we get each night we need a mattress that is matched to our unique sleep needs one that is neither too soft nor too hard for you one that breathes well and that won't be too warm or too cold for you if you go to the Helix website you can take a brief two-minute quiz and it asks you questions such as do you sleep on your back your side of your stomach do you tend to run hot or cold during the night things of that sort maybe you know the answers to those questions maybe you don't either way Helix will match you to the ideal mattress for you for me that turned out to be the dusk mattress D us I've been sleeping on a dusk mattress for gosh no more than 4 years and the sleep that I've been getting is absolutely phenomenal if you'd like to try helix you can go to helixsleep.com huberman take that brief two-minute sleep quiz and Helix will match you to a mattress that is customized to your unique sleep needs right now Helix is giving up to 25% off mattresses and two free pillows again that's helixsleep.com huberman to get 25% off and two free pillows today's episode is also brought To Us by element element is an electroly drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium in the the correct ratios but no sugar now proper hydration is critical for the optimal functioning of all the cells in your body and that's especially true for the neurons the nerve cells in fact we know that even a slight degree of dehydration can diminish both cognitive and physical performance so to make sure that I'm getting proper hydration and electrolytes I personally dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I first wake up in the morning and I drink that or sip that across the first half hour of the day or so and then I also make it a point to drink another packet of element dissolved in an equal amount of water so 16 to 32 ounces at some other point during the day and maybe even a third if I'm exercising and or sweating a lot I should mention the element tastes absolutely delicious my favorite flavor is watermelon although I also confess I like the raspberry flavor the Citrus flavor basically I like all the flavors if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with the purchase of any element drink mix again that's drink element.com huberman to claim a free sample pack and now for my discussion with Dr Martha Beck Dr Martha Beck welcome oh it's so good to be here Andrew thank you I'm so excited I mean I don't know how to convey to the people listening and watching just how excited I am I have very few heroes in life but you are one of them I don't it's true that does not compute it's true I I won't name all of them but you know you the great Oliver Sachs are among the people that have really influenced me so much in terms of the things I do the ways I try and think the ways I try to not think oh yeah at times and your life story is an amazing one so we have a lot to cover today so I'm not going to spend any more time talking about why I feel that way because it's going to just become apparent in our discussion but I do want to say that you have really been ahead of your time uh I mean you're triple degreed from Harvard you have these academic credentials and yet you were one of the first people to be public facing about the mindbody connection in a way that is operationalized what we sometimes call in and around this podcast protocols yeah and you've offered some practices that have absolutely transformed my life and other people's lives and I gain them through reading your books and that's not a standard book advertisement but all of your books have been transformative for me one of the exercises that has had a profound effect on my life is the perfect day exercise oh yeah you know and when I first read about it I I thought you know what could this possibly be you know and and as I recall it um involved taking a little bit of time maybe 10 minutes maybe 30 minutes and just sitting or lying down closing one's ey eyes and just imagining with no limitations yeah one's perfect day yeah and what's so wild about this exercise is that several not all but several of the things that I imagined in that exercise yeah have amazingly come to be reality it works I don't know how or why it works but it I've I used to have people send me a postcard this is how long I've been doing this stuff now it's emails and texts that I say okay we just did your ideal day you've got it all written down now send me a notification when that day happens and I get a lot of notifications okay well I'm giving you a notification right now because at the end of that exercise and I ended up doing it several times uhuh I do I do it all the time okay that's that's good to know I want to know about the the frequency there um was you know I'd love to sit down and talk to Martha Beck what I wouldn't do so I'm in a pinch me moment right right now this is so great it's wild it's a like reality weaving back on itself and I've listened to your podcast and I thought that guy is really cool and here I am thank you I'm um I'm moved by by that so let's just talk about this exercise for a second cool um clearly uh we could come up with scientific explanations for why it would work you know the the brain is a predictive machine you know once it understands that something might be possible maybe it looks for avenues for that unconsciously we could come come up with a whole narrative around that but just for sake of those listening what is this exercise how how would you suggest somebody try it so the first thing is that you don't make up something I used to people would always tell me they'd make up a day where they woke up in a white room with white sheets and windows with white curtains and then they would put on white clothes and drift around and I realized finally that these people were just tired and they were they they they could not project anything but a sort of blankness that I finally realized meant that they just pushed themselves too hard so I stopped doing this with people until they were well rested then you don't make it up you see it happen that's the key thing you allow it into your mind not as though you're reaching with your imagination just as though it emerges so I talk people through it um you first thing is you wake up in the morning you're perfectly crashed by a beautiful sleep in your imagination don't open your eyes but listen what do you hear so you don't make it up you listen for it what what do you hear for me the first thing I hear is like just feeling how comfortable my body is on the bed you know something that I don't do enough right what about the sound of someone or someone breathing mhm yeah someone next to me breathing and they're still asleep ah lovely you have is there a dog breathing on the foot of the bed well if it was like my Bulldog Costello that's snoring I'm G to get another dog soon so I would like a dog that breathes with less snoring than Costello although I I must say I I miss his uh bulld dogs is like incredibly deep snores the early versions of this podcast the early episodes we kept him in the room snoring and um and by the way the the watering up in my eyes these are truly tears of joy um and I said in uh at the beginning of the uh podcast I said listen I have a bulldog he's getting toward the end of his life so we're going to keep him in the room and so when you hear that breathing in the background that snoring let's call it what it what it is um he's he's in here like so sorry not sorry so anyway so yeah so there's some um bulldog breathing you can have as many dogs in the room as you want just listen and maybe you hear birds outside maybe you hear the ocean maybe you hear wind maybe you hear people talking or the noise of traffic just just listen for a minute until you're pretty sure you've heard everything there is to hear yeah I like the sound of kids playing ah sweet okay so smell the air what's it like how humid is it what's the temperature you know I'm California it hard I like um I like it in the 70s and ' 80s perfect not too humid and um I don't it's weird that it don't jumps in but there's something about the the sound of airplanes flying over interesting it always depresses me it must be some par Association sometime like I don't like that okay no planes so birds bird chirping who doesn't like birds chirping um and by the way for for our listeners this is not one magical day that you'll never live again this is a typical day but your life is now perfect so it's an ordinary day but in your perfect life so put it out three years five years whatever makes it possible for you to allow that your ideal life could form in that time you'll find as you do it many times the time necessary for it to happen becomes much shorter anyway so you get up look look around you sit up in the bed look around who's next to you what does the dog look like what does the room look like yeah it's my partner next to me my dog is you know I told myself I wasn't going to get another Bulldog but I think I'm get you are they're the best they're like the the essence of efficiency of metabolism meaning they do as little as possible and they experience as much joy as possible they're he us when you need a wise hedonist in your life right and and they are capable of protecting if they need to but I honestly don't care about that you know all that all that stuff like all that like my Bulldog I don't care about any of that something tells me you could protect yourself pretty well I'm I'm good I'm good there um so I look around the room what color are the walls what pictures are are hanging there if any yeah I'm a wyth fan Andrew WTH fan which one Andre or NC well the Recently I saw a caption I don't know if this is true because it was an Instagram post that um the woman in the field oh image Christina's World that um yeah yeah um I didn't know that the name of it thank you that that this was a neighbor of theirs that had a degenerative um neural condition yeah and rather than use a wheelchair of sorts she insisted on crawling everywhere um and so that image is actually of her crawling out into the field happily to enjoy the field because my impression of the of the painting before was that somehow because she's seated up there it looks like in my mind I projected onto it that there's some like desperation there or something to get back to the house but that's not it at all turns out this is a woman who preferred to move with her own agency even if it meant crawling to enjoy nature and it's a magnificent painting it's a magnificent painting so it's on the wall there yes maybe not the original although that would be awesome why not it's your perfect then I'm waking up in in uh in in the met and also just notice that you're creating a theme which is the the theme is I will go out as myself and and I will reach and strive for things and I I I'm not here to be helped I'm here to do hard things and to do them for the joy of it so that's what that painting is strong symbol of Who You Are so get out of the bed and your partner's still sleeping the dog's still sleeping go look out the window where are you and you can be anywhere I'm a mountains guy as much as I love California you know I've I've realized that I just went out to Boulder Colorado for the first time for a week just by myself and I fell in love with it yeah um so I'm in the mountains Colorado feels right to me um and there's water uhhuh like a river they a river they've got Great Rivers there yeah they do um or or the little streams I like the little streams that they have there um because the rivers are so loud the rivers are really loud when they get going um yeah and yeah so are you looking at a a small town a city or just do you just live out in the mountains by yourself definitely small town I I can't be too isolated if I'm going to be in a city I'm going to be in Manhattan it's like it's all or none so if I'm going to be in nature I I want to be in nature um It's a Small Town beautiful so just look around smell the pine and Aspen air and then you go into your perfect bathroom and it's all it's beautiful you could go through a lot of description if you wanted to but I'm G to rush through that to get to the interesting parts so you take a look at yourself in the mirror your body is absolutely perfect of course in your case that's not an aspirational thing you're already there but make it even better yeah that for me that that means being cleare eyed you know I'm people who listen to this podcast know that you know I came up through Neuroscience studying a number of things but the visual system and you know these two little bits in the front of our skull are pieces of our brain yeah the only pieces of our brain outside of our skull and and they yes they may be the windows to the soul if people want to refer to them that way but to me like just feeling like my eyes are clear yeah you know and and um there's a certain um tone or something that I'm like okay like there is a reality I I I've seen it I don't know if you've worked with people who are dying or who are really ill sometimes you'll see a shift in their the transparency of their eyes there there actually seems to be a Radiance coming from the eyes or gathered around the eyes that's what I'm sort of thinking as you talk yeah and the I think it's the Buddhist that talked about you know it's someone who's at the level of their their eyes are at the level of their skin so like right there as opposed to Sunken back into their eyes yes you know um and then of course some people are like really forwarding but this and I also happen to work on the intersection between the visual system and the autonomic system you know so you know stress or calm and I think what that's referring to and I'm speculating here is where we are alert but calm yes so we're present alert but calm and of course that controls pupil size and all this stuff I I do believe has been understood in other traditions and ancient Traditions through a kind of unconscious genius where they're recognizing all the symbols integrated of you know Clarity of the eyes and um level of the skin and you know and of course we can measure the stuff in the lab but that's just isolating variables so for me it's yeah looking in the mirror and like okay my eyes are clear this is so interesting because my friend Liz Gilbert of Eat Pray Love Fame that she wrote something before she was famous where she dressed as a man for a week and and walked around and she's tall and Broad shouldered and has you know great chin so she could get she could look male and she got herself all dressed up male and they faked a beard and everything and then she had her friends come and a male friend said to her no Liz pull your eye pull yourself back six inches away from your own eyes and she did it and he said now you're looking like a man interesting and she walked around that way and she said it was the lonliest saddest week she's ever experienced like yeah people gave her more respect in certain ways but she said when they told me to back away from my own eyes it was like my soul went dim wow and that's really really interesting that you would say that exact distance even that's like a retraction of our humanness that's fascinating I mean I don't ever recall as a kid you know my dad or or my mom or anyone telling me like where to place my my vision and I'm probably guilty of being um more expressive uh emotional um effusive than um than certainly the uh traditional male stereotype right like if I love something people are going to hear about it and um and I'm not shy about the fact that thinking about Costello or my graduate advice or people I love like I'll I'll well up and I I'm I'm okay with that yeah but I think well to to flip that one around do you think that that's a real thing that um I have no idea conditioning that that um men and women tend to kind of be either more I don't know there's no language for this I have an N of two you and Liz Gilbert okay all right um but I think it's very interesting that you said that that you're forward and your eyes and the the idea that the eyes are the parts of our brains that are showing it's fascinating that she had that experience too so I would love to I I'll be asking people from now on if you're design male identified male do you feel you have to pull your sort of Vitality back from the world and I I suspect it's true I suspect it's true just from interacting with people um and ask women if they I think it's more vulnerable to be right on the surface of your life and the surface of your eyes but it's also much more um there's a sensuousness to the world when you're fully present that I know I had to shut down like when I was in the ivy league it was I had to pull myself back and syn down and that's a typically male environment I think it's about materialism and conquest and oppositional thinking as much as very tactical yes like taking what's out there and holding it in I actually can do it I know how to do this you just did it yeah I know how to do this it's like visible yeah and I I probably just learned how to do it right um cuz I'm comfortable in a lot of different environments there are certainly environments I don't want to find myself in again or in the future for the first time but um yeah I'm very very um aware what that that the distinct change in internal state that a companies that that's so that was so interesting that you just did that wow okay back this the problem I'm having now is that I have and I quote an interest-based attention system I love that ADHD which means I pay attention to things that interest me which means that I literally follow squirrels away from business meetings but I have I have paper and Pen here and it's okay because the because the art of podcasting in my opinion is that we can spin a couple different plates and return to them because it's like conversation otherwise we might as well be on a highly produced uh traditional media show and that's not what this is sure I say so so we're back so I look in the mirror and I see I'm like you are C like I'm clear and present okay and of course for those listening you should all be doing this exercise for you right yes okay um okay and now you go to your closet and you're going to get dressed open your closet which is the closet of clothing you have in your ideal life and just look at the different outfits you have the different like how many kinds of shoes are there this is pretty funny because I definitely have my ideal wardrobe which is very sparse I've always owned 20 or so of these button- down black shirts like uh for work purposes I like t-shirts that are super soft mhm and because I have a short torso and long arms like they have to like fit right and so I find the ones that fit right it's a nightmare trying to get them but once I get them I I adore them because um I always own two belts or so MH one watch black jeans the shorts I like I get teased for wearing mailman shorts but they're actually the Costco purchased male or like Kmart purchased like male person shorts they fit best um for me and um and I've always worn Adidas so yeah I'm happy oh yeah I own a pair of proper leather shoes I have a suit I actually own a tuxedo oh my um I own those things and um I like the I like my closet I've always liked it it feels very safe in there uhhuh I like I like it and then um I've always kept a couple photographs of people that I love in my closet oh sweet so whose photographs are there do you see any photographs you don't recog at this moment it's my sister mhm it's my grandfather and then I think that's it yeah don't apolog apologies to my parents apologies to my parents apologies to my parents and anyone else forgive me okay yeah okay so then you go through the whole day and I I can spend at least an hour going through this with someone you and the important thing is that you do something I call the three ends you notice what comes into the field of your imagination but you don't try too hard to see it specifically and then as you go through you sort of narrow down what it might be and if the name of that thing comes up you can then name it but for example in one of my ideal days I was writing short pieces of writing then I was interacting with people very regularly about it and I I I couldn't even IM imagine what what kind of job that was and then um and an editor in Manhattan knocked over a manuscript I'd written and she got she was the editor of a women's magazine and she called me and asked me to be a columnist I was like I always a magazine columnist for like 20 years and it was exactly what was in the ideal day but I had not named it I didn't know that you could live in Phoenix and be a columnist for New York magazines so notice what you're doing you put on your very comfy t-shirt very cool black jeans you're one watch your belt your Adidas and you go do something really fun with people you really love in a place you really enjoy well the the work part of my life quote unquote work is like reading and teaching and talking about stuff on the internet which is podcasting um but what I got a flash of is I I'd want to work on my fish tanks with my kids oh yeah I see now I skipped a thing you're supposed to go down to breakfast and see if you've got a family I do I I um yeah I've always wanted kids um been trying to time that correctly and with the right person um so yeah I I like tending to my fish tanks I have kept fish tanks since I was a kid I haven't had one for a few years now but um I like I'm always setting them up for other people it's kind of interesting I always go in real life I go place I see people I'm like I'm gonna put a fish tank there I don't know my interest based detention system just went oh really you do it for other people oh yeah I'll show up and I'll be like I got will you let me and then I'll set it up and I I love setting up fish tanks it's like the who knows so your kids are helping you how many kids are there realistically no in your imagination you're going have 20 if you want two two I I for some reason I got obsessed with numbers for a while but I was thinking like five or something no two you never know it could happen the important thing about this exercise is you don't get logical about it you don't think what's manageable and what's probable and you just see who's there yeah two feels good all right fair enough two feels good and um yeah there's so much life in a fish tank there's the plants there's the food there's who how the fish are interacting with one another who's chasing who who's nibbling who's hiding who's dominant who's like being kind of unruly and like you know um I mean I must have seen the Finding Nemo movie especially the second one like like 12 times fabulous like 12 times it's crazy as an adult it's not crazy this is wonderful so good like I just loved the personalities I mean any any movie where Willam defo the voice of a fish you're like okay like uh so um all right so we we tend to the fish tanks which is great which is great pleasure and then for me it's we come here and sit sit down with you and hang out with these guys and uh my team and um and share what I like know to be really cool useful like truly useful yeah practices fabulous so you're very very close to your ideal day right now but and as you said I don't know the mechanisms that get put in play um certainly directed attention you're now like a guided missile that knows where its Target is or at least what the target looks like and we we all make countless decisions every day and you can think of it as a lot of little wi's branching out and if you've got this in your mind really clearly you're going to take the option that leads to it that's what I tell people it's logical directed attention except that in many cases I have to say a miracle occurs you know my favorite cartoon is this physics equation with these two physicists and they're all these symbols on both sides of the board in the middle in Brackets it says a miracle occurs I love it my dad's a theoretical physicist so he will but he will Delight in that as many of you know I've been taking ag1 for more than 10 years now so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast to be clear I don't take ag1 because they're a sponsor rather they are a sponsor because I take ag1 in fact I take ag1 once and often twice every single day and I've done that since starting way back in 2012 there is so much conflicting information out there nowadays about what proper nutrition is but here's what there seems to be a general consensus on whether you're an omnivore a carnivore a vegetarian or a vegan I think it's generally agreed that you should get most of your food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources which allows you to eat enough but not overeat get plenty of vitamins and minerals probiotics and micronutrients that we all need for physical and mental health now I personally am an omnivore and I strive to get most of my food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources but the reason I still take ag1 once and often twice every day is that it ensures I get all of those vitamins minerals probiotics Etc but it also has adaptogens to help me cope with stress it's basically a nutritional insurance policy meant to augment not replace quality food so by drinking a serving of ag1 in the morning and again in the afternoon or evening I cover all of my foundational nutritional needs and I like so many other people that take ag1 report feeling much better in a number of important ways such as energy levels digestion sleep and more so while many supplements out there are really directed towards obtaining one specific outcome ag1 is foundational nutrition designed to support all aspects of well-being related to mental health and physical health if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs with your order plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman there was something that popped to mind I mean there all these little things um that also go into my perfect day that we don't have to go into every detail about like working out and the whole thing but I just want to maybe um mention a point of contrast that served as one of the reasons why I did this practice in the first place was that in real life I was waking up and sometimes still do wake up with this like underlying like tension like something's not right yeah I don't feel good I wasn't anxious I wasn't like but like something's not right and I went through years of kind of like gnawing and scratching at different things that you know I quickly discovered you know like going out for a couple drinks with people made me feel worse I don't judge people who drink whatsoever I'm like I don't like this like it doesn't like I was just but this un unease um this it's like a restlessness um that lived inside of me for so long and still can Surface as a signal that like this is not the right life and at that point at a laboratory Wow Grants we're publishing papers like all these things that I loved doing and that I loved the trajectory that I took to arrive there and the people that were in my life but like I just knew I could just say like something's not right and I felt terribly guilty the reason I'm telling this is I felt terribly guilty like I owned a home right I was in my mid-30s and it wasn't an expensive home certainly not by today's standards but I was able to buy a home on my own I was um my dog I had you know people in my life but it was like this it was almost like a gear that was grinding and that was the um stimulus for exploring this perfect day my life looks completely different now and it's far from qu perfect um meaning there's still work to do in a lot of domains a lot but um but I feel like the trajectory is right yeah and I really believe the the source of all my work you know I was at um was getting my doctorate at Harvard I'd gotten my bachelor's there I'd been there since I was 17 and halfway through my doctorate I during that time I'd gotten married had a child my second child was prenatally diagnosed with Down syndrome and that I was six months into the pregnancy almost and I had like two weeks to make a decision and I'm politically very pro-choice um and I would again never judge anyone who made the other decision but I couldn't do it I was already sort of bonded to him and I kept asking the question of myself what makes a human life worth living because the doctors at the Harvard Medical Clinic and all my advisers told me you have got to at the very reled institutionalized this child the second he's born institutionalized oh yeah for sure they said you're throwing your career away the head of the obstetrics um committee there were five Obstetricians and um the chief dude came in and there I was sitting on a bed in my little Hospital napkin and he said um this is like a cancerous tumor you've got to let us take it out it will ruin your life and I just looked at him and I had the weirdest experience and I looked at this very intimidating guy and I'm there sort of young and naked and pregnant and um suddenly it was like I could see two faces on him and one was this very Stern knowledgeable doctor and the other one was a terrified child terrified and it was so striking that I like started looking at him strangely I'm sure he thought I was completely nuts but um I looked at him and I thought you're afraid you're afraid of this baby and I realized that's when I realized that a lot of people don't go to Harvard because they know they're smart they go there because they're afraid they're stupid and he probably true for a lot of higher education institutions yeah and I thought he's afraid of the in quote stupid little boy inside me because he's afraid of the stupid little boy inside him he's terrified of being the person he's worked so hard not to be he's afraid of being like my son and he thinks that should be thrown away and that was the point which I said I will not make my decisions based on social pressure I have to do something from a very very deep place within and so I kept that I mean he's home right now you know we're having a great time Adam right Adam my son Adam I only know his name through your books of course but I feel like I know him a little bit cuz I love the story about him peeing on the doctor yes the very first thing I ever did in this life was he the doctor pulled him out of my body and I saw this Arc of urine go straight into the doctor's face and I was like so proud of my child at that moment I thought if only I'd thought to do that I want to just um for lack of a better way to put it double click on two things first of all well I I wonder if we're going to speculate no need to but if the perfect day exercise is really about accessing the subconscious that's what I that's why I told that long story that that when I had to make that decision it was the first time I had dropped everything conscious and logical from my mind and come from a place that was I believe it's part of our neurological apparatus but the cognitive structures are so you know cognitive function is just a tiny fraction of what our whole nervous systems are able to detect and tell us and for the first time I was making a decision from every cell in my body instead of just my you know neocortex and I realized my life is not meant to go like his life and the person in the next bed their life isn't meant to be like mine but we all have this programmed into US somehow and when we start to leave it in my last book I called it um leaving our integrity because to be an Integrity just means to be one thing it doesn't have any moral implications in the original like Latin it just means integer one thing so if we we're born knowing who we are but some point at some point usually not long after birth we get socialized away from what from expressing exactly what our own truth is telling us we we get socialized to behav behen ways that please other people very simple and as you're describing it I had a great life I had a lab I had a dog I had a house those are all socially recognized items that say your life was working but they have nothing to do with your personal Destiny right and in my case again I loved and I still love doing science I mean I um my lab is certainly shrunk I everyone I got it made sure people got placed in jobs and faculty positions Etc um still involved in some clinical trials but you know one thing that pained me about the work I'll just come clean about this this makes my throat uh lock up a bit is uh I've been an animal lover since I was a kid I do eat meat I eat it from sustainable sources but you know not all but a lot of the work that I did in my laboratory was on animals and at some point it was approximately halfway through um my first position I realized I was like I I I I don't like this yeah and we could talk all day about animal research nonanimal research I decided to work on humans instead um because they they can consent um and they house themselves um but you know there so there were some pain points but I think my unconscious was pulling at me yeah um like this isn't good this isn't good and um for me yeah um and and I do think that the conscious mind and The Logical mind as you're referring to it is it's very tactical and it part of the problem is it works so well Works in quotes to move us forward on metrics related to that exactly but I mean there are very few people that I know who are truly aligned with their I guess what you've called essential self um one who um I'm fortunate to be good friends with he just so happens to be famous for lack of a better word um who resonates with a lot of what we're discussing is the great Rick Rubin the music producer who produced all these different types of yeah music and one thing that's really interesting about Rick uh spent a lot of time with Rick um and we communicate all the time and one thing that is very interesting about him is he's he has incredible powers of observation he can really feel the energy yeah of a musical artist or and he's produced other things too he does great documentary he's got his own great podcast but he doesn't get absorbed by it and I wanted to talk to you about this because I you know I think for people that are very feeling very sentient um or really in touch with that the ability to like feel music to feel other people's emotions to really um that's a beautiful life to taste food but there's a threshold Beyond which we kind of lose ourselves in the experience of others and what's going Rick can go right up to that line wow and really see it and enjoy it but it doesn't absorb him in a way that he he has a place that he returns to that's in him and the reason I discovered this is I I said wait you don't drink alcohol he said no I said no drugs he said no doesn't judge it but he doesn't do it I said did you ever he said no and I said who comes up through music yeah and never takes a sip of alcohol goes to college and never took a sip of alcohol tried any drug and again you know I don't judge I've talked about psychedelics on this podcast I've talked about my own relationship to those what I think are very interesting clinical trials and things of that sort I think there's tremendous potential there I agree but what is it to be able to like experience life in the richest way but make sure that we don't get lost in feeling or in thought it's like this ability to move back and forth seems to be the most um the best definition of like a great life yeah in my opinion to because we need to do things each day I would say you don't even have to go back and forth you can do it all at once you can feel you can think and you can stay in the driver's seat and not be overwhelmed either intellectually or emotionally but I think it has a lot to do with you were talking about Asian Eastern like meditation practices um there's a little exercise I like to do with people where if they're struggling with a bad habit I say imagine the part of you that is always doing the bad thing like smoking 20 packs a day or whatever um imagine them as a wild thing in your left hand and then imagine the part of you that hates him and says stop smoking in your right hand and look at them and begin to see that they're both well-meaning they're both exhausted and you can wish them both well so one the Wild Child part is not thinking it's just feeling the controlling part is not feeling it's just thinking and if if I can get people and I have them put their hands out because I know it's going to activate both sides of their brains and then I have them wish these people well may you be well may you be happy when they can feel compassion for both sides of themselves then I ask them so who are you and who they've become is a compassionate witness which is not thinking and it's not feeling in the way we it's not emotional ovar the the word emotion means movement disturbance this part of the of one's being is not ever Disturbed or moved it's totally still and totally peaceful and completely compassionate it's like the ultimate parent yes it is and um dick Schwarz who who came up with the model of internal family systems theory I don't know if you've had him on the show have not but I I'm learning more more about internal family systems models I learned about this first in the context of uh visiting a trauma Healing Center that's great and then people are now applying this to addiction as well yeah um I'll get his name from you later Richard Schwarz anyway he I was talking to him and he said there is this part we all have different parts there's a part of you that feels like a little kid and wants to curl up in bed there's a part of you that wants to go rule the world whatever your parts are so he talks to people about these different parts and then sometimes they say oh there I've just come up against there's someone here who's very still who's very huge who's very kind and he he calls it self with a capital S and he says after thousands of patients they'll say he'll say what part of you is that and they say oh this isn't a part like the others this is who I am this is who I am and he believes it's just one unified self and for me if I don't find and lock into that self I am immediately Swept Away by my emotions and my brain just like in a gale force winds so I have to be very not grounded but centered and identified with this self before I can even leave the house how do you go about doing that and one of the reasons I'm asking this is because I think everyone including myself would do well to be able to access this compassionate witness self but also because so many people are on social media nowadays where you can almost feel yourself getting pulled down these um on these trajectories like the gravitational pull of a battle or or a video or or even something that's delightful but then you find like two hours went by and you were you overc consumed and and underc created in some sense junk food it tastes delicious but then you feel like it goes nowhere yeah you know this sort of goes nowhere um so do you have a practice that you to make sure that you're in that place I do and it's called suffering um it's very reli that made me laugh my best friend suffering I have a deeply LoveHate relationship with suffering if I'm for example um I can barely look at Instagram because I will watch a monkey nursing a kitten and then I will be down that rabbit hole so far you and me both eight hours later I'm but I will start to suffer I will start to physically feel cramped my eyes will start to hurt and water and I will start to feel what you were saying the grinding of a the gear that is wrong the machine isn't it's not in structural Integrity it's like when your car starts making a funny sound and you're like I should not ignore that and it always feels like discomfort tension anxiety um anger any of those things and then the practice of my life is to notice those Sensations at a finer and more granular level so that the moment I'm off true I can stop and say okay wo out of Integrity okay now I'm into anxiety because a divided person is always anxious so to get away from that from anxiety and back to true I use the body sit back straighten my spine take a deep breath do all the things that I'm sure you do when you meditate and then I sink into that part of myself that I was just trying to pull up for people with with the two hands exercise and I believe you could probably tell me the truth of this I believe that I've wired a pretty strong Super Highway in my brain that goes oops suffering find self with a capital S and I've done it so many thousands of times that I think I have like a highly melinated circuit that just goes there and then no matter what's happening I can usually just find it feel it and it it's an Exquisite sensation it's like coming home completely over and over again it's and now when I do an ideal day everything else is incidental the key is I'm in that self so the state is what's key yes and that it is so it has so much fun in this world and so you can walk around in that state oh yeah um you can so to be um sure I understand so say I wake up in the morning and I'm just like not feeling right or something triggers me or um I don't know just like I'm off center right um you take that sensation of of suffering yeah and you don't fear it you don't amplify it you just kind of pay attention to it you pay attention to it and here is the here is the key thing this is in my new book I kept this a secret because it sounded so silly and I thought this would never go in the ivy league but there something I call kissed k i t and it's stands for kind internal selft talk so what do you call yourself when you think to yourself Andrew Andy what you call yourself you yeah just yeah so you'd be sitting there and you get you don't feel good you don't feel right the first thing you do is allow your self to register every sensation without pushing back without restricting it people talk to me about bringing down their anxiety and I say how'd you feel if I told you I was going to bring you down that's not a nice thing to say if I told you I'm here to understand you and care about you better so just allow yourself to feel all the suffering and then start saying kind things to the one who is suffering even if it's just tiny suffering just go how are you how you doing not great ah okay so there's some anxiety oh your sinuses are blocked too let's see what could we do for you what let's get you a hot drink and like a a call with a good friend or a book or something and you just actively work as your own caregiver from the moment you are conscious in the morning and what that does is it makes you so compassionate to other people because you're not fighting the suffering in yourself yeah people in pain um are usually agitated and grumpy and so it's the uh inverse of that yeah yeah I I love this I mean in some sense the the words like self-parenting keep coming up in my mind because a lot of this is about learning to parent ourselves from the inside yeah and I and I do think that most you know we hear about inner child stuff and I think inner child work is very interesting I also think that as a biologist who spent the early part of my Care on developmental neurobiology like the same neural stuff is repurposed in adulthood like that's that's something that it's kind of obvious but we Overlook right I'm like I've got some inner adults here who aren't very happy too you know right right right you know that but the notion that like our attachments when we're young somehow that like those neural circuits are set aside so then we can form more mature adult attachments you know it's like no that's crazy we repurpose them so we're working we're working in an adult landscape with child based algorithms and depending on how childhood went you know that either can be spectacular or so so or complete disaster usually it's a combination that obstetrician at Harvard I would bet my last dime that he was still working on the same circuits he used when he was five and they were pretty scary you know like so yeah we all have um multiple causes of suffering but we also have I wouldn't actually call it inner parenting because that basically implies that only parents give that to to children and I think it's just humaning if you are truly Humane if you are truly in a in a state of self with a capital S there is nothing in you that wants to cause suffering for any other being right and there's nothing in you that doesn't want to help ease the suffering of the entire world so again now I'm into a kind of Asian modality of there's this bodh SBA prayer that goes um for as long as space endures and as long as sensient beings exist may I also abide that I might heal with my heart the miseries of the world and that part of us is in everyone and if we become those people it won't just be parents being kind to Children it will be humans being kind to each other the Earth and other all other beings and we may actually make it into another Century yeah no it's looking a it's looking a little sketchy right now I mean things are are tense it sounds like it starts with um self love compassion like like only from that place of compassionate witness self with a cap capital S excuse me can we be at our best for others I believe it's actually the only part of us that's real I talked a minute ago about people who are dying they they drop the pretense they don't need the pretense of belonging to the material world or the material body anymore and they that Radiance begins to gather in their eyes and it's not new it's what they came in with if you've looked into the eyes of a young child a little baby you see the same thing and it's only when people die that they put down everything else unless as aart says you die before you die and learn that there is no death because that self does not feel physical it feels metaphysical let's um if you would let's drill into this a little bit more because this is a high level but at the same time basic and yet abstract yeah concept and um it's not often on this podcast that we talk about abstract Concepts um we probably don't do it enough we get like I like talk about protocols you get your sunlight you know and I love that stuff too but as probably people Realize by now I I think a great life is is bridging as many things at least for me as as possible and seeing the overlap in the ven diagrams um so it's the only part of us that's real um meaning the other parts are just conditioned I think you've said parts are impermanent they will vanish everything as Shakespeare says every will just disappear and leave not a wreck behind we are such stuff as dreams are made on um there is an experience that is common to individuals all over the world in different cultures at different times where they start to say they feel as if they've awakened from a dream Plato did it with his cave analogy he said you know imagine that we all live chained in a cave and there's a fire behind us and we see Shadows on the wall and that's what we call re and then someone gets out of the cave and goes outside and sees this three-dimensional world where everything's bright and mobile and goes back and says people that this is the Shadows on the wall are real they're real Shadows but they're not the Ultimate Reality you should come outside and see it and Plato said everybody would see say he was crazy and that's what Academia says now you're crazy if you've ever had an experience where you felt like there was something realer than your physical self you're crazy like read Playdoh well it's interesting because a few years ago um so many Concepts that I was intrigued by um breath work for instance um psychedelics yep um meditation I mean now people get federal grants to study this stuff yeah and we do reductionist work to try and understand in fact I had to disguise breath work as respiration physiology um which we did and we did a clinical trial you know lo and behold certain patterns of breathing shift your internal State and your sleep and your anxiety it's like a du it's like a giant duh but it was it was scary territory for a while and um and now you know psychedelics have kind of broken through as I mean I had I mean I just have to say this with like while touching my forehead and like like that they adjust neuromodulators just like but differently than certain drugs that adjust neuromodulators and everyone accepted so the changing neuromodulators to change conscious experience and in that altered experience to be able to achieve neuroplasticity is like a it's also a big duh of course it works that way but six years ago you'd get fired I know from University if you said well maybe psilocybin could be an interesting compound for you know depressed people but and by the way I'm not suggesting everyone run out and take a bunch of psilocybin especially if you're depressed but there and not without supervision but if you can got somebody really good at it yeah I'm not saying do it either but I'm not saying don't do it right and and there and if you're you know um more gunshy31 know somebody who achieved some relief through meditation or some benefits of meditation so now you know everyone I think accepts like meditation can be very useful for lowering stress and altering conscious experience this is not new stuff as as everyone knows it's gone back thousands of years so it sounds like getting into the capital S self the compassionate witness is Step number one and so I just want to make sure that we make clear how one does that yeah it's not step step number one is suffering okay we all have that you may have never felt good in your life listener but you have suffered that's for sure that's the first Noble Truth of Buddhism there is suffering in this life pay attention to your suffering without fighting it allow it to be there I do this meditation if something's physically painful or emotionally painful I used to say let go let go to myself didn't work so one day I said all right you can stay let it stay and so I do a let stay meditation if there's pain let it stay if there's sorrow let it stay and as soon as I let it stay it begins to change so first step is suffering second step is compassionate attention to one's suffering with no resistance and the third step is to follow the compassion that is naturally being directed toward that suffering until you find yourself centered in it and that is a huge relief and I've done this in massive physical pain I've done it when I just lost people I loved it it's a very powerful maybe not a Panacea but not that far from it if you can get there you're still suffering but there's a peace that holds the suffering so lovingly that it it no longer concerns you so on one level that you're suffering and on a different level which feels more real to me there's only peace and compassion and wonder and joy and somebody asked me once if there's a metaphysical reality why is there suffering and I just heard coming out of my mouth because um because the self loves experience and is not afraid to suffer it's not afraid so then staying in that is highly motivated by the suffering you feel when you leave so to me that's First Step suffer Second Step pay attention to suffering third step follow compassion to its origin fourth step never stop doing that and every day every minute yeah yeah this is very relevant to me I I have always wondered about like do you push back against the feeling do you live with the feeling do you let it amplify it's there's so much contradiction yeah in inside of the typical discussion of these kinds of things that's one of the reasons I love your work so much is that um you don't tell people what to do but you provide paths yeah absolutely you do um absolutely I'd like to talk about um two things you know before I came in here I did a little meditation I do this before every episode but today I I just it like took only like a minute cuz it came to me so fast which is the two words that PO to mind were you know what's real what is true I mean I think so much of what we're talking about and so much of life is like what's real what's true yeah um certainly out in the world but like in US yeah like what I'm hearing is that at some level we need to not trust our thinking but of course there are times when we need to trust our thinking yeah and then of course we're receiving messages about what's real what's not real what's true what's not true sometimes about us I mean there's all this childhood programming right right how do we start to sort through this this I I'm guessing that it has something to do with being in that compassionate witness place but but let's say well you've experienced in your life I know because you've written and talked about this and I certainly have now that by some interesting twist of fate I'm a public facing person people saying things about you or about me that are not true yeah or that are judgments that don't feel good yeah um and we are not alone in this right you don't have to be facing in order to experience this people all the time are being told they are stupid sometimes they're being told they are brilliant and they know they're not brilliant you know this can go in every direction how are we supposed to hold the narratives the voices that we hear in our head and outside us in a way that really allows us to be our best essential selves well I would can I reverse it and talk about what's true first um so I remember sitting when I was 17 in the Lamont library at Harvard contemplating ending my life and like actually ending your oh yes yes um and looking at the equally miserable scratchings that other teenagers had put in the wood there and I thought okay they say the truth will set you free all right I'll give it a try and I just started trying to find out what was true and I I read through all the works of the of the greatest philosophers until I got to Emanuel Kant who says everything is screened through our perceptions so we can't know that anything is true for certain and I was I felt such relief okay I can't intellectually know what's true then if it's not true uh if I can't intellectually know something's true because everything's subjective what's useful what feels like truth to the body and I was interested uh that for example polygraph machines work uh because the body hates to lie um it it starts to send up a whole bunch of you know activation of stress systems and puts you in fight ORF flight and everything when you tell a lie or when you keep a secret so I just started thinking all right what makes my body contract and and weaken and what makes my body feel peaceful centered and grounded and you do so much work with the body I love that you're a brain body scientist because the body is incredibly wise so I just started letting myself test things like I was raised Mormon and uh very very Mormon so okay Mormonism oh boy that doesn't make me feel good at all it wasn't for you no and okay so God is not a white man who lives near the planet cob uh okay that is not true okay that feels better okay so I started following what made my body relax because my whole body as I said a few minutes ago is far more sophisticated has spent far more time being uh tinkered with by Evolution than my human ability to think in language so it has a response to truth or falsehood that's more subtle and sophisticated than my intellectual knowledge that's how I made the decision to keep my son that's how I've made almost all my decisions does it make my body relax and then does the mind come to the party and make the math work okay Mormonism says that all the American Indians are descended from a group of Israelites who came across in 600 BC in a boat to the Americas okay does the math work what does the genetic evidence say no they came over the illusion Straits and down um into the Americas when I was living in Utah they excommunicated a a DNA expert from the Mormon church for doing the the the data for finding the data that said the Mormon is that mormonism's claims were wrong so something that makes my body relax where it's also logically coherent that's the first thing and then what you find is if you really pursue that what is true what is true what is true everything that makes you suffer turns out to have flaws in the logic including I will die because I can't know I have no idea so to say that I will go out like a candle when my body dies is just as fundamentalist as saying I'm going to go sit on a cloud and play a harp I don't know Miss Arad Maharaj one of my favorite Yogi says the only true assertion that the mind can make is I do not know but you can feel what feels right to you so that's what ends up being real what's left over when you're eliminate all the things that feel deeply untrue to your body and don't make logical sense and some of those are things that our culture is very very fond of like everything has to be measured or it's not real is that true right so it's sounds like challenging or sitting with Doctrine and labels and stories that we've heard and that maybe we've internalized and just oh we've internalized them yeah yeah and and systematically exploring how those make us feel in our body yeah I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge one of our sponsors waking up waking up is a meditation app that offers hundreds of guided meditation programs mindfulness trainings yoga NRA sessions and more I started practicing meditation when I was about 15 years old and it made a profound impact on my life and by now there are thousands of quality peer reviewed studies that emphasize how useful mindfulness meditation can be for improving our Focus managing stress and anxiety improving our mood and much more in recent years I started using the waking up app for my meditations because I find it to be a terrific resource for allowing me to really be consistent with my meditation practice many people start a meditation practice and experience some benefits but but many people also have challenges keeping up with that practice what I and so many other people love about the waking up app is that it has a lot of different meditations to choose from and those meditations are of different durations so it makes it very easy to keep up with your meditation practice both from the perspective of novelty you never get tired of those meditations there's always something new to explore and to learn about yourself and about the effectiveness of meditation and you can always fit meditation into your schedule even if you only have two or three minutes per day in which to meditate I also really like doing Yoga Nidra or what is sometimes called non-sleep deep rest for about 10 or 20 minutes because it is a great way to restore mental and physical figure without the tiredness that some people experience when they wake up from a conventional nap if you'd like to try the waking up app please go to waking up.com huberman where you can access a free 30-day trial again that's waking up.com huberman to access a free 30-day trial I recall um the inverse of the perfect day exercise was another one that I I did which was like just call it what it was it was like the the sucky day like the shitty day right like or just where you'd imagine something really terrible and then how it would cause the body to contract oh yeah and to recognize you know the other side of the coin yeah right and and just learning of that relationship between the body and thought yeah I mean I can say from my own experience that one of the biggest mistakes I ever made was teaching myself to be more resilient to certain forms of stress really one of the worst mistakes I ever made I mean I and my lab studies stress and I talk about stress relief and physiological size are a great way to you know reduce real- time stress and I I stand by that so I'm not talking about that I stand by meditation and saunas and all the things that make us feel vacation the things that relax us so I'm not saying the ability to modulate stress is is incredibly powerful and useful I believe that yeah um for sure but um when I was a kid I wasn't the kid that was going to hold the firecracker till the last second right I wasn't the kid that would um do the really daring thing I had friends like that and I felt um kind of sheepish about that those friends are probably dead by now they're not doing well they're not doing that's true and and I grew up um in the then very parentless community of of skateboarders that we a lot of us were really wild we were very free which I love the freedom part but there was a lot of Mayhem and craziness especially back then yeah um and it's a beautiful culture I'm still friends with a lot of those folks um but those cultures yeah split off basically into thirds over time about a third dead are in jail about a third doing incredibly well personally and professionally incredibly well and then the third like doing well but they're not like um still as ambitious about that they're more focused on their personal lives and I hope that's what they want to be doing so um that's kind of how it broke down but I remember as a young kid and then in that culture like learning to push myself yeah past the feeling of like this is dangerous to the point where as I got older and my body eventually got stronger because back then I was always getting hurt which is why I left that uh sport wasn't very good I for the record wasn't very good um good enough but not not not where I wanted to that over time I remember when I started doing science I realized this is crazy skateboarding you fall you hurt yourself so badly you can't do it anymore that doesn't happen with studying so I'll just study Until I Collapse yeah I'll just work until I'm sick I'll just you know like that person down the hall puts in 80 hours well then I'll do a 100 and I'm not a competitive person by nature and or even worse you know in my in my mid-40s getting into like stupid stuff like kit great white shark diving to the point where I had an air failure oh my God this is all you know this whole thing and then coming back from them like like what am I doing and what I what had happened is I learned to override the signals of the body right and it was like when is enough enough it's like when the reap when the reaper comes you know um and so I think that if we don't listen to the signals that our body sends and we learn to override them repeatedly and systematically we can place ourselves into real psychological emotional and physical danger and and and I just like I don't know why I just felt like this was a need to do this in order to grow up and now I try and do the exact opposite it's like and then I feel bad I feel kind of lazy I'm like I'm not like running at 500 a.m. I'm like sleeping at 5 a.m. I'm doing yoga NRA I'm doing Yoga Nidra at 7:00 a.m. CU I didn't feel I slept enough and then I have friends in the public facing health health space they're like they push so hard I'm I'm lazy and then um so it can go too far well we have this culture of push push push produce produce produce one of my favorite Heroes along with Oliver saxs is uh Ian mcgilchrist at Oxford I love that man I may someday he may wake up someday just just find me crouched on his bed watching him sleep he's like he's not just a neurologist don't be not in a creepy way not in a creepy way sir um but he talks about how our particular culture for the last few hundred years has veered towards stuff that is preferentially favored by the left hemisphere of the brain and it has to do with grasping things and producing physical things and getting things to happen controlling them where the right side of the brain and of course it's all I'm oversimplifying massively but functions like meaning synthesis combinations of uh different bits of knowledge we're moving away from those and one of my good friends is Jill bolty Taylor who had she was a Harvard neuroanatomist and she had a massive left hemisphere stroke right and so she suddenly she watched her left hemisphere go off the she had a brain bleed and it would pulse so her left hemisphere would be there and she'd see everything as solid and measurable and all verbal and then it would go off and she was in a world where she was like a fluid the of the universe and she would watch she was in the shower and she watched her hand on the tiles dissolve into fields of energy and you were talking about energy earlier she said by the time her left hemisphere had shut down completely she managed to get a phone call made she couldn't talk by the time the phone call went through she got to a hospital took her eight years to come back to full functioning but she said during that time I did not know people's name names I didn't know the word person but boy could I feel people's energy and as she healed she didn't bother to get rid of her ability to feel People's Energy so she she's a great fan of using the whole brain whole brain living is her latest book and it's great um but Ian mcgilchrist talks about how when we don't use the whole brain his book The Master and his Emissary says the part of the brain that knows meaning should be the master and the data collector is just the emissary but the data collector has taken over in Western um Society um Western educated industrialized Rich Democratic if you want to get technical um and so what you were doing to yourself was completely irrational completely you should you should get the Darwin Award for taking yourself out of the gene pool it was like the stupidest thing I remember thinking like what am I doing and of course we used it to get virtual reality for our lab we did a bunch of things that I thought were useful that we transmuted into studies on stress and um so there was always a a purpose in a story that could justify being there oh there is yeah um and one that was really rooted in goodness and Adventure I love adventure and I'm super curious I think it's cool that you did that I think it's really useful I mean there are many situations where your ability to do that could be really useful um like a pair of scissors could be really useful but when you're like trying to reder the baby you put the scissors down it's a tool that you can use and it's fascinating I did martial arts for eight years and I loved pushing myself to the point where I was bruised and bleeding and my doctor thought I was a victim of domestic abuse I think it's useful and even fun but you have to know when your heart's in it and when your heart is not in it when your self is delighting in the adventure and when self says no Andrew peace be still you know enough yeah yeah I mean that's a perfect segue uh but before I move on um I want to make sure that I linked back what you said because I I think it's exceptionally valuable about what's real what's true so to really evaluate what's true you need to sit or maybe one can learn to do this while in motion and sense within one's body what feels liberating opening versus what feels Contracting is that right yeah the Buddha used to say he said this often that wherever you find um the ocean whatever it looks like you can know it because the ocean always tastes of salt and wherever you find a wakening or Enlightenment no matter what it looks like you will know it because it always tastes of Freedom so not it's not that you stop suffering it's that you are free you are free to in interact with your own suffering in a new way and that is peace so you look and it literally physically affects the body as not free free and if every anybody out there listening go to a really rough time in your life and imagine it I mean go to that time in your life when you were pushing yourself and you can actually remember the tightness in your throat in your back and your it's contracted and then remember the best moment of your life and what was happening then and all your muscles will loosen relax and open and that is my gauge of Truth does it Set Me Free the truth sets you free so whatever sets you free is the truth um then reality is going to start changing for you with or without psychedelics and I remember sitting in the I had this overwhelming obsession with meditation when I turned 50 and I just bought this place in the woods in central California and I'd go out and sprinkle myself with bird seed and meditate in the forest all day while the Chipmunks came and the birds would land on me nice oh it was amazing and about six months into really meditating for hours every day I kind of had an experience like Jill bti tayor in the shower where I was in the forest with the Chipmunks and birds and then it was just light and it was like it was so startling it was like I'd fallen off a cliff like I couldn't see the ground I couldn't I and then so and then everything was back and then it started happening a lot and I read in shamanic Traditions they call this experience stopping the world and it can happen through the guidance of a you Shaman or a plant or whatever it was happening to me through meditation and in that space of Light which I stopped fearing after a while it looked as if this thing we're doing now is a video game if you and I were sitting and playing a video game you would choose a character I would choose a character you'd stab me with a sword I'd hit you with a mace and we would say you are hurting me you are killing me but really we'd be talking about characters in a video game and then somebody would come say let's go get lunch and we would put it down and go stop stabbing each other and be friends um it feels to me as if this is more like a game than reality the whole physical everything and I call this you me and you call that me and I call it you and when the Game Stops however that happens there's a level of reality as different from this one as a video game is from threedimensional life there's a world outside the cave and I don't know what it is and I may be wrong I don't care I love it um I'm gonna mention Rick ruin again a few years back um I called him up and I just said like Rick you're not going to believe this and I relayed to him a story about someone that I knew really well and this like very like just kind of wild set of discoveries that someone else had Unearthed about their life being completely different than it had been presented and their business was a they failed like the whole thing just collapsed and and Rick just wrote back he said um Back To Nature the only truth oh yeah like that's very Rick like he's you know that's how he talk rela exactly he said um he said well I actually sorry it was preceded by he said um I said did you read this do you see this like I can't believe this and I like know this person really well and like can't like for a very long time and he just said it's all lies Back To Nature the only truth and I just like and that just like got like tattooed in my brain because so much of what we see and like and the shock and like I can't believe it and I think he was referring to something similar um he also has said and you're going to get a kick out of this I think so Rick loves professional wrestling he watches 10 hours a week of professional wrestling why well first of all he believes that it's the the only thing that humans have created that's real why because everyone agrees that it's not real fake it's fake and that he likes that no one gets hurt actually I mean people actually can get hurt but that no one's trying to actually hurt the other person they're collaborating in this kind of Shakespearean dance that they do and you have the different characters and so I went to see professional wrestling with Rick thinking like what am I doing here like it was like loud in the flames and all like not a scene I would normally take myself to on a Friday and it was so much fun mostly because of how delighted Rick was in sing and his son as well so we can distinguish or like really identify what's true through this practice as close as we we can't ever know completely what's true the whole the bonian method is accept nothing until it's proven true well we can't prove anything true we could all be dreaming this so I decided that I would would accept everything until I'm convinced that it's false so I don't really believe anything but I'm willing to like a scientist yeah I don't believe anything because I can't nothing can be absolutely proven but I do know what's most useful to me what makes me healthy I've had a really really um sick weak body most of my life and it became a big part of my navigational system I now think I have um the the MCAS uh Mass Cell Activation Syndrome you put out a podcast on that my daughter's been diag iagnosed with it I probably have it and it's just this weird random thing where you get symptoms in different parts of your body it's overactive immune system yeah and um it'll protect you from cancer does it really well it turns out that people that run kind of more towards autoimmune conditions like people who have skin conditions that are autoimmune based have fewer skin cancers yay because the immune system is combating all these Invaders com everything so there's a yeah if there's if there's an upside I is the basis of a lot of the logic related to immunotherapies for cancers is trying to have the immune system fight off these mutations that are always occurring in the background so I'm not I'm not trying to take away from the suffering it's created but but that's an upside and my mother had it and I just wish she had lived to see the um the diagnosis even exists but my daughter called me from England the other day and we were talking about the fact that she has that diagnosis and she said I am I am allergic to my own godamn emotions and I was like yeah we both are and my whole journey has been really really accelerated by the fact that if I go off true for myself emotionally psychologically metaphysically whatever I immediately get physical symptoms of some kind but when I am true to myself they all subside and I get this unbelievable health so I've been told that I had five different Progressive incurable diseases I don't have any symptoms but if I allow myself to be untrue to myself if I allow allow myself to get out of Integrity I suffer intensely and immediately and in a very real way so I don't know what's true but I know what keeps me healthy and I know it feels like freedom and if I hit a thought like um there is nothing to us but physical matter and it feels like tension like when I put down my dog and I felt something go through me as she died um it was like I don't know whether that I was feeling something that was real but that's as close to the truth as I can get and if I see right now what what's happening to me I'm getting into this self thing and as I'm talking about this dog I feel that dog and I can feel I'm going to sound crazy no you can't not not if you're talking about dogs and feeling I know right you might make me cry cuz I'm thinking about no CU I think I can sense it yeah I think I can sense it and forgive me if I'm I'm like you know like like now sounding like totally crazy if anyone's listening like this I will say and I have a I'm just going to be blunt I got a lot of training in Neuroscience I got Decades of training in it and I'll tell you the notion of energy is not mysterious at all I mean neurons are electricity and chemical exchange and that happens locally and it happens at a distance yeah we our phones are electronic circuits that communicate at a distance we are electronic circuits why shouldn't we communicate at a distance that's right and the Really Forward Thinking neuroscientists are starting to put multiple people into scanners and putting people in Scanners in different locations and I know it sounds like people are oh no like what are you talking about this is like spoon bending stuff no the idea that thought and emotion at one location can impact thought and location at another one is act Magneto reception has been published in the journal science yeah so we're not outside the bounds of reality we are like actually finally as a field starting to acknowledge that this stuff exists and starting to to poke and prod around in there but people have known about this so for you the the sensing of your dog passing or you can feel them present that my dog was physical entity but my dog was also an energetic entity and that entity was something I could feel and this is I don't know how many a couple years later I start talking about that dog I feel it again and it is a I have okay so when I was pregnant with my son Adam the one of the big reasons I chose to keep the baby is that from the moment he was conceived I started having experiences that completely blew apart my understanding of reality my husband at the time was traveling in Asia a lot and when I would think about him it happen a lot at night for me I'd be like lying in bed and I would think about him and it would be daytime in Asia and I would suddenly be like in a three-dimensional movie where I'd be walking down a street in Japan or flying over a thunderstorm in an airplane and I'd see these very specific things very specific and then he would call me like the next day and say oh I was walking down this street in Japan and I saw this very specific banner and I flew over a thunderstorm and I the lightning was amazing and I started to realize I was picking up information that he was seeing and it was testable it kept happening so what is that it would have been so nonscientific of me to say that is completely insignificant don't pay any attention it it just was too weird and so that's when I decided I'll believe anything until I'm convinced it's false and that throws your whole mind open to understanding the universe as being far more mysterious than we than our culture likes to say it is and yes there's a danger of getting woo woo and crazy but as I said the math has to work too and you're just telling us how the neurophysics of energy are being tested and shown to be operative it is it's not woooo it's just at the outside edge of what our culture is willing to accept yeah and the instruments we have to measure things are just not there yet um but the same was said about most everything that has been clearly discovered and is Rock Solid over the last 50 plus years at least in Neuroscience um I can't help but uh just briefly share when I put Costello down because I did that myself a which sucked yeah but I didn't want to I didn't I mean so I the Vets they came to the house but it was at home and I was right there I didn't do I didn't do the injection okay good um no no no originally I I thought I would because unfortunately because of my previous job I had to do that a number of times yeah um that is not an accident no so but what was interesting is you know like he let out a big like sigh right there at the end but the wildest part of it was and I I swear it sounds like I'm making this up but I F at the moment he went I felt my heart heat up I thought I was going to be crushed like a broken heart and it and I swear it felt as if he was giving me all this energy back and it's because I had been spending so much time he was up in the middle of the night a lot he I he must have had some Dementia or that kind of thing and I mean I had that dog on everything I was injecting him with testosterone for the last part made him a lot healthier folks um don't let your dog breed you know indiscriminately but like I've got my theories about you know all the stuff at hormones and animals that a lot of the Vets are aligned with me on this one um talk to your vet talk to a progressive vet um you know I had him on a bunch of different drugs I had him you know he was he was really unhappy so letting it it was the right thing to do and uh I'll stop talking about it because I'll get i'll get too worked up but um forgive me but the um but that feeling it was like whoa and I can still feel it it's like he gave something back that now I think enough time pass I go get another dog and like it was it was almost like here here's all this resource and um and like gratitude and so these things sound kind of woo right could you do an experiment where you put me in the lab while I go through that sure would you see huge physiological changes sure I don't see the point of that kind of experiment because I think enough people have experienced these kinds of things that it's not necessary yeah in any case I want to talk about integrity and your way of Integrity you ran a very interesting experiment that um frankly it's going to sound a little scary to some people and maybe have to do it and maybe reflexive to other people um which is I think it was one year of no lying yes but like no lying of any kind not even to yourself no and especially not to myself yeah right um and previously on the podcast we had my colleague Dr Anna lmy who runs our dual diagnosis addiction Clinic she's done a tremendous service to the world talking about all the various kinds of addiction addiction as a disease yes but also something that people can overcome and one of the things that I love so much about Anna's message she wrote the book dopamine Nation but oh I love that yeah wonderful book is she talks about how recovered addicts are actually her Heroes because they've learned to navigate this internal process that most people perhaps who aren't addicts or don't think they are are constantly being yanked around by these dopamine systems but they've learned to conquer their own dopamine system right so they represent the heroes of of her world and I love that model because we tend to look at addicts and think about is like like we there's all this judgment on it but no I think they're I think it's amazing I think addicts are people who are hyp sensitive to the suffering that they are told to accept and so they're trying to medicate the suffering that comes from being out of integrity and and the society says you know um like I I talked to people I interviewed people who for this book who would go to their this one woman went with her husband to the psychiatrist and H they they said you know she's not happy doing the traditional wife role and they sat there and talked about what medication would enable her to fulfill this social role that she just didn't like and it never occurred to anybody to say say you know maybe don't do it if you don't like it that much and people are medicating themselves into a Conformity with social systems that are not in line with their true nature and addicts hurt and they sometimes they find a substance or they find an activity that gives them relief and so they use it because they're in a lot of pain and one until it becomes the source of pain yeah and it it always does and it's horrible but addiction specialist I know says it's like they're standing on a nail and trying to take enough drugs to stop the pain but that is not what you need to do when you're standing on a nail you need to take the nail out and the nail is the part of your life that you're living that's out of Integrity with your true nature because other people want you to live that way and they will force themselves they want to stay in the position of pain or fear push past it be stronger yeah I've spent a lot of my life there I'll confess and it's super un Pleasant and it's always led to like shitty things but how how laudable is it that you took what the culture told you was good and by God you learned to do it and we tell ourselves stories like well we if we achieve certain things then we'll be in a better position to do more for other people like there's the the martyrdom version of it too the reason I brought up Anna was she was the first to alert me to these studies that have been done about how myelination and growth of the prefrontal cortex is actually accelerated when people tell the truth truth especially around truths that are somewhat uncomfortable um and it's a beautiful literature that's small but starting to really emerge yeah and um and the big part of the recovery from addiction is people first like acknowledging the truth to themselves yeah and then to other people and you know again it's all of that's kind of shrouded by how we think about addicts like you know sadly in any major City and even small towns now you can see the the bent over you know like fenel ad and like we we judge we're like oh you know or we say it's so sad or um but that's just um you know an example of how far gone people can get in that particular addiction Anna offers an interesting idea which is that the more we tell these little micr truths the more connected to reality we are yes and in the way of Integrity you talk about this experiment that you did my question Integrity cleanse what so an Integrity cleanse so maybe you could explain what it is and um it sounds incredibly scary um it's not just the telling the truth part it's the realizing the truth part yeah yeah um I guess I'm going to start with the woo story um I was very sick and at one point they rushed me into surgery didn't know what was wrong with me I had some internal bleeding going on that's a long story wrote about it in another book point is during the surgery I regained conscious and sat up and looked at them operating on me which was surprising because I was lying down there and so I was like very disconcerted and I lay back down and I looked up between the surgical lights and between them appeared this ball of light that was much much much brighter than the surgical lights which are very bright and it was so beautiful I you just you can't describe it it's outside the cave and I was just completely obsessed by it and then it started to grow and when it touched me and it filled things it didn't bounce off things it filled them when it touched me this incredible joy and love and warmth flooded my body and I started to cry and my body was crying and the surgeons noticed these tears coming out of my eyes and they freaked out because they thought that I was feeling the surgery and crying was the only thing I could do about it so they were panicking and the anesthesiologist they told him you know bump up the medication later because I I grilled him later what did you give me what are the side effects what happens can I have some more um he he said afterward that when he went to increase the medication he said a voice said to him don't she's crying because she's happy and he said I just did what it said and he was white and shaking and he said did I do the right thing so I kind of told him a little of the story anyway this light was there wild yeah and I was just like home home home and it said yeah okay so this is this is what you really are and you're about to have a pretty tough time for a while um but just remember I'm always here even though you can't see me this and so I came out of that surgery and I thought I will not allow anything to my life that doesn't feel like that light oh that's what it it wasn't like it used language but it said this is not the way you feel after you die this is the way you're supposed to learn to feel all the time so in your body out of your body doesn't matter this is how you're meant to feel and believe me when I worked with heroin addicts they would describe their first high and it was as close to that as anything I'd heard people describe and I would say I believe you're meant to feel that way and also keep your teeth you know but um so I didn't tell a lie for a year I came out of it and Li I thought well lying is definitely not going to feel like that that light does not lie so no lies ever of any kind even the little micro like like when are you going to be home and you know it's 12 minutes and um and you say 10 can't say that say 12 do you like my my outfit no I do not I mean I found ways to I I would sort of try to soften the truth did it mean also telling every truth that was in your head you would keep certain things to yourself No in fact it felt untrue to say certain things to certain people it felt invasive or offensive and that didn't feel true sometimes silence was the greatest truth I could tell but I W I didn't even know that that was the case until I started my experiment so I did not lie for that year and I've done it many many times since but I would not recommend jumping into it 100% from a life that hasn't already been pretty examined what Anna has said and I think in the backdrop of what you're saying is that everybody does these little micro adjustments or um and you've said constantly and you've said that this is largely to smooth social interactions that most of lying is to smooth social interaction the research shows that most people lie at least three times within 10 minutes of meeting another person they lie to them and men are socially conditioned to tell lies that make them seem a little bit cooler than they maybe think they are for real and women people identified as women are socialized to tell lies that make other people feel good about themselves so it takes you in different directions um but I just wasn't going to tell any lie at all and let me just say that that year I it's not like I could say I lost these things but the fact is I dropped them I walked away from them my religion my uh with the religion went the family of origin um every friend I had growing up because to leave Mormonism is worse than murder in that Community I was cast into outer Darkness uh my marriage realized I was gay oops I hadn't figured that out at 29 came to you as a realization in that year yeah okay it must have been in your unconscious someplace prior there had never been there never been a like knock knock hey no I was so bent on being a good person according to my socialization the same way you were bent on being a a brave strong male according to the skateboarding culture I I would never have let that anywhere near my Consciousness and it had to be a series of experiences and my ex-husband was gay as well so um I'd known that about him for a while and so and I knew he was his best self when he was his gay self so that kind of helped but the marriage ended because of that um let's see what else happened oh oh yeah I quit Academia so my industry the thing I'd gone to all those years of school for my job means of support uh left my I was living in Utah at the time and I sort of fled for the border so I lost my home how were you feeling during this time better and better and better I think I expected you to be like it was horrible you're like no better and better it kind of was but not as horrible as staying in all those things and um the part that intrigues me um at the moment is like the losing of friends like losing of people and the structures that we relied on also for safety yeah that's got to be hard oh it's it's very yeah for the for parts of the psyche that are um you know very attached to socialization and and attached to people that are familiar to you it's heartbreaking really heartbreaking but that light gave me a full-on experience of the self and that I just I what it told me was it's always there my son who has Down syndrome one day told me um after his friend's mother died we're coming home from the funeral and he said I didn't cry and I said it's okay if you CED strong men cry and this is a sad time and he said it's not as hard after the light comes and opens your heart and he can barely talk and and so it was very garbled and I was like what a light came and opened your heart he said mhm I said when did this happen he said May 10th I was like this year no I was 13 wow and I was like you're holding out on me so this light had appeared in his room when he was having a really hard time kids with Down Syndrome don't have easy lives and it touched his heart and he said since then nothing was as hard and I said you know I saw it too and it said to me that it's always with us even though we can't see it and he said oh I can see it and I I was like you can and he was like yeah like he was sort of disappointed in me and I said well where is it is like up there down here in your head in your heart and he just looked at me and he said mom is everywhere he just sees the whole world illuminated and I think that's what I saw in the forest when suddenly the world would just turn to light it was that light so that was the field and as I lost each friendship as I lost each job as I faced the fear and the Heartbreak and everything those parts of me were dissolving and I was becoming more identified with that light and I that was the thing I was it was completely selfish I was not going back to the way I felt before I felt that light never going back there did you feel as if you had to accomplish certain things degrees Etc first in order to allow yourself this um because I hear this a lot you know and in the backdrop of this entire conversation I have um one little piece of neural real estate which is like devoted to the audience that is saying okay can do this things once I have a job once I have blank once I have the resources but at the same time I do want to highlight for people that everything that we've talked about in terms of practices and things to do like you just do them there there's no there's no purchase like it's inside of us right like there's no looking to something um in a package or in a even a program it it's all within us like so it can be done at really anywhere and with any resources or or lack thereof but but be gentle with yourself don't quit your job I mean I was very violent I was quite a lot like you you know the way I got to Harvard was I had a part of myself called fang that did not care what hurt me I'd go running in the snow I I remember once I bought running shoes that were too small and all my toenails came off during that run and I just kept running and I'd stop and take off another toenail and keep running I was able to be very brutal to myself living in Boston is brutal to me well you know on the plus side my feet were completely numb because of the cold so okay there's that but so you have some you have the capacity for extreme resilience yeah and it and it perhaps took took you too far yeah and I think that's why I did I did this massive Integrity cleanse when I was at a place where I was far far away from my true self and because of that it was a kind of violent breaking of connections so now if I'm coaching somebody I'm like be very gentle take the I call it one degree turns if you're flying a plane and you turn one degree North every half hour you won't even notice it's turning but you'll end up someplace very different so just gently move away from what causes you to suffer get yourself the hot cup of tea in the morning to soothe your throat listen to your own sorrow cancel a meeting because you just don't feel like doing it you know these are the things that bring you back to your truth and it's always loving and it's not loving necessarily to just say I'm going I'm going to say the truth about everything and I don't care who hates me for it that was just my way and inevitably a much Kinder more generous version of ourselves emerges when we're living our truth I mean it's for a foregone conclusion but still worth stating um yeah I can um personally say that most of my suffering has been the consequence of the fact that I am I love love yeah and um and I'm blessed with many great friends and uh things of that sort um business partners Etc but I have a tendency to get into relationships quickly and ending them feels near impossible and this has caused me and you know and also others too much suffering yeah you know and so a lot of that is the reason I raised this is that um it's about holding two truths at the same time which are feel incompatible on the one hand really loving and caring about someone yeah and at the same time knowing that the loving caring thing to do is to go separate ways and it's this relationship to loss that I sort of can't accept yeah or haven't been able to like I can accept that people die uhhuh um all three of my academic advisers wonderful people suicide cancer cancer like so I had to come to the conclusion pretty early on in my academic career like wow like I'm the common denominator I joke you know like and it got took me a long time to realize like this might not be my fault you know I know it's crazy like how how would that you know but I think that it also woke me up to the idea you know like Life as we know it in this life ends and so to try and make the most of it but the idea that people would move apart yeah even um in circumstances where death doesn't separate them to me it's like it's so painful yeah was it Keats who said that of all the ways there are to lose a person death is the kindest like that yeah yeah and this has roots and in in all sorts of things in me of course but the reason I raise it is that I think that when we have two incompatible truths yeah that's when we feel stuck like we love people we want to take care of them maybe we want them to remain in our lives but we have to like the Letting Go process sucks there can't be incompatible truths I think what happens is that you and just tell me where I'm wrong okay I could be completely full of crap it sounds to me like you're one of the people who who have a huge heart who sometimes confuse love with self-abandonment who loves so deeply that you want the joy of the of the Beloved more than you want your own Joy 100% and that is not love that is a hostage situation okay like um there's something I call spider love if you say to a spider how do you feel about flies it would say oh I love them and it expresses that love by immobilizing them wrapping them up and injecting them with poison and then sucking out their life force whenever it needs them and it loves those flies yum but love always sets the Beloved fre okay so there's a consumptive love and when you are a fly and you meet a spider um and you give your whole self to this person who goes yum yum yum yum yum I really want that you find yourself starved of your own uh your own validation your kindness to your true self and you've given it all to the other person and that's when it will not work and you may be missing the people who aren't looking for flies or who want to just I'm not going to extend this metaphor any further who just want to be with you as a whole human who want to know what your limitations are as well as their own who will say to you I have a new friend who uh had pneumonia and I wanted to talk to her on the phone and I told my assistant I don't care if I have pneumonia and she C she wrote me a text and she said do not impinge on your own health because you want me to feel loved I don't like it I want you to be healthy and I was like well so I would examine the moment where you become so entranced with another that you stop caring about yourself and try to feed your whole life to them because that's not love it's something our culture defines as love a lot of parents love their children that way but you have to be able to know exactly what you want to communicate to the other person and to have them say I completely respect that or you don't have a love situation you have codependency that's very useful thank you and I know it will be very useful to many people what um what is the suggestion for people um that are trying to figure out what they want or need or both um I'll I'll relate it to this relationship thing thing because it's it applies across everything but it's hardest in relationships and that is start to notice the first moment when part of you a deep part of you knew you were losing your threat you were losing your integrity so if you think about a relationship you had that ended poorly where you love the other person by giving your whole self to them which you've been taught is called love even though I don't think it is called love so and then look back on the first moment that she wanted something and you abandoned yourself to give it to her and it's usually very early in the relationship like day one yeah it's like this isn't safe exactly and you you just crushed right over that boundary that very sensitive inner vigilance that's saying this is how we stay whole and this is how we stay in integrity so most people with a job with a relationship with any choice they make they can trace it back when I pick up the pieces for them years later they're like oh that I knew that the first week and I stayed in there for 20 years so it's about as I said earlier being really granular in your experience of your own suffering and knowing that you are not here to suffer there's this big thing that men in our society are taught that if you know there are love songs like I would the the um I can't remember his name he won the Nobel Prize for literature and you know I would crawl down the Avenue black and blue to show My Love To Make You Feel My Love and it's like okay that's not showing me love you don't have to hurt yourself to show me love but maybe that's why you have to pull back six inches from your own eyes to brutalize yourself for other people that martyr uh archetype it's no it doesn't work yeah it's caused me and and I think others a lot of suffering because I think what ends up happening is that um when we get separation from that person then we do a little bit of self-recovery but then it it's it's like all fractured and repeat yeah and repeat right exactly what you just described as um extremely helpful I'm curious in your uh role as a coach to many people um how often are romantic relationships partnership type things whatever form that takes for people how often is that like the the bulk of what people struggle with at least in terms of what they bring to the table or is it more often I don't like my job I'm in the wrong life professionally you know if you had to give us like the the non peer-reviewed study but like kind of crude breakdown yeah I think because they Iden ify me as a coach they go to a therapist with relationship things but people come to me with my life's just not working that feeling whole thing oh great not working but in my job I need to change my job I need to get my purpose I need to have my life's meaning and it always ends up ending up to be about the relationship as well you know but it anybody anything we do that's dysfunctional for any part of ourselves is dysfunctional for every part of ourselves the way we do anything is the way we do everything so if you come in with a job issue because you're you know you've got a horrible boss but you never complain you're going to end up telling me that you're in a horrible marriage with a spouse who's awful but you never complain the same issues come forward as a kind of gift to show us over and over not that way no okay see that pattern no see that pattern no well it's interesting that you say that CU I feel like professionally it's like there's like a gravitation P like I wanted to get into tropical fish when I was a kid and I was like tropical fish I would spend all day at the tropical fish store then it was Birds then it was skateboarding then it was you know I want to be a firefighter like whatever eventually it was Neuroscience then it was podcasting you know it's just like I can't miss when I say that I mean I can't keep myself from doing what I really want yeah I would say likewise with friendships I'm fortunate to have a great relationship to my biological family it was Rock really Rocky for a lot of years but it's like cool the work has paid off and they've done a lot of work um in romantic partnership it's like a carve out it's been much more challenging I've had some amazing Partners in Partnerships like amazing um still on excellent terms with many of them yeah and then I've had some like really really brutal like barbed wire just like and you know I've had to take a look at my role on that too right right so in this case for me it's like a carve out I think of it as like this like wedge shaped carve out it just seems so much more challenging but I think in talking with you today it's clear that it's because of this thing of like it's not I'm not approaching it from the standpoint of like I want to do this and it's good for me yeah to be frank um whereas in the work domain it's like what feels good ends up being really good for me cuz for a while you did things that hurt you and then you realized no the things that hurt me I'm not going to do that I'm going to do the things I like when you bring another human being into it when it's a romantic partnership I think you still have the pattern of I will do things that hurt me I will abandon my sense of safety I will go over my own experienced internal boundary and you just haven't you've done it in other areas of your life but this is yeah this is a big one for you where you just haven't applied the same wisdom you've learned in other areas and I would guess that it's because you don't feel that that's loving to the other person if you decide you're not going to kill animals at your job you know the people at your lab aren't going to get be heartbroken but if you decide you don't want to live a certain kind of life with a another person that person's heart could get broken or at least they could feel that way they could genuinely feel pain so I think maybe that's why it's a cutout thing because this changing your job doesn't hurt someone but changing your relationship pattern somebody could get hurt and if you don't change your P pattern someone will also get hurt right well and that's often the case right and I think so this notion of others getting hurt when we make the choice that's most in line with our own Integrity whether it's relationship or family or the decision to move or leave a job how do you sit with that I mean I mean how do how does one sit with that I mean I think I have clearly internalized some script that says if someone else is really upset even you know and obviously the right thing is often not the thing that makes people feel best etc etc you know but um how do you work with that so there are different ways of reframing it and one example since you know a lot about addiction um if if somebody is Addicted to You pleasing them um you're pleasing them and going out of your inte Integrity to please them to give them whatever they want that pleases them your addiction as a codependent is giving them that emotional energy whatever they whatever gets them high and their their absorption of that energy and the imbalance that results it's as if they are getting high on you and an alcoholic if you take away the bottle of booze will tell you you are hurting me this is the worst thing you could ever do to you have no idea how much I'm suffering and the thing you have to do in an intervention is no it's the alcohol that's doing the hurting you know it's the overgiving it's allowing someone to consume your energy and to get high on it that is an addiction I will not let you do it I will separate from you person to person if you continue in your addictive pattern doesn't mean that we won't be together in the great self and that we're all on self and we can all love each other for ever but it is not kind to feed someone's addiction to eating your energy does that make sense yes it's not you have to do some tough love yeah the compassionate thing is to do the right thing yeah this is not helping you and they say but I want more of you and you say no no you really don't you want something false I was creating for you and it's actually not me you know my friends who why would you leave the church now you're lost to us and I was like no I was always a gay non Mormon you know I was just feeding you the story that I was a straight Mormon girl you know and I can't feed you that anymore it's making you sick it's making me sick it's not true and some of them I never saw again and some of them came around years later and said oh I figured it out and some probably still are really happy and think I'm going hell sorry I didn't to laugh at that but I did I don't know um I find it hilarious I mean sorry uh not sorry no that was I just nothing to do but laugh there um goodness yeah the I think this notion of things ending because we realized that we were telling lies yeah and gosh it even hurts to say yeah you know it's like because we weren't trying to tell lies we didn't we didn't know we were telling lies yeah it's an innocent mistake to me that often grows from what I think of as empathy probably not certainly not the best form of empathy yeah but I think that there's a a human phenotype that I'm familiar with where we we feel other people's emotions which I think is healthy can be healthy yeah and we love seeing people enjoy Y and we delighted it so it feels good to us yeah to you know feed this addiction oh I know the feeling it's it's not like it's like oh here I am marom like I'm bleeding out Bleeding Out bleeding out but it's not in line with this essential self and here I guess the the little vignette that's related to this is that I do think there's one very healthy form of this which is I believe at least for me with a dog I like other animals too but with a dog when we love them uh-huh we are seamlessly attached to their love of us and so loving them and empathizing with them means like double the love like we love them and we can feel their love and it's like a perfect it just sound feels like a perfect circle and with people that can happen too I imagine um felt that a few times I certainly feel that in my friendships I feel that with my sister um and I've felt it in a few of my romantic relationships but the empathy for the others pleasure can go too far yeah and then we when we quote unquote lose ourselves I think it's because there's a component of ourselves that's like not attached to the part that still has our own needs does that resonate oh totally yeah here's the thing you don't your dog expect your dog to pretend it's not a dog you don't deserve you don't expect your dog to stop loving walks and chasing a ball and just being a dog and when it's tired it'll go to sleep but often when we fall fall in love we try to make ourselves not who we are and try to become the person that will make the other maximally thrilled with us and I know exactly what you're talking about I have thrown like I love to give money to people makes them happy and then it never works well it works out only in cases where it feels true in my in my heart if I give if I overg give because someone's they're saying I need and doesn't feel good in the giving I am not being a dog a dog would say no this is where my limits are I'm going to go lie down on the floor and sleep but I will get an extra job to give money to people that I don't want to give money to after the first little while so we Bend ourselves out of our true being and I think the reason we love dogs so much is that they love but they love truly they love honestly they don't pretend to be something they're not and they don't have the empathy that says if your leg is broken I will break my own leg and lie down next to you so that I feel exactly the same pain you're feeling it is not empathy to feel everything the other person is feeling if they then take the broken leg example if you got hit by a car you're lying there screaming in anguish and I felt your feeling so strongly that I couldn't cope and I lay you know fell down in a faint um I had a client once who has passed away now so I'll tell this anecdote in her husband was like you he would give himself away and she gladly consumed all his life energy and one day he had a heart attack a near fatal heart attack and she called me and said I couldn't get him to take care of my needs while he was having this heart attack he just had it and I was like yeah he couldn't help that and she said well I told him he said I can't be there for you right now I'm having a heart attack and she said you're not the one whose husband may be dying from a heart attack she was so into consuming his energy that she actually said that with a straight face unbelievable she was expecting him to give empathy that's not empathy that's selling yourself out empathy acknowledges self other awareness they four components to a real empathy self other awareness I am not you as Byron Katie one of my favorites spiritual teacher says my favorite thing about separate bodies is that when you hurt I don't it's not my turn so good so good yeah another one is emotion regulation so you see something that's horrific and you can like this is where you can use your skills dealing with your emotions you bring it down okay I'm I'm a surgeon I'm dealing with a horrible ER accident I can't feel that I have to get to work so that's emotion regulation you can do that that um self- other awareness emotion regulation um are two other components but those are the two that I think we really need to focus on if you heard I don't it's not my turn and when you're hurting and I start to hurt too much because you're hurting I can bring myself back into my own body relax and be be contented in my own skin so that I can be present for you so here's the thing I love it's a short quote from a poem by haiz who was a 13th century Persian poet it's so simple remember it though troubled then stay with me for I am not I love that yeah that's being yourself in a relationship then stay with me for I am not but I'm really really unhappy I see that and I'm not unhappy but I really really want to be together I really see that that's how you feel and I don't want it it's so interesting because I I feel like in in the domain of work um and with my friends and largely with family um you know like giving feels great and then people are like saded and then they go on their way but I noticed the contrast um with romantic Partnerships when as I've said I I maintain good relationships with a couple of girlfriends that I had you know in some cases I'm good friends with her husbands like they actually one just came and visited with her sister and her kid recently and like on just great platonic terms but for years I like I didn't worry about them but I felt like I could still feel the energetic pull even though they weren't asking for anything right and then when I attended their wedding this particular person's wedding I was like I was like my work is done and I got to enjoy and still get to enjoy the friendship with the family yeah but it really showed me how much the the whole relation so much of the relationship had been about like trying to make sure the other person was okay you make it your job to make them happy and it is never your job to make another person happy you can not do it happiness is an inside job you cannot make another person happy you can't be you can't go far enough into someone else's sadness to make them happy you can't go far enough into their sickness to make them well you have to get out of your own sadness and your own sickness and then stay in your integrity with love for them and model what it is to be in your own skin which is the only one you're ever going to have my oldest child as a teenager I was so over involved in everything and uh they gave me a a song called Let Me Fall by a man who had fallen from a tree and been he broke his spine he was a paraplegic and he just says the one I will become will catch me don't catch me anymore and it was so hard as a parent to like let my child have you know suffer the slings and arrows of Outrageous Fortune and what they were telling me they're they them pronouns um was that this is my life and my suffering is my Birthright and am here to figure it out as I go and you are not loving me when you shove yourself into my Affairs to try to take away my suffering let me fall what a mature and um generous thing for them to say yeah they are iary it sounds like it this is your oldest the contrast and I think what drives a lot of what we're really talking about here is codependency oh yes yeah um for for those that don't know that we haven't caught on right exactly um is that sometimes when we cut people off or we just say hey I can give but only to this point yeah or you can get this aspect of me but not these other aspects especially if they've been receiving them before they get oh yes pissed I mean this I mean and it's unclear especially if the relationship had been different up until then that um you know like it that's why it sometimes feels unfair to do it's like oh yeah you know it's one thing to invite someone over for a drink then to discover that they're an alcoholic continue to fill their glass enjoy the exchange and then one day realize they're an alcoholic yeah and I guess that term isn't used anymore I've been told by many audience members forgive me it's alcohol use disorder I said that too I'm sorry no quite all right um I think that field of addiction medicine is nent enough that we're still making the transition and I don't say this by the way for political correctness I'm not a politically correct person it's just I've had to learn to reframe these things for the specific purpose of trying to be more to bring more people into the conversation also right I like the the sound of um I don't like the idea but the words alcohol use disorder the disorder piece is also controversial but what I love is that as soon as we start to name things and rename things we're all talking about those things and then there's no way out of the conversation so that's my that's my like kind of Jiu-Jitsu out of uh that so that means we have to talk about it just like autism spectrum disorder or Autism or or um neurotypical atypical well guess what folks now we're all talking about it and it needs to be talked about so in any case at some point there's the idea like I'm cutting you off and the person says but this is what we do yeah this is the the kind of promise that you made yeah and so then we find ourselves in like the other scripts of like well now I'm like being bad I'm CH I'm doing the right thing but I'm breaking a promise which we were told from like the time we're little like you don't do but only in the eyes of the other person if you come back into your own Integrity okay is did I promise to always give more than I can well I did by my actions I established a precedent isn't that a promise they say it's a promise no or if I did make a promise I was in error I apologize I made a mistake I I promised something I couldn't really give have you heard the term distinction burst um in the notion of uh galaxies developing or something like that no it's when pigeons are well awesome I am way off gtic I'm like trying to be Elon Musk here and and you're no it's about pigeons cool um it's about any animal I love pigeons I even have a pigeon tattoo I love yeah I do I love all the animals um anyway uh if you give pigeons they they Peck a lever and they get a pallet and you know unpredictable intervals which is highly motivating it's the most highly motivating thing they can do so and then if the pellets stop coming the pigeons go bananas they pick it a lot more they pick it angrily um they insist that the researchers promis them those pellets and then they just give up and go away cuz the pellets stopped coming when you have been giving too much and you realize that that and you say to stay in my Integrity I have to pull back and care for myself and that's where I stop and um the other person will put on an Extinction burst for sure and you your job is to stay inside your integrity until they stop pecking and they'll be much more healthy I had a golden retriever once who would just come and bark to be petted big huge dog but he was young and it was so annoying and we had to get a dog behaviorist to come in because he was just barking at everybody constantly to be petted and she said when he does that get up walk across the room go into another room and shut the door in his face and we were like that would be cruel she's like it's not cruel he'll understand it and I'll never forget watching him bark at and they got up walked out shut the door in his face he went he stood by the door then he went he went over and lay down he was like all right well that didn't work and you know that's ultimately what happens when you stay inside your integrity and don't let people play with you that way don't let them tug you around yeah yeah it's interesting because with work it's like I love learning organizing information having conversations like this and sharing them with the world it feels kind of like the relationship to a dog it's like this reciprocity and if people don't like it okay and if you like it great and if you love it even better but I would be doing it anyway that's like I'd be doing it anyway like there's no there's no feeling of of of loss there's no metabolizing of self any of that yeah I know and I call it what I what I in the book that I just wrote called Beyond anxiety I talk about when people like you live that way from their Joy they begin to create economic ecosystems you create so much value that in multiple ways people start to um you can get streams of income mult people pay me to do this and I still can't believe it I come in here and I talk to my producer who's also my business partner and my closest friend Rob and I I'm like I can't believe they pay us to do this I can't believe it and that's also how I felt about science the first time I looked down the microscope and saw a slice of a particular brain area called the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and we had labeled this and I turned to Barbara Chapman my graduate advisor there and I was like this is amazing and her response was so funny she was also Harvard trained Radcliffe um to be specific and she said yeah brains are really cool they're kind of like Little W nuts and I was like so Barbara one the smartest people I ever met she was just like and I was like and I thought and then I looked around her lab I was doing rotations where you get to sample different labs and you hope they'll take you and and she had green counters in her lab instead of black counters oh cool and she had pictures of mushrooms M and she had picture this picture of a cat coming out of a farm silo it's like it's hat and I thought I really like this lady I want to work here I want to do my PhD here yeah and I had already committed to another lab and I started sneaking into her laboratory at night to do bre the heart of the other lab I she got over it so in the professional domain I'm a completely different animal when it comes to these things I walked into the other woman's lab I she's done tremendously well without me so I just said listen I'm going to join this other lab but um like I have no trouble doing that in in the work domain none it's like you know when I started the podcast sure there were these voices in my head one of my colleagues going to think this and that and you know I was like nah I hope they're living their best life I'm going to live mine yeah like and I see them and some love it some hate it and some you know like really I can tell like I hear the judgments and I also hear the like I love it you know that kind of thing it's it's a mix um because public facing anything is going to evoke different responses from people and but I'm sort of like you do you I'll do me and um we'll both be good we live in this weird economy where you're supposed to get a job and it's all based on factory work you're suppos go to a place and do something you don't really like to get your little allowance and then you go home and that has only existed for the last couple hundred years since the Industrial Revolution before that people existed for hundreds of thousands of years doing what Hunting Fishing gardening weaving um singing songs telling stories doing the things that we do as Hobbies but we have this weird mindset that says no if I do things that bring me joy like a hobby does the things that people have been doing for hundreds of thousands of years if I just put my joy out there and see what I can do with the wild New Creations of our particular time um if I don't do the job I'm being weird somehow and it won't work but what I'm seeing is the economic structures of this Society are all being fractured they're falling apart around us and it's people who are afraid I used to watch this video of a of a tsunami that hit Sendai Japan in 2011 I think it was and it this wave comes in and it eats a city in 6 minutes this one wave and you watch the whole city like be ripped to shreds in six minutes and people are running into the buildings and then the buildings start to collapse and you know there are people in there and I I watched this and I thought there is so much change in our culture it's like that wave has hit us and then accidentally I hit something in YouTube or whatever and it switched to Mike Parson's surfing one of the biggest waves ever filmed it was a rogue wave and it went up like 70 feet and the camera pulls back and here's this a man a naked basically naked man on a board with a wave that is like the wrath of God and he's this tiny little figure the wave is seven stories tall and he comes riding down the face of that and it breaks over him and you think oh he's dead and then he shoots out of the spray just like shouting and I thought those are the choices we have right now we can run into the institutions that we think will keep us safe and change will crush us and drown us and kill us or we can deal with the fact that there's a huge wave of change in our society right now and everything's changing at an accelerating rate and we can risk running out naked and just with our joy and just balance on our joy and let the wave take us for a run you're surfing that's you know you are an example to the world of someone who is balanced in his Joy except in relationships but you'll get over that anyway she's taking some work he taking some work there's a woman hanging on to the end of your surfboard it's not going to unfortunately it's a lot more complicated than that but I am seeing a portal toward I guess what you're calling like true Integrity where in the back of my mind I I have this like very um vestigial understanding of what all of that relationship stuff actually looks like when it and feels like when it's right for me I just I think it's not going to look like the way I try to script it out do an ideal day with that relationship and it could be the weirdest thing you've ever heard of it will work I promise you I have a very weird relationship life that's reassuring to me I can't believe I'm going to say this on this podcast so I have two partners your partner is awesome oh I met well one I just met one of them uh one was the very first relationship I ever had with a woman that was 20 some years ago and then I was living on my Ranch and meditating all day and uh my partner Karen came to me and uh this Australian poet Rowan was staying on our ranch with some other people and Karen sat me down she said Marty I have to tell you I'm having very strong I don't know maybe maternal feelings toward Rowan I was like no they're not maternal I'm not getting a maternal energy and I got hit by this blast of joy joy joy it was like that white light thing it was like and I said you're in love with her this is amazing tell her to come in um I'll go I'll go to the guest room you guys can have the I was just like happy happy happy and I looked for jealousy and I looked for I was said this isn't supposed to work this way so Rowan came up and we all sat around talking and we sat around talking a lot more and we all sat on the same couch talking going this isn't weird is it and after a couple of weeks we realized everybody was in love with everybody and we couldn't live without each other and so that's how you that was eight years ago and we have a three-year-old named La lla who's delightful awesome and it is we call it Feeling Good by looking weird and you can cut it out on the podcast if it's too no we have no we have no no master no Overlord are you kidding me I mean what we're not I mean what we're talking about here is love first of all like I mean let's just be you know of all the of all the things to cut out of a podcast um we're not GNA cut love out of a podcast oh I love that about this podcast because a lot of people would yeah well not me um and for people that like bulk at that or or creates internal in them then I just invite you to um I don't know visit your um compassionate witness self see if it's still there and if it's still there then you know hey I I actually believe that humans partially based on developmental wiring P like experiences but also just differences in wiring I could just fundamentally believe in this you know I mean my one of my closest friends my third postto my third adviser who is my postdoc adviser at Stanford is the now unfortunately he died of pancreatic cancer the late Ben Baris he was born an identical twin girl wow okay then went up through Medical School living as a woman MH graduate school as a woman and then transitioned to Ben um pretty late in life so I only met Ben Ben was a close friend and then unfortunately had probably because he had the braat two mutation oh died of multiple cancers but that initiated by pancreatic cancer first transgender member of the national Academy of Sciences wow um I wrote his obituary for the journal Nature we were very very close and just an amazing very quirky dude you know um and didn't have a romantic partner at least not at the time when uh he passed or in the time that I knew him to my knowledge um and you know Ben used to say like there are components of our wiring that are ubiquitous yeah the parts that control breathing you know the parts that control heart and then there are part of our wiring that are just different and to me as a scientist like it makes perfect sense like the notion that any of that would be controversial is like what like it doesn't make any sense whatsoever that one would like not believe that people have differences in wiring because most people want to believe in differences in wiring when it's like convenient for their for themselves so I really appreciate that that you're sharing this and um because yeah the Every Which version works and I also learned from my graduate adviser Barbara Chapman she used to say Toler has to go both ways yes so I also like love and applaud like the whatever traditional nuclear family is still called that AB oh my gosh yes you know so but I would love you to really sit down get incredibly authentic with yourself and say honestly if I had the perfect romantic life what would it look like and be what you will call very selfish what I will call very much in your integrity don't tell yourself any lies about what you really want yeah it's it's very strange but both Karen and I felt like there was a tremendous absence before in the a couple of years before row came into our life and and we're just it's like we're a three-legged stool two-legged stools do not make sense to us they fall down um whatever comes into your vision of Joy whatever makes you feel free write it down and cons read it often and when you get into a relationship read it even more often maybe have the other person read and let the other person read it totally that would be that I can do as difficult as is to have certain conversations I could certainly write things down and just like slide an envelope what I'm after don't let me do the things in column B it won't end well I love it and I really appreciate that you shared that and I know people listening will as well I hope so and if not I read a book by Samantha BB be a wonderful comedian and she says here's what you say when people tell you that you're horrible and you're doing something awful you say I like it that's well one of the reasons I oriented very young towards and still love punk rock music like that genre is because to me could be wrong maybe classical music being an exception but to me it's the only genre of music where all the versions of self and emotions are welcome there's angry music there's like political music there's sad music there's um you know music about friendship and camaraderie about loss and you look at the community like I I'm really into this stuff so look at the community like that my good friend Tim Armstrong has created around certain bands he's going to be on the Mount Rushmore punk rocker the great Joe Strummer from The Clash political music yeah yeah you know or Laura Jane Grace like one of the first transgendered like outwardly facing transgender uh people in in the punk rock community and does Amazing Music was against me and then Laura Jan Grace I'm like she's a hero of mine one of my short list of here I love love love her what she's done uh at so many levels and it's like there's like this tapestry of all the different humans and human experiences in a in a kind of sing Single genre yeah and I don't know much about other genas of music but I don't see that yeah I don't see that like maybe across the totality of rock and roll or what but you know and so like if ever there was a a sector of life that's like allinclusive yeah it's that but not because it's loud it's fast and it's anti it's like so much of it is like pro-social right you know so I think there's a big misunderstanding around that so that ethos is something that's always resonated and um and I feel the same way about like relationships or on social media one of the reasons I can go on social media and not have it like Spike My cortisol constantly is I'm there and I'm like okay there's some like mentally healthy people here some mentally unhealthy people here people are here to fight people are here to love people are here to find Partners people are here to flirt people are and you know what people are here to attack me like cool I'm glad I'm giving you a purpose for your morning you know that kind of thing I try and just approach it all that way where you just made all of this very clear in a much more succinct way where you just said like great I like it yeah I like it it's awesome yeah yours with with a with a re real genuine sense of Joy yeah like no like well I like it there's no there's no friction in that statement it's just I like it yeah I really like it I like a lot I love that you like it a lot and you can say it that way who can't like if it's all love nobody can really you can out love almost anything you're you're furious at me I like it I just out loved you and I I think that's why Jesus said you know charity never faileth it's not that you're going to win everything if you are a loving person is that no matter what happens it's like that self your suffering your pain your codependency whatever it loves it all bring it it loves it all and that means that no matter what you come at me with I can hold that in a field of love and my experience is love what was the quote from Jesus um it's I don't know if it's from Jesus but in I think it's in Paul says charity never faileth you know love never fails and it's because I can say I hate myself yes but I love the part of me that hates myself just out loved you were you all well of course the answer is going to be yes I was going to ask were you always like this meaning that you could hold this position on the balance beam and then I feel like you've taken this balance beam and like created this big Mesa for for others to stand on so so because it's a really stable place to be once you're there but getting to this place of like essential self and um the path to inte it I mean can I just say it the way I I feel it yeah yeah it's [ __ ] difficult yeah that's what I was I was about to use that same word I I think in order to be to become stable um I always say that the raw material for any good experience is its opposite so I was messed I was effed up beyond belief there snafu these are both military terms snafu means situation normal [ __ ] up Fubar means [ __ ] up beyond all recognition I was Fubar now I occasionally get snafu um but I was so Fubar the the suffering was so intense that when I learned to come home the contrast was very sharp and I never ever want to I never want to leave the Consciousness that that light is always with us and we can feel it If we're honest and that's all we have to do be honest and there it is Boom it's goddess I feel like it starts with the scope of self like we have to do this for ourselves before we can do this with and for other people yeah and then at some point the the fantasy in my mind right like it sounds like my mother my mother um from the youngest age I can remember in myself was talking about like trying to heal the world yeah and I've seen the toll it's taken on her like she'll call sometimes I'll be like how's it going and like something will have happened in the news like I can just tell like it it really wears on her yeah and it's hard for me to to hear and see cuz I've you know like I feel it too it's like goodness like do you feel like there's hope for our species I mean I'm trying to not throw the whole the whole problems of the world at you but no thinking about it I mean like what I'm almost 50 I feel like at this point I've seen enough like there's so much goodness in people yeah but there's also like the capacity for so much like misunderstanding bad you got the developmental wiring you got the hurt people hurt people we're all everyone's doing the best they can everyone wants safety and acceptance and they're just trying to find it this and like and then there are your truly Bad actors because they're either miswired or whatever and they're like creating Havoc like is there any real hope for like a different version of things that's persistent the first time I remember worrying about this I was four and I'm 10 years older than you are but I knew at four that I was here to try to help with something and um as I grew up it just wouldn't go away this feeling that I was supposed to help with something and in my teens it became I need to help change the way people think I don't know and then I started noticing other people who seem to be like me and I would be like I think they're on the same team I'm on and I was like What team what am I talking about and it all came to my head when I was in South Africa in the wilderness and I had a dream that my ancestors were coming to visit me and um I thought it was funny so I told it to some friends from the shangan tribe who reacted like this and then they ran and I was like what did I do wrong and later that night we're all sitting around the fire there are lions roaring they bring this little woman from mosan Beek and she's the S she's a shaman and she did her divinatory system which is she threw the bones for me because if you had dream I had you have to see a Sona right away or bad things will happen so she said stuff about me that was true but she could have Googled it you know and it was weird when she looked at me I felt like these ice needles going through me it was not cute but it was very int tense and what she said was there are people being born to be healers all over the world just like there are in the traditional tribes you need to go find them and tell them what they're here to do they're here to heal the world and they need the wisdom that the traditional people had and they need their technology and it was so interesting because she was like confused she acted very frightened and confused by what she was saying to me she had to get a group of people behind her who would chant we agree we agree because she was freaked out um but I think that in every traditional group of 100 to 150 people there were a few healers that were recognized by the elders as people who were the they were highly sensitive they were interested in Nature and Science they were interested in animals they were interested in the mystery they were interested in the Arts they were performers but they were also very like um introverted thinky thinky it's an archetype of healing of medicine person the coaches I coach I call it wayfinders which is a term from an anthropologist if you're born in that archetype if you have that phenotype I believe it's a phenotype and I believe it crops up in every 100 to 150 people several times and our culture has no word for it and no path for it but if we are going to save the world we will draw on whatever was born into us that makes us want to heal things and we will use the Technologies we've developed and we will use our joy and our refusal to participate in the nonsense of our culture and we will hold firm and we will try to change the way Humanity lives on this planet and I don't know which way it's going to go but I'm in the game and I kind of think you are too I have a feeling I am too and I'm certain that I'm in it thanks to you oh and seriously in in large part you know I told the story earlier that the patham on and the fact that anyone's listening to this and uh watching it is the consequence of having read your books and done the exercises and um and we'll continue to do them so I I must say um there really aren't words to express how much um this means to me that you would come here um take the time to share with us your your wisdom and to delve into some topics that are of particular interest to me um because I like everyone else I'm a work in progress who's curious about the best ways to to move forward and um yeah every time you speak um and just when you show up someplace it it's um an incredible thing everybody learns everybody gets better and everyone walks away with tools and um empowerment um and I just um just want to say thank you so much there's really not a whole lot else same to you you're just looking in the mirror thank you thank you that might be the only podcast ever end in tears thank you so much thank you for joining me for today's

Did you ever walk up to your buddy and say, "You know, my arm really hurts. You know, I injured it the other day." And what did your buddy do? They'd stomp on your foot. And you'd say, "Why the heck did you do that?" You and I must have grown up with the same friends. Oh, yeah, yeah. And they'd say, well, "Now, doesn't your arm feel better?" And I'd be like, "Well, yeah, it does." And yeah, I did grow up with those friends. I tell this story to some people and I sometimes just get the wide eyes like, "They did what?" Yeah, we are not making recommendations here. No, we're not making recommendations, but it's a real phenomenon. It was described by Le Bars late '70s, '78 or something like that, in rodent models initially. And what happens is that when you engage a nociceptive stimulus or a painful stimulus in a site distal different from where the primary pain is, it engages a brainstem circuit that has descending pathways to the spinal cord and inhibits pain. Amazing. Pain inhibits pain. It works.

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hi, everyone. I'm delighted to kick off this premium subscriber AMA. And today I have some great announcements to make, including the fact that we have now expanded our Scicomm That is the parent company of the Huberman Lab podcast, as some of you know. We've expanded our Scicomm Huberman Lab podcast philanthropy to support great, exciting science that is going to directly relate to mental health, physical health, and performance tools in the very near future. And we've been able to do that thanks to all of you because we use a significant portion of the funds from the premium channel subscribers to support exciting work on humans. So these are laboratories working on questions such as improving mental health, physical health, and performance from a variety of approaches at all major universities. And we've supported work at Stanford, Columbia University, University of Oregon coming up. We're actually supporting some programs related to student training and teaching in the realm of neuroscience and happiness. So some really exciting, groundbreaking areas all made possible thanks to you and the fact that we now have three dollar for dollar matches from exceptional donors. When we started this premium subscription model to support science, we had one, still have this one, absolutely spectacular dollar for dollar donor match from the Tiny Foundation. And now two others have joined in. So for every dollar that is used from the premium channel to support these exciting areas of research, we now have $3 being donated to match that $1. So we essentially have a 4x what we would otherwise give in terms of supporting exciting new research on humans in various laboratories at Stanford and elsewhere. I'll just touch on a few areas that we are supporting going forward. This is not an exhaustive list. But for instance, we are supporting some exciting work using deliberate heat exposure to treat symptoms of depression, a really interesting and forward-looking approach to treating depression for which there's already some really exciting preliminary results. We are going to be supporting work on goal setting at New York University. This is really exciting work. Many, many people struggle with goal setting and habit formation that can serve them in their career and in their personal life and fitness goals, health goals. This work directly relates to that. In other words, you're supporting that work. We are also supporting work on immune system, nervous system interactions. This is an area of science that's now really progressing quickly that explores how, especially in babies, and kids, and young adults, but also in more mature adults, interactions between the brain and nervous system and the immune system can cause all sorts of interesting susceptibilities, but also patterns of resilience in people that do specific things as it relates to supporting their immune system. So thanks to you and these dollar for dollar matching donors, we are able together, but mainly thanks to you, to support these exciting areas of human research. And as the data come in, we are going to relay what the new findings are and, of course, translate those where appropriate to protocols for improving mental health, physical health, and performance. So I want to extend a deep, deep, deep message of gratitude to you for supporting science, for supporting new research, and for supporting the evolution of new data to serve humanity. Thank you ever so much. OK, so without further ado, let's get to answering your questions about mental health, physical health, and performance. The first question comes from Robert. And the question is, is there any way to repair thinning skin as we age? I'm 77 years old. And in the last few years, the skin on my arms has gotten noticeably thinner. Thank you. Well, thank you for this question. It's a very timely question, given that we just had a solo episode. I did a solo episode about skin health and appearance on the podcast. I should mention that episode was reviewed by a derm oncologist. I consulted with different dermatologists prior to that episode. And my general sense is that it's been received very well. There are a few areas within the skin health and appearance field that are of controversy, mainly around sunscreens. I'll just go on record saying that it's very clear that excessive sun exposure will age skin more rapidly. That's just categorically true. So if anyone's debating that, there's an issue there. There shouldn't be any debate about that. It's absolutely true that sunscreen can help. And there are three major forms of sunscreen. This relates how to protect skin from thinning. One is a physical barrier. Pretty much nobody disputes a physical barrier, a hat, a long sleeve shirt, long pants, et cetera. However, those don't always cover all the areas of the body that need sun protection such as the ears, the back of the neck, portions of the face, and so forth. When it comes to sunscreens, sometimes called sun blocks, I think there's general agreement that the sunscreens-- and I'll use sunscreen and sun block interchangeably-- that are mineral-based, that is inorganic, meaning that the active ingredients are either zinc oxide, or titanium dioxide, or some combination of those up to a concentration of 25%, are generally deemed safe by most all dermatologists. Now, there are some people who will point out that there's some controversy around certain forms of titanium dioxide. The evidence for that, however, is not conclusive. I would say that if you're really, really concerned about any of that, then just stick with a pure zinc oxide formula up to 25%. Why would people not use zinc oxide formulas? Well, they tend to be kind of pasty. And they don't spread on very easily compared to some other sunscreen formulas. Sunscreens that are, quote unquote, "chemical based", everyone will say, well, everything is a chemical. Yes, but they're chemical based. They use a different approach to blocking, or reflecting, or absorbing UV rays. Those do indeed have some controversy around them. There are a few studies in which very large amounts of those chemical-containing sunscreens-- these are chemicals like oxybenzone, et cetera-- are applied to the skin. And they do make it into general circulation. They do blood draws. They see that some of these chemicals can be endocrine disruptors, leading some people to believe that chemical-based, or sunscreens that contain some of these chemicals, are to be avoided. Now, I want to be very clear on my stance, which is if you need sun protection and the choice is either to use those types of sunscreens occasionally versus no sun protection, I would say probably better to just use them. But if you are picking a sunscreen, a.k.a. Sunblock, where you are going to be using it all summer or very frequently, well, in that case, probably best to go with a mineral-based sunscreen because you'll be doing more frequent exposure application. And then, of course, there are people that will argue that the chemical-based sunscreens are, in fact, fine. And if that's your threshold, meaning that there isn't enough conclusive evidence that they're problematic, then that's fine. So those are the three general categories. But yes, sun will damage the skin. That doesn't mean you shouldn't get any sun exposure to your skin. Turns out that generating vitamin D, of course, getting your circadian rhythms right, hormone production, et cetera, actually requires some exposure to sunlight. You just don't want to do it during the highest UV index portions of the day, like the middle of the day. You don't want to burn. However, and please note this, you do not have to burn in order to put yourself at a greater risk for skin cancer. So avoid burns, but avoid excessive sun exposure for you as well. Now, back to Robert's question. The skin is thinning. Why is it thinning? Well, as we get older, the composition of the proteins in skin-- and there are many different proteins-- but in particular the collagen and elastin start to either mutate or weaken. There could be less production of these. The skin sometimes loses moisture as well. And the basic solution to this is the following. We know that sun protection will help. We also know-- and I cover this in the episode-- that there is some evidence-- I would say it's moderate evidence. It's not extremely strong. It's not weak-- that ingestion of collagen proteins, believe it or not, can improve skin elasticity. And the appearance of smoothness and plumpness as it's subjectively rated in these studies. You might ask yourself, well, how is that? Is it that you ingest collagen? And by the way, people typically do this at dosages of anywhere from you'll see as low as 5 grams per day, but as high as 30 grams per day of collagen protein. Typically, there's some vitamin C in there as well, which seems to help its absorption or utilization. And they will observe in these studies over time some improved elasticity, appearance of smoothness and plumpness of the skin. So should you ingest collagen protein? Well, the results are, again, statistically significant. But they're not overwhelming in the sense that you're not going to reverse all the thinning and what appears to be a kind of local sagging of the skin completely by ingesting collagen. But it can help. Collagen can be ingested through things like bone broth. By the way, collagen is a composition of not just skin, but of tendon, and ligaments, and things of that sort. Typically, people will get their collagen in powdered form. It's relatively inexpensive. There are a lot of different forms of this from fish, from animal sources. There are some plant-based sources. It's a little unclear whether or not those are as good. But in any event, 5 to 30 grams, typically 15 to 30 grams in most of the studies does seem to be moderately effective in improving skin elasticity, plumpness, and appearance of smoothness. So that's one area. The other area where there's some interesting research is red light exposure. So red light exposure is an interesting one because, of course, in sunlight we have full spectrum light. If you ever put a prism out and you get a light beam through it, you get the rainbow. It includes red. There are long wavelengths, a.k.a. red wavelengths of light. I pause as I say red wavelengths because they're actually long wavelengths of light that appear red. And it has been shown that light panels that are emitting red light or near-infrared light or typically both can also improve skin appearance if done for about 10 to 15 minutes per day, maybe five days per week minimum over the course of a few months. Again, the results in those studies are statistically significant in many of those studies. And I would place them in the moderate result, meaning it's not a striking result. But you could imagine combining red light with the collagen. So you start to get perhaps a synergistic effect. But those studies combining them have not been done. It does seem that one of the best, that is dermatologists supported ways, to improve skin appearance is to ingest a retinoid. Now, these are prescription drugs. The retinoids do require that you work with a qualified dermatologist. They require that you stay out of the sun for some period of time because they can increase sensitivity to the sun. But they will improve collagen composition. And that's from the inside out. And by the way, there are also some different supplements that one can take that can protect your skin so that you don't have to put sunscreen on. It's actually the extract of a vine. I did not cover that on the skin health and appearance episode. But we very soon have a guest, Dr. Teo Soleymani, who is an expert dermatologist, oncologist, trained at Stanford, and Harvard, and UCLA, who is going to talk about the use of essentially sun guarding by the ingestion of certain compounds that change the chemical composition of the skin from the inside. So that's very interesting. He also added another tool for improving skin appearance-- and this is true for the face and for the arms, et cetera-- is the use of laser resurfacing. Now, this is not a cosmetic procedure as much as it is a procedure to remove the very top epidermal layer, the very, very superficial layer of dead keratinocytes and other cells of the skin as a means to reduce cancer risk. So he's a derm oncologist. It does have the consequence of making skin look quite a bit younger. So it does work. And like anything in the realm of laser resurfacing and things of that sort, it does require a period of peeling, of staying out of sunlight and being really strict about that because the skin is more sensitive in the immediate days and even week after the laser resurfacing. It was kind of remarkable for me to learn that this laser resurfacing and the arytenoids are very well supported by dermatologists as a preventative measure for certain forms, not all forms, but certain forms of skin cancers, and that they can dramatically improve the appearance of skin, that is to make it look more youthful. So certainly, that would work on the arms as well. So we're talking about collagen, red light, retinoids, laser resurfacing by a qualified dermatologist, or derm oncologist ideally. And the reason I emphasize the derm part is there are a lot of people who do kind of plastic and cosmetic work on skin who are probably very qualified. And then there's probably some who are not as qualified. And there can be some real issues raised by using excessive laser power and things of that sort. This is something I also touched on in the episode. So those are the four major ones. And then of course, eating a diet that's low inflammatory, so limiting fried and highly processed foods, of course, making sure that you're getting enough essential fatty acids in the form of either supplementing or ingesting fatty fish oils. All of these sorts of things, fruits and vegetables, fiber, all the sorts of things that support healthy skin internally, some directly, some indirectly by virtue of the gut microbiome. So I think that's probably a sufficient answer. I will add one last thing for your question, Robert. It's very clear that the appearance of skin is also very supported by hydration and moisture. So applying a regular moisturizer, a high quality moisturizer regularly. Pick a non-fragranced moisturizer regularly to the arms. That will help as well. And then there's some more aggressive approaches that I'll talk about with Dr. Soleymani, things like hyaluronic acid and things of that sort that can help with the kind of plumpness or moisture of the skin. But we'll hold off for that episode, which comes out in a few weeks. So thanks again for your question. I like to think that those are some actionable tools. And then depending on people's disposable income, time, and energy they want to devote to this, you could go with the zero cost one, the moderate cost one, or the combination of all of them, if you're able to. OK, the next question comes from Jen Shah. How cold does the water need to be for cold therapy to be effective? This is a great question, especially since at least in the northern hemisphere, it's summer. And people are doing cold plunges more, cold showers. Such an effective tool for shifting the state of your mind. Any debate about deliberate cold exposure to me that centers around metabolism or how long the dopamine increase lasts is kind of a trivial one in my estimation because what do we know for sure? We know that deliberate cold exposure is very, very low cost or even cost saving if you use a cold shower because you're saving on the heating bill. We know that if you can afford a cold plunge or access a safe river, or stream, or cold plunge, great. What do we know it does? It changes your state. It shifts your state. It makes you more alert, not just while you're in there, but in the minutes and certainly up to an hour or more afterwards. And let's face it, rarely does it feel good getting in. Sometimes it feels good being in it because you're very, very warm before you get in it. Maybe you came from a run or from the sauna. But it always feels great getting out. And you always feel much better afterwards, provided you get the right stimulus, which is really what this question is about. So what is the right stimulus? How cold? Cold enough that you feel a bit uncomfortable and you want to get out, but you can safely stay in and you stay in for a little bit longer. Now, I know that sounds vague. But there has never been a systematic study of exactly how long to stay in at a given temperature at a given time of day. Why do I say at a given time of day? Well, try doing a cold shower first thing in the morning. It can be pretty rough, pretty jarring. Try doing it at night when you're tired. Far bigger barrier to getting in that cold shower or cold plunge, unless you are particularly warm because you exited the sauna or exceptionally motivated. So the point is to make the water just cold enough that you would kind of retract from it, that you don't want to be in it, but not so that it's like an icy burn, so cold that it burns. This is my opinion. I like to do deliberate cold exposure in the following way. I don't even do it for time. I do it for what I call walls. So if you're having a hard time even persuading yourself to get in the thing, well, then that's one wall you need to get over. And then if you get over that wall, which hopefully you do, you get in and you start to breathe very quickly. Just know that if it's very cold, you'll breathe quickly. And after about 20 seconds your ability to think clearly will come back online. That's right about the time that most people say that their hands or feet hurt. I do recommend putting your hands under-- it's not necessary-- but hands and feet under. If you're in the shower, getting your body as small as possible. Sometimes people will huddle in the shower. If you really want to make it uncomfortable, you can raise your arms and get it in your armpits, which is especially cold. But in any case, it should be uncomfortable. And then you should stay until you adapt to that. OK, so maybe that's 30 seconds. Maybe it's 10 seconds. Maybe it's a minute. And then I suggest getting out at that point. So I would say anywhere from one to three minutes for most people, maybe 30 seconds if you're really experiencing a lot of mental barriers to getting in there. And it should be just cold enough that you don't want to be in there, that you want to get out, but that you can stay in for that one to three minutes safely. Why do I say this? Well, if you get into very, very cold water, like 30 degree Fahrenheit water, and you're and really hyperventilating, you do run the risk of hypothermia. You run the risk of putting your cardiovascular system into shock. I mean, is a real danger to these things. And by the way, you should never, ever, ever do any kind of breathwork prior to getting into deliberate cold, prior to getting into very cold water because if you're doing a lot of exhaling, you're blowing off a lot of carbon dioxide. That will limit your gasp reflex. And there have been people who have done cyclic hyperventilation, deep breathing, then gone into water. And they didn't realize that they needed to breathe. They didn't get that gasp reflex early enough. And unfortunately, they blacked out and died. So that's very serious. So what do I recommend in terms of cold water? Great to have somebody there. Ideally, you have somebody there with you who's not in the water with you, who can monitor you. If you're talking about cold shower or cold plunge and you're talking about, OK, should I do it at 40 degrees or 45 degrees Fahrenheit, or 50 degrees, well, put your hand in, and then ask yourself, on a scale of 1 to 10, how eager am I to get in? If it's 10, well, then it's probably a little too warm. Or maybe you're just highly motivated. If it's a 5 or a 6 and you're kind of feeling some resistance, great, provided it's not so cold that it's dangerous. So for me, the typical temperature, if you just want me to throw one out there, is somewhere between 45 and 50 degrees. And a few of my friends who really like it extra cold or an ice bath will say, oh, that's weak. Well, that's what works for me. I never like the cold. I love getting out of it. Sometimes I like being in there after a little while. But I never like getting into it. I much prefer heat and the sauna. And while we're here I'll just mention, how hot for the sauna? Again, same thing. Hot enough that you feel a little uncomfortable, but not so hot that you put yourself in danger. And here we really have to emphasize danger because it doesn't take much of a temperature increase to overheat the brain. So for me, I'm pretty heat tolerant. So I'll put the traditional sauna, not infrared sauna, but traditional sauna to about 210. And I'll last about 10 to 20 minutes in there maximum. And then I'll go into the cold plunge and back and forth. So if you're going to do the cold plunge for the first time, maybe start at 55, 60 degrees and stay in a little longer. If you're going to be more experienced with this and you're more cold tolerant, try 45, 50. And then if you're really aggressive and you want to try getting down into the low 40s or so, high 30s, well then make sure you have somebody there and make sure that you don't force yourself to do something that's going to cause tissue damage or cardiovascular damage. Cold is a very potent stimulus. And you should go with the minimum effective dose. But you don't have to obsess over the difference between 58 degrees and 56 degrees, or 46 and 48. I think subjective feel is going to help. Just make sure that you build in some safeties so that you can adjust quickly, stay out of danger. No deep breathing prior to getting in there. Now, some of you might be asking, well, what about deep breathing while I'm in there? That's how I calm myself down. That's fine. But no emphasizing the exhales to blow off carbon dioxide. Certainly no submerging yourself intentionally. So be safe. Have fun with it. Deliberate cold exposure, I think, is a wonderful tool for increasing alertness, not just while you're in there, but when you get out. In fact, that's the best part, if you ask me, is getting out. All right, next question is from Katie. It's about self motivation. Do you any suggestions or steps to self motivate to start a new routine? I do. I do. I do. I do. First of all, be very careful who you announce and what you announce to people in terms of starting a new routine, unless they are going to really be on you about accountability. In general, talking to people about our goals, less effective, in my opinion. And there's some research to support this. Then just simply making the decision, writing it down, simple old school like me, 8 and 1/2 by 11 paper. Write down what the goal is. Give yourself a check for each day that you do it or the times of day that you do it. Sometimes signing your signature as if you have a contract with yourself can help. These are all different tricks. Some people will say, should you reward yourself for completing something? Sure. Should you scare yourself into doing something? Sure. There's data to support that also. I covered this in the episode with Emily Balcetis and about goal seeking and habits that I did as solo episodes. We have a newsletter on this. Here's the deal. There are going to be multiple barriers to starting a new routine. I do believe in incremental approaches to these things. Right now I'm working on some bonus chapters of my book. And while I'm a pretty motivated person, I'm excited to share that information with the world, I must say that setting aside time to do these bonus chapters has been challenging because I've got a lot else going on. So rather than tell people that I'm doing that, I actually have a contract with myself that I sign each time I complete anywhere from a 10 to 60-minute writing block. So a contract with yourself can really help. I think it's far more valuable than stating to the world what you're going to do. I don't know why that tends to work. But we know why stating to the world what you're going to do often wears off because typically-- and this reflects both good and bad things about human behavior and psychology-- typically people will support you by saying, great, you're going to do great, the book's going to be great, or your new exercise program is going to be great. And they're just supporting you, supporting you, supporting you. And that support turns out to be sufficient to create this mindset that you could do it at any point or you've got the support you need. Sometimes a little bit of additional friction, what Tim Ferriss would call fear setting, is a good idea. You think about worst outcomes if you don't do the thing. But let's face it, you can't lie to yourself and believe it. So if you know that not doing the thing isn't going to markedly change your life for the worse, well, in that case, you need some additional support. You need some additional motivation. So you could use all sorts of tools and protocols, like a cold shower to increase epinephrine, adrenaline, and dopamine and get more motivated, and then do something. You could-- and I think this is probably the best tool anyone could apply-- which would be to put away your phone, turn it off, put it in the other room. I now have a box for my phone that I've dedicated to keeping my phone in when I'm busy doing other types of work for which the presence of the phone would be an intrusion. It would limit my work output. I do think that the contract with self is going to be the best way. You say, I am going to do 30 minutes of whatever, resistance training three times a week. And then you're going to sign off by the end of the week. And when you complete each one, that's your reward to yourself, that you were accountable. There's no external reward. Why do I say this? The work itself should become the reward. We know this from all the work on growth mindset that we've talked about, Carol Dweck's wonderful work and David Yeager's wonderful work. He was a guest on the podcast. I've done solo episodes about their work, about growth mindset, that ultimately the work becoming the reward is how you're going to sustain motivation over time. So when you sign off that you did the work and that's the reward, well, then there's this kind of cyclical relationship between what you've promised yourself you would do, what you did, and rewarding yourself for the work, no additional external reward. The work becomes the reward. So I like the idea of being a bit of what we would call closed loop system on motivation rather than going out and seeking excessive support from others. And I say this not to isolate. I encourage healthy relationships, et cetera. But if we start seeking external validation or pressure in order to do what we know we want to do or would love to be able to do without external support, we limit ourselves. And when that support isn't there, we tend to be far less productive and move toward our goals far less well. So it's an internal process of reshaping your psychology. There's also some deeper psychology around this stuff of agency and what you feel you deserve. You deserve-- I'll tell you this because I believe everyone deserves to be able to better themselves through these kinds of self-directed actions. And I also like the idea of a closed loop because you can be really honest with yourself at the end of a week. Did you do your three sessions? Did you sign off three times? Keeping some of that reward system and validation internal really helps you become stronger, also to be able to support other people if they need your support. Whereas, if you have a committee of people that you rely on, that you need to hear from, you need their support in order to be motivated, well, that can be great. Coaches can be great. And support systems are wonderful. I don't think it's nearly as effective as being your own committee, your own chair and secretary, in this case, and member of your own committee. And then, of course, seek social support and reinforcement for other areas of your life that you need. And be a source of social support, but also encourage people to be in this kind of self-cyclical loop of motivation and to really impart the principles of growth mindset, which is really what we're talking about. Make the effort the reward. OK, I'm going to take a sip of tea here. Lou asks, what can you do if you're not getting enough rapid eye movement sleep? What are the consequences? OK, so to remind everybody, rapid eye movement sleep is more enriched towards the end of the night. It differs from slow wave sleep or deep sleep, tends to be dream-rich sleep. The dreams tend to be more elaborate. You also dream during deep sleep, during slow wave sleep. But your dreams are far more emotionally laden during rapid eye movement sleep, more vivid, et cetera. And rapid eye movement sleep is associated with learning. So getting enough rapid eye movement sleep, especially on the first night after trying to learn something is important. Rapid eye movement sleep is also important for removing the emotional load of previous day and previous days' experiences. So it's its own form of trauma therapy. During rapid eye movement sleep, your body is essentially incapable of releasing adrenaline. So you can have these very intense emotional experiences in your mind without adrenaline in your body. You're actually paralyzed during rapid eye movement sleep. It's a healthy paralysis. Sleep atonia it's called. How do you get more REM sleep? Well, one of the best ways to get more REM sleep is to simply add anywhere from 10 minutes to 30 minutes to your sleep schedule, adding that 10 to 30 minutes in the morning. Most people can't do that, however. Another way to increase the amount of rapid eye movement sleep that you get is to get a bigger surge of epinephrine of adrenaline in the early day prior to that sleep. So this is a great reason to do deliberate cold exposure in your shower in the morning. You could also get it through exercise, so exercising early in the morning. And then we're talking about the rapid eye movement sleep that occurs that same night. So we're talking about a Monday morning where you exercise and get deliberate cold exposure. By the way, it is true that if you do deliberate cold exposure after resistance training, you can limit some of the strength and hypertrophy increases or adaptations. But at other times, it seems to be fine. And there is zero evidence that taking a cold shower after resistance training is going to limit strength or hypertrophy adaptation. So you don't have to be too paranoid about deliberate cold exposure. In fact, I think the best recommendation I can make about deliberate cold exposure is neither be too paranoid nor too obsessive about it. So spiking your adrenaline a bit in the early part of the day with exercise and/or deliberate cold exposure can help get more rapid eye movement sleep later that night. Sleeping in a bit, even 10 minutes more going back to sleep. This is a case for hitting the snooze. You go back to sleep, maybe even two or three times. Of course, better to just sleep the whole way through until maximum long night is achieved, long night of sleep, that is. If you wake up and you're not rested enough, or if you're looking at your sleep score and you don't see enough rapid eye movement sleep, the other thing you can do is a non-sleep deep rest protocol, which, by the way, Matt Walker's laboratory and I are gearing up to do some studies on non-sleep deep rest and how it impacts the brain specifically. And this has been done in other studies, but not with modern methods in a while. So we're excited about that. So do a 10 to 30-minute, or 10 or 20-minute non-sleep deep rest protocol. Those are easy to find. I have zero cost ones that are on YouTube. You simply put NSDR Huberman. There's a 10-minute one, a 20-minute one. We have them in Spotify format. There's actually a link on the hubermanlab.com web page that links out to audio format so that you don't have to go on to YouTube. If you don't want to do that, you can download that script from Spotify. And that way you have it in your phone. You don't need to even have internet access. So if you're camping or you're out of internet access, you can still do that non-sleep deep rest. And then if you prefer a female voice, Kelly Boys, B-O-Y-S, has some wonderful NSDR and yoga nidra scripts on YouTube. She also is on the waking up app doing NSDR and yoga nidra. So I would do that first thing in the morning to get a bit more REM-like rest is what we'll call it until the data are in. REM-like rest puts the brain into this very interesting state with body completely still right. Similar to sleep atonia that you observe in REM sleep and mind active, very similar to REM sleep. This is actually our hypothesis, which is that non-sleep deep rest mimics rapid eye movement sleep. But that hypothesis still needs to be tested formally. And Dr. Walker and I are going to do that. So that's another way to get more REM sleep. The other way-- and this is kind of a tongue in cheek answer-- is if you don't get enough REM sleep on one night, you can be sure that if you allow yourself sufficient sleep the next night, you'll get more REM sleep than you normally would anyway had you slept well the previous night. What does all that mean? It means that there's something called the REM sleep rebound. If you don't sleep enough or you don't get enough REM sleep on, say, Monday night, Tuesday night when you go to sleep, provided you didn't blitz your system with caffeine, you're not ingesting anything that would disrupt your REM sleep, such as caffeine late in the day, or alcohol, which will disrupt REM sleep dramatically, well, then you will get more REM sleep on Tuesday night. There's a REM compensation. Anyone that's tracked their sleep has observed this. So that's another way. Right now, there's no clear pharmacology to induce more REM sleep, unfortunately. There are some tools to increase slow wave sleep, deep sleep pharmacologically. Some of the growth hormone secretagogues that are in common peptides will do that. But right now, there doesn't seem to be any pharmacology directed specifically at increasing REM sleep. There are a few. These go by brand names like Quviviq and things like that are thought to do this. But it's still somewhat debated as to whether or not they specifically increase REM sleep. Danielle says, the top three most impactful things schools could do to raise student capacity for learning? What a great question. Well, I'll add a fourth because I don't want to try and wriggle out of the question by just saying sleep again. But I think trying to get kids to sleep enough is going to be key. So that means off phones and iPads in the middle of the night. That means starting school a little bit later. I don't know if that's ever going to work. But that would be a marvelous thing for learning because as you know, or we all should know or remember, neuroplasticity and learning is triggered by focused attention, which is supported by having slept well the night before. But the actual rewiring of neural connections occurs when? It occurs during sleep, it occurs during deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. That's when the reorganization of neural connections occurs, the strengthening of particular synapses, the weakening of other synapses. And there's a small, small, small, perhaps infinitesimally small percentage of neuroplasticity that is the consequence of the addition of new neurons. So most neuroplasticity is not that. Most neuroplasticity is the reorganization of existing neural connections. But nonetheless, that happens during sleep. So getting kids to sleep enough, nap enough, sleep late if they need to is actually a great thing. But who knows if schools will change their protocols? What else can we do? What can schools do? Well, I'm a big fan, as you know, of non-sleep deep rest. Wouldn't it be wonderful if in every school it started the day with a five-minute meditation or non-sleep deep rest, where kids would do some quiet, focused breathing, bringing their attention back to their breathing, bringing their attention back to the spot just behind their forehead, just before beginning a learning session. Why? Why? Is it about mysticism? No. Is it about trying to understand consciousness? No. It's about a study done by Wendy Suzuki's laboratory at New York University. She's their current Dean of Letters and Sciences, as far as I know. She's a neuroscientist. She has a spectacular record in the field of neuroscience and psychology. And her laboratory showed that even a very brief meditation session-- in that particular study, it was about 13 minutes per day-- can significantly improve working memory, which is the ability to keep information online in one's mind active. It can increase other forms of memory. It can increase focus. It can decrease stress. And it is a zero cost tool. So I think unfortunately, we think of meditation as a mystical tool to explore consciousness. And it can be. But if you think about it, exercise can also be an ultramarathon to run 242 miles or something to win a trophy. Or it can be something to improve cardiovascular health. So similarly, meditation is just a perceptual exercise. I think that if kids learn that they can bring their perception internally to what we call interoception, as opposed to looking at things externally, exteroception, understand that they have some control, some regulation over their focus and attention, bringing their attention back to them to interoception whenever it drifts, well, then they get better at focus over time. And it improves learning in the long term, but also in the bout of learning that they go into immediately after. So if I had a magic wand, every classroom would begin a session of learning with five minutes or maybe even three minutes of what is typically known as third eye or focused meditation, with no interest in mysticism, pure interest in improving the bout of learning. I think another thing that schools should include to increase capacity for learning is they should include micro gaps. So we know that if you take gaps in information delivery-- so for instance, if I were to just pause now, and then continue. It seems kind of an odd interruption. And then every once in a while at random introduce a short 10-second pause or so, what do we know happens? We know based on now a number of different really high quality papers that have looked at musical learning, mathematical learning, concept learning, physical skill learning, that those little micro gaps allow for very rapid replay of the information that's relevant, for whatever reason, in reverse in the brain very quickly within the hippocampus and the neocortex areas of the brain critical for encoding and storage of memories. And these little micro gaps and the rapid replay of the information one is trying to learn at 20 to 30 times the normal rate increases the number of repetitions. You're basically getting 30 repetitions for doing nothing. This is exactly what happens in, what? In rapid eye movement sleep. When you learn something, like maybe you learned something today in our discussion thus far, and you go to sleep at night, there's a very strong chance that if we were to record from your brain, we would see that the same areas of your brain that were active during specific portions of this discussion, which arguably is more of a lecture than a discussion, but those brain areas would repeat at 20 to 30 times speed within a very compressed time. And then you'd go back to a different pattern of brain activity. What is going on? Well, in rapid eye movement sleep, the brain is rehearsing. It's generating repetitions of certain forms of behavior and certain forms of learning of cognitive information at high speed. You're generating more repetitions. And this is critical for the learning process. We know this from animal studies. We now know this from human studies as well. So if in the classroom teachers would just say, OK, we just finished discussing, I don't know, the cell cycle or the Krebs cycle. Now, let's take a moment. And students are not checking their phone at that time or reviewing the material at that time. They just got 20 to 30 repetitions of-- and by the way, at a subconscious level, they're not aware of it-- of the material they had just been exposed to. And so you introduce these at random. You could do anywhere from one to five of these per hour. You could do as many as 10 per hour, just introducing these brief micro rest intervals. There's a beautiful literature to support this. And the third thing that's very important is, I think, it's very, very clear that physical activity, in particular cardiovascular training, any kind of physical activity, running, jogging, swimming, et cetera, is going to facilitate learning, especially if the learning is done immediately after that activity. That's right. If the learning is done immediately after the activity. And that's probably related to the increase in the various catecholamines, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine associated with physical activity that making coding of new memories and coding of new information more readily accessible. So this is a call for including PE class or even just some basic movement, even walks or things of that sort. We can look at this through the other lens and say, what are the worst things for learning? Terrible sleep, being delivered information through a fire hose with no pauses. And forgive me if from time to time I tend to do that. Maybe I should start introducing micro gaps into the podcast. But you can always just pause it, go back to it. I feel like real life provides that. There is the strong, strong incentive for including some physical movement each day. And then I suppose if we were going to include another one, we'd say that kids and teachers should have a discussion about optimal learning protocols. They should understand where their thresholds are, after which their attention falls off. There's really no point in trying to learn information if you're not focused on what you're trying to learn. And then there's a whole discussion to be had about caffeine. There's a whole discussion to be had about nutrition as it relates to maintaining alertness throughout the day. Anyone that's ever gone into a lecture on a college campus, or a high school, or an elementary school even, after lunch, you'll see that people's brains are just kind of idling there in the background. It's the rare student that's rapt with attention even after a big lunch, even after running around outside. So structuring of the day properly is essential. And of course, get that sleep at night. OK, Alec, could you share your thoughts on how shilajit might influence cognitive function and physical health, specifically its impact to boost testosterone? I get a lot of questions about shilajit. Shilajit is a mineral pitch from the Himalayas. There are a lot of fake versions out there. But the authentic versions are basically-- this is stuff that basically, they take soil and grasses and a bunch of things and they mash it down. And they take the extract. And they create this stuff called shilajit, which sometimes is sold as a thick paste, kind of a tar-like paste. Sometimes it's in capsules. What do we know about shilajit? Shilajit contains minerals that are thought to augment some hormone pathways. And that's why people have argued and it's marketed that shilajit increases vitality. It's been argued that shilajit can increase testosterone, maybe estrogen as well. There are actually a few studies on this that are covered at examine.com. I'm going to bring up one just now so we can induce a little gap effect here if there's a pause. There is some data, not a ton, but there's some data that support the use of shilajit for testosterone increase. But I would place it on the low end of the effectiveness scale in terms of things to increase testosterone. And then of course, the real question is, are you getting enough authentic shilajit to really have an effect? The dosaging on this is very mysterious. In other words, I personally wouldn't place shilajit high on any list of ways to generate hormone support. There are far better ways. I mean, the best ways, of course, are to make sure that your body fat percentage is neither too high nor too low. The people who are overweight, who are obese, who lose body fat, will improve their hormone profiles dramatically. However, people who are already very lean, who get excessively lean, you can disrupt testosterone levels dramatically. And by the way, any time there's a discussion about testosterone, I want to remind that both men and women have testosterone. It's important in both men and women. Yes, it's related to libido. But having sufficiently high levels of estrogen in both men and women is also critical for libido. People that take drugs like anastrozole to disrupt the aromatase conversion of testosterone into estrogen can sometimes find themselves with reduced libido. And that's because estrogen is critical for libido in men and women, as is testosterone. So it's all about the ratios. Going back to shilajit, let's look at the human effect matrix on shilajit. There is one study here with 60 participants that cites a small increase, small but statistically significant increase in follicle-stimulating hormone, FSH, which in females is critical, in males is critical. And the extent of the increase is just very small. So it's not clear that it would be worth taking shilajit, given the risks and the cost. It depends on how aggressive you are in trying to increase testosterone. Certainly there are other ways. Sperm quality, one study showing a small improvement in sperm quality. One study of 60 participants showing a small increase in testosterone. And then, of course, there's a bunch of other things that have been looked at. The perhaps most impressive effect is a reduction in some LDLs. But again, even though I say the most impressive, it's still a small effect. So I wouldn't play shilajit high on the list of supplements to consider. Always, always, always before talking about supplements, you want to get your nutrition right. I've talked about how to do this. You want to be exercising, but not overtraining. You want to do both resistance training and cardiovascular training, maybe on the same day or different days, whatever your schedule allows. You want to make sure you get enough sleep at night. If you want to increase your testosterone significantly, get an extra 30 to 60 minutes of sleep each night. Even a 20-minute increase in rapid eye movement sleep is going to serve your testosterone far better than taking shilajit. Will taking shilajit Increase your vitality? Probably increase your energy a bit. You might increase libido a bit. You have to ask yourself, is it transient? Is that effect transient? Is it directly related to testosterone increases? Probably not. It's probably directly related to follicle stimulating hormone increases. And for women who have a menstrual cycle that is obviously, going to lead to different constellations of hormones, markedly different constellations of hormones, such as follicle stimulating hormone, estrogen, progestins, et cetera, different times throughout the cycle. Taking something like shilajit, because it can stimulate FSH release, can potentially disrupt that. If you're a male who's doing everything else, like you're exercising, you're sleeping well, your nutrition is locked in, you are taking creatine and fish oil, you're taking care of your gut microbiome and you want to experiment with shilajit, well, by all means, find a reliable source of shilajit. They are out there. Just look for one that has some testing for authenticity. And then you're likely to be able to see within about a week or so if it leads to a significant increase in vitality, libido, whatever it is that you're seeking. But I wouldn't place shilajit high on the list of things to pursue. And I will also say having tried shilajit, it's pretty messy. It's hard to get the dosage right in the tar form. The capsules make it a little bit easier. If you wanted to explore other ways to augment testosterone that have a bit more data to support them, I would say things like tongkat ali, which may have its effects on increasing libido in both men and women by virtue of increasing testosterone or maybe free testosterone. More likely, it's an increase in luteinizing hormone in that case, which is upstream of testosterone. So this can all get into some pretty extended discussions about biochemical pathways and hormone pathways. I did this on the episode about optimizing testosterone and estrogen as a solo episode that I also covered with Dr. Kyle Gillette and with Dr. Peter Attia. By the way, if you go to hubermanlab.com and you put in any combination of search items, if you put, for instance, shilajit, testosterone, it will take you to the timestamp that covers that. If you put tongkat ali, testosterone, or libido, tongkat ali, it will take you to the timestamps across different episodes directly to those timestamps so that you don't have to listen to entire episodes or go searching for this information. It's all there. We also have an AI engine at hubermanlab.com that allows you to do searches on this sort of thing. But of course, I'm happy to talk to you about it as well. I'm delighted to. So again, if you have the budget and you're somebody who likes to experiment, maybe shilajit is the right thing for you. Find a good brand. It shouldn't be hard to distinguish the real brands. They always have a label of authentication on there. And if you're going to already be doing everything else right behaviorally and you want to explore supplementation for improving testosterone, vitality, et cetera, then I would say don't start with shilajit. You'd probably be best off starting with something like tongkat ali, maybe fadogia. I've talked about these things previously. OK, let's see. Two questions popped up in front of me. So I'll just take the first one. Alexander. Alexander, I like the way you spell your name, Alexander. It's unusual. I dig it. What has your process been for the writing of your book? Slow. I have a saying that I say in my lab or that I have said for many years in doing science when I was a graduate student, a postdoc, and then in my lab. And by the way, because sometimes people ask about this, I still have research funds for human studies. I closed my animal lab focusing mainly on teaching, which I'll be doing again this year. I'm teaching in the spring, maybe in the winter as well to undergraduates. And I may get re-involved in some human clinical studies on vision, an area that I've loved for many years. But in any case, there's a saying that I always would reiterate to my students and postdocs, which is I go as fast as I carefully can. So I believe in a sense of urgency. I like to sit down to write and think, OK, I'm going to go as fast as I carefully can. It's that right balance between urgency and precision. Going fast is rarely good in its own right. Going too slow isn't good either. So there's that place where I feel like I'm just pushing myself a little bit. But then you have to be careful. So as fast as you carefully can. So the process has been slow. But I've been going as fast as I carefully can. Any recommendations on overcoming obstacles? And how did you deal with them? Yes. Put that phone away. Put in the other room. If you have to generate accountability measures, do it. When I used to write grants in my laboratory in San Diego, you can ask my lab, I used to walk in and say, OK, I'm giving my phone to somebody. And if I ask for it back before 5:00 PM today, you each get $1,000. And I did not have $1,000 to give everyone in my lab. I had a pretty big lab. And I didn't have the money. So you may have to create some barriers. Gosh, about an hour and a half in, I'd think, OK, gosh, I was supposed to respond to this person today. They're going to think that I've dropped off the map. Oh my goodness. And then I'd remember I have an office phone. If someone really needed to get a hold of me, if it was an emergency, they'd let me know. And if I couldn't be reached that way, someone would find me. I realize for people with kids, et cetera, this might not be feasible. But if you have to do that, you do that. Set stakes. Give someone a check for an exorbitant amount of money that you can't afford to give away, but that you do have in your bank account. Give them that check and say, if I don't stop writing for the next hour, then you can tear up the check. Otherwise, you can go cash it. So you can put some fear in there. But again, as I mentioned earlier, better to generate these kind of incentives with yourself. So I like to put my phone away. I like to take about 10 minutes to transition into the writing. And then I actually set rules for myself. I don't allow myself to get out of the seat, even to use the bathroom. It's true. I've never gone to the bathroom in my seat. But I resist the temptation to get up until the timer goes off. That's how I did it as an undergraduate. That's how I did it writing grants. That's how I've done it writing fellowships as a graduate student. And that's how I write the book now. And I find that after about 20 or 30 minutes, I don't want to stand up. I'm super happy. And then if an interruption comes, then I get frustrated because I want to keep writing. So give it a try. Set some high stakes incentives for yourself. I mean, don't make them too high. But set some high stakes incentive. Thank you for saying looking forward to the book. I appreciate it. If you want to buy a pre-order copy, it's protocolsbook.com. It's there in multiple languages now. I'd be grateful if you did. On the other hand, if you don't want to buy it or you just want to wait till it comes out, that's fine too. And I'm just grateful that I have the opportunity to put this information into one place that people can access if they like. Mike Torres, and I think this is the last question. Are we down to about the last question? Two more? One more? All right, here we go. I'm asking my producer here. Mike, where can I find information from Huberman Lab regarding addictions and recovery? Great, great question. I get this a lot. A lot of people struggle with addiction. Addiction is a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure in ways that can be very disruptive for your life. These can be process addictions, meaning behavioral addictions. These can be substance abuse issues. First of all, I just want to say, while I have no formal relationship to them, there are wonderful zero cost resources in every city around the world, 12 step communities. Go online, look for that. The meetings and programs that they provide are very useful, have proven very useful. Actually, this was explored in a study from Stanford psychiatry a few years ago because there hadn't been a lot of science on those sorts of programs. And the conclusion was they can be very, very useful. In terms of Huberman Lab resources, if you go to hubermanlab.com, put addiction into the search function, it will take you to specific timestamps, mainly of an episode that I did with Dr. Anna Lembke, who is our director of the Dual Diagnosis Addiction Clinic at Stanford, the author of Dopamine Nation, and absolute virtuoso in terms of the description of the underlying biological mechanisms mostly surrounding dopamine, but also the approach to treating and getting over addictions. You can get over addictions. People get sober from their addictions. It takes time. It takes energy. It takes effort. And in every case, it's an incredibly rewarding thing that just makes your life and other people's lives better. So I highly encourage anyone that's struggling with process addictions or substance abuse addictions, or alcohol use disorder, or things of that sort to pursue those resources, both on our website and of course, the other resources that I mentioned a few minutes ago. Also, Ana's book, Dopamine Nation, is a wonderful one. It will allow you to see and understand that these are brain mechanisms that are at play. It's not a lack of willpower. It's a disruption in neurochemical circuit regulation. And that should give you some grace and some feelings of ease because what that means is that while it is not, quote unquote, "your fault", it is your responsibility to deal with it. And you can. And there are great zero cost resources to do that. So please access those. And then just popped up on my screen, it says, happy birthday, Karen [inaudible]. I hope I pronounced that correctly. Happy birthday, Karen. And happy birthday to anyone else whose birthday happens to be today or in the vicinity of today. I guess this is going to be recorded and put out eventually. And then it'll be somebody's birthday on every day at some point. But happy birthday, Karen. Thank you for being a premium subscriber. Thank you all for tuning in. Thank you to those of you that listen to this at a later time recorded. I really appreciate your questions. I really appreciate your support of Huberman Lab. As I've said many times before, it's a labor of love. It continues to be a labor of love. I spend my life, basically all of my waking life minus some self-care and some care of others, and hopefully a bulldog soon, another bulldog soon. I can't wait. I've been looking for bulldogs. And there will be another one soon. I don't know what his or her name will be. But in the absence of tending to those things, I'm focusing 98% of my waking life to trying to suss out the best health and science information for you all and get it out to you in formats that are convenient for you, that are useful for you, and that you can apply. Also discussions with expert guests. So there are the guest episodes, the solo episodes. hubermanlab.com has a lot of resources, like the AI engine. Please give that a try, if you like. It's basically an AI version of me, which is kind of weird to me. But it does a pretty good job. I would say it does a very good job of encapsulating a lot of themes. It's a great way to generate your own brief protocols, if you want to do that. You can ask it to generate an exercise plan based on Huberman Lab protocols, or what have you. And then the newsletters I'm assuming most of you already subscribe to. But if you would be so kind as to make sure that you follow the podcast by clicking subscribe on YouTube, following the podcast on Apple and Spotify. If you already follow, by the way, make sure you don't accidentally unfollow. But if you go click that Follow tab, that really helps us. It's zero cost. Give us a five-star review if you think we deserve it or a different review if you think we deserve that. I love your comments on YouTube. I do read them all. I really do read them all. I even go and find the hidden comments that get filtered. And I read those too. So please, if you feel inclined, you can support us in that way. And most importantly, take the protocols and the information that you think works for you. Apply it. Discard the protocols and the information that you don't feel is for you. Discard it. That's great. And of course, I don't deserve credit for any of these protocols per se. These are the product of so much great science and health studies out there, clinical studies. And I'm just a funnel and a filter. But it is a true pleasure to be able to be that funnel and filter. So thank you for letting me funnel and filter today's knowledge for you. And as always, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]

Title: Dr. Peter Attia: Supplements for Longevity & Their Efficacy
Published: 2024-07-29 12:00:12 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. Peter Attia, M.D., a Stanford and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine-trained physician expert in improving human healthspan and lifespan. Dr. Attia is also the host of The Drive podcast and author of the best-selling book Outlive. 

We discuss the NAD pathway in human cells and its possible links to aging and health. We evaluate how supplementation can augment molecules in the NAD pathway; we compare NAD, NMN, and NR, different routes of administration, their safety, and bioavailability. Then, we discuss the broader research and clinical literature on longevity to decide if supplementation with NAD, NR, NMN, rapamycin, or resveratrol can indeed extend lifespan. 

Finally, we each describe our supplement regimens and compare the role of supplementation to behaviors such as sleep, nutrition, and exercise for longevity. We also discuss whether tests of biological age are true indicators of aging and whether normal radiation levels increase cancer risk. 

Listeners of this episode will learn if supplements purported to improve lifespan show any efficacy and the behaviors and other factors that can prevent disease and extend lifespan.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Peter AA Dr Peter AA is a medical doctor who did his training at Stanford University School of Medicine and John's Hopkins school of medicine Dr a is one of the world's most trusted voices on the topics of healthspan and lifespan and with good reason he is known to systematically review the research literature the clinical trials and he maintains an avid clinical practice so when it comes to the topic of whether or not a particular molecule or supplement or prescription drug is indeed something that we should be thinking about and perhaps even taking in order to improve our health span and lifespan Dr AA is the person that I choose to sit down with and discuss it so today we are going to discuss the so-called NAD pathway this is a pathway that's received a lot of attention and recent years as a potential Target for improving lifespan that is for living longer today we discuss the various molecules in this pathway and the various approaches to increasing NAD which is the end Target goal of anyone that's trying to augment the NAD pathway so to speak so for instance we talk about taking NR versus nmn versus direct infusions or even orally taking NAD and we compare them in terms of both what's known known and what is not known about their ability to get into cells and any efficacy they may have for either longevity or health span Dr at and I compare and contrast the literature on this again both research and clinical literature and we discuss whether or not he or I take NAD nmn or NR and if so or if not the reasons for that we also each go through our own supplement regimen which of course reflects what we do believe can potentially have an effect on health span and or lifespan so by the end of today's episode you'll learn a lot about NAD you'll learn a lot about the biological pathway you'll learn a lot about the delivery routs the various supplements and why people think they may be useful why others perhaps even Dr AA and myself think they may not be useful for longevity you have to listen to find out what the answer is there I should also mention that we give somewhat of an overview or a framework for thinking about approaches to longevity so if you're interested in things like rap amise and Metformin and whether or not fasting can improve longevity we get into that as well before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium in the correct ratios but no sugar now proper hydration is critical for the optimal functioning of all the cells in your body and that's especially true for the neurons the nerve cells in fact we know that even a slight degree of dehydration can diminish both cognitive and physical performance so to make sure that I'm getting proper hydration in electrolytes I personally dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I first wake up in the morning and I drink that or sip that across the first half hour of the day or so and then I also make it a point to drink another packet of element dissolved in an equal amount of water so 16 to 32 o at some other point during the day and maybe even a third if I'm exercising and or sweating a lot I should mention the element tastes absolutely delicious my favorite flavor is watermelon although I also confess I like the raspberry flavor the Citrus flavor basically I like all the flavors if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with the purchase of any element drink mix again that's drink element.com huberman to claim a free sample pack today's episode is also brought To Us by levels levels is a program that lets you see how different foods impact your health by giving you realtime feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor one of the most important factors in both short and long-term health is your body's ability to manage blood glucose to maintain optimal energy and focus throughout the day you want to keep your blood glucose level steady without big spikes or crashes I first started using levels about 3 years ago as a way to try and understand how different foods impacted my blood glucose levels and it's proven incredibly useful for determining what food choices I should make when best to eat certain foods especially around things like workouts and when and what to eat relative to when I go to sleep in order to allow for the best possible night sleep and stable blood sugar throughout the night and when I wake up in the morning so if you're interested in learning more about levels and trying a CGM yourself go to levels. l/ huberman levels recently launched a new CGM sensor that's even smaller and has even better tracking than their previous version right now they're also offering an additional two free months of membership again that's levels. link spelled l n k/ huberman to try the new sensor and two free months of membership today's episode is also brought To Us by eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity now I've spoken many times before in this podcast about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts of quality sleep each night one of the best ways to ensure a great night's sleep is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3° and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3° eight sleep makes it incredibly easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment by allowing you to program the temperature of your mattress cover at the beginning middle and end of the night I've been sleeping on an eight- Sleep mattress cover for well over 3 years now and it has completely transformed my sleep for the better eight sleep recently launched their newest generation pod cover the Pod 4 ultra the Pod 4 ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity higher Fidelity sleep tracking technology and it also has snoring detection that remarkably will automatically lift your head a few degrees to improve your air flow and stop your snoring if you'd like to try an eights Sleep mattress cover you can go to

discussion about NAD and Longevity with Dr Peter AA Peter AA welcome how are you great to see you again great to be here again should we parse this NAD thing I think we should do you mind if I set up a little bit of a framework great so for people that want to live as long as possible I think fig there are at least four categories of approaches broadly speaking the first I'll just call the dos and don'ts you've talked a lot about these your book outlive beautifully covered these and I tend to regurgitate some of what you say on this podcast namely you want to move appropriately and often enough so get enough Zone 2 cardio do your resistance training keep nerve to muscle connection strong avoid the sorts of things that would lead to falling and being immobile eat right there's a whole category of things there we're not going to talk about today although we might touch on a bit and know your genetics and make some good decisions on the basis of your genetics so the dos and don'ts the second category I would put under the umbrella of calories glucose insulin Etc that all kind of funnel in at least in my mind to mtor mamalian Target of rapamycin a molecule that's robustly expressed during development and essentially all cells of the body and then across the lifespan tapers off during puberty especially well let's say infancy through puberty cells are expressing so much mtor and they're growing like crazy and we often associate that early stage of life as youth not aging because we think of it as a kind of a time stamp as opposed to the verb but I would argue as a developmental neurobiologist by training that it's one of the most rapid phases of Aging of our entire lifespan look at a picture of you when you were five look at a picture of you when you were eight versus 15 you look very different and your size is robustly different by the way I just did this exercise because my daughter her birth her 16th birthday is around the corner and uh we take a picture of her every single year at the minute of of her birth so we have a picture of her every single year holding a clock that says 356 at 3:56 p.m. because that's when she was born and I just went through and pulled each of the last 16 of them from the day she was born all the way up and you're right the biggest changes are actually in about the first 10 years um you know the difference between being 13 and 14 14 and 15 15 and 16 becomes incrementally less and less and less whereas going from 2 to three and 3 to four and four to five are ridiculous changes yeah I mean the brain the same brain has to learn an entirely new body every year in terms of how to move it limb length Etc so a lot of the so-called anti-aging or longevity approaches that fall under this umbrella relate to things like caloric restriction or taking drugs such as rapamycin and of course Maman Target of Ramin is the target of rapamycin duh in an effort to essentially remove excess insulin blood glucose and thereby reduce mtor activity so essentially slow cellular growth and all that fits nicely into the logic that mtor is associated not just with development but with aging because development is aging and then I would say there's a third category and it's the one we are going to talk about today which is targeting specific cellular Pathways that some people have deemed potentially interesting for longevity and the pathway that we're going to spend some time on is the so-call NAD pathway NR nmn NAD being the major players and we'll talk about some of the biochemical and enzymatic steps in between and then I suppose there's a fourth category which we could say is you know the do everything even the most esoteric of things category this is a rare category there are folks like Brian Johnson who spend a lot of time in this category specifically you know taking very high doses of polyphenols limiting their caloric intake to just early part of the day I think he eats dinner at 11:00 a.m. I don't know if it's still qualifies as dinner at 11:00 a.m. but his final bite of calories is I believe at 11:00 a.m. doing everything from red light to PRP platelet platelet rich plasma excuse me um and essentially the kitchen sink approach to longevity and aging did I miss any categories so I I I would frame it slightly differently because I I like categories to be more mey mutually exclusive collectively exhaustive um so so I I don't I don't know that I would formulate it that way right I might say look category one are sort of the essential behavioral things that you have no choice but to engage in whether you want to or not right so you have to eat you have to sleep you have to move you just have a choice in do you want to do those things correctly or not correctly or do you want to do those things in a manner that promotes health or erodes Health right so again there's nobody listening to us who doesn't eat but again you can choose how much you eat and what you eat and when you eat there's nobody who's alive who isn't moving because Locomotion is life and the absence of life is the absence of locomotion but you can certainly choose to move very little you can choose to move a lot and you can choose to decide on how youve move you alluded to it already right you can you can move in a certain way that puts your Aerobic System in a zone that maximizes fat oxidation we call that zone two you can move at a level where you consume incredible amounts of oxygen at your maximum aerobic level you can choose to move in a manner that uses resistance and and gravity against you and all those sorts of things similarly we all have to sleep right Matt Walker would probably tell us the number of days you could go with sleep without sleep before you would literally perish um but again you have a lot of choices in how you do it so anyway I agree that's kind of category one but that's kind of the way I would frame it and then I would put in category two um sort of what are the molecules that you would exogenously take to try to impact any of those systems and maybe and again I'm not saying my framework is correct and yours isn't I'm just saying this is the way I think about it I would then say what are the molecules that I could take that specifically Target disease processes so I kind of think of like if we want to live longer and I described this I think in chapter 4 of outlive there's a that's a that turns out to be mathematically equivalent in the modern society to delaying the onset of chronic disease now that wasn't true 100 years ago 100 years ago if you wanted to live longer a few things had to be true you couldn't die during childbirth and that because that was a huge hit on mortality um and then you had to not get an infection or succumb to trauma um and and then maybe 150 years ago that was the case but today most of those things are taken care of by antibiotics sanitation and you know the modern Miracle of childbirth in the in in in this era so now for you and I to live longer we basically have to delay the onset of cardiovascular disease cerebrovascular disease cancer neurodegenerative disease dementing diseases and metabolic diseases we have to delay the onset of those things the longer we delay the onset the longer we will live full stop so you can use everything that you talked about in the first category plays into that but you also have this other category of where you can take molecules that specifically Target those things you can take Metformin or an sgt2 inhibitor or a glp1 Agonist and you will directly impact those things you could take uh a pcsk9 inhibitor or a Statin or bidic acid you will directly impact those disease processes you will delay the onset of those diseases and you will reduce the mortality associated with them then I would go to a third category that says are there exogenous molecules that you can take that don't Target a disease per se specifically but we're going to put them in a category called geroprotective which is they target Hallmarks and Pathways of Aging that you've described so we talk about all of these things that occur in an aging phenotype where we see more inflammation we see a greater abundance of senescent cells we see reduced uh nutrient sensing capacity of mtor which you described as the probably the most important nutrient sensing system in our body um so so we have you know these somewhere between 9 and 14 the number just keeps changing arbitrarily but it doesn't really matter we have these Central things that everybody would agree Define what an aging phenotype is and can we use exogenous molecules to Target those specifically you gave one example which I I would argue is the single best example which is rapy so rapy targets a very specific Hallmark of aging and we can talk about what the experimental evidence is to suggest that that makes you live longer so I would sort of say those are the big three categories and then basically the fourth category you could just say is like how do you put them all together and how aggressive do you want to be in culminating those of course none of this touches on another area that I want to talk about that we won't talk about today which is like how does all that factor into kind of emotional health and happiness and and and well-being where you know none of none of this other stuff matters if you're kind of unhappy and so so you have to and and you've done so many podcast on that topic right you've had Paul Con on where you kind of go through the understanding of ourselves and our minds and and why that's also a very important part of it because it actually does impact how long you live because if that piece isn't working it's very difficult to regulate the first bucket because the first bucket takes so much work so if you can't regulate yourself it's very difficult to regulate the the dos and don'ts but even absent just length of Life stuff it impacts quality of life which is this idea of Health span as well so I guess that's just my slightly different way to frame it but it's a little bit more mey um in that you know we talk about the behaviors um the exogenous molecules that Target diseases the exogenous molecules that Target uh aging aside from food what exogenous molecules do you take I take a few right so I take some that are disease specific right so I take a pcsk9 inhibitor I take bidic acid uh I take an sglt2 inhibitor um and then I take at least one that is purely just uh based on the belief of its capacity and Juro protection which is rrap ayin and um and also the SG the sglt2 inhibitor I think is probably just broadly geroprotective and we can even talk about that a little bit in terms of the success of one of those molecules called canaga flosin in the interventions testing program the ITP which I am sure will talk about in the context of NAD as well what dosage of rapamycin do you take I take eight milligrams once a week for as long as I can tolerate it but that I usually have to take breaks why is that I get these vicious apus ulcers uh little mouth sores canker Source yes about 10% of people get them hm it's paradoxically the only biomarker we probably have so I I secretly uh rejoice in knowing that at least I'm getting a good batch of rap AIS by virtue of the side effect by virtue of these miserable side effects but so so in reality what it works out to is I'm probably on it for two months and then off it for a month on it for two months off it for a month or thereabouts and the idea there is that you're limiting mtor you're causing your cells to grow less mature slower and and in that sense slowing down aging is that the idea yeah I mean you know and this will be an important theme today right it's like we can talk all day long about mechanisms and theoretical Arguments for why it would work and I think my conviction around taking Ramy is less about um sort of looking at the molecular explanation for why Rapa Works although I find that to be quite convincing and why does the inhibition of mtor stimulate a top Agy why would that suppress ccent cells but truthfully my conviction around mtor is far more based on the experimental data um something that is actually sorely lacking in the NAD story which we'll discuss so the experimental data are far more convincing right which is when you look at the administration of Ramy or its analoges for example ever alus um when you look at the administration of these molecules to organisms that are as close as possible to the species of Interest we the species of interest um so looking at mammals such as um mice um and small primates um looking at fruit flies looking at worms and even looking at yeast although that's so far from us that you would argue that's the least important um you see something that you don't see for a single other molecule which is uniform life extension no other molecule has done this it's very important to understand there are only two interventions full stop that have ever extended life across those four categories of UK chariots caloric restriction and rap ay very important point right how do you feel when you're on rap ayon aside from the canker Source yeah which fortunately aren't that frequent you I I don't feel anything and the very few of my patients who take it because I I maybe 10% of my patients also take it um I've never heard actually that's not true I've probably heard two people say they feel better on it but you know I don't know what to make of that maybe they do um and maybe that's just a placebo effect does it synergize with caloric restriction or collide with caloric excess meaning if you're taking rapamycin but you're slightly over your caloric needs maybe you're trying to add a little bit of body weight or happen to overeat a little bit just because is it going to collide with rapamycin's potential positive impact on slowing aging yeah it's a good question Andrew I don't I don't know I don't think we know uh we do know that there's one other really important readout we're waiting for which is um Matt cabin's dog aging study um which uh is is is going to be an exciting readout in 2026 um we're also waiting for another readout out of the University of San Antonio looking at another um another trial in mammals and again I think those two will be really interesting right um because we have a ton of we have just an overabundance of mouse data that are so reproducible and reproducible in really good Mouse models um you know as you know I'm sure from your work um the model you choose matters right and and sort of you you you know in an Ideal World you want to use a mouse model that is um you know not inbred that is more closely related to the what we care about which is ourselves and and so when you see many Labs getting the same result over and over again regardless of how they do it you you really start to believe there's a signal there so now to be able to see this in a higher order mammal um and ultimately in companion dogs which is where Matt cabin is looking I think that's that's going to be really exciting and I've often said to my patients look in 2026 I'm either going to feel a lot more conviction about taking rapy and and prescribing it to some of my patients though again not most or I'm going to you know have a second look at this and say you know maybe maybe we just shouldn't be taking this right because I do think that the dogs study is going to be more telling um but again we'll have to wait and see what that shows without going off track too much my understanding is that the dog study was halted because of a lack of federal funding um is it continuing it is going to go on there's there's yeah it's so so initially there was kind of insufficient funding to do the study in an adequate way um and then it turned out there was a shortfall of about $2.5 million um to do the the study that really wanted to do and then actually a group of us raised that money for Matt and did that so great uh me and a so few of my patients and a couple of other folks came together and put the money in to close the gap but yes there has been um what's what what did get pulled back by the NIH inexplicably and um in my view totally incorrectly was the ongoing surveillance program the funding for the ongoing surveillance program that would allow this type of work to continue and to allow greater followup on this so yes unfortunately um until we can get more funding we're we're we're not going to be able to maybe do as much as we'd like to do and understand this which again when you look at some of the things that are funded it's hard to believe that there's not a more interesting question right now in biology than this drug that seems so promising why we wouldn't want to know you know if this is something we should all be taking is is kind of a mystery to me yeah I was on ni study sections for many years reviewing grants I rotated off as a regular member a little over a year ago and I can tell you that the whole process is designed to be as um targeted to the best and most exciting work possible but there's a number of features now that make it such that it's largely the work that's already mostly completed that gets funded you even go like how's that work but anyway we could have a whole other Journal Club discussion about funding but I I had to ask I was curious hope hopefully that um uh that study will get completed and thanks for raising those funds let's talk about NAD yes it's in essentially every cell of the body except red blood cells correct you know I I don't even know if it's in red blood cells my intuition is I I I've never looked to be honest with you but given that red blood cells um have a different metabolic pathway right where they're purely glycolytic I don't they wouldn't have the need for it in the way that others would but they might right because they still undergo Redux potential so it's possible NAD is in every single cell yeah and it's generally thought to be associated with energy production and mitochondrial Pathways in every single cell right so NAD is again one of the most ubiquitous molecules in the body and most of what it does and I mean most meaning like somewhere between five and 600 Pathways of it utilize NAD as a co-actor meaning that it's not consumed in a chemical reaction but rather it serves as an electron shutle so NAD and nadh basically play catch with electrons and that's 99% of what NAD is doing in the body and for that reason NAD is so tightly regulated in the body the levels of NAD in the cell are really tightly regulated and that shouldn't be surprising just as glucose really tightly regulated pH or hydrogen ion concentration really tightly regulated we as a species cannot survive outside of a very narrow band of uh pH right if it's below seven or above 7.8 on a 0 to 14 scale we die full stop um so similarly NAD is managed across all ages and across all physiologic uh uh uh conditions in a super tight band there's another place where NAD shows up and that shows up as a substrate right so co-actor means used co-enzyme used but not consumed recycled that's 99% of it a small fraction of it is used and it's used by these things called cerin that consume NAD as an actual substrate in the process of DNA repair and maybe we can go into this but this is really where the story picks up it's also as I recall where the story began that's exactly it was some experiments where the cerin were mutated in One Direction or the other meaning gain of function or loss of function these days people hear gain of function and they immediately think to pandemic related themes but gain of function is a way of changing genes typically to um augment a function increase its robustness or in some cases to rescue a phena type where you have a knockout mouse that lacks a gene so that's loss of function or a Trin of yeast that lacks a gene and then you do the gain of function rescue experiment you re reintroduce the the gene of interest um it's an important I wouldn't even call it a control it's an important experiment in any case because loss of function will tell you a lot y um but gain of function and loss of function assuming that the results J uh tells you much much more this is one of the major areas I think this is very important to highlight where human genetics really struggles because you can get humans with a mutation in a particular pathway like I don't know the Sonic Hedgehog pathway there somebody is hypomorphic for Sonic Hedgehog and you know they might actually lack a a major tooth up in the middle because the role of Sonic hedgehog at the midline and you could say okay well loss of function here here's the role of Sonic Hedgehog but the ideal experiment is to put the gene back in and then rescue that phenotype because as any logical mind can tell there could be many things Downstream of Sonic Hedgehog that could create the phenotype that you observe but if you put Sonic Hedgehog back in yes that's still true but you get more reassurance that that's the gene of Interest so with respect to cerin as I recall they deleted the cerin let's use another example of what the gold standard is here or what a great example is so so I recently did a podcast with Dina dubal from UCSF on clotho which is an amazing scientific story and it's a great story because it shows how accidents can lead to great discoveries right so there was a a researcher in Japan who was really interested in understanding hypertension high blood pressure and they had created a mouse model where they were trying to knock out certain sodium channels to see if they could perturb blood pressure and then there was this one strain of mouse with this one knockout that died really really quickly and it developed like devastating neurogen disease and died very quickly and you know like a good scientist he didn't say well that sucks I'm going to discard that one CU it didn't give me what I wanted which was the blood pressure change and he kind of went and figured out what was going on and he figured out that there was a certain Gene that he had hit that wasn't a sodium transporter and instead was this other Gene he named it clotho so so you had this one piece of evidence right now which was if you knock out that Gene you kill an animal very quickly now that doesn't mean it's a longevity Gene you have to do the other experiment to your point you have to overexpress that Gene and ask the question do you live longer and sure enough when they overexpressed that same gene that they had just knocked out and killed the mouse the thing was living 15 to 20% longer so it's both necessary and sufficient for extended how you can say well that's a longevity Gene as many of you know I've been taking ag1 for more than 10 years now so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast to be clear I don't take ag1 because they're a sponsor rather they are a sponsor because I take ag1 in fact I take ag1 once and often twice every single day and I've done that since starting way back in 2012 there is so much conflicting information out there nowadays about what proper new nutrition is but here's what there seems to be a general consensus on whether you're an omnivore a carnivore a vegetarian or a vegan I think it's generally agreed that you should get most of your food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources which allows you to eat enough but not overeat get plenty of vitamins and minerals probiotics and micronutrients that we all need for physical and mental health now I personally am an omnivore and I strive to get most of my food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources but the reason I still take AG one once and often twice every day is that it ensures I get all of those vitamins minerals probiotics Etc but it also has adaptogens to help me cope with stress it's basically a nutritional insurance policy meant to augment not replace quality food so by drinking a serving of ag1 in the morning and again in the afternoon or evening I cover all of my foundational nutritional needs and I like so many other people that take ag1 report feeling much better in a number of important ways such as energy levels digestion sleep and more so while many supplements out there are really directed towards obtaining one specific outcome ag1 is foundational nutrition designed to support all aspects of well-being related to mental health and physical health if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs with your order plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman so let's go to the ceran story so it goes back to the late 90s Matt cllin again this is amazing right so you have this guy who's like the leading Authority or one of the leading authorities on the on the work going on today with Rapa and along with one of his colleagues David satini and a few others um but when when Matt was a post dog he did an experiment in a strain of mice uh pardon me a strain of yeast I think it was a w303 strain of yeast and he overexpressed sir two um and lo and behold the yeast lived longer now a year later someone else in the same lab took a different strain of yeast and calorically restricted them and they also lived longer um I forget the name of that I forget what that strain was it was something 316 was it but it was a different strain of yeast at that moment again this is about 25 years ago a hypothesis emerged which was we have two different strains of yeast and in one of them when you overexpress sir 2 this gene they live longer and in this other strain if you calorically restrict them they live longer the understandable hypothesis was caloric restriction which we had known was life extending is working through cerin that hypothesis sort of fell apart about four years later when Matt cabin again this time with Brian Kennedy did another experiment in a yet a third strain of yeast that allowed them to test hypothesis because there was a problem with the story I just told when you took the 303 strain this is the strain that when overexpressing sir two lived longer if you took that strain and you calorically calorically restricted them no change that's odd even more odd is when you took the 316 strain and this is the strain that lived longer with CR if if you overexpress sir to no change so right off the bat the story didn't make sense but it was further solidified that that story didn't make sense when Brian and Matt published in 2004 in yet a different strain God I'm blanking on the name it's like uh B by4742 like you know these don't matter if you calorically restricted them they lived longer if you overexpress sir two they lived longer if you did both they lived even longer it was additive again further suggesting that overexpression of sir2 and caloric restriction independently and separately extended lifespan these are parallel Pathways they're parallel Pathways for reasons that honestly Escape me Andrew there are still people who maintain that the benefit of ceran overexpression is through the caloric restriction pathway and vice versa and that's wrong my reading of the literature in addition to every person I have talked to on this who works in the space including Matt cin who has done the most research on this is that there is no evidence that caloric restriction and cerin operate through the same pathway and in that sense I think there's there's relatively uniform agreement that caloric restriction extends life across the model systems we discussed what about in humans what what about it specifically that experiment's never been done and never will be done the joke I was trying to set up for is the one I'll make now which is no one wants to be in the control experiment um that said nobody want want treatment experiment either you got me you got me you beat me to the punch uh no one wants to be in the treatment group either because it requires eating so little yeah you know it just the the yeah the joke is the joke is you probably will live longer and it will feel even worse like it's just it's yeah caloric restriction which by the way there are real debates about whether it will extend life in humans because it will clearly I shouldn't say clearly I think it would be a very safe bet that severe caloric restriction will absolutely reduce the risk of most chronic diseases meaning I I have I think there's very good reason to believe that if an individual constitutively consumed 25% fewer calories than they were meant to eat their risk of cardiovascular disease cancer Alzheimer's disease would go down the problem is what things go up what does that do to your immune system what does that do with respect to sarcopenia what does that do to your risk of falling fra yeah exactly so you trade one set of diseases for another it's not at all clear that lifespan goes up and by the way when you even look at some of the wild um uh like some of the animal literature where they're using different strains of mice that are not inbred and they don't put them in hermetically sealed uh situations they don't live longer so it's not always the case that caloric restriction extends life and therefore well um it's safe to say caloric restriction probably reduces the onset of chronic disease that might not translate to an all cause mortality benefit based on those downsides but all of that said I think the holster in story got off to an incorrect start where it basically lopped on to the CR story which was hey we've got this thing CR that we've known since restrict right clor restri we've got this thing which you know for 50 years we've known has a signal that really says it's life extending and we've got this yeast where it works and this other yeast where ceran activation works oh it's got to be St but again if you if you go through the story in detail as I just did there's no evidence whatsoever that cerin have anything to do with chloric restriction and vice versa it's incredibly interesting because I think when you look at cell biology and you see these parallel pathways when you see these effects of experiments where changing cerin or changing caloric restriction independently increased lifespan combine the two you get this what appears to be a synergistic effect but it's as you pointed out an additive effect seems like a pretty straightforward experiment to do you could just do an occlusion right you could then put back in the cerin OR adjust calories and see whether or not you get the effectively whether the math is corrected yeah you know so um now none of this gets to the question you raised yet that's just all that's all prologue right that's like where did this story come up but then the question becomes well if you believe that cerin are truly um a factor that drives longevity how can you activate them right how do you activate a ceran so we have to now simultaneously start to hold things true in parallel that may or may not be true so we we we want to then ask the question do we believe that what we saw in yeast which I think is the only reproducible finding I can draw meaning this is a reproducible finding in many but not all strains of yeast if you overexpress sirtuins the yeast will live longer so let's park that in the parking lot as a very likely statement you would then say well if it does it in yeast does it do it in flies does it do it in worms does it do it in mammals you you want to be able to check those three boxes because again that's a billion years of evolution so if something works across a billion years we' be much more confident it works in US yeah making a fly mutant dropa mutant that overexpresses cin a worm cigance mutant that overexpresses cins that's a pretty quick experiment to do because of this short generation time of those species right now Mouse it's a longer experiment but I'm guessing all of those experiments have been done yeah and the only one that I can find that has demonstrated a survival Advantage is one particular transgenic Mouse experiment that overexpressed uh CT 6 and it did indeed for the male mice increase lifespan by 10 to 15% so this is one transgenic Mouse model that overexpressed CER six and those mice the male mice lived 10 to 15% longer the female mice did not we should probably clarify what a transgenic Mouse is I talked about knockout mice that's when a gene or genes in some cases is deleted from The genome so it's null it does not express that Gene the gain of function would be to put back that Gene in that would be a Knockin Mouse so in that case you still get some normal expression of the gene from the endogenous genome but now you have a trans Gene that's inserted there and there are all sorts of important intricacies that relate to for instance where the trans Gene is inserted if it's you know Downstream of of an enhancer that's muscle specific then you can get a mouse that it overexpresses C to in just in muscle you can get it ubiquitously expressed there are a number of different ways that this can happen I'm assuming this was ubiquitous expression of you said CER six CT six yeah so every cell in the body that normally would Express C six would Express more I don't remember Andrew to be honest with you I'd have to go back and look at the paper I don't know if it was muscle specific or whole body specific I'm guessing unless they made it clear that it was tissue specific that it's whole body so we're talking about it when Peter says transgenic Mouse he's talking about a mouse that has this trans Gene that causes it to express more cer2 in6 than it ordinarily would and let's assume although we don't know this for sure that the other genes in this mouse are functioning as they would normally right so again just a summarize that that's 2012 we have this one transgenic Mouse you put CT six you over Express search six and all of a sudden the males were living 10% longer again to be clear the females didn't experience a difference um and that's not uncommon or unheard of in longevity research there generally are sex specific differences and you always have to read the fine print the first thing I always look at in a study when I see a difference in Sexes or frankly any difference in longevity but it's always great when they parse them out by Sexes is how long did the controls live but I went back and actually looked at the Kaplan Meyer curves on that exact study and yes indeed I think that's a real effect um so let's take stock of now two pieces of information that I think we could say is probably true it is probably true that in a handful of strains of yeast if you overexpress CT you are going to live longer that tends to be completely independent of caloric restriction that's the single thing I can say with the greatest confidence and there is at least one trans genic strain of mice that if you get it to overexpress a different C CT six but again they're these are homologues throughout the species so we don't have to get I don't think we need to get wrapped up in CT 2 versus C six um you will at least make the male mice live longer but not the females what sorts of things are Downstream of cerin and that question translated to normal English is what is changing as a consequence of increasing the cerin could it be for instance well unlikely based on what we already know about caloric restriction and the fact that they are independent parallel Pathways but is it something related to glucose metabolism is it something related to um clearance of senent cells I I'm just throwing out possibilities actually you've hit two of the big three right off the top right so we believe that when cerin are activated they're improving mitochondrial biogenesis um they are um uh in increasing DNA repair so that's probably the biggest one by the way that's sort of what brings us to um um the um the NAD story um and also reducing uh sasps right so the soluble products of senescent cells so so Tamp so in other words those are all three good things right so you Tamp down on siness and cells uh you increase mitochondrial biogenesis and you increase DNA repair those would be all great things to do and we think that Sans are probably doing all of them this business of DNA repair and reducing um you know fragmentation or mutations to DNA that are naturally occurring has been a hot idea in the field of Aging for a long time is that because when x-rays became popular or um post nuclear fallout that people showed accelerated signs of aging I mean how did we get from DNA mutation to accelerated aging like well I mean I think we we know that as we age it's just a stochastic process right like given the ubiquity of DNA replication and the Fidelity of the system which is high very high but not perfect there's going to be mistakes um actually this is an interesting question so in 2016 I went to Easter Island with David sabatini and nav chandelle and Tim Ferris so the four of us just took a trip to Easter Island to see the birthplace of Rapa so it's kind of like vacation SL science Journey a nerdy vacation it was awesome and um you know so just picture hiking around this incredible Island just talking about science all day but this was an interesting question that I posed to nav and to David which was why do we see such a clear and present association with cancer uh as we age and why is it so nonlinear so it's not just that cancer goes up with age it goes up like that um and I said I'll offer two hypotheses which is more compelling is it simply that as we're aging uh DNA replication again taking a step back for the listener uh cancer is a genetic disease meaning uh by definition it is uh sort of the canonical problem with cancer is a genetic mutation that leads to two properties of a cell the inability the cell to uh rep uh to control replication so it interrupts cell signaling so cell replicate but then don't know when to stop and then the introduction of the capacity to spread this property called metastasis those are the two Hallmarks of cancer so so we know that that only happens in the context of genetic mutations but why does this happen later in life and not at the beginning of Life with very few exceptions and and so the question is is it because over time mutations compound is it because there are more mutations as we age or is there a third issue which is um all of those things are happening normally and they're no more abundant when you're 80 than when you're 20 but your immune system can't detect them as well and the truth of it is we didn't come up with an answer but it's probably all of the above so it's probably that as we are aging we are undergoing more DNA damage and um or at a minimum the DNA damage we're undergoing is less amenable to repair and that's part of the thesis here part of the thesis here is as we're aging we are less and less able to to repair DNA and one of the arguments that put forth although we have we're not quite ready for this part of the story yet but I'll just say it now and we'll come back to it is we don't have enough of the substrate that the ceran needs to repair DNA and that substrate is NAD so again remember the outside I said like there's two big categories to think about NAD most of what NAD is doing is operating as a co-actor for electron shuttling that's the NAD nadh electron transport electron accept blah blah blah blah blah okay not consuming NAD just using it to pass electrons back and forth but then over here we have this other category where we use NAD as a substrate it gets broken down and that's what the cerin are doing to repair DNA okay so if that's true and if NAD levels are declining with age it's a logical conclusion that should we give more NAD right if you're running out a substrate to repair DNA and DNA repair is an important way to thwart a it all makes sense so we'll keep that over there but before we do I want to come back to one other story which is the story of ceru and activators so what's the most famous ceran activator of all time what is the heavyweight champion of ceran activators that has taken up 99% of the bandwidth in this space it's a lovely little chemical called RIS veratrol okay so Resveratrol which gained a lot of Fame and notoriety because it happens to be found in Trace element elements in the uh skin of grapes and therefore shows up in wine uh gained a lot of notoriety about 20 years ago when one lab doing one experiment somehow was able to convince some people including uh a very large Pharma company that RIS veratrol increased lifespan so the thesis was RIS veratrol activates cerin cerin activation is important because of all the things we just said right it improves mitochondrial biogenesis it suppresses ccent cells and it and enhances DNA repair so if you have something that is such a potent activator of cerin and you give it to a mouse that Mouse should live longer now lots of experiments were done that couldn't find that but one experiment was done but it was a it was an interesting experiment I've discussed this at least on two podcasts including one with Rich Miller who runs the ITP the interventions testing program which later tested ratol and found that it did uh categorically nothing in this one experiment that worked the investigators took a bizarre Mouse model where they force fed it uh an enormously high-fat diet and in doing so they created such an abundance of fatty liver that the livers of these mice um uh encroached the chest the thoracic cavity of the mice so the mouse died prematurely because they couldn't breathe and in that particular Mouse model RIS veratrol rescued the mice so again let's just assume that all of that is correct and it's possible that there were even errors there but let's just assume that's correct let's assume so this is resveratol delivered orally yes in the food yes very high doses Mega doses the equivalent of barrels of grape exactly like doses so high you could there you know if you recall we're both of an age that's old enough to remember this there was this period of time when people thought this was the explanation to the French paradox right why on average do the French live longer when they consume so much wine and the answer was it's got to be the ratol turns out that's not true at all because yeah you would need to be drinking your body weight and wine a day to get the doses of RIS veratrol that were needed to produce this effect but for whatever reason there was an effect which is if the thing that was going to kill you was your liver being so full of fat that it shot up into your chest so you couldn't breathe um which I've never seen a human no matter how bad their fatty liver has been where that's been the case but if that's if that's the problem you're going to face it's possible at least based on this one Mouse experiment that you were going to live longer but again it turned out that there was no other replication of this in Mouse models that matter and that always comes back to the ITP the intervention testing program which is the most robust tool we have scientifically to measure these exogenous molecules so the ITP is an ni funded program that runs out of three independent labs and by independent I mean they're each doing the experiments independently but they're they're in sync with doing the experiment but they're doing it in triplicate so you have three Labs three great Labs doing the experiments in triplicate and um when they did the RIS veratrol experiment and they did it in combination with the people who found the result of that study so they consulted these people and said what dose should we give and they said do this do this do this and they did it and nothing there was no effective RIS veratrol and that result has been consistent across the board so that's also a very important part of the story which was if RIS veratrol was a ceru an activator and I don't know if it really is it clearly has no effect on lifespan with the one little asterisk that says unless your body weight is 50% fatty liver then maybe it does I'd like to take a quick break to let you know that the huberman lab team has launched a new podcast with host Dr Andy Galpin Andy is an expert in exercise science and Human Performance and has long been a fan favorite on the hubman Lab podcast this new podcast is called perform with Dr Andy Galpin and it dives into topics such as how to build muscle and strength how to improve your cardiovascular health and how to optimize recovery sleep for performance and much more Andy is an absolutely fantastic educator and true expert on all things Human Performance I know you'll thoroughly enjoy his new podcast and learn a ton of useful Knowledge from it so please check it out and give it a subscribe wherever you're watching or listening to podcasts now again the podcast is called perform with Dr Andy Galpin so let's see let's just take stock of where we are in the story we got the whole yeast ceran situation which is at least in some East ceru an overexpression lives longer no evidence that that works through caloric restriction truly no evidence that's been known for 20 years now that paper was published in 2004 and that was a follow-up to papers that had been published in 2002 20 1999 Etc um you later on you'd have the 2012 transgenic Mouse study um so now the question is okay how do you activate certu how do you activate well well yeah so so so or or more to the point why don't we just give people NAD okay so the again the NAD story is NAD levels are declining with age in most tissues um it appears most prevalent in the skin of all places and I think we should come back to this because there's one interesting finding associated with augmenting NAD levels in the skin and my thought is I wonder if it has to do with the fact that skin experiences the greatest decline in NAD it's also interesting because catino sites in skin turn over every 28 days or so so you could imagine because it's a novel population of cells that they would have steady expression of cerin and NAD then they simply die for whatever reason or that it starts off very high on day one of generation then tapers off quickly but that's not the case it sounds like yeah you know on average skin over the course of your lifetime will see about a 60% reduction in NAD whereas other tissues and this is now based on you know animal studies the brain might see a reduction by 15 to 20% and the same would be found even in humans looking at the blood so if you just sample you know uh whole blood in people at the age of 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 you're going to see about a 20% reduction in NAD what about neurons I mean you've got the same set of central nervous system neurons your entire life and of course some peripheral neurons as well but there's some regeneration in the periphery so we need to let's just talk about brain so unless you're talking about the old factory bulb where you have constant turnover throughout the lifespan you have the same hippocampal neurons except a small population same hipocampal neurons cortical neurons retinal neurons that you were born with are we observing NAD levels tapering off as we in animals yes obviously in humans we're not doing that experiment but yeah now here's an interesting point in 2015 a study was published in pnas that looked at NAD levels in whole blood over time and it found indeed NAD levels were going down about 10 to 20% over four decades or so but that same study said nadh levels were going up by the same amount explain the role of nadh for people nadh is the um electron acceptor so when you when you the so let's maybe take a step back like what how do we why are you and I sitting here talking and not dead like because we have enough NAD right right what's going on right so right you and I ate something at some point in the foreseeable past that contained chemical energy so we ate something that was organic so it had um so primarily fats and carbohydrates contain carbon carbon bonds and carbon hydrogen bonds and those bonds contain a ton of energy but how do we liberate energy so we break it all down into these constitutive molecules namely glucose on the carbohydrate front and free fatty acids on the fat front and then our bodies break those things down further into smaller molecules that get shuttled into the mitochondria where the Lion's Share of our energy Liberation comes from and what we do is we take that chemical energy that is stored in a carbon to carbon Bond or a carbon to hydrogen bond and we turn it into elect electrical energy and people have heard this term it's called the electron transport chain so there are these four complexes in the mitochondria and there's an inner membrane in an outer membrane across which these mitochondrial uh uh these large mitochondrial complexes reside and what they're doing is they're building up a huge electron gradient by by breaking them apart and taking the electrons and transferring them between NAD and nadh so that at the end they can do another trick which is transfer those electrons to M ADP and ultimately make ATP the finished product is water and carbon dioxide so we eat and we take that chemical energy and food we utilize oxygen in the mitochondria to make ATP carbon dioxide which we breathe out and water which we breathe and pee out so what NAD and nadh are doing is playing an absolutely essential to life role in facilitating the transfer of chemical energy to electrical energy back to chemical energy ATP is just taking it from one chemical form in food to the electrical form as the intermediary in the mitochondria back to an electrical form of ATP so you and I are walking around flush with ATP which as we sit here right now we're constantly firing off phosphates again now turning the chemical energy back into electrical energy and away we go so yeah this this whole NAD nadh thing is like you know it's as Central to our existence as any form of respiration so my point let's go back to the story the story was NAD levels are going down as we age but nadh levels are going up suggesting that the total amount of NAD and nadh is the same and what's declining as we age should less be thought of as a reduction in NAD and should more be thought of as a reduction in what's called Redux potential the ability to do what I just said so when people say NAD levels decline with aging the answer is yeah but what's really declining as we age and this kind of comes back to what you said at the very very outset like what's happening at the cellular level I think what's happening is our mitochondria are not as good as we age and we have less Redux potential and I would say a fair number of so-called anti-aging approaches are targeting the so-called reactive oxygen species Ross's which impede mitochondrial function essentially uh this is an opportunity for me to call out the work that I think is at least intriguing which is uh the work of a colleague by the name of Glenn Jeffrey at the University of College London he's been in the field of visual Neuroscience for a very long time and a few years back he started doing some experiments on animals and now also two studies published on humans showing that exposing the Aged eye so 40 and older to red light and near infrared light for a couple minutes a few times a week can spare certain processes involved in Vision photo receptors how does this work well the idea this isn't proven yet the idea is that it's reducing reactive oxygen species and thereby improving mitochondrial function in what is perhaps the most metabolically active cell type in the entire body not just the eye which are the photo receptors so it's an intriguing set of studies again we don't have all the mechanisms worked out but it brings us around again to this idea that mitochondria are vitally important for the functioning of cells things that impede the function of mitochondria can either reduce the output of Andor kill cells and so anything that can improve Redux can potentially keep a cell around longer functioning better so when I hear about the role of NAD in this pathway I think like most people I think okay well then I should just take more anad and maybe I will age more slowly or I will replace some NAD that's missing as I age in whatever cell type turns out that might not be so straightforward right I mean I don't want to jump to supplementation just yet but if we are to back up from NAD a little bit and look at the pathway leading to NAD it's NR nmn and NAD we'll spell these out in a moment and the sort of competition that's out there in the market is around either infusing or in some cases ingesting NAD directly taking nmn which is the precursor to NAD orally I haven't heard of anybody infusing it or taking oral form NR which is the precursor to nmn my understanding is that nmn is simply NR minus a phosphate group yeah and and I'll take a step back from this first to say the following again let because this topic is so confusing I think it's just worth reminding everybody of what we now everything we've said and where it brings us right so I'm not going to repeat the whole ceran thing let's just leave that alone because everything we're on right now is Upstream of cin yeah it's basically like once you establish that we think cerin matter even though they don't work through caloric restriction and that's about the single most obvious thing I can say they might still matter even though we don't have things that we figured out can activate cerin like RIS veratrol we don't seem to have things that we can give you that activate cerin we're now on to the next part of the story which is okay cerin matter they don't seem to matter we think cin matter because of a few of these overexpression experiments um and we're making a big leap that because they mattered in yeast they're going to matter in us that's a huge leap for which there's zero evidence right and I'm only leaping further to this discussion about how to increase NAD because I know that's in the back of people's minds we're not we're not going to double click here just yet I just want to frame that up because ultimately ultimately that's where we are headed in terms of people making decisions as to whether or not they should take NR or take nmn NAD or none of the above and the reason I'm being such a hard ass about this Andrew is I spend so much time Fielding questions on this that I realize we just have to talk about this and excor it just in the most detailed fashion possible so that people understand why because it is just too easy right there's this great quote by JFK that I'm going to paraphrase that is basically people Ure you know enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought right so we need to sort of this is this is a podcast to get people to think and understand the entire history of this field so that they can actually make an informed decision about a supplement that I'm going to argue has very little scientific basis for its justification I I would say scientific justification for longevity I'll I'll go on record now saying that I take nmn and in some cases I will take NR and nmn and I observe this is just n of one self- observational data I observe a very clear positive effect but I don't think it has anything to do with extending lifespan and and we should talk about both Health span and lifespan benefits when we get to that part but we're so to bring us up to where we are now where you are with should people be supplementing NAD we're we're basically at the point where we're taking a lot of leaps of faith and saying because NAD levels are going down and Redux potential is going down we believe supplementing NAD in one form or another makes sense but before we do that we should acknowledge something yes NAD levels are going down but we have no reason to believe that raising NAD levels will correct a problem in other words if the body operates between this level and this level of NAD and if you go below this level you die and you go above this level you die and levels as you age go like this do we believe that raising them to this does anything we have there's no evidence that says it does so that's a leap of faith it's okay to take leaps of Faith you just have to know you're taking a leap of faith okay so leap of faith number one is the ceran thing leap of faith number two is the ceric Restriction thing leap of faith number three is this matters in our species the species of Interest leap of faith four is you know the whole uh ceran activator thing and now this leap of faith is if we just increase NAD levels in us it will produce a positive benefit okay so now how do how do we how do we do that now you get into the tactic okay there were three ways to do it as you said um one is you can intravenously take NAD by the way you could probably also orally take NAD it would just break down in the gut into its constitutive products um and then probably reform but for the purpose of how people actually do this they intravenously get NAD because it's not orally bioavailable or as you said they orally take two precursors NR and nmn my personal view on this is there's not really much of a difference in what you do in other words at the end of the day all of these things are generally going to increase NAD levels in the blood so a couple of um kind of practical notes I've taken NR in capsule form I've taken nmn typically in powdered form where I put it sublingually under the tongue my understanding is that have you done intravenous NAD I sure have and um and did you experience nasin flush no I I took NAD in a um as an infusion I probably done it five or six times and for the first 10 minutes of the infusion you feel like somebody stepping on your chest with a boot your legs cramp up you feel nauseous I did not take the anti-nausea Med that was offered I don't like taking things if I can avoid it I just figured I'll just experience this it was very uncomfortable MH to the point where you couldn't read a paper or a book you just you just want to be left alone you actually get a little bit irritable you're like this is awful you know every noise in the room is a bit too loud during that first 10 minutes and then by the way do you know how many people have said to me that because of that experience they know it must be doing something good oh my goodness to to which I'm like why don't you spread your legs let me kick you right in the nuts that's going to feel even worse is that doing something good like the fact that something feels so awful shouldn't be used as an explanation for why it's doing good physiologically right I don't know what it was doing physiologically except making me feel miserable during the infusion there are ways to adjust this even without the anti nausea meds for instance you can slow the infusion um that's the typical way people will put it in over the course of several hours anywhere from 3 hours to as brief as 30 minutes is kind of the record that I've heard about for 500 milligrams of NAD if you put 1,000 milligrams in there obviously it's more painful and you have to anyway there are a bunch of practical considerations you feel now maybe it's Placebo but one feels quite good afterward so as soon as the drip is done you feel better than you did prior to the drip how do you feel if you just receive an IV infusion of the same volume I've done that because I've received saline drips um you also feel pretty good yeah um it's hard to disentangle these things um and typically they'll put other things in the bag glutathione some vitamin C you know they tend to sell these as kits I just decided to try it it it seemed fine I did it when traveling I don't know maybe I'm due for another one soon but for me the more typical way to try and increase NAD or whatever because I don't know what it's doing exactly but I like the effects of taking sublingual nmn the single most let's say Salient to me uh anecdotal data on taking sublingual nmn is that it makes my hair grow really fast it makes my nails grow really fast and I do feel an increase in energy and I take it first thing in the morning morning um and what dose one and a half gram 1500 milligrams so by by the way if you translate you know the the doses that they give mice in the studies where they're testing the efficacy um are typically on the order of 500 to 1,000 milligrams per kilogram whoa yeah I'm 100 kilograms yep whoa okay so picture that the next time you're giving yourself some NAD or NR I'm not even approaching that yeah um at all well it's clear to me um based on my read of the data that NR can cross the cell membrane directly directly very easily there's no obstacle to NR getting into cells okay and nmn cannot because of that extra phosphate group so that if you take it sublingually or you ingest it orally it goes into the gut the phosphate group is clean and because of that the argument is that if one were to compare the benefits of taking NR versus nmn they're more data to support NR as a precursor to NAD a more effective precursor to NAD than orally ingested nmn but some people will say well I'll just take more nmn than I would NR and then this gets into the realm of Cost effectiven commercial starts becoming a battle between commercial sources and and I don't dispute that NR makes more sense as a precursor especially at dosages of you know 300 to 600 milligrams versus 1500 milligrams but I've opted to take sublingual nmn mostly based on cost and are at the dosages people recommend is quite expensive imagine you had to take it at the mouse doses right you'd be spending about 300 bucks a day right it's just it's not feasible it's just not feasible so you know I don't have a deep desire for my to grow faster or my nails to grow faster it's more the increase in energy effect now I will say that sublingual nmn is also a bit of a laxative so there all these and I say that you know somewhat chuckling but you know some people say it makes them feel better well is that because you're you know evacuating your bowels a few minutes or hours later and then you feel less bloated and you have more energy you know it's very unclear I think what has not been done as far as I know is to compare early and ingested NR at say 600 milligram a relatively high dose versus a gram of sublingual nmn and then actually measure blood levels of NAD if that experiment has been done and I'm not aware of it I'm not aware of it then forgive me maybe someone we'll put in the show note captions but I guess this gets down to the question of how many people are taking oral NR or n and Men or are taking NAD infusions which by the way are quite expensive mhm anywhere from $300 to $1,000 a drip that's pretty expensive what benefits are they getting what are they getting out of this like what are they getting is it an acute increase in NAD that that what that that causes them to live what a week longer I mean we have no idea well so so let's let's try to use data to answer the question right so this is exactly the thing that the ITP the interventions testing program was designed to test and again um I I would I would if people are interested in this they should go back and listen to my two discussions with Rich Miller where we go through gory detail of every molecule that has gone through the ITP the ITP is hands down the most rigorous tool we have for testing molecules in anything other than the species of interest because we can't do these experiments in human we cannot test lifespan interventions in humans for the obvious reasons so what is the next best thing well it turns out it's doing it in a noninbred mouse in triplicate in three institutions like you can't get more rigorous than this the ITP has tested probably north of 50 molecules meaning it has done the same experiment for 50 different molecules and very few have extended lifespan and the notable failure is NR NR was tested and I believe it was tested at a very robust dose either 500 or 1,000 milligrams per kilogram and there was no extension of life there was no improvement in health span there was no change megad do NR Placebo same result conversely let's consider some of the successes of the ITP rap a when you give rap a the first time they did it because they had a hard time formulating the Rapa they weren't able to started until the mice were like 21 months old which is very old for a mouse that's like a 60-year-old Mouse and at that point they almost aborted the experiment because they were like well what's the point nothing is going to work when you start this late including caloric restriction by the way although it has worked in one experiment but nevertheless it worked and when you gave Raa that late in life it still worked then they redid the experiment and they gave it earlier it worked kagaoan as I mentioned which is an sglt2 inhibitor it worked acarbose a drug that inhibits glucose absorption worked and interestingly didn't require weight loss so the th pis behind giving a carbos to the mice was it's a caloric restriction mimetic a CR mimetic and it worked but then but the but the treatment mice weren't any lighter than the non-treatment mice which actually goes back to something you said at the very outset which suggested that tight glycemic control independent of weight is a longevity benefit the same was true with the sglt2 inhibitor canaga floen sglt2 Inhibitors cause you to pee out more glucose a carbos vents you from absorbing in your gut so two different ways to regulate glucose neither of those experiments resulted in a lower body weight for the mice and yet they both lived longer again there's something very important about regulating blood glucose the other thing that worked is 17 beta sorry 17 Alpha estradiol and it only worked in male mice so again suggesting that um well we can come back to that it's more than we want to get into at the moment but Point here is there are very molecules that have withstood the scrutiny of the ITP it it is it's a high bar met foran failed by the way for and the ITP is specifically for offsetting aging is that right it is it is lifespan but it also looks at some measures of Health span but it's it's primarily it is the gold standard for lifespan yeah because my understanding is that there are some studies that have explored the role of supplemented NR maybe nmn as well but certainly supplemented NR for sake of lowering inflam to offset some of the negative effects of time zone shift alcohol um I have a few others listed here um overnutrition yeah so let's talk about that so so in 20 I don't remember what year it was it was somewhat recent um a study was published looking at NR with uh uh something called teras Bean so tertill Bean is believed to be a ceran activator like RIS veratrol so commercially available product called basis and it was tested there was a it was a three arm study in humans um roughly 30 people per arm so decent size study right this is a big study so you take 100 people more or less with fatty liver disease now this was documented with um uh an MRI of the liver so um they're looking at um hepatic fat in the liver um by Mr and um using this type of MRI if your hepatic fat index is over 5% that's a high enough degree of what's called steatosis that you have fatty liver disease now of course this is not um this is not an a digital thing it's an analog right there's a there's a spectrum to this so so you know you start with just fat accumulating in the liver but as more and more fat accumulates you start to get inflammation that results in scarring and fibrosis and ultimately you would get to therosis so just keep in back of your mind the Threshold at which we would say you're you're in the you're get you're in the danger zone is once you hit 5% so this study randomize people to either uh a placebo or a regular dose of this product or a double dose of the product and I can't remember exactly how much is in the product I think it's either 250 or 500 so then that would be what the regular group got of NR and then the other group was getting 2x that so it's either 250 and 500 or 500 and a th000 I don't recall um they also looked at something called the um they looked at many things right so they looked at all sorts of biomarkers um and the primary outcome for the study was did you see a reduction of this hepatic fat via the MRI um so what happened so they they did the study and uh lo and behold there was no difference there was no difference in anything okay so so at high dose at lowd dose there was no difference in how much hepatic fat you had at the end of the there was no difference in body weight there was no difference in inflammatory markers there was no difference in glycemic markers glucose levels liver function tests any of those things so in that sense it was a null study H but they did one subanalysis which again you have to be very careful of because a subanalysis is not a primary outcome but it's kind of a way to go and parse the data and they did find one statistically one statistically significant finding which was if you limited the analysis to people who had a hepatic fat score below 27% remember I said once you're above 5% you're you're sort of you have fatty liver disease well they had people anywhere from you know 10% to 40% wow but if they looked at people who were below 27% in the lowd do group there was a statistically significant reduction in liver fat if it sounds like I'm masting I am let me say it again if you limited the analysis to people who had below 27% on this hepatic fat index the people who got the full dose had no difference they averaged 20% at the beginning of the trial and 19% at the end no statistically significant difference the placebo group averaged 20% at the beginning 20% at the end but the single dose of the drug went from 20 % to 15% which was statistically significant it's not clear that that's clinically significant which is a pretty consistent theme in this type of research never confuse statistical significance with clinical significance if I gave you if your blood pressure is 160 over 100 and I give you a drug that lowers it to 157 over 97 that could be statistically significant if the variance is small enough between people in the study it has no clinical significance I haven't changed the course of your life so again that to me is one of the one of the two big findings that people point to to say aha there was some benefit in fatty liver disease with this but again when you read the fine print which I just vomited out to you I I don't think anybody's looking at that going oh we we just found the solution to to Naf D the second study that people point to a lot was 2021 or 2022 um this came out of a group at washu I believe and they looked at nmn and they looked at glucose disposal so in this study they asked the question um we're going to take two groups of people you're going to get a placebo for a period of time or you're going to get nmn for a period of time and um we're going to then do what's called a a a type of glucose challenge where we look at how well you dispose of glucose with and without insulin infusion and in the uh placebo group you would look at pre and post glucose so so pre- and post Placebo treatment was there a difference in glucose disposal with no insulin no what about with insulin where you would expect to see much more glucose disposal no difference but when you did that with the nmn group there was a statistically significant increase in glucose disposal with insulin infusion but it was quite small in other words it was clinically very insignificant and just to make just to sort of figure out how insignificant it was I went back and actually looked at some of the red light data because there's an interesting study that shines red light on a person's back and then does an oral glucose tolerance test yeah and you can actually reduce like postprandial glucose by 8% is that meaningful not really I mean not in this not in this patient population because these people were all pre-diabetic they had very high glucose so it was again another example of something that was statistically significant but not clinically significant and the same thing was true in this study right but again people would would probably point to these St two studies because they're Inhumans and you had this one if you squint and look really hard and take a Sub sub subset of the analysis on this one measurement we saw you know a result a response of hepatic fat going from 20 to 15% which is still 3x above the threshold to hepati liver disease and in this other study you had this you know very very modest reduction pardon me increase in glucose disposal but I mean like we're you know there's a saying in my in my sort of Mind Andrew which is like if you have to resort to really interesting statistical machinations to see something there probably isn't something very interesting there right right I totally agree and I think you know at this point I'm questioning whether or not I'm wasting my money taking NN or I take NR is really for these anti-inflammation um reported purported effects um I just want to pay a little bit of attention to the whole commercial battle around this because I think it's relevant I mean I think right now as far as I know the FDA has essentially said that nmn should not be sold as a supplement but it is still being sold as a supplement so there's a little bit of a ignoring of the and of the fda's request NR as far as I know is authorized for sale as a supplement yeah so it's generally regarded as safe it has an FDA designation of grass which means it is not regulated generally recognized as safe right and so that means um anybody can sell it the FDA will have no oversight they're not telling you whether they're not going to put a stamp on it that says what they're selling is what it is um and they you can't make a claim about it that isn't validated by some sort of study so um I honestly Andrew I think the whole nnnr debate is irrelevant I I think it's just a commercial debate I think it's literally just posturing about how can I carve out a different Market I don't think there's a scientific reason to favor one over the other well you just answered the question I was going to ask but I suppose the question therefore becomes is there any benefit to taking either of them for sake of lifespan there's one benefit I could find there's one benefit I could find that I think is genuine there are a few other really insignificant ones that fall into the category of goofy studies that cherry pick by data mining okay so so there's studies that like gave people nmn and looked at a shotgun approach of many different things like did it change LDL cholesterol HDL cholesterol triglycerides and the answer is oh look there's a small decrease but it was totally insignificant clinically even if stati Ally significant and oh it increased your you know six-minute walking test or whatever and it's like a six-minute walk test or whatever in people who were in their 20s is irrelevant it had no change in V2 Max it had no change in any meaningful metric of performance one test one study I could find that actually had what looked like a signal to me and it was a study that looked at skin cancer rates um with and I can't remember if it was NR or nmn but honestly I don't think it matters because I think they're basically equivalent um once just got a phosphate group on there you might need to take a little bit more of the nmn versus NR or maybe a lot more who knows in order to get the same increase in NAD is my understanding so this one study found somewhere between a 60 and 80% reduction in basil cell and squa cell carcinomas I found no difference in melanomas so again you know this because you just did a podcast on this melanomas the skin cancer that kills you but that's not to say that you know squa cell and basil cell carcinomas aren't problematic they can be very uh you know deforming uh they can require pretty aggressive surgeries to address them and so if indeed there is something that can reduce the risk of basil and squel carcinomas that may be a rationale for taking it and I should say that basil and Squam Cel carcinomas are very very common they are very common and they are very clearly associated with sun exposure a way that even melanoma is more complicated and has a genetic component and there are other things going on but squamous and basil cell carcinoma are very clearly related to sun exposure uh as you said they're quite common and so you know personally that's an experiment I would like to see repeated because if indeed um NR and/or nmn reduce the risk that significantly of sell and basal so carcinomas I think you could make a case that if you're an individual who's at risk for those things clearly I'm not right like I've never had a sunburn in my life I mean I I don't work outside so it's like it wouldn't matter to me but there are a lot of people for whom either either their skin color makes them more susceptible or their their um you know their pastimes or or frankly their their their line of work makes them more susceptible you know maybe there is a case to be made for it there if if you could if you could literally take 60 to 80% of your risk away on S Mr basell carcoma that could matter and by the way I don't know if this is true but you you may recall at the outset the outset I said that when you look at all the tissues in the body where we see a reduction in NAD do you remember what had the biggest reduction it was skin so there's a part of me that wonders like is the reason that the only place we see a really good signal potentially for NR and nmn supplementation is is in a skin cancer although it's not melanoma which is the one we'd really want to see I mean if this reduce the risk of melanoma I would take it right because even though I'm dark skinned I'm still susceptible to melanoma um so I just wonder that could be true true and unrelated but that's that's the first thought that crossed my mind when I came across that literature was hm I wonder if the enormous reduction in uh tissue NAD in this particular tissue explains why maybe there is a benefit to it assuming somebody is averse to feeling like they have an elephant stepping on their chest and they're going to pay $750 for it AKA and NAD infusion once a week and look people may opt to do that with the disposable income could do that drip it in slower not feel nauseous increase NAD with the hope hope hope that maybe it's going to extend your life most people considering supplementation to augment the NAD pathway are going to default to either taking INR or taking nmn by the way just going back to the group that have decided that $1,000 for an NAD infusion and dripping it in over two hours is a good use of their time what do you think would be the Improvement in their lifp if they spent that 2 hours exercising significantly greater interesting all right just just not and and less expensive but yeah right you could also weight train for the first hour and then enjoy some food afterwards Lane Norton taught me that there are data showing that exercise in particular resistance training improves the rewarding properties of food makes food taste better which we've all kind of intuitively experienced so you spend the first hour working out hour eating if you had an extra two hours a week to choose between paying a th000 bucks or 700 bucks for an Adu infusion or you know uh lift weights for an hour go for a half an hour walk and listen to your favorite podcast uh like the huberman lab and then eat a meal for half an hour like I can just think of so many better ways to spend time uh and money but anyway let's let's not digress okay well I'm going to pull a little bit from marketing text here but I trust these showing really yeah yeah I do because they have citations to support them and we can include the citations these are not um I'm not going to say these are these are not Lynch pin Arguments for doing one thing or the other but we already established that NR and nmn are quite similar except for the presence of a phosphate group on NR that gets cleaved off so again you might have a slight dose issue but at the end of the day you're giving NR NR is freely taken up into cells it turns into NAD so this is all a big sort of shell game of how do you get NAD up and and again I think we've established and we can we can agree that that there is an increase in NAD at least in the blood and probably in the liver when you take exogenous NAD or precursor let's yeah that's right so great well then you took the words right out of the the data I was going to refer to that's right because I asked a few folks that help develop some of the NR supplements like what are the data yep that support the use of NR for increasing n and they say NR can cross the cell membrane directly NN cannot okay but you can just CLE the phosphate group right exactly um NR they claim I'm not this is not my claim but they claim that NR is quote unquote 25% more effective than NN in raising whole blood NAD levels but I'm guessing that's milligram for milligram right okay so then you just adjust the milligram dosage a little bit and so on what's entirely unclear is what raising blood NAD translates to in terms of getting more NAD into cells I don't know that that's specifically cells like skeletal muscles right I think based on Josh Rabinowitz his work I also had Josh Rabinowitz on the podcast to talk about this um and I trust Josh on this um much more than I would trust any marketing material um because he doesn't have a dog in this fight right right he just you know he just does the work and um what Josh's research soed which is basically NAD flux research has demonstrated that look the liver is probably the place of greatest uptake uh in addition to blood and that's about all we know like it's not clear how much of this is getting into other cells um so I mean that's the rest of it is just you know I think rearranging deck chairs on a Titanic as far as like how much does it really matter and and again I don't even think it's worth arguing about whether nmn or NR is more bioavailable because to your point you can sort of adjust the dose and I trust that whatever you're taking NR or nmn you are getting some NR into the cells and that's being converted to NAD but we still keep coming back to the jugular question does that matter does increasing intracellular NAD matter when the system is so tightly regulated so I think what you see is a lot of marketing material that tries to make the case that you can do it great I'll grant you that you can do it does it matter does it matter in lifespan the answer appears to be unambiguously no at this point does it matter in health span I think that's what we're discussing right there's something um so sticky about the longevity field just so sticky about this idea that one could take something and extend lifespan and people don't want to be in the control group so they're willing to invest significant amounts of money to do it well I mean I think the bigger issue is like you can't do the longevity experiment in humans and I'm sure that these companies that sell this and I honestly I don't follow the space I don't know how many of these companies there are out there I can name two because the you know five years ago which was the last time I really dug into this I knew who the two dominant players were for all I know there could be 20 companies today that are selling NR and NN I don't know they're probably about 30 to 50 prior to this FDA ruling okay which is kind of an interesting situation in its own right yeah you know what happened there was the supplement nmn suddenly the FDA decided that it should not be sold over the counter um anymore because there was a clinical trial initiated on nmn which essentially makes nmn a drug for clinical testing and thereby can't be classified as a supplement any longer that was the rationale As I understood it but as with things like anical cysteine that was more of a lobbying effort though I think I I don't think actually that was a scientific decision I think that was more of a lobbying decision um from a from a market protection from an IP protection standpoint and this had happened prior for netal cysteine Knack which some people take it's a mucolytic it's actually a great decongestant yep if uh you're congested and it increases glutathione that's my understanding and I believe somebody checked me on does it decrease or increase glutathione increases glutathione is my understanding if I have that wrong someone will tell me quickly in the comments my understanding is that in Europe Knack might even be available by prescription in the US you can still buy it over the counter but a few years back the FDA said nope can't sell Knack any longer and there was a push back lobby to keep it on the market and you can still buy it on Amazon the same thing has more or less happened with nmn and certainly with NR although NR was never in question in terms of whether or not it should be sold as a supplement or not because as far as I know there's no clinical trial on nnr at least not currently so there's a clinical trial on nmn which classifies it as an experimental drug and therefore the FDA said nope you can't sell it as a supplement a few companies major companies pulled NN from the market in the US many smaller companies just kind of watched and waited and continued to sell it and I checked prior to the beginning this episode and you can still buy it online but of course a lot of what we're saying today is kind of a why would you um we're not really coming up with strong arguments um for taking nmn um at least not in today's discussion yeah I mean again I think the strongest argument I could make based on the data would be potentially on the um on the on the basil cell and squa cell carcinoma uh risk reduction if indeed those results are reproducible um that again that's that would be justification again for the right individual wouldn't be a justification for me might be a justification for somebody um but really the rest of it is um why why do you need to do experiments on this if you're selling a supplement when you don't need to make claims to sell a supplement like if it's a drug you have to have an indication you can't sell a drug without rigorous trials that demonstrate both safety and efficacy um I do think it's pretty safe to say that I I I do think NR and nmn are probably um there has been some voice around the idea that NR could increase the risk of cancer right and the experts in this area like Charles brener have pushed back hard on that arguing that the studies were not done well is as I recall I I think that's probably fair I don't think there's been a well done study in this entire field is is part of the problem right um so so and then that's probably too harsh a statement but but this is not a field that's like you know that's necessarily lending itself to the rigor that you would in in in pharmacotherapy and I I I think there are probably you know you mentioned Charles brener like I think Charles does good work right um and he works on many things not just this yeah and and and and by the way I don't I don't think I don't hear Charles out there saying that NR increases lifespan No in fact I don't want to quote him um at all but I think he would argue that sirtuin NR and a men should not logically or practically be linked to to efforts to extend lifespan but that there are some interesting positive effects of augmenting NR as a means to increase NAD for sake of anti-inflammation and some of these other effects that we've been discussing yeah that's my understanding of his position as well is that I I think he firmly agrees with what I laid down at the outset of this which is there's no meaningful logical connection between the relationship of uh ceran caloric restriction and NR that's that's just a that's a shell game that is empty um and and you're right I mean I think part of the reason why I think there's much better research going on with rap ay is that there's really no commercial interest in Rapa like nobody's going to make money selling Rapa because it's so cheap well yeah and it's actually not cheap but it's a drug that is off- patent right so this is a drug that was approved by the FDA 25 years ago so generic forms are inexpensive enough that no believe it or not they're not this is the irony of it is is generic so rap immune is the brand drug um that was initially uh uh approved in 1999 and today if you go and buy rapamycin you're going to not buy rapamune you're going to probably buy generic uh ceramus or rapamycin and yet it's surprisingly quite expensive now it's not enormously expensive because you're not taking much of it but it's about five bucks a milligram that's pretty expensive so if you're taking 8 milligrams a week that's 40 bucks a week is probably what I spend on Rapa and that ain't cheap no relative to you know and it's cheaper than some things I take but it's not cheap um but the point is like nobody has a commercial interest in rapy right it's sort of an irrelevant drug it's but the interest is scientific right and and and the commercial interest is in what we call rapalogs which are analoges of Rapa and that are being um investigated by a number of companies to to look at new indications for example immunity immune function right so rapy historically is thought of as an immune suppressant because that's the context in which it was approved for patients uh undergoing organ transplantation um but you know I think Joan manik um and Lloyd klickstein when they published that paper in 2014 using everolimus where they took a group of 65y olds and randomize them to either a placebo or different Doses and dosing schedules of everolimus found an enhanced immunity in response to an influenza vaccine which again was for me that was the turning point right that's when Rapa went from something that was interesting based on the first ITP in 2009 to maybe we should be taking this in 2014 so between 2009 and 2014 I was kind of looking at the curios of rapy and saying well cool that it worked in mice I don't think humans should ever consider this to that study which was like wait a minute something's different if you take rapamycin as a human at least every day it seems to suppress your immune system but if you just pulse it once a week as they did in that study it seems to improve immune function which again means it's an immune modulator it can go up or down on the immune system that was really the the hypothesis that emerged from that experiment um and so now the question is could you design drugs that are more specific to empor complex one which ramyon is not but you can get around that by dosing it intermittently um and then of course you know is it a drug that has efficacy in in terms of other um other things that can be tested in humans that are not longevity because you can't test lifespan in humans obviously right you're 50 right 50 years old 51 you seem to be vigorous you take great care of yourself how much do you think taking rap ayin for how many years have you been taking it six has contributed to your current state or Vigor zero idea this is my opportunity to ask about your belief or lack of belief in biological aging tests because if somebody's going to experiment with any or all of these things um they may want to evaluate whether or not they're biological ages is changing and there are a number of these tests available mhm um and people love this stuff love them they love them I mean who wouldn't want to see that they are 51 years old but their biological age is 37 I just did a movement test the other day so it's a it's a it's a very fancy camera system where you it's got a million cameras on you and you go through this whole exercise how high can you jump how far can you throw like it was awesome and then it gives you a movement age Andrew I was 20 I believe it I mean I'm on I should be I should feel amazing do you actually think I move like a 22y old I mean are you freaking kidding me I bet you if I went and did that again tomorrow I'd come back at 31 or something there is so much nonsense in this type of testing it it is just you know look there's probably something to be said if I do that and I come out at 22 as I did versus 92 sure I would I would grant you that if you took 150 year olds and you put them through a movement test the ones that really really are struggling will come out older and the ones that really really are doing great are going to come out younger so great I guess it's not I guess I move reasonably well for a 51y old but it's simply impossible to believe that I can do today what I could do when I was 22 with respect to movement and strength and power which is what that was assessing you're doing a lot of jumping single leg jump here do all this kind of stuff balance testing all sorts of things um and and and I guess I would say the gold standard for any of these biologic aging tests has to be the following what is a better predictor of remaining years of life chronologic age or biologic age that's to me the most important standard so how old are you chronologically I turned 49 in six weeks okay so um I'm sure your listeners will not like to hear this because they would probably hope and believe that you are Immortal but some might want to hear that I'm going to be taken out soon but uh let's let's just grant your mortality as a given um based just on your chronologic age an actuary would come up with a pretty decent prediction of how long you're going to live now I would argue that that's a crude assumption because it doesn't take into account the fact that you're metabolically healthy that you do all of the things that you do but just based on the fact that you are a man who is 49 years old and who doesn't smoke those three things would give me if I were an actuary a very good prediction of your life expectancy and because I'm not an actuary I don't know the exact number but my guess is it would be predicted at this point at another 37 years okay well I bought that chart my life in weeks yes in fact I bought two of them um for reasons that are uninteresting but I've watched that chart Phil um not quite what you predicted but I put my estimated lifespan to be 95 great that's fine and then I have little lines on the side MH of how much Vigor I felt from uh and just overall Wellness completely subjective of zero being like completely cratered near death to 10 like it's best I've ever felt but you do that you make that note every how often uh okay so what I did is you know from 10 to 15 I felt you know blank and then um in my 20s I actually didn't feel so great because I was I was working 80 hour weeks commonly you can ask my former lab technicians um I was just talking to Fong win recently and I mean I used to work to collapse not healthy you know 80 hour a week maybe 100 hours occasionally maybe 70 maybe back to 40 but just too much work not enough sleep s nutrition not great not just not doing the right things but just gave gave my 20s to being in in lab basically and a lot of my 30s as well so I would say from 40 to 45 my Vigor was higher than in my 30s MH and then now I track I would say about every two months I'll start filling in that line and it's adjusted for by stressors and adjusted for by positive things in life life and the goal for me is to figure out what are the behavioral tools and other things I can do or take that are going to keep the Vigor as high as possible Vigor well-being internal peace Etc all of that combined kind of what I'm calling Wellness in this very subjective uh measure as high as possible as I transition to my 50s my 60s 70s and 80s and I'm guessing that I'm going to have to do many more things in my 80s and 90s in order to maintain a simil hopefully level of vigor and well-being than I do now and the question is will I be able to yeah maybe maybe I I might take a slightly different different um um different angle on that but let me go back and make one point and then we'll come back to this point which is actually really interesting yeah because I think the chart is great I think the chart um more than any supplement for longevity gives you a or gives one a visual perspective of where they sit in this long Arc and I don't think the brain is very good at anchoring us to the notion that we are mortal um because if we think about that for even a few moments too long it makes us anxious and I think we are very good at avoiding that reality yeah well it's it's it's um as you said it's very difficult to contemplate finitude um so I I actually want to talk about that because I think it's so interesting but I just want to make this point about the Actuarial point right so um let's just say actuarially your expectation is 40 years more at this point because you're 49 you're a male and you don't smoke so we believe you have somewhere between 35 and 40 more years of life predicted on the basis of your biologic age that's it that's all I got you're going to live to whatever 88 to 91 or something I'm making that up but that's like okay I better get cracking on some stuff so now let's pretend you went and did a biologic age test okay so let's say you did that and let's say it came back and said you're 25 so if I had a 25-year-old male non-smoker in front of me what's his life expectancy well it's about 60 to 65 years does that mean that you Andrew have 60 to 65 more years of life based on a fact that your biologic clock says you're 25 do you believe that no no way no of course not now this would be an easy thing to test not in humans but you could do it in mice right interesting that to my knowledge that experiment hasn't been done so right out of the gate when I look at people talking about their biologic age you know well I'm I'm actually 60 years old you know chronologically but my biologic age is 35 um my response is who cares truth F like is that a good thing yes probably but does it is it is it is it tangibly measurably meaningful like to have a biologic age of 35 versus 40 versus 30 if you're 60 I don't think I I think we're we're applying a very false level of precision to something that might only need to be directionally true secondly we don't really yet understand the biologic noise in that measurement right so there are lots of things that we measure that are really noisy so um if I measured your I don't know let's think of something that's very biologically noisy your triglyceride level like your triglycerides are pretty noisy unless I do something very important which is standardize it by how long it's been since your last meal like if you ask me right now what my trigs are I have no earthly idea because you know I probably ate 3 hours ago like and I don't even remember what I ate how much fat was in it how much carbohydrate was in I have no idea so the only way you could really get a triglyceride measurement and put any weight to it is if you've been fasting for 8 to 12 hours then we can at least say hey a triglyceride level of 50 milligrams per deciliter is excellent whereas a triglyceride level of 120 milligrams per deciliter is lousy but if you measured my trigs today and they meaning at this moment and they were 150 that could be totally reasonable even though at fasting levels I'm at 50 so we know that because we know exactly what goes into the triglyceride measurement but when you look at a biologic clock that takes into account your glucose level your vitamin D level your epigenetic marker here or there those are very noisy things so how do I know when I measure it in you now versus when I measure it in you a year from now I captured you in the exact same space I mean I don't so it's for that reason that I just have a very hard time putting any stock in this um now does that mean that in the future we won't find some benefit in this I I I think we probably will um I do think of all the things that go into it probably the epigenetic part of it would be the most interesting but again what most people don't understand is sort of a dirty little secret is how difficult it is to measure the and to sequence The epig genome right so to my knowledge none of the companies that are doing this I may be incorrect on this by the way but the last time I looked which was about a year ago not a single company was correctly sequencing The epig genome on these things so they were not able to accurately say what they were giving you an average representation of your methylation but they weren't going base pair by base pair and actually sequencing this the way we would sequence The genome so so again it just it's so much noise in this system and um I I just think it creates a a little bit of a distraction for people truthfully do you avoid going through the um non uh let's just say the non-traditional scanner at the airport the one that might use higher levels of radiation no do you think about how many flights you take as a source of radiation no let's just keep this all in context so the NRC recommends that a human being or at least an American should expose themselves to less than 50 MTS of radiation a year okay so what that number doesn't mean anything to somebody so let me give people a sense of what that means so how many mills of radiation do you and I receive because we both live at sea level so just ambient radiation living at sea level is one Miller a year okay so we just chewed up 2% of our annual allocation what if you moved to Colorado now you're a mile up that increases you from one to two Ms a year okay what if you had a CT scan of your chest uh uh a CT angiogram well it depends on where you got it done if you got it done at a really good place with a fast scanner and great software probably three Mill certs a year if you got it done at a place that's sort of average might be 10 to 15 Mill cevers pardon me per scan um now here's what's really interesting uh by the way I'm I'm totally fascinated by this question which is how much radiation is too much um a dexa scan by the way you can't even measure how many Ms you're getting so a dexa scan is like less radiation than a cross-country flight so it's super super super low less than an xray or anything like that um people who work in uh in nuclear plants I'm told I haven't looked at the primary data on this but I've talked to people who incessantly do this so so it's possible I'm a little bit off on this but I'm told that these people are at 10 times that level of radiation exposure and sometimes higher so not they're not getting 50 they might be getting like 500 m seits a year and yet interestingly they're not in an increased risk for cancer I'm not sure what to make of that um but it suggests to me that we probably don't need to worry about things like airport scanners and flights in fact even if you look at pilots who do constant flights across the poles because you're going to get the most radiation going over the pole to my knowledge there's no convincing data that suggest those people are't an increased risk of cancer either and they're you know they're obviously at the upper end of what a civilian would experience in terms of radiation so um I just I'm not convinced that that's like that's something we should be stressed about I think you just relieved a lot of people of some unnecessary concern I want to go back to what you were saying earlier about what you need to do in your 90s versus what you're doing now so you said you think that in the in your 80s and 90s you're going to have to work harder to preserve the vitality that you have now yeah grip strength jumping cognitive function I mean I've got very good genes in terms of longevity on one side of my family pretty good on the other although not as robust I mean if I just look historically um yeah who who knows right I mean but my sense is that I'll live to be 95 if you know barring you know bullet Buster cancer so I would say that yes you're going to have to work hard in that last decade of life to preserve those things but I think it's the work we do now that sets the stage for that it's the foundational work that we do in this period of Our Lives you know you and I are only a couple years apart but I think this is the critical decade it's in your 50s to your 60s and in your 60s to your 70s that I think is is the deciding time 50s to 750s to yeah 50s to 70s so so what is it about this this window that you and I are just entering now and why is it so important um I think it's important because we're we're getting to that point where aging does start to show up like I think if if you and I are being brutally honest like we're we're kind of half the men we used to be um and and and and again that just means like look like a night of poor sleep shows up more right when you were working in the lab as hard as you were describing it you could probably walk through walls when you were exhausted yeah a short nap would reset me near completely yeah I I got more colds and flu in that time because I wasn't taking such good care but then again I was indoors more so it's an imperfect experiment but you're right I think that um as I've approached 50 I need to do more you need to do more self-care you need to be more mindful of what you're eating how you're sleeping how you're recovering from those workouts because we still do hard workouts but recovery plays a greater role in other words we're just not quite as resilient as we used to be you know I was telling somebody the other day they asked me about my residency I don't think being hyperbolic when I say this I couldn't do one month of what I did for five years I really couldn't do it I don't think I I don't think there's any there's no way I could go back to that level of sleep deprivation for a month let alone five years so um you know that's just a fact of Aging I think so um but what we have to do during this period of time is build up as much physiologic Reserve as possible and so the the important thing is we you know we have to stay in the game because compounding makes such a difference right so you know we're still young enough that we can actually put on muscle mass now that's not always going to be the case it's going to be very difficult to add muscle mass when you're in your mid to late 70s it's doable but it's very very difficult so instead we want to be putting on as much muscle mass as we can and increasing or at least maintaining strength as much as we can uh again probably increasing it is unlikely clearly we're not increasing power as we age right Andy Galpin has talked a lot about this the atrophy of the type two muscle fibers the 2A muscle fibers really start to atrophy in your 20s and 30s so I know I don't have a fraction of the power that I used to have and I know that because my vertical jump is L literally half what it was when I was a teenager I was never mine was never very good so I it doesn't matter how good it was my point is like if you know what your vertical jump was at8 192 and then you do it today I mean it's literally 50% and that's one of the purest tests of power um so power's going down strength is going down but not as much muscle mass is actually not because remember that's the order in which you lose things right you're going to lose power strength and size of muscle um but again size still matters it's still a glucose sync all these other things um but what we don't want to do is you know be out of the game right what we don't want to do is injure ourselves and get a setback that becomes very difficult to recover from because you know when you're our age if you're inactive for months at a time it's it's going to be 2: one or 3:1 ratio of inactivity to activity to get it back um what about energy sorry to interrupt but since we've been talking about molecules and energetic Pathways what about energy just that get up and go let's just say after a decent night's sleep 7 and half hours um waking up same time more or less you know 6:30 7: a.m. probably for you or me and why is it that as we get older we have less energy our mutual good friend the late Ben Baris used to ask about this he used to say he called me Andy he was like Andy why do I have so much less energy I was like I don't know I don't know it's a great question now unfortunately he died of pancreatic cancer so there may have been other things going on but that was prior to the cancer at least as far as I know you know it's a very interesting question why do we have less energy and I don't think anyone's ever been able to answer that question no and when you have kids you're going to be even more starkly confronted with that because I actually it's one of the things I am most Amazed by when I look at my kids especially the youngest ones the boys who are seven and 10 is what I just describe as spontaneous outbursts of energy um like their inability to sit still their kinetic desire to just like they will like if we I remember once we were kind of walking through a mall and we're walking through the mall they are sprinting ahead of us sprinting back sprinting ahead of us sprinting back like imagine if you and I were walking through the mall and I just started running ahead and running back you'd be so sore the next day but it's like it just wouldn't occur to me to ever run unless being chased right like it's just I mean like like we now live a life like I think our ancestors did which was you know if we're not deliberately in the business of moving for a reason like you're exercising you're going for a walk for the sake of going for a walk like you just wouldn't it wouldn't occur to you go and expend energy for no reason and yet kids do this it's amazing and um look it's going to go down by the time you're a teenager like just going from being you know sort of 10 to 18 there's probably a significant reduction in spontaneous outbursts of energy let alone where we are now um and it's a great question who maybe it's NAD I mean I don't know maybe although up until now we've been talking about all these ways to try and increase NAD in the bloodstream and hopefully in cells and I don't know I take my nmn and my NR and I feel a little bit of a boost in energy but I can't say that it's so significant that I feel like I can Sprint back and forth Just spontaneously these again it's just so hard for me to imagine that any supplement or any drug including rapy which I think is the most promising geroprotective drug we have I just can't imagine that those things even compare to what good sleep good exercise and good nutrition do for your energy levels and vitality and the reality of it is all three of those things are hard to do you know yeah they especially if you're an adult like especially if you have a real life you know you got kids you got a job which is presumably many people listening to us right now like there's very few people listening to us right now whose only purpose in life is to take care of their health everybody's got something else they have to do which means you have competing interests for how do you take care of yourself so to sleep is not easy right like we all are busy as hell we don't want to have to stop what we're doing to undergo nighttime routine to put ourselves in the right head space to be able to sleep do all the things necessary give ourselves that eight hours in bed to hopefully get seven seven and a half hours of sleep um even people like me who like exercise I know you like exercise um it still is a sacrifice in terms of time um and and and for many people certainly for me food is the hardest of these all right if left my own devices I'd eat freaking Froot Loops all day like I love fro Loops right interesting by way of contrast the food party is easy for me I like healthy food and oh I like healthy food I just like all food I like I don't like unhealthy food I've weaned myself off it I never really liked it that much I mean I like a great tasting slice of pizza or ice cream every once in a while but I much prefer meat fish chicken eggs fruits vegetables rice OB I just like that stuff I'm a weirdo that way I suppose but on the topic of exercise as it relates to Vigor and Longevity I'm intrigued by how some forms of exercise give us more energy especially the same day and how some forms of exercise or even timing of exercise tends to deplete us because I think one of your major um sort of calls to the public has been to move more yeah for sake of their health span and lifespan but because of the time investment that it takes to work out in a gym or to go for a run or a Ruck I think some people think well that's a lot of time but if it gives you more energy and more Focus to do other things well then it's great so it's not just about living longer it's about being able to do more and I've noticed I don't have any science to back this up but I'd love someone to run a test on this that if I complete my workout before 9:00 a.m. even if I have to start it while I'm a little bit fatigued I have more energy all day long but that if I initiate that workout say mid to late morning I'm pretty tired in the afternoon it's like I give everything I have to that workout and so it becomes a little bit defeating since I'm not a professional athlete or even an amateur athlete I'm working out for health span lifespan but I I want to do exercise that gives me more life during my waking hours I think somebody should study this and I'm convinced that it has something to do with the change in body temperature that occurs across the day and the additional change in body temperature that occurs as a consequence of exercise that's my hypothesis do you notice a seasonal change in that do you experience it more or less in one season or the other I haven't thought about it that much but not so much not so much and I wonder whether folks like our friend Joo willink are able to do so much he has so much Vigor that guy in part because he basically exercises at the just after the lowest temperature phase of the Circadian rhythm and use his exercise presumably to drive himself out of that and get that you know temperature increase that's the consequence of waking but in his case he's waking up so early 4:30 is when he starts those workouts so it's something for people to play with it's something that I don't think gets discussed enough which is yes you should exercise do resistance training do cardiovascular training but play with the timing of those and see how at a given intensity it impacts your energy levels for the remainder of the day I think that's I think it's an important metric that again I I just don't see a lot of attention to because I think if people could experience the increase in energy that is the consequence of working out at the right intensity in the right way at the right times for them they'd be much more apt to do it it wouldn't feel like this like spending money on something that sure will make you live longer but then you're depleted and you can't do cognitive work there's something pretty impressive about the fact that as far as I know the last three let's just call them I don't want to call anyone out specifically major pillars of the high level administration at Stanford school of medicine to my knowledge were all 5 am. Runners there's something about early morning exercise and my good friend Eddie Chang who's the chair of neurosurgery at ucss he's been on this podcast known him since we were 7 years old he's an early morning exerciser and then he's got tons of energy all day what about the reverse causality there do you think it's possible that they're they have a whole they have a system of high energy that makes Joo who he is or makes you know these people who they are and as a result of that they they they're able to work out 5 o' in the morning yeah I don't doubt it I just have noticed that in the few times in my life where I've kicked my own butt to get out and start working out really early I have more energy all day long sometimes I still require a brief nap but it's a pretty striking effect as compared to you know the 10: a.m. workout effect yeah so I've started setting a standard of trying to get my workout done before 9:00 a.m. so anyway something for people to play with because the more energy to live in your waking hours um perhaps not longer but um certainly have more energy in terms of output I think is a significant and undervalued parameter so let's let's quickly return to supplements we I think are converging on an answer about NR nmn and NAD which is you don't take them correct I take NR and nmn with not a lot of religious adherence I should say if I ran out I might not buy it for a while and the only observed effect for me is this accelerated hair growth which is a pain in the butt frankly cuz it just just means I have to get my hair cut more often I'm not trying to grow my hair faster but okay what are some other supplements if any that you take that are peripheral to this pathway or separate from this pathway Romy is a prescription drug only right so are there any over-the-counter things that you take that you would Place into the lifespan category maybe they touch into Health span as well I'm happy to list off what I do but um what are your let's just say top five at least well I don't I don't take that many so top five would be a pretty exhaustive list um I think the other supplements that I take I do take EPA and DHA in the form of liquid or capsule fish oil capsules not because I have a an effection for capsule over liquid it's just going to increase my compliance if I take I've done both and I noticed when I was taking liquid because you're storing it in the fridge it's just it's just one more step removed and I was just less likely to remember to take it twice a day um I take uh thumin um and there's some reasonable evidence in MCI patients that thumin improves cognitive function um so I think there's a relatively low downside to the hypothesis that theum uh May uh preserve cognitive function um again I I don't I don't I don't I I wouldn't put that in the category of like beat the table for it right I think it's just you know reasonable evidence um I take I do take vitamin D because interestingly despite the fact that I'm outside every day without supplemental vitamin D my levels are surprisingly low how much do you take I take 5,000 IU um and that takes me from kind of a level of 30ish to a level of 50ish mhm um and there's you know there's a lot of debate about how high vitamin D levels should be that's a whole separate podcast we could you know waste time on that in in 10 years yeah my appetite to talk about that one uh let me think what else do I take because I sure oh I do take methyl folate and methyl B12 um and again the the the rationale there is um I do think there's some evidence that elevated levels of homosysteine are uh bad in and of themselves so there's no denying the fact that elevated levels of homosysteine are associated with bad things that's unambiguously clear meaning there's an association between Badness and homocysteine what's not clear is is it causal now there's definitely one mechanism you can point to although again mechanisms are what they are we just spent how many hours talking about mechanisms that theoretically make sense that never pan out but mechanistically homocysteine will um inhibit the clearance of something called symmetric uh and asymmetric dimethyl Arginine have you heard of these things sdma and adma so adma and sdma uh regulate nitric oxide synthes and homocystine impairs their clearance and therefore when you have high levels of homocystine it per it results ultimately an impaired nitric oxide synthes and therefore low lower nitric oxide so this has been proposed as at least one mechanism by which homosysteine might negatively impact um vascular disease uh so and we also know by the way that um adma and sdma are cleared by the kidneys and therefore this might this is also proposed as one of the mechanisms by which impaired kidney function is is um uh impacts vascular health because that's a known right if you if your kidneys don't work well your risk of heart disease goes way up so this is now proposed as a link between what we OB erve with homocysteine and impaired renal function so um we know that if you take methyl folate and uh uh methyl B12 you're going to lower homocysteine that's abundantly clear so the the thinking is that that might actually lower um adma sdma and raise nitri oxide synthes again relatively low cost lowrisk you know thing to take at modest doses I also there's probably some evidence that overs supplementing vitamin B is problematic especially B6 so I don't because of peripheral nerve damage exactly so I don't supplement B6 I'm just taking a bit of folate and and and methyl B12 let me think what else do I take because I do take a couple other things oh I take um magnesium L3 and8 and ashwagandha for Sleep um i' take slow mag which is just a a magnesium chloride slow relasing version of magnesium and I take methyl pardon me I take uh magnesium oxide so I take magnesium in three forms so I'm I'm I'm I'm long magnesium you're carpet bombing Mages I'm big on magnesium right great for bow function great for I mean I don't know the last time I had a cramp in my life you know it's been years since I've had a cramp despite exercising in a really hot place like Austin Texas where I'm sweating like there's no tomorrow um whether you call it a supplement or not I take uh I I take um uh like electrolytes I take a element um which I should disclose I'm an investor in that company um so I I drink an element a day I take creatine monohydrate five grams a day I take AG most mornings oh and I take pendulum the probiotic got it y as far as I know there's no other probiotic that has any meaningful effect on the body outside of pendulum right pendulum is the because CU if you buy the argument that a probiotic for your gut needs to have Anor robic bacteria in it there's no value in giving you aerobic bacteria so you have to have something anerobic so acrania which works through the um glp1 butyrate pathway is anerobic and pendulum is the only company that can make it I have no affiliation with this company I think you should have the CEO Colleen cutcliffe on your show um she's an actual scientist and she's fantastic and um um it's a really interesting story how they kind of developed this and how difficult it is to actually make an aerobic bacteria and so this is kind of an odd company because it's a supplement company but they have to basically adhere to Pharma GMP conditions to make it because of the anerobic Vats that you have to use infused with nitrogen to be able to make an Anor robic bacteria so anyway so I take three of their products I take something called glucose control I take polyphenol and I take acromania okay I think that's the list okay yeah I'll try and move through my list pretty quickly I may miss one or two things and I don't know maybe we'll put the list someplace online and fill in any gaps I definitely take AG ag1 you know I've my typical ad read I've been doing it since 2012 that's true uh take one or two servings a day three of I'm traveling and I'll generally do that first thing in the morning or in the evening um for me it's really about capping off the vitamin minerals that I might be lack lacking in my diet and also the whole adaptogen business I think and polyphenols and I'm a very interested in pendulum because part of the reason I take ag1 is for the gut health aspect I think just bowel movements are more where I'd want them I mean it sounds kind of uh weird to talk about but you just feel better when your gut motility is right I feel like it adjusts my gut motility so it's neither too fast nor too slow so that's first and foremost I take a quality fish oil either the one that AG makes or Carlson's in liquid form mhm that has that lemon flavoring and I make sure I get above one gram per day of EPA yep so that's usually a tablespoon sometimes two tablespoons I make sure that I get enough D3 typically from The Dropper 5,000 IU per day approxim sometimes 3,000 sometimes 7,000 I kind of play around that and I test my blood levels I also take methyl B12 and I also take Tonga Ali so I take one capsule of that in the early part of the day that has lowered my sex hormone binding globulin freeing up a bit more testosterone it's why I like it um and I take a couple of green tea capsules in the morning I drink yamate that's more of a stimulatory effect and I take the NM in powder form sometimes NR as well and again if I run out of that I tend to go long periods of time without I use element MH as an electrolyte so people are probably noticing this is all pretty basic I take in my case 10 grams of creatine monohydrate per day I sometimes forget to take it that's why I take 10 grams I'll sometimes miss a day okay um and I certainly feel the effects of that in the gym because of the greater water volume in the muscles but there are a lot of data on creatine monohydrate for sake of either maintain paining or offsetting some of the cognitive dysfunction associated with sleep deprivation maybe aging altitude and some other things as well and then for a few months I was playing around with let's say um nicotine gums I stopped doing that um first of all I was dipping it and I ended up lifing for uh an entire episode of The Lex Freedman podcast and I only realized later so I stopped taking it also because it gave me a kind of a tick and off when I wasn't chewing it and then I felt like I needed to chew it and it's a little too stimulatory for me um before sleep I take magnesium 3 and8 I'm really bullish on magnesium as well appenine 50 milligrams which is essentially chamomile extract and theanine and occasionally I'll take 900 milligrams in netl also um or instead I kind of mix those up and around and then I use a quality way protein as a protein replacement that kind of thing and I've played around with various things like Sheila G and you know sometimes get the sense that it's having an effect but then I'll stop taking it for long periods of time um you know there are very few things that I've stayed with for long periods of time and I basically just described what those are you know if ever someone were to design a supplement that would provide more energy all day long that wasn't caffeine I'd probably look to that but I ingest caffeine in the form of yerbamate and coffee I've played around with caffeine tablets you know taking you know 50 milligrams of caffeine in tablet form I mentioned that only because it has a distinctly different feel than ingesting caffeine through liquid form it feels stronger and I don't know why that is in fact I there's a very well-known podcaster who drinks peppermint tea and takes caffeine tablets as a way to uh I don't know drink peppermint tea which sounds very nice and mellow but also get the stimulant effect so anyway that's pretty much and then I do a lot of things as I know you do mainly based on suggestions you've made about getting zone two cardio rucking weight vest walks and Hikes three times a week resistance training three times a week cardiovascular training one long one medium one short and I try to hit the sauna and the cold once a week and um yeah that's pretty much it um I think there are a bunch of other supplements that are really interesting and kind of fun to play with if one wants to like 600 million Mig of alpha GPC or 900 milligrams of alpha GPC in a Double Espresso prior to a workout you feel different it's a stimulant but I don't like to do that too often because of the increase in tmao that occurs and then you have to take 600 milligrams of garlic to offset that increase and you start getting if we believe tmao matters right if you believe tmao matters and um okay great even better I'll maybe skip the garlic so things like that I prefer to just eat garlic anyway um so there are a bunch of things like that that are kind of fun to play with as pre-workouts but yeah that's the core um supplement regimen and it's the one I've stuck with for gosh at least 10 years or in the case of AG near more than you know more than that so I should say because any discussion around supplements I think it's going to you know have people pricking up their ears to okay this is like a sales pitch or something I absolutely want to go on record the things you choose to do and not do are going to have much greater effect on your healthspan and lifespan that is the behavioral things in particular sleep exercise nutrition sunlight Etc than any One supplement that you're going to take so I do view supplements I think through the appropriate lens which is that they are indeed a supplement they are not necessary many of them are simply sufficient to serve as an insurance policy or to augment mental and physical health maybe longevity uh in ways that make it worthwhile given my disposable income that I want to devote to supplements but I don't think you need them yeah I'll go even more extreme on that statement everything we have talked about on this podcast today whether it be NR NAD nmn thumin magnesium this supplement that supplement all of that stuff while potentially mattering I would put in the category of was the Titanic serving LOB Lobster or steak look I I like steak more than Lobster that's a relative discuss exercise sleep nutrition emotional health is the question of what was the heading of the Titanic okay so I just want people to understand the magnitude of what we're talking about how you eat how you sleep how you train and how you take care of your mental health is the equivalent of what Direction was the Titanic going with respect to the iceberg all this supplement that we just talked about is equivalent to were they serving Lobster or were they serving steak and was the band playing this song or that song I'm not saying those things don't matter but just put them in the context of the direction the Titanic is going okay so I completely agree with you exercise sleep nutrition and emotional health not listed in any particular order Peter and I both completely agree those are the critical four before we close nrnm NAD and NAD in particular how do we view this is it a pathway that we should be focusing on in terms of supplementation or infusions for sake of extending our life my answer on that is no yeah I would say the same you know I I don't remember who said this but someone maybe it was Nim TB said don't tell me what you think show me what's in your portfolio like meaning people who pontificate about this stock versus that stock he's kind of like assuming it was him that said this he's like okay I I don't care what you're telling me tell me what you own that's going to show me your conviction so through that lens look I'll show you my conviction on exercise I'll show you what I do I'll show you my conviction on sleep this is what I do I'll show you my conviction on all these other things I mean I don't take these supplements full stop I don't take them because I can't afford it's not that I can't afford them it's not that there're any inconvenience to me to take them I passionately do not believe they do anything for me and why would I waste time money anything on something that I really don't believe makes a difference now again I am always happy to be proven wrong and I am very happy to say that two years from now five years from now we could be doing this exercise again and in the presence of new information maybe I'm not taking rap ay and maybe I am fist fulling you know NR and nmn possible I will I will reserve the right to change my my mind for the rest of my life in the presence of new data but as it stands today I do not take these supplements and I have no foreseeable plan to do so until information changes great thank you for that clear stance and the willingness to change it in light of new data Peter so good to sit down with you again and talk science talk health and in this case talk about the supplements that we're not going to take in addition to the ones that we do take we will do this again sometime very soon hopefully in Austin would love that thanks Peter thanks man thank you for

Title: Dr. Stacy Sims: Female-Specific Exercise & Nutrition for Health, Performance & Longevity
Published: 2024-07-22 12:00:53 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. Stacy Sims, Ph.D., an exercise physiologist, nutrition scientist, and expert in female-specific nutrition and training for health, performance, and longevity. We discuss which exercise and nutrition protocols are ideal for women based on their age and particular goals.

We discuss whether women should train fasted, when and what to eat pre- and post-training, and how the menstrual cycle impacts training and nutrition needs. We also explain how to use a combination of resistance, high-intensity, and sprint interval training to effectively improve body composition, hormones, and cardiometabolic health, offset cognitive decline, and promote longevity. 

We also discuss supplements and caffeine, the unique sleep needs of women based on age, whether women should use deliberate cold exposure, and how saunas can improve symptoms of hot flashes and benefit athletic performance. Dr. Sims challenges common misconceptions about women’s health and fitness and explains why certain types of cardio, caloric restriction, and low-protein diets can be harmful to women’s metabolic health.

Listeners will learn a wealth of actionable information on how to improve their training and nutrition to enhance their health and how to age with greater ability, mobility, and vitality.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Stacy Sims Dr Stacy Sims is an exercise physiologist and a nutrition scientist and a world expert in all things training and nutrition specifically for women in addition to working at Stanford and with numerous professional a letic teams Dr Sims has authored more than 100 peer-reviewed studies on exercise physiology she has not only evaluated existing protocols for nutrition and fitness that are specific to women versus men but she has also developed many new protocols that are now in practice with professional sports teams but that can also serve people who are generally interested in Fitness and Longevity and in doing so the general public the tools that Dr Sims shares with us today are applicable to Fitness to to changing your body composition and to overall health today we discuss how hormones and hormone Cycles impact nutrition and fitness needs specifically in women of different ages we of course discuss the menstrual cycle perimenopause and menopause but also female specific nutrition and training as it relates to things independent of hormones for instance we evaluate the evidence that women may not want to train fasted and the reasons for that we talk about how training might vary according to different phases of the menstrual cycle and we discuss how women can design nutrition and training programs that are optimized for their specific needs not just because they are women but because they are women of a particular stage of life and women with particular goals as you'll soon see Dr Sims is exquisitly skilled at explaining the human universals of nutrition and training that is the things that do not differ between men and women and their needs in terms of nutrition and training but she is also exquisitly skilled at highlighting the data showing that there are specific areas of nutrition and fitness for which women and men differ and women have specific needs so today you will learn what those are and you will learn how to apply those specific protocols such that by the end of today's episode You Will Be armed with a tremendous amount of new knowledge about the biological mechanisms and the specific dos and do Nots that can guide you towards your female specific health and fitness goals before you begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Maui Nei venison Maui Nei venison is the most nutrient dense and delicious red meat available I've spoken many times before on this and other podcast and with several expert guests on this podcast about the fact that most of us should be seeking to get about one gram of highquality protein per pound of body weight every day not only does that protein provide critical building blocks for things like muscle repair and synthesis but also for overall metabolism and health Maui Nei venison has an extremely high quality protein per calorie ratio so that you can get that one gram of protein per pound of body weight easily and without ingesting in excess of calories also mauii venison is absolutely delicious I love their venison steaks their ground venison I love their bone broth and I love their jerky which is extremely convenient when you're traveling those mauii venison turkey sticks have 10 g of highquality protein per stick at just 55 calories while Maui Nei offers the highest quality meat available their supplies are limited responsible management of the access deer population on the island of Maui means that they will not go beyond Harvest capacity so signing up for a membership is the best way to ensure access to their highquality meat if you'd like to try Maui Nei venison you can go to Maui NE venison docomond to get 20% off your membership or first order again that's m new venison docomo today's episode is also brought To Us by eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity now I've spoken many times before in this podcast about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts of quality sleep each night one of the best ways to ensure a great night's sleep is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1 to 3° and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3° eight sleep makes it incredibly easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment by allowing you to program the temperature of your mattress cover at the beginning middle and end of the night I've been sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover for well over 3 years now and it has completely transformed my sleep for the better eight sleep recently launched their newest generation pod cover the Pod 4 ultra the Pod 4 ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity higher fidelity sleep tracking technology and it also has snoring detection that remarkably will automatically lift your head a few degrees to improve your air flow and stop your snoring if you'd like to try an eights Sleep mattress cover you can go to 8sleep.com huberman to save $350 off their pod 4 ultra eight sleep currently ships to the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's eights sleep.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by waking up waking up is meditation app that offers hundreds of guided meditation programs mindfulness trainings yoga NRA sessions and more I started practicing meditation when I was about 15 years old and it made a profound impact on my life and by now there are thousands of quality peer-reviewed studies that emphasize how useful mindfulness meditation can be for improving our Focus managing stress and anxiety improving our mood and much more in recent years I started using the waking up app for my meditations because I find it to be a terrific resource for allowing me to to really be consistent with my meditation practice many people start a meditation practice and experience some benefits but many people also have challenges keeping up with that practice what I and so many other people love about the waking up app is that it has a lot of different meditations to choose from and those meditations are of different durations so it makes it very easy to keep up with your meditation practice both from the perspective of novelty you never get tired of those meditations there's always something new to explore and to learn about yourself and about the effectiveness of meditation and you can always fit meditation into your schedule even if you only have two or three minutes per day in which to meditate I also really like doing Yoga Nidra or what is sometimes called non-sleep deep rest for about 10 or 20 minutes because it is a great way to restore mental and physical Vigor without the tiredness that some people experience when they wake up from a conventional nap if you'd like to try the waking up app please go to waking up.com huberman where you can access a free 30-day trial again that's waking up.com huberman to access a free 30-day trial and now for my discussion with Dr Stacy Sims Dr Stacy Sims welcome thanks our podcast and I put out a lot of content about Nutrition Fitness cold exposure heat exposure hydration topics that are very near and dear to your heart and for which you have a ton of expertise but for which you have an extra degree of expertise as it relates to females specific yeah so I'm excited to talk to you today because very often I will get questions in the comment section on social media or on YouTube was this study done in both men and women how does it differ for men versus women and on and on and I rarely if ever have answers but you have answers I have answers for you great so just to kick things off because this is a question I get really often fasting oh yeah inter mittent fasting y we need to distinguish between the two of course perhaps the most common question I get as it relates to males versus females is is intermittent fasting or time-restricted feeding as it's sometimes called an 8 Hour feeding window a six-hour feeding window a 10-hour feeding window is that something that perhaps differs in terms of its impact and how well it works for men versus women yeah that's a short answer great yeah yeah um so I'll put some parameters around it right so if we talk about intermittent fasting that's where you have like the 20-hour non-feeding window or you're holding a fast until noon or after um and then we have time-restricted eating and that's the fancy way of saying normal eating where you're having breakfast and then you stop eating after or you don't have anything after dinner right so you're eating with your circadian rhythm during the day if we look at intermittent fasting where you're holding the fast up till noon or you're having days of really low calorie restriction we see in active women it's very detrimental unless you have PCOS or you have some other subclinical issue and the reason for that is we as women have more oxida fibers so we hear about all the things about fasting to be to improve our metabolic flexibility to improve telal length to improve parasympathetic activation but by the nature of women having more oxidated fibers we are already metabolically more flexible than men interesting yeah didn't know that um could you elaborate on more oxidative fibers what that is and how how it relates to metabolic flexibility sure sure so oxidated fibers are are muscle fibers that are more aerobic capacity so those are the ones that you you can go long and slow for a very long period of time because it uses a lot of free fatty acids you need a little bit of glucose in order to activate those free fatty acids so we look when a woman starts to exercise she goes through blood glucose first and then gets into free fatty acid use she doesn't tap so much into liver muscle glycogen which is I think another misconception that happens so when we're talking about fasting or fasted workouts trying to improve that metabolic flexibility it increases stress on the woman and so when we're talking about overall stress we're talking about cortisol increase and they can't hit intens high enough with no fuel to be able to invoke the post exercise responses of growth hormone and testosterone which then drop cortisol so from an overall stress perspective that fast did work out and holding that fast for a long period of time increases cortisol but then when we look from like a hypothalamic point of view and we're looking at how the brain reads it we know that there's one area of kisspeptin neurons in the brain for men but there are two for women so the two areas are distinct where One controls appetite and luteinizing hormone and the other one is looking at estrogen and thyroid so if you start having an exercise stress or a daily stress of getting up and going on with your day without fuel you perturb those kisspeptin neurons and downregulate them and so when you start downregulating them we see that after four days you have a a disregulation of thyroid we have a change in our luteinizing hormone pulse which is really important to maintain endocrine function and we'll hear this oh I've been fasting for so many years and it does great for me but the other side of the question is well how much better would you be if you were to actually pay attention to your circadian rhythm and fuel according to the stress at hand and knowing that you're going to Garner less stress that way and if we're really tying in nutrition according to that profile instead of following a fast we see better brain Improvement M ments as well we see more cognitive function we see less thyroid dysfunction and overall a woman does much better when we're not in that fasted State then when you look at population research that's coming out now they're showing in both men and women who hold their Fest till noon and then have an eating window from noon to maybe 6: p.m. have more obesogenic outcomes than people who break their fast at 8 and finished their eating window by 4:00 or 5:00 p.m. so it's coming back to the chronobiology of we need to eat when our body is under stress and needs it unless we have a specific issue like obesity inactivity PCOS or other metabolic conditions then we can look at using fasting as a strategic intervention to help with those modalities super interesting two questions is there a protective effect of starting the eating window and here I'm asking for both men and women starting the eating window at say 11:00 a.m. or noon and ending it a little bit later so not a 6our eating window or 7h hour eating window but extending that to 8 or 900 p.m. under those conditions do you still see the obesogenic effect yes because we're looking at the way cortisol responds we know cortisol has lots of fluctuations throughout the day and it Peaks about half an hour after you wake up right so if you're having that quol Peak half an hour after you wake up but you're not eating then that is that higher Baseline sympathetic drive for women for men it's not the same so when we're looking at that obesogenic outcome the actual timing hasn't been tested yet to see how can we ex expand or contract that eating window for men but for women because of that cortisol Peak that right after waking up women tend to be already sympathetically driven so then they walk around more tired but wired and have a really really difficult time ACC accessing any kind of parasympathetic responses down the way where if you have something really small where you're bringing blood sugar up then it's signaling to the hypothalamus hey yeah there's some nutrition on board then we can start our day so again it has to look at that circadian rhythm and those hormone fluxes which people don't really either understand or talk about because all of our hormones flux through the day and so you have to look at where's the peak of cortisol how does estrogen flux how does lutenizing hormone flux progesterone all these things that have this tight interplay and the more we're doing the hormone research and the more we're understanding these perturbations and how important it is to fuel for it to stay out of any kind of low energy availability stance regular listeners of this podcast will know this but just to remind everybody a sympathetic state has nothing to do with emotional sympathy it's the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system which drives more arousal and alertness and at higher levels stress sometimes called the fight ORF flight response parasympathetic being the other arm of the autonomic nervous system sometimes called the rest and digest arm of the autonomic nervous system they work sort of like a seesaw or a push pull pick your analogy in any case it sounds like intermittent fasting or time-restricted feeding unless it's very well aligned to the Circadian rhythm is not going to be advantageous for women that's what I'm hearing I'm also hearing that if a woman trains while fasted so in the non-feeding window so wakes up maybe has some uh hydration and trains that's going to further exacerbate the stress response in a way that's not going to be good exactly and I have to imagine that if she also is drinking caffeine in order to do that training because caffeine is a stimulant of the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system that it will further exacerbate all these issues so this is a opener for me because I've had female training partners for years I don't eat until 11:00 a.m. I like to hydrate and cinate before I train in the morning and then I like to eat starting around noon several of them have hopped on that schedule with me some of them eat breakfast first some of them don't they do as they choose of course but now I'm thinking that's probably the worst way to go and it gets worse as you get older because if we're seeing as women are getting into par menopause which is in their 40s and we have more fluctuation of those hormones and an increase in Baseline cortisol anyway then when you look at fasted training it increases that cortisol drive and that sympathetic drive and because it's a point where you really need to polarize your training to get any kind of body composition change not having any fuel before a high-intensity workout puts them in moderate intensity they just can't hit the intensities they need to same with resistance training like you go in and a lot of women are now working on sessional rpe or rating perceived exertion where you go in and say okay we need you to hit an eight on this squat so you have two reps in reserve and a sessional RP of an eight well if they're not fueled then we are seeing trends that they're missing around two to 5% of that top load so they're not really lifting in that zone that they need to be in let's get um people sorry to interrupt let's get people up to speed on rpe because this is a term that's starting to um circulate more outside the physical um training community and to the broader kind of you know recreational exerciser Community which I consider myself part of UMO I mean I train regularly and half for years but I'm not an I'm not an athlete I don't get paid to train and I you know and so forth so rep repsen Reserve perceived effort maybe just um explain this I think probably 95% of our listenership has never heard these terms okay so if we're talking about about reps in reserve this is when you go in and if you say eight it means you have two reps in reserve so you finish your eight and you should be able to complete two more with a really good form and then you hit failure so eight repetitions in good form and the person doing the exercise could in theory if they really dug in there grit their teeth could complete two more repetitions in good form before hitting failure the inab to move the weight anymore in good form exactly okay but they're stopping at eight so they have two reps in reserve exactly and so we can correspond that with your rating perceived exertion so if we're saying we need you to hit an eight on our scale of 1 to 10 of rating perceived exertion we see it correlates with um that eight with two reps in reserve so it's a way of quantifying what you're doing in the moment for a squat or a deadlift or some other really heavy lift that you're trying to accomplish as opposed to looking at um say percentage of one repetition maximum yeah saying you're going to move 70% of your one repetition maximum for six repetitions seems like that's a great thing as well but it's a little bit more complicated because you need to know your one repetition maximum doing one repetition maximums can be dangerous if you're not skilled in that especially with compound movements like squats and deadlifts okay so is there an across theboard recommendation for most people that they should generally train their sets in good form to failure to leave a couple reps in reserve what do you suggest for let's say women but this could also pertain to men uh and then that also depends on the age of the woman so if we're looking at the reproductive year so you know 20 to 40 then it doesn't matter so much you can periodize pretty much how normal periodization works with your mesocycles and your micro Cycles so you're looking at what you're doing across the few months what are you doing in the week are you lifting heavy power Based training but when we start to get to per menopause and we're losing all the flux of estrogen and estrogen is woman's testosterone the key driver for strength and power we have to look at lifting heavy so this is where we really turn women on to we want you to do something that is two reps in reserve three reps in reserve because your one rep max also changes depending on what kind of training block you're doing so you're finding that when you're talking about reps in reserve then it allows people to lift more on the day so we can get women to get into that strength and power-based type training rather than going let's lift to fatigue because then it might be 20 reps and that 20 reps doesn't invoke a big central nervous system response which is what we want it's more of that hypertrophy and muscle tearing you will gain some lean mass but not as much strength as if you were to invoke That central nervous system response and that becomes really critical as women get older because we need to def find that external response that's going to cause the same kind of strength and power adaptation that estrogen used to support interesting lots to talk about in terms of exercise but before we move on if the bad situation is a woman fasting drinking caffeine and training intensely but as you told us not as intensely as she would be able to otherwise what's the solution I imagine that solution involves ingesting some fuel MH what is a good example of a you know a pre-training um meal if you will and we could put some variation on that for people with different you know Tendencies towards omnivore or vegan or whatever uh but what is the timing of that meal relative to training that works best or and and I'm assuming there's some flexibility there yeah I mean like I'm the kind of person that gets up and is out the door within a half an hour to go do whatever I'm going to do so it's not like I'm going to have a full meal I've heard of people like you yeah mean meaning I tend to move slowly in the morning so I wish I could but the way my life is it doesn't work that way um so but I'm also one of the people that never really has an appetite till 11 o'clock okay so we're similar in that way yeah so how do you how do you square that so I make a double espresso at night and I put some almond milk and a scoop of protein powder in there so the almond milk is sweetened and usually it's unsweetened but sweetened for the carb and then the protein powder for the protein because because if I'm going to go do an ocean swim then I need some carbohydrate and protein on board if I'm going to just go to the gym then I'll probably just have the protein powder in the coffee yes I'm caffeinating but I'm also getting the calories for the hypothalamus and getting more circulating amino acids Abby Smith Ryan out of UNCC did some specific work looking at carbohydrate protein before and you know strength or cardio and found that if you're going to do a true strength training session you only need around 15 grams of protein before before you go to really help you get into the idea that yes you have some fuel on board and also increases your post exercise oxygen consumption or your Epoch so your resting metabolism stays elevated um giving you a better chance for Recovery post exercise as well if you're going to do any kind of cardiovascular type work up to an hour then you're adding 30 grams of carp to that so it's not a lot of food and it's not a full meal um other people are like I'm starving right before I go training then yes you can have your meal giving yourself about a half an hour before um but it doesn't have to be major food that we're talking about um but that's just enough to bring blood sugar up and and stimulate the hypothalamus to say yeah there's some nutrition coming in and then you have your real food afterwards you have your breakfast afterwards within 45 minutes as a neuroscientist I find it so interesting that at least some of what you're talking about with this pre-workout meal and perhaps most of it relates to how ingesting those calories impacts the brain protects those kisspeptin neurons we'll talk more about kisspeptin very interesting peptide as opposed to saying okay you need X number of calories because you're going to burn X number of calories I hate that conversation right which is a very different conversation um here what we're talking about is the neural aspects of being able to generate intensity also blunt cortisol and get the most out of training without putting the body into kind of a an Emergency State yeah yeah and the longer someone withholds food after exercise and the greater they stay in that catabolic or breakdown State the more the brain perceives it as being in a low energy state so the first thing to go is lean mass when you start telling a woman that you know if you're going to do fasted training and and or you're going to delay food intake afterwards while you're training because the first thing that goes is lean mass and it's really really hard for women to put on lean m M so once you start really nailing that and then saying look you just need 15 gram of protein to really help and be able to conserve that lean mess it's a small simple fix people try it and they're like oh my gosh I feel amazing so it's small little things when you're working with the whole system because I get tired especially around Christmas time when you're reading all the magazines it's like two cookies means you have to walk for 30 minutes on the treadmill it's like it doesn't it doesn't correlate like that at all um so that's why I was like like I hate the calorie conversation because it's just not applicable right and it has its own kind of um elements of being laced with neuroticism about calorie counting and then that can drift easily into the realm of Eating Disorders I did an episode about eating disorders some years ago and as I was researching that episode um I learned that people with eating disorders women and men um especially anorexia become like calorie calculators their eyes in their brain just are constantly evaluating the caloric load of food and it can be um obviously very intrusive it's also the most deadly of all the psychiatric conditions so it's um that's a long way from hopefully what we're talking about here but but there's the opportunity for drift whenever we talking about calorie counting in and out we of course believe in the laws of thermodynamics and calories in calories out but I love what you're describing here as getting the brain in a mode that the brain and body are protected so that one can invest in that high-intensity exercise and get the adaptations that one wants but not send everything down this pathway of um kind just becoming a computer of you know how much am I exercising what did I burn what did I earn it's it's crazy it's crazy um as long as we're talking about food and food intake relative to training what is the suggested posttraining um window um in which one should either avoid or make sure they get nutrition um meaning how long does one have after let's say a resistance training session of about an hour seems to me that's what most people are doing if they're investing in resistance training maybe plus or minus a what 20 minutes yeah um and they're hitting those um high-intensity sets where they have maybe just one or two repetitions in reserve maybe going to failure on a few of those SES what do you recommend women eat after they train so we know that women who are in their reproductive years need around 35 grams of good protein highquality Lucine oriented protein within 45 minutes and we see that women who are per menopausal onwards are 40 to 60 grams because we become more anabolically resistant to food and exercise as we get older um when we look at like the recovery window for food there are definitely sex differences because we hear all the conversation of there's no recovery window it's you know it's old science but we look at the research of when women's metabolisms come back down to Baseline meaning that they have constant straight blood sugar levels versus men women it's within UH 60 minutes and for men it's up to 3 hours so when we're looking at the data that says there's no window per se for getting food in it's based on male data so when we're looking at women women we have this tighter window to stop that breakdown effect and start the reparation um so yeah it's like when we're talking about the protein intake it's really important not only to get that Lucine content up in the muscle to start the reparation and repair but also again to signal that yeah we're in a building State we're not holding that catabolic State and increasing all the repercussions that come with it so women should try and get 30 or as M much as 40 maybe 50 grams of protein depending on their age m post training within an hour of training yep men seem to have a longer window they could wait an hour two hours maybe even three hours yeah before ingesting protein what about carbohydrate we look at mixed but for men it's more important because they go through their liver and muscle glycogen so much faster than women so when we look at women we want to get around3 grams per kilo um of carbohydrate within 2 hours of finishing so we look at prot and people like well that's a big dose of protein how do I get it all in it's like yeah well you can look at how we mix all of these things you're also getting carbohydrate in with that so that's why I say you could have your next meal after your training session um yeah there's a time and a place for protein supplementation but if you're getting that real food in then you're also getting you know your magnesium and your potassium and your sodium and all the things that people supposedly lose and you're able to also repair a lot better as many of you know I've been taking ag1 for more than 10 years now so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast to be clear I don't take ag1 because they're a sponsor rather they are a sponsor because I take ag1 in fact I take ag1 once and often twice every single day and I've done that since starting way back in 2012 there is so much conflicting information out there nowadays about what proper nutrition is but here's what there seems to be a general consensus on whether you're an omnivore a carnivore or a vegetarian or a vegan I think it's generally agreed that you should get most of your food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources which allows you to eat enough but not overeat get plenty of vitamins and minerals probiotics and micronutrients that we all need for physical and mental health now I personally am an omnivore and I strive to get most of my food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources but the reason I still take ag1 once and often twice every day is that it ensures I get all of those vitamins minerals probiotics Etc but it also has adaptogens to help me cope with stress it's basically a nutritional insurance policy meant to augment not replace quality food so by drinking a serving of ag1 in the morning and again in the afternoon or evening I cover all of my foundational nutritional needs and I like so many other people that take ag1 report feeling much better in a number of important ways such as energy levels digestion sleep and more so while many supplements out there are really directed towards obtaining one specific outcome ag1 is found ational nutrition designed to support all aspects of well-being related to mental health and physical health if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs with your order plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com huberman at some point there was a lot of discussion about training fasted burns more body fat uh I think now most people accept that that's not the case that perhaps the percentage of fat as fuel is increased when one trains fasted but that overall in terms of loss of body fat it doesn't matter if you train fasted or you train fed correct okay I think um that can't be stated Enough by experts like you um that doesn't mean that if one prefers to train fasted or with a minimum of food in their gut that they can't do that I like to train fasted but I what I'm hearing is that women should probably ingest at least some protein high quality protein and maybe drink the protein in a protein shake yeah um form if they don't want to ingest solid food yeah I think the easiest way for people to understand the basic idea of what low energy is and how this affects men and women is when we're looking at um a Tipping Point for endocrine dysfunction for men we're seeing that Tipping Point at 15 calories per kilogram of fat-free mass for women it's 30 so when we're looking at Baseline calorie needs before you really get into that endocrine dysfunction when you're looking at those parameters you can see why men do better in a fasted state or a low calorie state but for women our intake and especially our carbohydrate needs are so much higher because we have so many other functions that are reliant on that kisspeptin up regulation or down regulation preferably up regulation um so when we're just talking the basic calorie needs and what we're seeing it's that dichotomy right there of 15 to 30 and when you start telling people that they're like oh okay I get it is that a biological aspect it's like well you could trace it all the way back where you know men went out to get the calories in most tribes and the women were home and it wasn't advantageous to be pregnant under low calorie intake that's why you have dysfunction when the calories are too low but you know you can also feed forward to modern day now and you're seeing that all this perturbance of hormone and the way we regulate hormone across the Circadian rhythm requires more calories for women than it does for men I know some men that basically don't eat all day and then eat one meal in the evening and they'll train in the morning that's inconceivable to me because within an hour or so of training I'm hungry uh which brings to mind what we mean when we say training uh I'm a big believer in people everybody getting ideally two or three resistance training sessions in per week and two maybe three cardiovascular training sessions per week that would be ideal yep um one could potentially do more probably not a whole lot less before you run into long-term health issues that you could offset but I think most people can fit those in and I'm very frankly delighted that nowadays there's such a push for women and men to resistance train that wasn't the case when I was growing up for you know I recall taking my sister to the gym for the first time and was like I think she was the only woman in the gym when we were in high school yeah except for a few female bodybuilders and she said well I don't want to look like that and I said well don't worry you're not going to look like that um but now you go to a gym and women are lifting weights men are lifting weights it's great it's terrific I've seen the evolution right when I was 16 one of my friends Brothers was a bodybuilder and he took us to the gym of like what you did with your sister and so both of us were like well we want to beat those guys so we got into weight training with them not to be bodybuilder but it's been like the Paramount throughout all of my athletic career used to be I'd be the only woman on the lifting platform and now it's like you have to wait because there's so many women on the lifting platforms I love it it's great yeah it's awesome as I mentioned before I've had female training partners and they they kill it yeah they um it's a lot of fun to have a um female training partner also because um not only is it cool to see the progress they can make really quickly which surprises them often you know I think a lot of women think that okay it's going to require external androgens or it's going you know and and what you pointed out that there are some barriers to women putting on mass quickly I think I've noticed that strength increases can come really quickly why is that it's a central nervous system aspect there's a lot of like if we look at the culture of how a lot of us grew up and I'm saying us like 45 plus right the women were all the 90s supermodels don't show muscle that kind of stuff so always been gravitated to cardio even now if you go to a gym and you're a new member you're signing up for a new member and you're a woman they'll say hey great here's all of our spin classes and our box fit classes they still doing that yeah and there's a cardiovascular machines a guy comes in like all right how much do you want to put on here are the lifting platforms all the you know the weight trainings at the back starting to see a shift with Boutique type gems but that's still the commonality there so it's still that little bit of taboo so when women start strength training they haven't been exposed to that kind of central nervous system stress before and the whole aspect of getting the nerve and the acetylcholine which are are little vesicles that you know hold the ability for the nerve to actually stimulate the muscle fiber all that gets trained really quickly so the more that you train it and the more muscle fibers that are recruited for contraction you see an increase in strength really rapidly and slowly building on that for increased muscle bulk because it takes a long time for women to put bulk on uh because the driver for strength training is that Central Nervous System um so it's great when we see higher doses more volume we aren't seeing huge hypertrophy we're just seeing really good increases in strength whenever somebody male or female is concerned about growing too big too fast um I always remind them that resistance training is unique among different types of exercise in that because of the blood flow to the muscle during the exercise session the soc called pump yeah you get a window a transient window but a window nonetheless of what the hyper could look like if you do everything else correctly in terms of recovery so provided that the um the size of the muscle during the training session is not aversive to you yeah you're okay you're good yeah um which is unique among you know training it's not like when you go running you get a sense of being much faster you actually get the opposite effect you you feel the burn in your lungs and and the pain of of hitting the wall of your limits and then hopefully if the adaptation takes place then you can push past that next time but with resistance train you get a liter Lally a physical picture and a and a sematic feeling for what that hypertrophy could look like yeah that's why on your physique competitions and bodybuilding competitions they're out the back pumping before they go on stage so we've been talking about training but we haven't really spelled out what you would suggest a novice perhaps an intermediate um resistance training cardiovascular training um program would look like in in Broad terms I realize we don't have time here to get into all the DET you WR this elere and refer people to those teric resources and the show note captions but um what would you like to see women doing and maybe we can break up the the age brackets because it sounds like this is something that um is resurfacing again and again here um women let's say 30 and younger women 31 to let's say 40 and then let's say 41 to 60 and then maybe 61 and on in terms of how many sessions of resistance training per week is it whole body training how many sessions of cardiovascular training and what sorts of examples could could you give yeah so if we're looking at that 20 20 to 30 year old a lot of times I really try to get them to focus on the whole movement aspect first so we phase them in same with older women phase them in learn how to move learn complex movements so that when you are going in to do resistance training preferably three to four times a week you can look at moving well and it doesn't have to be a long period of time if you're doing to failure which works really well when you're younger to increase strength and a little bit of hypertrophy you're going to have to spend a little bit more time in the gym so it might be 45 to 60 minutes when we're looking at doing that four times a week you can add in a Sprint interval training at the end of one of those to get that super high intensity or you can look at putting in at the most two hit sessions from on separate days if you're training specifically for something so if I work with a lot of endurance athletes still and they're like well how do I fit it in it's like okay well we look at the Quality and how that fits into your training so if you're training for a marathon you're training for a triathlon or other endurance stuff you can take that high-intensity work and put it into your training program so ideally we look at three to four resistance training with really good movement when we're in the younger set with two high intensities when we start getting into our 30s we start having an eye to how are we actually doing that resistance training instead of just going and doing a circuit we're really focusing on let's do some compound movements let's look at doing some heavier work let's look at how we are periodizing so we're having you know six we blocks and we're building on those blocks because we want that base foundation so when we get to be 40 plus we can actually go and do our powerbase training if you're in your 40s you've never done resistance training at all then we take between two weeks to four months to really learn how to move well because there's a higher incidence of soft tissue injury and overall injury as we get into our 40s because of perturbations of estrogen and ideally when we get there we're looking at that around three minimum three resistance training with compound movement and either one Sprint interval or two Sprint intervals and one hit in a week and just to remind people compound movements multi-joint movements squats deadlifts uh chin-ups rows overhead presses bench presses Etc as opposed to isolation movements where only one joint is is moving yeah yeah and for everybody in all those age ranges that you describe are you suggesting they train the same muscle groups three or four times per week or do some sort of split where it's upper body lower body take a day off or upper body take a day off lower body take a day off whatever that what might work for them yeah what works for them if you're looking for short amount of time in the gym because of busy lives then you can split it if you're looking at okay well I can allocate an hour to an hour and a half in the gym then you can do total body with adequate rest um the key when you're younger is working to failure the key when you're older is working heavy interesting yeah so when we're looking at working to failure we're trying to get more of that lean mass growth with strength when we get older because it's so difficult to put on lean mass we really want to focus on the strength component because that becomes more important when we're talking about longevity because if you're looking at the strength component from a central nervous system standpoint we see it feeds forward into better appropri reception attenuation of cognitive decline and this is the other thing that you in Neuroscience would understand the sex differences in things like dementia and Alzheimer's there's some really interesting research looking at strength training and that power-based stuff when we're getting into our older ages because we get more neural growth patterns and more neural Pathways even some interesting literature about emphasizing some unilateral movements as people get older not just um dual limb movements or dual limb simultaneous movements you always want to train both sides of your body folks but um so if I understand correctly younger women should train to failure try and generate strength and hypertrophy as women get older they should emphasize more strength training leave some repetitions in reserve but train heavier yes it makes so much sense what you're saying yeah um because what we know about the nervous system as we age is that there's some atrophy or at least some weakening of neuromuscular connections and the upper motor neurons in the brain that control the neuromuscular Connections in the spinal cord out to the muscle yeah um there's something really sticky about this idea in terms of longevity that I don't think anyone else has ever said no the thing about it is men age more in a linear fashion whereas women we have a definitive point in our late 40s early 50s where all of a sudden things go to where it's that per menopausal State and I can't tell you how many emails and DMs I get in a day from women who are like I'm 46 or I'm 47 I'm putting on body fat I don't know what's going on I can't sleep and then when we say it's per menopause they like what is that and so when we're looking at per menopause it is a huge change in the body because you're having less and less of your sex hormone circulating more and more an ovulatory Cycles means no progesterone or very low progesterone you're having a difference in the pulse of your estrad to those Flatline aspect effects and because every system in the body is affected by it this is why you see more soft tissue injuries like two of the biggest things that women who are in their 40s are going to ptas about her frozen shoulder and pler fascia those are two really indicative issues that are happening in Parry menopause so that whole section of mid to mid 40s to early 50s is a definitive aging point where I really tried to get women to get into the heavy lifting and get into the patterns of polarizing their training not putting an emphasis on zone two just really looking at how am I polarizing how am I affecting my central nervous system so that when they get into that one point in time of that perimenopause their body is already conditioned for the stress that's coming whereas men we see that kind of stuff happens in their late 50s early 60s so the soft tissue injuries the change in body comp comes at a later time so yes looking at how we're scoping our strength training definitely something to think about in a longevity Factor but for women it's a there's a better indication of the timing across the ages of when you should start implementing for men I think you have a better bandwidth of when you should start implementing for women who are not on hormone replacement therapy and we did a previous episode about per menopause menopause and hormone replacement therapy but if it comes up again and again today that would be wonderful because these are important underd discussed topics absolutely for women that are not on hormone replacement therapy who decide to train heavier maybe do a bit more training volume not train to failure they're making sure to not let their cortisol Spike too much by making sure they have some pre-workout nutrition some post-workout nutrition would they be wise to be very careful in how much cardiovascular exercise they add to that meaning there seems to always be this risk of overtraining and as you pointed out for various reasons cultural reasons historical reasons um around exercise I my observation is that most women sort of unless they know better default to cardiovascular exercise as opposed to resistance training so if a woman in her 40s late 30s to let's say 50 is doing two to four sessions of resistance training workouts per week and they also really like cardio or they feel they want to or should do cardio should they be careful about how much cardio they're doing and is there a best form of cardio should they really emphasize the high-intensity interval training should they avoid zone two we should probably also Divine for people what zone two is if they if they don't already know um so I am notorious for slamming things like orange theory and f45 because they mark it specifically to that age group of women and it's not appropriate because it's not true high-intensity work when we're looking at women who are really trying to maximize body composition change and Longevity and unfortunately default to cardio because they think oh that's going to help change my body composition is going to help me lose body fat it doesn't is this things like Soul cycle as well okay I've never done any of these yeah um but I imagine there's a lot of spinning a lot of moving a lot of sweating and a lot of quote unquote calories burned emphasis yes there is but it's it puts women squarely in moderate intensity where they're so used to leaving one of those classes feeling absolutely smashed that when you tell them actually that training doesn't work for you because it's putting you in a state of intensity that drives cortisol up but it's not a strong enough stress to invoke the post exercise growth hormone and testosterone responses that we want to dampen that cortisol so this is why we have that hyperbole of women who are in their 40s plus shouldn't do high intensity work it's like well actually they shouldn't do moderate intensity they need to avoid that polarizing absolutely that's what we want we want true high-intensity work which is 1 to four minutes of 80% or more or if you're doing Sprint interval it's full gas for 30 seconds or less and you're doing that a couple of times a week you're not doing it every day because you need to have enough recovery to hit those intensities trly because those are the intensities that are going to give you those post exercise hormonal responses to drop cortisol when we're looking at women who are like oh well I love going out for hours and hours on my bike and I love you know doing my spin classes it's like okay but we need to look at the big rock here if you are looking for longevity and body composition change and cognition and all those things you have to polarize your training and that has to be the focus but soul food like I come from a long background of endurance I now love riding my gravel bike on the weekends for long periods of time which is not optimal for me my age that kind of stuff for all the things that I want to see improvements in but mentally it's great so we talk about going out for that long stuff zone two is at low conversation and that's fine for mental health and being out in nature but for Optimal Health and well-being we don't want to do that we want to look at resistance training as a bedrock and true high-intensity work to help with body composition change metabolic control insulin sensitivity brain health and dropping that cortisol I have family members who are women who are thin because they love to walk and they just walk a ton um and they eat well um and enough but they are resistant to resistance training and if they do pick up a weight it's usually some very light dumbbells do a few curls a couple tricep extensions and aren't really um leaning into the higher intensity work yeah I think this is pretty common and my observation is that it's common not because they couldn't be incentivized to do the higher intensity work but that learning the complex compound movement like how to squat properly or even leg press properly y um deadlift properly can be a bit overwhelming especially when one walks into a gym this is true for men too like all this stuff all this equipment all these bodies and these people look like they know what they're doing it's like if I were to go into an advanced like kitchen or or um Symphony and you know all these instruments I don't know how to play yeah so what's the best line of attack for somebody who really wants to overcome this uh longevity barrier because clearly resistance training proper nutrition work yeah and the cardiovascular exercise piece is a little bit more intuitive walking you do it faster you're jogging you do it faster you're running yeah yeah um the bike the soul cycle class Etc it's just it's easier in terms of the mechanics one can still get hurt but it's just more straightforward is there a way that in the absence of a budget for a personal trainer that somebody can learn how to do these movements and as you said ease into them over the course of even up to four months in a way that they can be confident that they're unlikely to get hurt yeah and really build up their capacity to do real work that can benefit them yeah this is where I love technology for one thing but if we're staying really basic I look at some of my family members and I've gotten them started with just body weight stuff or loading a backpack with cans to add a little bit of resistance so they feel comfortable in their own house and they might be doing lunges or squats um just keying them up of like where foot placement and knee and that kind of stuff so they're getting used to that kind of movement um I love Kelly starett's stuff with Mobility so show them like here's how we do some of the mobility to find where the sticking points are and then you can either direct them to some of the programs that are out there that um like Haley happens has some really good ones for women or 40 plus so does um uh Brie and then Sunny Webster down in Australia you can send in a video of what you're doing and he can critique you and tell you things to do there are other programs like that too um so there's lots of ways of getting help if you seek it the personal trainer is very much a stumbling block for a lot of people and as much as I am not a fan of Planet Fitness I am a fan of the fact that they've made it really easy for someone to walk in who's interested in resistance training and they can go to a circuit one of the circuit things that they have at the back and they can start resistance training on machines which is another level up to learning compound movements so there's lots of ways of breaking that barrier to entry you just have to find the motivation factor of what's going to incentivize the person to give up their time walking every day and taking time to go to the gym or taking time to do garage based stuff that's going to improve their lean mass I'm a big fan of machines especially plate loed machines but machines just create the close to correct or correct Arc of movement yeah that um so for your size yeah yeah yeah exactly and to really spend the time adjusting the seat height adjusting the various um pins on the machine not just the weight in order to make sure that one gets the best range of motion I think this is something small but that is significant in terms of its impact people just pop down in a machine especially if you're working in with somebody and feel um especially beginners will feel pressured to move quickly and they won't adjust the seat height and so it's just all wrong for them and all it takes is a little bit of time to you know and ask people you know how to adjust the machines I'm also a fan of kettle bells in in the garage or light lighter dumbbells that you can do like thrusters or hang cleans or something like that to get the the momentum and movement feeling um because that's another good learning curve for people um so like I said there's lots of ways that you can Implement Things based on someone's intuitive like or dislike of resistance training so you've mentioned polarized training if I understand correctly this would be a woman doing three or four days of high-intensity resistance training for 45 to 60 or 45 to 75 minutes per session and then at the opposite extreme maybe just walking a lot or jogging a lot so is that what you're talking about polarized training as opposed to um these other forms of training where it's designed to get people sweating like crazy breathing hard for long periods of time but neither putting them at the in the landscape of inducing muscle strength adaptations and hypertrophy adaptations nor really taxing the cardiovascular system enough to create you know an increase in longevity for instance when I talk about polarizing I look at the high-intensity strength like that's really hard on the central nervous system and then we look from a cardiovascular standpoint of doing true high-intensity work so the walking is more of the recovery so if you're going to go out and do something long it has to be very very easy if you are looking at cardiovascular and you want that big sweat then we are talking true Sprint interval training so what I have a lot of women do is a 20 minute lower body heavy set and then they'll go on the assault but and do as hard as they can for 30 seconds and then recover as much as they need to to go then do another 30 seconds as hard as they can most people go oh I can do four or five of those after two they're completely gassed because it's that hard of work and that's what I mean by polarizing you have very very low intensity for recovery and super super high intensity for metabolic and cardiovascular changes is what we're after I'd like to take a quick break to let you know that the huberman lab team has launched a new podcast with host Dr Andy Galpin Andy is an expert in exercise science and Human Performance and has Longman a fan favorite on the huberman Lab podcast this new podcast is called perform with Dr Andy Galpin and it dives into topics such as how to build muscle and strength how to improve your cardiovascular health and how to optimize recovery and sleep for performance and much more Andy is an absolutely fantastic educator and true expert on all things human performance I know you'll thoroughly enjoy his new podcast and learn a ton of useful Knowledge from it so please check it out and give it a subscribe wherever you're watching or listening to podcast now again the podcast is called perform with Dr Andy Galpin let's talk about the menstrual cycle yeah and how that impacts training at the level of Psychology and Physiology meaning Mo and of course the two are linked they're inextricably linked for instance is there a particular phase of the m cycle where a woman should expect that motivation Andor recovery would be more challenging so this is the sticky point of recent science because we see all these research studies and met analyses that are coming out of the sports science literature saying that there is no effect of the menstrual cycle on anything when you look at that population it is specifically you menic women might have an a subject pool of 10 if you're lucky 12 so this is women who have quote unquote normal menstrual cycles humanic supposedly ovulating so they have a definitive low hormone and high hormone phase and this is probably because these studies are being done on University campuses with with college undergraduate women yes exactly yeah which is a typically is in a given age range right okay and they look at performance meaning that one point in time and we know that psychologically you can perform at any point in the menstrual cycle unless you have something like heavy menstrual belief um when we're looking at a higher touch and looking not only from a molecular aspect but also pulling in mixed methods and looking at the qualitative we need women to track their own cycle and find their own patterns because we know that there are times where you feel like crap and you can't push intensity but that might be on day eight for one woman it might be day 18 for another from a molecular standpoint we know that theow hormone phase being day one is the first day of bleeding up through ovulation which is Midway through your cycle you have a greater capacity for pulling in and accommodating stress physical and mental stress so if we're looking at doing heavier loads we're looking at doing high intensity work we're looking at motivation then that low hormone phase is really optimal for trying to hit a PR trying to hit a new speed because you can take on that stress and you're immune system handles it your muscles handle it your core temperature everything handles it so for most women in the weeks before their period they're going to feel more robust except right up until the point of um of menstration or the inverse it is day one a bleeding up through midcycle that feel great yep the sticky Point comes not every woman ovulates and this is a thing when we're looking at will pop we have lifestyle stress we have nutrition stress we know that women for the most part have four to five an ovulatory Cycles a year so this is where when you're looking at that high hormone phase we can't say you're definitively in the high hormone phase so this is where we need women to track their own cycles and understand their own patterns because in an Ideal World we know that in the ludal phase this is where where we have the most change where we have a pro-inflammatory response from the immune system we have uh inability to access carbohydrate as well we have a higher sympathetic drive so there's lots of things in there that aren't so fantastic for accommodating stress so broadly speaking the ludal phase is associated with more cortisol more kind of Baseline levels of stress would it makes sense for a woman to try and offset some of that with a bit more nutrition during that phase a bit more perhaps complex carbohydrate we know that some complex carbohydrate can blunt some of the cortisol response maybe just even a little bit more attention to eating yeah absolutely I mean core temperature goes up but the whole goal of the ludal phase is to build tissue so this is where we're seeing a lot of shuttling of carbohydrate and amino acids to go to build that endometrial lining and that's the whole goal so yes you need to eat more protein you need to eat more carbohydrate but again the sticking point is did you ovulate or not so if you aren't aware of if you ovulate it or not you're tracking your own patterns then just be acutely aware that in about the week before your next period comes you really need to be amping up carbohydrate and protein um because that's going to help you hit intensities it's going to kind of level that playing field especially on days where you feel like you can really hit those intensities you feel great but then you go to do something and your heart rate's higher than it should be you don't feel that that you can hit those if you're offsetting it with some increased carbohydrate beforehand and you're going to hit it so it's again it's really dialing it back down to the individual now because we don't have enough robust research to make generalized ideas because of the Nuance of have you ovulated or not what are your ratios of estrogen progesterone in that ludal phase so when we bring it back down to the general pop it's like the best thing to do is to track your menstrual cycle over sleep over how you're feeling find your own pattern patterns and dial in your training in your days according to what your pattern is how hard should a woman push through the mental and maybe even physical resistance to train less or not train during a given phase of the cycle getting depends on how she feels what we can't rely on are things like heart rate variability because we know that changes with the autonomic nervous system change progesterone it's a good indication that you've ovulated because your heart rate variability tanks but it's not a good indication of what your body can do if you wake up I always say it's the 10-minute rule you wake up and you feel awful and you're like uh I really want to do this workout but I don't know how it's going to go give yourself 10 minutes if after 10 minutes you can't hit those intensities or you just feel horrible change it drop it down do something that's more recovery do something that's not going to be so taxing because we do have a limited amount of that stress Acumen of how much stress we can handle so if you're going to try to exert it all in a high intensity work out what do you have left over for the rest of the day and then that compounds because if you're always fighting it then you're going to increase this Baseline sympathetic drive because you're fighting the training you're fighting life so give yourself that 10-minute roll if it happens three days in a row that's okay because it's a very short period of time it's not going to last forever so a lot of women have this internal conversation of I have to do this and it's really based on some kind of external they think everyone's watching them but internally you don't have to if you give yourself permission you end up training better recovering better and getting better gains on the flip side if a woman is feeling spectacularly good should she just really push it as hard as she can or is there anything about the relationship between the hormone fluctuations of the menstrual cycle and feeling really really great that training hard can somehow disrupt the cycle and this is actually kind of the uh the old lore um probably myth I would imagine that high intensity resistance training is somehow detrimental to female hormone Cycles I don't think there's any evidence for that but I hear that from time to time um why do you think that myth came to be why do you think it propagates and what can we do to extinguish it if in fact it's not true it's not true we see it comes from a misstep and food intake and we also see that it's a cultural influence because if we think about how sport started it started as a way for men to demonstrate how powerful and aggressive they are and this is the original Olympics right there are no women allowed and as we feed forward into Sport and how it became okay for women to be involved at the high performance level if a woman walks in and shows any fallibility then she's immediately put on a lower stool right no you can't you can't play with the boys because you have a menstrual cycle you're bleeding you're a woman you're a delicate flower so women would walk into that professional sports space and be excited if they were a menic or didn't have periods or they trained hard enough and their period went away because then they were more like men and they could play with the boys if you start bringing up menstrual cycle in professional sport now as of the past about four or five years it's okay to talk about which is you know what 2020 so that myth of high-intensity resistance training causing issues with the menstrual cycle one it's a cultural Nuance for push back against women being in that space But then the reality is women weren't eating enough to accommodate for that stress which then feeds forward to low energy availability maybe relative energy deficiency in sport perturbations in all of our menstrual cycle hormones so it's not the act of the high-intensity resistance training it's the act of not fueling appropriately for it and then getting the okay to not have your period because yeah now you're you're in with you're training hard enough you've lost it you're more like a man wow um very interesting history there is it true then that if a woman maintains either um caloric balance with her basically eating enough to support her energy output or even a slight caloric Surplus that it's unlikely that um her periods will cease even if she's training very hard very often correct so it basically boils down to calories in calories out fuel for the task at hand because some people want to have a slight calorie deficit even in high training and if that deficit is at night away from training maybe 150 to 200 calories then it's going to help perpetuate body fat loss not lean mass loss and it's not going to interfere with recovery it's the fueling in around the stress meaning they exercise stress it's really important but women have been so conditioned to not eat and not take up SP space to be small you know all of these sociocultural things that women are afraid to admit the fact that they want to eat and they should be eating so this is a a a Nuance within the fitness community that we're really trying to change and get the mindset around you train hard you eat well and your body responds in kind app tight body temperature and hormones are very tightly linked yes they are um far too tightly for us to uh disentangle all of those in a single conversation here but as you're describing the urgent need for women to fuel enough with the proper fuels to train hard enough to stimulate the correct adaptations that they need I imagine that the shift in appetite and body temperature that occurs across the menstrual cycle is also going to play into this meaning there will be phases of the menstrual cycle where women will be just naturally less motivated to eat enough carbohydrate enough protein in order to get the most out of their training what phases of the menstrual cycle are those um so that women can pay particular attention to make sure that they're fueling enough yeah um as estrogen starts to come up right before ovulation that estrogen surge really dampens appetite uh it also has a an interplay with our appetite hormones which is part of the reason why we don't have that great of an appetite it holds after ovulation estrogen dips you get hungry it comes up and people are like I have some Cravings which are driven by progesterone because your body needs more calories but at the same time with the elevation of estrogen you're not hungry you have cravings but you're not hungry interesting yeah so it's trying to disconnect those it's like your appetite is something that will come back of course once you eat but Cravings are more of a of that psychological capacity of yeah I my body needs more but I'm not quite sure what so to get women to understand what's happening across the board it's always coming back to Let's fuel appropriately for the exercise and even if you're not hungry if you are fueling appropriate appropriately at that point in time if you end up with less at least you've stopped that breakdown State the catabolic state so we don't get those perturbations in the hypothalamus that's my biggest concern for women is really taking care of that signaling from the brain to the rest of the body and if we have fuel on board even though we have appetite perturbations and if you go do a really hard workout in the heat you're not going to be hungry either but if you're having a cold protein drink after that hot workout you're taking care of that immediate need to shut down the signals that we need to break down things let's talk about one of the many third rails of um discussions online which is birth control yeah and we need to Define exactly what type of birth control we're talking about because there are so many different forms yes there are iuds there are the copper iuds there's the ring there's the you know let's talk about oral contraceptives that are designed to prevent ovulation so this is quote unquote the pill y so we're being let's for now limit the conversation to that so that there isn't confusion um share with us if you will your thoughts on these how they impact any of the things that we're talking about or anything else from that for that matter can we have another history lesson please all right um I just gave a talk at home to some young athletes on contraception because someone might be on the depot and if they're on it for more than two years they get bone mineral density loss so then the question of okay how does the oral contraceptive pill come up how does that affect things it's like well let's look at the history of it initially came from Stanford was funded by um Katherine McCormick from McCormick family and a feminist activist Margaret Singer but because they were women they couldn't get in the lab so they got a guy from Stanford to develop the pill and he's like you know what we need to put in a placebo week so that women feel like they're having a bleed so if we're looking at the three active pills and then the one sugar pill week it was by Design to make women feel like they are having control over their menstrual cycle and they would still have a bleed but it's not a true bleed it's a withdrawal bleed so this becomes the confusing point for people who are on an oral contraceptive pill they're like I get my period it's like no you don't because the idea of the hormones that are in an oral contraceptive pill is to downregulate your ovarian function so that you don't ovulate so you have a whole different hormone profile from someone who naturally Cycles so this depends on the type of oral contraceptive pill you are using for the most part monophasic is the one that's most prescribed so that means the three weeks of the active pill is the same dose of estrogen progesterone and then you have your sugar pill week or your withdrawal week and then you start again when we look at the repercussions of using oral contraceptive pill in active women there's a higher amount of inflammatory responses and oxidative responses so from a training standpoint no one's done the study yet but I would be interested in doing this of looking at how that impacts adaptation you do end up with a new Baseline of this when you start taking the pill but we're not really sure how that impacts adaptation we also look at the progestin component of the oral contraceptive pill because we have four generations of progesterone first generation was really high dose and has a lot of risk factors not really prescribed that much second generation is the most prescribed and this is the one that people just take it's in your IUD it's in your OC uh has the least amount of side effects and then we have a third and a fourth generation the fourth generation is primarily used for women who have really bad PMS or pmdd which is your um premenstrual dysphoria Disorder so significant mood issues because that progestin has a direct effect on a lot of the dopamine receptors in the brain as well the third generation is very androgenic so we see that in in some preliminary research that improves speed and Power by the second week of intake because it's accumulated so when we're looking directly at an oral contraceptive pill we can't make generalizations because you have low dose highd dose estrogen we see that a 30 microgram dose increases hypertrophy but not strength because estrogen increases the satellite cell aspect ECT um so for my power in Olympic athletes Olympic lifting athletes that's a detriment because they'll put on muscle mass but no strength so we've had to look at changing their OC or getting them off for women who have breakthrough bleeding that higher incidence of or that higher intake of estrogen is is really beneficial so we look overall at how it impacts women from an athletic standpoint it's so variable in the hormone profile that we can't make generalizations we only look at the very high performance athletes and what's happening up there because that can make or break an athlete so from the general touch point we don't know enough like the beginning of this year 2024 there was a study that came out looking at changes in the amydala that happens with oral contraceptive use it's reversible in adults but for young girls we don't know because their brain is developing and unfortunately Physicians will pass out OC's as if it's candy OC's or a contracep contraceptives and do you recall what the direction of the effect was on the amydala for those that don't recall the amydala bilateral brain structure meaning one on each side of your brain uh literally means almond in Latin it's almond shaped and it's part of a larger Network associated with threat detection um sometimes it's described the locus of fear in the brain but it's involved in a lot of other things too both positive veilance and negative alance but nonetheless is part of the um threat detection system elevated levels of arousal which is why it's often discussed in the context of fear anxiety Etc it increased fear in women who were on the OC oral contraceptive pill made them less um willing to take chances and when they went off it they're like why couldn't I do that before so that's why they started looking at the Amala and when I say we're looking at young girls and again we don't know what's happening is it reversible in young girls that are put on it or not because of the brain structure changes that are happening um so when we talk about an oral contraceptive pill I want people to understand that it has a significant effect on the body not just reproductive we don't know enough about all the other effects so I have parents who say my daughter wants to go on the oral contraceptive pill she's having irregular periods she's a athlete we want to be able to control it and it's like if there's a issue with your menstrual cycle now it's still going to be there when you get off it so we have to look and see what what's going on here if you're looking to get on it to control your menstrual cycle why because we know that you can have an increase in your V2 Max and other an anerobic capacity when you are not on it so you have a better top end capacity when you're not being blunted by these hormones and then the other conversation is oh my skin it's like well they have really good Dermatology that can help you with that you don't have to go on an oral contraceptive pill but unfortunately GPS don't understand all of that and if a girl comes in and says I'm having irregular Cycles heavy menstrual bleeding I want to go on the OC here you go so it is a huge conversation still we had um I put it in the same category as menopause hormone therapy because there isn't enough research to address all the population needs and we see these big pendulum switches so before it was like everyone be on the OC and now it's like maybe not and then it was no one be on menopause hormone therapy everyone should be on it but we need to land in the middle and understand more of what's happening with these exogenous hormones is there any evidence that other forms of female contraception can be let's just say problematic for the types of things we're discussing today like the implant in the Depot or IUD copper IUD copper I and the Marino or you know your progestin laced IUD those are what a lot of my tactical athletes will use because it doesn't have a systemic effect on adaptation or inflammation mood any of those things um and it's a fit and forget so you can put it in for up to 3 to five years if you have a really heavy bleeding it really dissipates because the whole idea of an IUD is to thin the endometrial lining and so then you have autophagy that takes care of the endometrial lining so you don't necessarily have a bleed the copper IED is different because you do have really heavy bleeding for the first three cycles and then it attenuates before we got started today you mentioned some very interesting pioneering studies on evaluating menstrual blood itself as a window into some larger themes about what's going on physiologically maybe even psychologically um now might be a good time seg to uh just touch into that we can always return to it again later but let me just ask it um more directly what are some things that can be measured directly from menstrual blood that are informative for women and it sounds like there's a new generation of at home tests that might be interesting and informative for them to think about yeah well if you think about menstrual fluid everyone thinks about it as a discard product but it's a very good indicator of what's Happening from an endocrine standpoint gives a really good indication of what's Happening from an endometrial standpoint so if you're looking at all the cyto and the proteins and the tissue that comes from it it's a huge indicator that's naturally discharged that we're now looking at for determining HPV do you have it or not what about proteins for PCOS can we really identify PCOS or endometriosis can we talk about PCOS for a moment most people have heard of it by now but polycystic ovarian syndrome It's associated with typically elevated androgens um it's becoming more and more common or perhaps detected more based on better detection methods I don't know which um the prevalence of PCOS seems to be very very high it does and I think it's a combination of both uh we also see some rebound PCOS that happens when someone gets off the oral contraceptive pill it's not necessarily true pcus because what's happening now your ovaries are producing eggs m that have been downregulated for so long so under ultrasound it might look like PCOS but it's not necessarily true indication the other is more and more women are starting to eat more and so they're coming out of low energy availability if you have more carbohydrate you end up with greater folicular stimulation which also shows up as PCOS so the true PCOS yes there is a high incidence from a reporting standpoint but is it that rebound where it's not having all the androgenetic changes that's still kind of up in the air at the moment um but it is a big concern for women because it is an indication that something's going on and they might have some fertility issues uh we see a really high incidence of PCOS in Olympic level athletes because of the higher androgenic aspect of PCOS so better recovery time a little bit higher Baseline testosterone um so yeah it's a population spec specificity as well in the 80s and 90s there was a lot of excitement in the kind of neurobehavioral Endocrinology Fields largely based on animal literature but then expanding into human literature that certain forms of activities could change hormone patterns and maybe even psychology and that makes sense on the surface of it but is there evidence that um if somebody engages in say high-intensity training or competitive scenarios this has been explored a lot in men but I'm wondering if it's also been explored now in women that androgens go up you know I mean there's been these studies I don't know how good they are of you know um people on the stock exchange you know watching their stress fluctuations measuring testosterone I think most of those studies were done in men um but other competitive scenarios even showing for instance that exogenous testosterone can increase altruism in men if men are competing for who's like donating the most money at a Phil philanthropic event but you put them in a different scenario where it's far less benevolent in in goal and then they'll uh exogenous testosterone drives competitiveness towards um things that are more traditionally thought of as male male competition uh in other words it's all context dependent um is there anything that kind of Springs to mind of interesting studies as it relates to androgens or uh estrogens in women athletes and as it relates to exercise they haven't done any specific studies like that in women we do see that under stress the cortisol increases and if you have an adequate uh response to it and your body can overcome it then yes you get a boost in testosterone for women um we see this in a lot of the night Mission shift changes in tactical athletes there is also uh I guess a lessening of circulating estrogen so the pulse changes when we start getting to the end of a really strong training block because we're starting to have a little bit of a down regulation of our leutinizing hormone pulse and estrogen um but it shouldn't be severe enough to cause menstrual cycle dysfunction what we want people to do is look at the ratio of their estrogen progesterone and keeping track of luteinizing hormone if they are at that point where they are going to have a really big training block so we look at pre-season during season end of season and people who might be at a higher risk factor for becoming a menic then we keep track that way um because it is the stress component that can downregulate not actually causing a permanent change as we talk about menstration we should probably talk about iron stores and um Iron yeah um do women need to supplement iron given that they lose iron during menstration it's interesting because we have a change in heepen or heidin depending on which part of the world you come from uh because it is increased under times of inflammation and decreased under times of iron loss so we see a a significant change across the menstrual cycle so I tell women if you are concerned with low fertin then we want you to take an iron supplement every other day starting in the first day of your bleed for 10 days because that's going to really allow your body to absorb it and stay on top of it um after that every other day yeah but you're not going to be absorbing as much of it because hepsin starts to come up after ovulation again you have a pro-inflammatory response so you have greater inflammation do women blanket need a supplement no because we see fatigue isn't necessarily just iron related there's so many other reasons why women are fatigued the one problem is the Baseline levels for like ferien for active women if you go in and you have a fertin level of 20 to 25 they're going to say it's normal but we'd rather see you up around 50 so if you are in that low end of normal then supplementing will help you get up into that 50 and see if it makes a difference if a woman is going to get a blood test to evaluate testosterone estrogen lipids metabolic factors Etc and she can only afford to do that at one point during her cycle and compare at various times maybe every six months or once a year even at that spefic specific time of her cycle is there a Best time in cycle to do that blood test uh if I'm limited to say that then I would say 5 to seven days before her next period starts so mid ludal because then you get a good indication of estrogen progesterone Peak testosterone doesn't fluctuate as much as those two so you're going to get a good idea what Baseline testosterone is and we know that there's a greater inflammatory response so anything that's outside of the norm of that upper elevation of inflammation you're going to be able to to pick out um so yeah I would say if you could only do it at one point in time that would be the time to do it and if she can add a second blood test at a different phase of the menstrual cycle where would you place that second test day two of the menstrual cycle second day of bleeding to get a really good indication of what your true estrogen level is at Baseline and if she measures her hormones at those two times within the cycle do you think that's sufficient to um get 75% plus of the relevant data yeah definitely terrific caffeine yes in the old days yeah meaning when I was a kid and not long ago 10 years three weeks ago um we would hear these crazy statements about caffeine it pulls calcium out of the bones it's you know you'd hear this stuff I did a whole episode on caffeine I'm a big fan of caffeine but I do warn people that if they suffer from anxiety or they're going through a particularly stressful life event it can raise the activity of the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system you'll feel more nervous you're more prone to panic yeah when you're drinking caffeine but um many people love caffeine I think 90% of the adult population of the world ingests some form of caffeine every single day I'm in that 90% yeah likewise making it the most consumed drug worldwide is caffeine safe for women I suspect based on what you just said that the answer will be yes but are there um case conditions where women should be cautious about their intake of caffeine independent of this anxiety thing I mean people probably shouldn't uh drink more caffeine than they can uh tolerate psychologically no one male female young or old yeah yeah it's more of a genetic Factor than it is a sex Factor uh so I mean both men and women will be fast metabolizers slow metabolizers or not have an effect that becomes the bigger Rock of them what we do find is in that per menopausal State women will become more sensitive to the blood sugar fluctuations that happen with caffeine so they're used to having coffee in the morning and with something then halfway through their workout they become a little bit hypoglycemic because there's changes in um insulin sensitivity insulin responses so there's changes also in blood sugar control and caffeine can exacerbate that so if you are someone who's like oh I always have a double espresso before I go workout and then halfway through I'm really hypoglycemic I'm really dizzy and lightheaded I don't know what to do feel sick or nauseous yeah yeah eat some food eat some food with it what about sipping caffeine through the workout um you know taking that coffee in and just having a SI between sets can that offset some of that uh I don't think so okay I hear a lot that people who drink caffeine before a workout you know Midway through they're like I don't feel good yeah yeah cuz they don't eat that for me that just stimulates the desire for more caffeine but um or even how dare I say a half piece of nicotine gum which I experimented with but I was told and this is why I'm not going to continue to do it not only is it very habit forming it actually is such a Vaso constrictor that uh I was told by a dermatologist that it's terrible for skin even if you're not getting your nicotine by smoking vaping dipping or snuffing so this this big Trend now toward ingesting nicotine as a stimulant and cognitive enhancer and performance enhancer I think people should at least be aware of the negative effects on skin never would have known because I'm not a nicotine person I'll tell you that half piece of nicotine gum is um the first time you do it it's a it's an unbelievable experience it's the it's like your first real cup of coffee oh really wakes you up yeah and dials you in I I recommend nobody do it because it's it feels that Pleasant if you like caffeine I like Shandra for that reason Shandra yeah what's Shandra it's an adaptogen I me I should know what this is you you should know what this is I should know well I'm here to learn okay um Shandra Shandra uh yeah so it is an adaptogenic plant so you know like jining siberian jining maah asaga all those buzzword out there Shandra is another really well-studied adaptogen and I have friends who say it's like Aderall where you take it and it's immediate fun focus and function because its main goal is to regulate dopamine serotonin and cortisol so it gives you gets women and men out of that brain fog gives them incredible Focus do you use it yep are you on it now I put it in my morning coffee okay uh you just sent people down the uh the rabbit hole of the internet of the internet all right yeah yeah you heard it here first from Dr Stacy Sims I'm going to give it a try because the nicotine thing is an interesting one and there are some cognitive enhancing effects of nicotine that perhaps in um people 65 and older might actually be beneficial for offsetting some forms of neurod degeneration but that needs to still be explored and researched don't cut that and clip it and put it out there like so that's happened already um very interesting all right caffeine we both agree is great Shandra you got to try it check it out let me know all right we'll do cold yeah for reasons I still don't understand people have Associated me or this podcast with deliberate cold exposure I like deliberate cold exposure in the form of a cold shower or a cold plunge or an ice bath mostly for the effects that occur afterward meaning more alertness a kind of semi- euphoric Buzz that goes on a long long time no I don't think it increases metabolism significantly enough to have a meaningful difference but the long long lasting increases in the so-called catac colines dopamine or epinephrine and epinephrine to me are pretty impressive and I just like the way it makes me feel so that's the main reason I believe why people do deliberate cold exposure and every time I do a post about deliberate cold exposure I get asked understandably so how does it affect women differently than men and then I usually get questions about rod syndrome oh yeah yeah so is there a difference in terms of how Del cold exposure impacts women I have to imagine the answer is yes given what you said earlier about Vaso constriction versus Vaso dilation but deliberate cold exposure like it hate it what do you think do you recommend it for women I recommend it for Open Water swimmers who might experience that vagal response when they first dive into the cold I prefer heat for women everyone's a responder to the heat you get better adaptations so sauna yep sauna hot tub yep preferably a true finish sauna infrared doesn't it warms the skin but not the core we want thank you for saying that I'm not a big fan of infrared sauna cuz it doesn't get hot enough no yeah you can bring an infrared light into a traditional sauna if it can tolerate the heat yeah but finished sauna would be what something between 185 degrees Fahrenheit and maybe 210 if you're really heat adapted yeah I'm still working on Metric let me do the conversion oh sorry yeah you're living down in New Zealand now yeah so 60 to 80 degrees C I need to look every time I've tried to do math on the fly on this podcast in my head it's like okay * 9 different processing mode yeah but people can look it up yeah okay look it up um so the thing with cold water exposure is the whole conversation about ice cold ice baths and how cold it is it's too cold for women because when we're looking at that severe immediate jump into that icy cold it causes such severe constriction and shutdown so women do really well and get that whole dopamine response and everything if the water is around 16° C which is 55 to 56 degrees Fahrenheit which is chilly it's chilly it's not warm no it's go dive in San Francisco Bay right and that is enough to offset that severe constriction survival but it is cold enough to invoke all the changes that we want with cold water exposure so it's a temperature Nuance that's that sex difference and like I said when I have Open Water swimmers who are going to do a long swim or they're going to do a triathlon and the water is colder I have them do cold water exposure especially face exposure into the cold water um to get them habituated to that initial severe constriction and sympathetic activity that we don't want to happen before a rice with heat being the true like true heat that we're talking about with sauna we see a lot of metabolic changes for women so we're having better insulin and glucose control we're seeing uh a better um expression of our heat shock proteins and the uncoupling and and the rebuilding of those proteins that are cardiovascular responses and then for women as we get older and have the offshoot of hot flashes night sweats that kind of stuff if you're doing heat exposure you're sending a stronger stimulus to the hypothalamus and you're also getting a better serotonin production from the gut because we have 95% of our serotonin produced from the gut which lends to better temperature control and shuts down hot flashes I think some people might be confused by the idea of using sauna in order to reduce the hot flashes um so I'll just remind people that your brain has a set of neurons in the medial preoptic area that's sort of a thermostat if you will controlling core body temperature and if you heat the surface of your body your medial preoptic neurons say oh let's cool down the core of the body now if you stay in that heat too long you'll cook your your body core body temperature will go up but conversely if the surface of your body is made cold the internal milu of your body will heat up because those medial preoptic neurons will say oh you know this this is like putting an ice pack on the uh thermostat which is what um graduate students and post talks used to do in the labs side working because it was a battle over the the heater right some people were in hot some people were in cold so there was always this this business in any event um so it's not that you disapprove of the of using deliberate cold exposure you just recommend that women do deliberate cold exposure with temperatures that are maybe in the um low 50° Fahrenheit um Range as opposed to the really H frankly just painfully cold for anybody um you know 38 to you know 50 degree temperatures right we did a pilot study looking because Wim Hoff has been down to New Zealand quite a bit and so you know his breathing and ice bath stuff has been making the rounds and working in the high performance people wanted to do that but we have few athletes that have really severe endometriosis it's like well we could look at using cold exposure to help control that and what we found over the course of this study was that if we were to do deliberate cold exposure around ovulation and then hold it for 10 days over the course of three menstrual cycles it attenuated the endometriosis because endometriosis is an inflammatory disease right so if we're looking at inflammation process and growing the tissue if we can dampen that inflammation and create a response that learns that inflammation and dampens it then it helps with endometriosis interesting that's another Avenue that we really want to take when we're looking at Cold deliberate cold exposure wow fascinating as a cautionary note if anyone is going to explore Wim Hoff type methods um please please please do not combine cyclic hyperventilation um or hyperventilation of any kind with breath holds and water exposure not even in the depth of a puddle um there have been drownings associated with people doing cyclic hyperventilation in various contexts not just related to Hof breathing but um basically people who are not skilled um and even some who are skilled combining cyclic hyperventilation breath holds and water in any form cold or warm water idea just don't if you're going to do any kind of cyclic hyperventilation breathing my labs actually published on this in a clinical trial do it on dry land or don't do it at all and if you're going to do deliberate cold exposure um limit your breathing to slow deep breaths make sure that you're um well supervised and um just stay alive please yeah so we didn't incorporate any of the Wim Hof breathing we just Incorporated the deliberate water cold water exposures cold and temperature generally is such a potent stimulus and it's exciting that people are starting to explore this especially the in my opinion the the sauna work uh one thing I suppose that we should um discuss very briefly before we move on since we've been talking about resistance training we've been talking about deliberate cold exposure there is evidence that doing deliberate cold exposure not so much in the form of a cold shower but in the form of a um submersion up to the neck post strength or resistance training say in the four but probably the eight hours after resistance training because of the attenuation of the inflammatory response which sounds like a great thing it actually can inhibit some of the strength and hypertrophy gains that one would otherwise experience so if you're going to do deliberate cold exposure best to not do it in the eight hours or even on the same day after resistance training geared towards developing strength and hypertrophy increases no problem to do it first in fact maybe even some performance-enhancing effects of doing it first there's some athletes that stand for doing that but just want to throw that out there is there anything else you want to add to that um which is different from heat exposure because heat exposure you want to do afterwards the phas of dilation yeah because it extends that training stimulus and also the passive dehydration from training will stimulate greater blood volume improvements oh interesting so after a good weight training session if one has the luxury of doing it get into the sauna for up to 30 minutes make sure you're hydrating you want slow rehydration because part of it is that dehydration and the decrease of oxygen at the level of the kidney to stimulate more EPO so with more red cell production you have natural increase in plasma volume so it's a blood volume expander o so now we're getting into Real Performance enhancement is this true for men and for women yep yeah uh let's walk through this protocol I like I like this this is uh this has not been discussed on this podcast so um somebody does their resistance training M finishes up drinks eight or 16 ounces of water with a little salt in it maybe and then hops in the sauna yep for how long up to 30 minutes okay no longer no longer no longer yeah they'll probably be a little bit thirsty in there you're looking for a little lowlevel dehydration is that right yep okay um the ranges that I've seen published in the finished studies are as I recall and I'll double check these numbers 186 degrees Fahrenheit up to about 210 Fahrenheit um and the higher end only being for those that are heat adapted yeah one can cover their head with a towel and actually feel more comfortable because the brain is insulated the surprises people they think putting a you know something on their head would make it excessively warm but you actually protecting your brain from some of the Heat and people will put a towel over so that they when they breathe it doesn't burn the inside of their nose and their mouth either um I'm always like if you're going to be in and it's that hot just move down a level so on the floor y y um and this stimulates the production of more red blood cells MH okay which then translates to what in terms of athletic performance you have an increase in your cardiovascular effort and because you have greater amount of blood volumes you you have greater amount of pretty much blood circulating so you have more available for um muscle metabolism heat loss um so it's akin to going to altitude so people will go to altitude to get that blood volume boost but not everyone responds to altitude you have responders non-responders over responders okay this is why when I go to Colorado I'm gasping for air while I do a walk but then I come back to C Level and I feel better my endurance is better but some people might not experience that effect true this is I was telling the guys before we started that I've been in ARA at home in preparation for going to Park City because I live at a beach town and going to Park City I am a significant responder to altitude and I won't be able to have coherent meetings at altitude if I am not adapted so okay yeah so this explains why when I've gone to meetings in Colorado at altitude some people can have a drink that first night and they're perfectly fine even though they normally live at sea level and I'm trying to trying to see the stairs correctly even though I don't drink y that would be it very interesting so you can use post resistance training sauna exposure to improve performance yeah you can use it um post cardio as well so anything that is giving you that passive dehydration from training because you're not because you will become passively dehydrated when you're training right you can't keep in as much fluid so I'm saying passive as in you're not able to stop that dehydration and then you go into to the sauna and you are extending that training stimulus because your heart rate is elevated you're putting your body under stress from dehydration and the body responds in kind of we need more blood volume so let's let's jump start that I love it logically watertight and um I'm going to give it a try yeah what other training T tricks tips do you have up your sleeve Dr Sims what you want to talk about um do you have any favorites besides that I I Delight in these and I know other people will as well um do any come to mind I mean you've T us about Shandra um about posttraining sauna exposure to improve performance by increasing red blood cell count yeah there is there anything else that Springs to mind no no no pressure uh I'm a fan of what I call the track stack that we used to use for track athletes but then for really significant high intensity work so track stack is kind of the idea from the old bodybuilding set where you're taking 200 milligrams of caffeine uh lowd dose baby aspirin MH but then I add beta alanine used to be a fedrin I know so I'm I'm old enough to remember when they would sell it as the triple stack with a fedrin but some people dropped dead and they took it off the market y hey it came back on the market in New Zealand last week did it really yeah it gets you going yes it does it's um it's Speedy y um it's dangerous yeah but the track stack which has beta alanine and not ephedrine is really good at encouraging an extra top end effect because you're having the caffeine you're having a little bit of the blun blood thin from the aspirin and then the vasodilatory properties and the carnosine aspect for muscle contraction from the beta alanine and so like training for gravel races in the top end Sprint you do a couple of Sprint sessions with that and it's increasing your training stress during the training so your adaptation is to that higher stress should anything be done in terms of recovery to make sure that you offset that additional stress that's achieved with this track stack yeah um just making sure that you're not stacking two days in a row of high intensity work like really making sure that you're recovering well because it is a significant stress on the body what about sleep we hear so much these days about the importance of sleep for mental health physical health performance I think this is a great thing a great Trend are there female specific requirements for sleep that vary across the menstrual cycle Andor by age or just generally you know do men and women need to think about the need for Sleep differently yeah um part of it is the obvious like when you're talking about sleep temperature right women and men have variations in their sleep temperature and what's optimal so looking at that like you need to create an environment for you that is cool comfortable which is probably going to be different from your partner who might be sharing your bed so that becomes a sticky point we talk about the menstrual cycle there are definitive changes in sleep architecture we're seeing that in around the mid ludal to the premenstrual so you know that about 10 days before your period starts significant change in your slow wave sleep there's less of it latency is increased so you have a longer time to get to sleep and you have more light sleep so overall you know less of that deep recovery sleep and this is where women tend to have more of their mood issues too because of estrogen's play with serotonin in the brain so we really need to nail down our sleep hygiene in that time period um so looking at things like eleanine and appenine and looking at your room temperature and the screens and all the things that you've talked about for the most part about sleep and sleep hygiene super important and then of course as you get older in both men and women becomes more difficult to sleep but we see significant issue with insomnia in women who have really bad hot fleshes and significant uh menopausal symptoms and again this has to do with lots of the perturbations from temperatures of night sweats increased sympathetic load um not being able to get into a parasympathetic state so this is where working with a specific sleep specialist might come into play we can also look at using some adaptogens the Rola stacked with theanine um and looking at the cold temperature getting people to use the non-sleep deep rest or Yoga Nidra or some other kind of meditative property that they can then access when they're in bed so there's a lot of different things that we have to be aware of um and again in that par menopausal State we see that significant change in sleep and sleep architecture and quality of the sleep but men don't have the same thing so women have to be a little bit more aligned with what's happening from a hormonal profile standpoint because it does definitively affect serotonin melatonin and sleep architecture because of the interplay that estrogen has on the brain and The receptors makes very good sense we'll put a link in the show not captions to some zeroc cost um non-sleep deep breast yogan nras we've put out a couple with my voice if you prefer another voice I a big fan of the ones by Kelly boy who's contributed to um The Waking Up app it also has terrific um non-sleep deep breast yoga nras out there and there are S as well um you mentioned a few supplements theanine um appenine which is chamomile extract um maybe let's just have a general conversation about supplements what's your thought on supplements um how do you place them into the landscape of nutrition they are after all supplements not Replacements but um the word supplements I I believe is a little bit misleading um because there are food-based supplements you know like a protein powder um there are supplements designed to achieve a specific Al come and then there are supplements that are kind of a um designed to be a more you know support for a bunch of things you know kind of insurance policy um what are some of your favorite supplements in any of those categories specifically for women and perhaps even specifically During certain phases of the menstrual cycle Andor per menopause menopause I just threw about nine questions at you okay the number one is creatine creatine for women doesn't matter what age it's really important we're seeing a lot for brain mood um and actually gut health so five grams of monohydrate per day sort of to five three to five yep um preferably of course Crea pure because the way it's produced so if you're looking at Crea pure it's the German company that produces it uses a water-based wash to produce the creatine interesting whereas others use an acid-based wash and we see a lot of side effects with the acid base wash like gastric distress yeah so people are like I'm really bloated and I have nausea and stuff from taking creatine I'm like is it Crea pure actually no it's like switch to creapure and so they switch and they're like oh my gosh I feel so much better noted yeah um and then vitamin D3 really important especially um when we're looking at all the information that's coming out from cardiovascular muscle brain everything that goes with vitamin D also with iron so vitamin D is really important for absorbing and maintaining iron stores uh so those are the two big ones and then sorry I just wanted to stop you for a moment um as it relates to creatine I hear two general lines of concern one I hear more often from women my understanding is that because creatine brings water into the muscle as well as supporting the phosphor creatine system of the brain the water into the muscle component means yes people who take creatine 3 to 5 grams per day will gain a few pounds of body weight that's solid body weight in the form of water within the muscle so solid in air quotes it's water but it's within the muscle um so they should know that um it's not a given though interesting it's not a given there are some women on the lower dose of three that don't experience the water gain okay and this is not bloat like water subcutaneous water this is water within the muscles correct so it will be uh stored within lean tissue um and then I do hear concerns about creatine uh causing hair loss I my understanding is there is zero evidence for that no evidence there is a smidgen of evidence that it might increase dihydrotestosterone levels but it's like one study marginal increase and then people linked dihydrotestosterone to hair loss and so then the the conclusion people drew was that somehow creatine increases hair loss but you're saying zero evidence no evidence we see that women who start taking it midlife are complaining about it but it's actually a progestin driven thing we see progesterone and fluctuation progesterone can exacerbate any hair loss so if women are experiencing that and they're saying oh it's creatine I've read all this stuff on Creatine no it's not okay so we've got creatine D3 um a th000 IUS per day 5,000 IUS I guess it depends a little bit yeah uh being very close to Antarctica in the southern hemisphere in the winter uh very low sunlight exposure um looking around the 5,000 same with upper Northern Hemisphere UK that kind of stuff closer you get to the Equator the less you need the one concern is like a day here where it's foggy and it's supposed to be sunny and people are like great I don't you know don't have to worry about going out in sun exposure but then the next day it's bright and sunny and they're like ooh sunscreen so they put sunscreen on and not getting the right sun exposure so then again it is a lifestyle thing so basic is two to 5,000 great Okay so we've got creatine vitamin D3 what are some of the other supplements that you um that you take or that you I don't know if we say suggest but that you um perhaps suggest women consider yeah so protein powder a really good high quality uh because the amount of protein that women should be getting is often difficult to eat um so again supplementing not using as the main stay uh that's one to consider and then again I'm about adap so looking at the different adaptogens ashanda is a good one holy basil or Tulsi is another one Shandra and then getting into some of your medicinal mushrooms Lions man Rishi those are the two big ones that I look to and often have women use if these adaptogens blunt cortisol because certain ones do like ashwaganda which by the way I do think people should cycle if they're going to take it high doses right cuz there are some ISS issues with liver and thyroid and thyroid problems if people take ashwaganda high doses for too long so that's um important to note but assuming that the adaptogens are reducing cortisol levels um in addition to doing other things is there a particular time of day or night that people should consider taking them should they avoid taking it early in the day my understanding was that you you want a bit of that cortisol uh bump early in the day but you certainly want cortisol lower later in the day yep and I think the problem is people think that they don't want any cortisol and they think that would be bad that would be bad they don't understand that the body has fluctuations of cortisol throughout the day and that's normal if we're looking at having issues with sleeping and that anxiety provoked from that sympathetic drive and elevation to cortisol let it peak in the morning after you're waking up and look late afternoon like 4:00 when it starts to dip to take your adaptogens then because then it feeds forward to being able to relax more which feeds forward to better sleep for something like Shandra where you're looking for that brain Focus you can have it in the morning it doesn't necessarily have as big an impact on cortisol that you see with something like Tulsi or ashanda because Shish is more stimulatory the other two are more calming um I put some in my morning coffee and then in the afternoon when I need to pick me up instead of more caffeine I'll us Shandra because it gives you that boost without the effects of caffeine and it doesn't interfere with sleep so there's a time and a place to take them and yes some need to be cycled on some need to be cycled off but I tell women what are your main symptoms what are the things you're looking to control and we can look and see what kind of adaptogens we can use and how we place them what's the story with pregnancy and training yeah you um is there an official word on this you know uh assuming a woman knows that she pregnant from the very beginning of missing a period where she's in a position to make decisions about training or not training training at a given intensity or or not um what are your recommendations the human body is really interesting and when you get pregnant your body tells you what you can do so we see that you have a reduction in your Anor robic capacity on purpose your body's trying to be protective you do have an expansion of your blood volume so endurance is really good but you can't do high-intensity um when we're looking at the general guidelines that are out there they've gotten rid of the heart rate rule they are now telling women to be as active as they can be without creating injury and without trying to make gains so that means if you're in the weight room you're not looking to improve you're looking to maintain if you're doing cardiovascular work and you have a specific class that you love to go to yeah but don't beat yourself up that you can't hit that high in intensity you're going for the social aspect you're not trying to gain Fitness you're trying to maintain I think the very worst possible scenario is someone who superactive and stops doing everything because they're afraid because then they get deconditioned and then they end up in a worse State than someone who was sedentary who's now encouraged to walk during exercise um it hasn't been well researched because you can't get ethics to study pregnant women very well so we go on a lot on um case studies and cas study notes and the bottom line of it all is you stay active and you can do resistance training you can do all the cardiovascular work and your body will tell you what you can and can't do I've been asked whether or not pregnant women can do deliberate cold exposure probably no fewer than 2500 times on social media and I never have an answer and but I always default to the cautious answer which is uh please don't until you talk to somebody who actually has an answer yeah just because it sounds like a very precarious situation but in all honesty I don't know I'm just biing time there and just saying please go ask somebody who can give you a definitive answer yes so we see women who have a high risk for miscarriage that anything that they do that's incredibly stressful for the first 12 to 20 weeks will put them at a higher risk for it so being very cautious especially with cold because we know that there are so many different nuances doing something like hot yoga when you're pregnant is not there is a research so it's not detrimental yeah because when we're looking at blood flow diversion that way when you have slight hypoxia to the placenta and to the baby there is a rebound effect that increases the vascularization so that the baby has better nutrients we see this also with like exercise and exercise intensities this is why people people are now saying you need to have some kind of blood flow change and increase in core temperature to create these vascular effects within the placenta to improve nutrient and nutrient delivery to the developing fetus so Heat's good cold I'm not so sure of but probably not extreme heat not extreme heat so that's why I mean like hot yoga is not going to the sauna Hot Yoga sits around 40° Celsius so what is that just around 100 degrees Fahrenheit and in that situation if you're feeling too hot you leave you lie down on the floor don't try to stay for the whole class um but it's not going to be detrimental unless you're pushing yourself too much again everything in moderation especially when you're pregnant it's almost the inverse of what we know for males which is if men want to conceive they should avoid the sauna because we know that heat is detrimental to sperm viability in a in a real way so much so that I tell guys if they are trying to get their partner pregnant that they should bring an ice pack into the sauna they should insulate that ice P don't put it directly on the scrotum for for other reasons but that it's a you know that the effects of heat the negative effects of heat on sperm are are real yeah but there's also an interesting it's not just a trend there's actually some research showing that um cooling the testicles leads to increases in testosterone which is on the face of It kind of um counterintuitive because turns out that it's about the Vaso constriction causing the subsequent increase in blood flow increased Vaso dilation so the inverse of what you just said which is that during the heating process the hypoxia induces more vascularization of the of the placenta yeah so um when talking about temperature one always has to think about the surface of the body versus the brain response as we talked about earlier and then what's happening during the delate heat or deliberate Cold versus what's happening after the deliberate heat or deliberate cold right everything in biology is a process not an event yeah and I should make full disclosure I started as an environmental exercise physiologist and my PhD was all in heat and heat research so I'm a little bit biased towards heat but I've done a significant amount of research in the hot and cold thank you for the disclosure uh I see it more as a uh as an indication of of real knowledge so thank you this is an aspect of your training I I knew a little bit about based on your Publications but I didn't realize the depth of knowledge so we're all benefiting here including this earlier protocol of sauna post training you can bet a lot of people are going to start incorporating that I think we might need to name that I've done this from time to time named protocols um because people are reluctant to name them after themselves maybe we call that the um the uh The Sims protocol or something like that the anyway your discomfort will be other people's U benefit now seems like a good time to address some specific questions related to the age brackets that you mentioned earlier um in anticipation of sitting down with you today I asked some different women that I know you know if you could ask the world expert in exercise physiology hormones and um and nutrition Etc as it relates to women one question what would it be and one of the most common questions I got in the 50 and up category was what is the most efficient way for a woman older than 50 to train for the maximum health span and lifespan benefits I love this question because I get it all the time we have to turn our brains away from everything that's been predicated before to this point so if we're looking for longevity and we're looking at what we want to do when we're 80 or 90 we want to be independently living we want to have good propri reception balance we want to have good bones and we want to be strong so this is where we look at 10 minutes three times a week jump training so this isn't your Landing softly in our knees this is like impact in the skeletal system uh a colleague in friend of mine Tracy kle did a PhD and um post not a postto but post research on this and is developing an app on it to show women how to jump to improve bone mineral density over the course of four months of this type of training people have gone from being Osteo um pic to normal bone density so it's a different type of stress so if your concern is that which a lot of women do have a concern because they lose about onethird of their bone mass at the onet of menopause wow yeah significant yeah goodness gracious if you don't do something as an intervention so we see a lot of women are like oh I'm going to go on menopause hormone therapy to stop um bone loss yeah it can be a treatment but I always look at an external stress that we can put on the body that's going to invoke a change without Pharmaceuticals so jump training heavy resistance training and Sprint interval training those are the three key things and from a training standpoint and then from a nutrition standpoint getting protein protein is so important when you start telling women they need to look at around 1 to 1 1 G per pound which is around that 2 to 2.3 G per kilo per day they're like whoo that's a lot of protein it is because we haven't been conditioned to eat it few scrambled eggs it's a chicken rest at lunch it's a small steak at dinner plus other things right exactly and it doesn't all have to be animal products I mean you're looking at all the different beans and things that you can put together and that's the other big thing that in order to build the muscle and to keep the body composition in the state that we want it to keep going for longevity those are the big rocks the Sprint interval training the heavy resistance training the jump training and the protein I'm thinking about this and I'm thinking about my my mother who's 79 years old she'll be 80 at the end of June and is in good health walks a lot Gardens does some yoga but does none of the things that you're describing so Mom please I'm gonna I'm going to um send her to listen to this s in the same vein yeah what about the women out there age 20 to maybe we make it the 20 to 40 bracket um and if we need to divide that more finely we can um um what is the most efficient way for them to train for health Vigor and Longevity uh making things fun for the most part I don't want people think that it's a chore so if you're someone who's been told you need to run and you hate running then don't run like that's common sense and I say that because I see little kids in non- US countries that have to run across country and you see these kids when they're six years old and all running around the field and they're the the kids that hate running that aren't natural Runners and then they hate physical activity for the rest of their life so I put that in like when you are exercising you want to find something that you find fun when you're in your 20s to 40s you have more room to get away with things that might not be optimal for you when you start to get older big rock again is resistance training it doesn't have to be heavy resistance training like I said earlier to failure you're periodizing if you want to do a block of Olympic lifting go for it if you're like I'm not comfortable doing that kind of lifting I want to do more machine stuff great but we want to make sure you're changing it up all the time to keep things moving and shaking with regards to strength and hypertrophy and then it becomes more of are you training for something that's endurance are you looking for just longevity for brain health we need to have some lactate production because women as I said at the beginning of the podcast are more oxidative we don't have as many of those glycolytic fibers so what we're finding in older research is that there's misstep in brain lactate metabolism because the brain hasn't been exposed to it especially if we're looking at women who are being studied now it hasn't been in a societal context to do that kind of work the younger we are and the more that we can keep our our glycolytic fibers going by doing high-intensity work the more we're exposing our brain to lactate the better we see fast forward to attenuating cognitive decline and reducing the plaque development of Alzheimer's this is why women who are in their 40s plus I want them to do the Sprint and the high intensity work for that lactate production start early because then you can take some of those type two B fibers that could either go more aerobic or anerobic and make them more Anor robic so those are the two big things for women who are younger and then you can play around with the other things if you want to be an ultra endurance athlete yeah not really ideal but yeah you can do that that's fine you'll recover well now forgive me because you've said it several times throughout today's discussion but I really want to drive home a key point that I think for most people men and women is not obvious but is really important when you say high intensity you don't mean a class or a run uh where you're drenched in sweat and gasping for air at the end necessarily correct let's disambiguate high intensity from what most people think of high intensity which is a really hard workout a tough class where they had me moving the whole time doing a circuit Etc what does the appropriate high-intensity workout look like okay so uh if I talk about true high-intensity interval training if you're a runner it's going to the track and doing sets of 4800s okay so 400 a lap yep 800 two laps right so you're looking at between a minute and four minutes of of hard work at 80% or more with variable recovery so that's why use a track as a as an example so if you do one lap and you're like uh I'm going to walk half a lap and then do it again that's adequate recovery tough yeah it's hard right but it's not like you're going to be there for 90 minutes doing as many 400s as you can because you have that variable recovery it might take half an hour to 40 minutes max and then you're gassed out can't do it anymore if you're looking at a gym situation I look I I like to look at something like every minute on the minute where you might be doing uh 10 deadlifts at moderate intensity weight and it Tak 10 repetitions yeah so it takes you 50 seconds to complete that then you have 10 seconds to move to the next exercise that might be thrusters so you know a squat clean thrusters so it's a squat pulling the weight up overhead so you're doing maybe eight of those in that minute and you might have 10-second recovery you go to the next exercise that might be um kettle bell swings and you're doing explosive kettle bell swings and you'll finish you know 10 seconds to go you go to the fourth exercise I don't know toes to bar or some other kind of vup some other high intensity and then you have one minute completely off so you've had four minutes of really heavy work with maybe 10 seconds to move to the next exercise one minute completely off and then you repeat that three times and this is high-intensity interval training this is not what you would consider resistance training for sake of building muscle or strength correct you're using these loads these machines the the pike you know hanging from the bar and bring your knees up or lsit or something as a tool to get the heart rate up continually y y very different than resistance training the mo the way most people think about it correct so this is the cardiovascular high-intensity interval training and the subset of that is Sprint interval training and this is something that's really really hard and people don't get it I don't necessarily mean running it can be whatever mode of activity but it's 30 seconds or less as as you can go so this is your N9 or 10 on your rating and perceived exertion 110% it's Max effort on the rower on the airdine bike running if you like of those the skier the battle ropes battle ropes are big so 30 seconds all out then rest what 10 15 seconds repeat no you want to because now we're looking at that top end where we want uh regeneration of your ATP you know all of that system and central nervous system recovery so this is 30 seconds all out could be two or three minutes of recovery oh nice because I'm not looking at Tata where you're 20 seconds on 20 seconds off because that's not the intensity we want we want you to go all out and recover well enough to be able to go all all out again you're not leaving anything in the tank so those are what I mean by high-intensity interval training or or when you're looking at polarizing your cardiovascular work that's the top end those are the two examples of your top end and then your recovery is that long slow walking on another day where you're not going and doing a tempo run you're not doing a 5k easy jog because that put you in that moderate intensity and if I heard you correctly earlier you are suggesting most women do one or two days of high-intensity interval training plus 3 to four days of resistance training for sake of building strength and muscle which looks very different it's more warm up do a couple work sets you know two to four work sets of you know an overhead press two or four work sets of maybe a barbell curl two or four sets of some dips or whatever whatever um one's you know personal choices yeah okay got it um very different Far and Away different than what most people men or women are doing out there which is um a lot of StairMaster treadmill jogging maybe some Lifting for hypertrophy because I look at the general consensus of what's out there in the fitness world is all based on Aesthetics and body composition and so people have this mentality of I need to be hypertrophy to Get Swole and I need to do long slow stuff on the cardio machine to lose body fat but that isn't what we're after we're after let's create really strong external stress to create adaptations not only from a neural and a brain standpoint that's understanding it but but also feeding down to metabolic change because if you have a really significant high stress we see epigenetic changes within the muscle that increase the amount of what we call the glute four Gates so you know the proteins that open up that allow carbohydrate to come in without insulin so we're expanding that acute um glucose uptake through an epigenetic change the other thing that it does is it causes a an acute inflammatory response that your body learns to overcome and it's really important for women to do that because as we start to lose estrogen we lose a significant anti-inflammatory agent so this is why we see that increase in the visceral fat especially when we're hitting your your mid-40s onwards is because now you have this increase in free fatty acids and the inability for inflammation to come down so the muscle cell is going I don't know what to do with this so get circulated to the liver and the liver stores it as visero fat whereas if you do that high intensity work it creates that change within the muscle to understand pull that in let's use it let's also bring more carbohydrate in and more glucose in use that which helps use free fatty acids and it also creates a significant anti-inflammatory response at the level of of the mitochondria and within the cell itself which is what estrogen used to do so if we look at those external stresses it's not about body comp and Aesthetics per se it's about the molecular changes that we want to invoke to get that body composition and the brain health that allow us to be 80 or 90 and independently living and in terms of nutrition you mentioned women should shoot for 1.1 1.2 grams of quality protein per pound of body weight what other types of foods do you like to see women ingesting so um are you a fan of fruit yeah great well these days you sort of have to ask in these circles uh vegetables y yeah fiber is important yeah absolutely and then in terms of starches to um to replace glycogen especially if people are doing these high-intensity interval training sessions and the resistance training um what are your preferred sources it depends on who I'm working with uh I have some people who love cocoa pops and kids cereal o i cringe at that stuff um but you know I prefer I prefer rice and oatmeal and I like a really good sourdough bread with butter or olive oil you know guilty of that yeah but there are some people who like the ultr processed stuff so I'm like okay if you really really need it then you can put it on top of your yogurt after training as part of your carbohydrate uptake it's the only time because glute four levels are so high you're basically pulling everything into glycogen at that point anyway um but ideally carbs are all the different colorful fruit in veg and if we're looking at sweet potatoes or Kuma if you're from other parts of the world yams all those kinds of things sprouted bread fantastic kenoa amorth all of those different types of things it's just staying away from the ultra processed and when we look at women it's really important to have a very significant diversity in the gut microbiome so we see there's a definitive decrease when we start to have hormonal shifts because of the way the gut bugs help deconjugate or unwrap some of our hormones and shoot them back out in the circulation so as much fiber colorful fruit and veg as you can but also it's the 8020 rule right 80% of the time you're spot on 20% is life because otherwise where do we get our chocolate and our whiskey and there's some data that chocolate is good for us especially the the low sugar dark chocolates what I look at is how it makes you feel makes you feel good right yeah yeah we one has to live yeah um and fats um where do you like to see women get their fats from again I'll do a full disclosure I have been um vegan since I was in high school because of an incident of a field trip to a pig slaughter house and driving down the five but that's my own preference so when we're looking at fats um it can be from a lot of different sources I prefer women to have most their fats from plant-based stuff not because I am plant-based but because of the effect it has on the body but there is a time and a place for animal fats too um um the whole fear mongering of saturated fatty acids from dairy has been disproven so if we're looking at what kinds of fats you want a conglomerate but you want most of them to come from Whole Food plant-based not from Ultra processed um and then of course you're reaching for some real butter you're reaching for some 4% fat yogurt or something like that to complement your avocados your nuts your seeds and your olive oils that all sounds very r and delicious in my opinion yeah it's it's too Common Sense people don't do it I think if people hear it from you they'll do it um I think people just need to hear it in the context of a non-diet um context and you've done an amazing job today of explaining how nutrition fuels training training fuels changes at the level of the muscle the liver Etc that allow one to ingest more fuel in fact a lot of what I'm hearing is that women should probably ingest more quality fuel to offset these cortisol spes and feel better while training and to train more which um everyone agrees provided it's done properly is is great for us kind of a fun hopefully fun question for you if you had a magic wand and you could get all the women uh on earth now and going forward to make a change or changes you don't have to pick just one in terms of nutrition how they think about their hormone cycle exercise Health span lifespan what would it be I think I would have everyone understand their intrinsic selves because we have been inundated so much with sociocultural rhetoric and so much external noise that women have forgotten what it means to listen to themselves and their bodies I mean that's the one thing that I have to retach women to do so often so if I could have a magic wand and have every woman understand what their bodies are saying and what their Cycles are saying and per menopause is normal it's everyone's going to go through it if you have had a menstrual cycle just to intrinsically understand what their body is so then they have the tool to be able to implement external stressors that's going to be beneficial for them well Dr Stacy Sims this has been tremendously educational for me and I know for everybody listening and are watching um you've taken us on an amazing tour of the best ways to train with cardiovascular training and resistance training those tailored specifically for women as well as touching into some protocols for both men and women that are immensely powerful talked a lot about the menstrual cycle I get asked about the menstrual cycle and how it relates to training and vice versa so many times and um thank you for providing clear actionable answers and you've also educated us on caffeine supplements including um revealing some supplements that I didn't know existed which is a which is a uh not a common occurrence for me yeah I win and um many wins many many wins thanks to you and on and on so just such a a rich data set here um presented with such Clarity and in an actionable way so on behalf of myself and everyone listening and watching I just want to say thank you I know I know you've come a very long way from the other side of the Equator not just to see us but given that your time is so precious um that you've come to visit us and share with us your knowledge I just want to say uh a really deep heartfelt

Title: Dr. Stuart McGill: Build a Strong, Pain-Proof Back
Published: 2024-07-15 12:00:50 UTC
Description:
In this episode, my guest is Dr. Stuart McGill, Ph.D., a distinguished professor emeritus of spine biomechanics at the University of Waterloo and a world expert on spine anatomy and physiology, back pain, and rehabilitation. We discuss the most common sources of back pain, how back pain can be assessed (including self-assessment techniques), and how to design a personalized recovery plan to reduce back pain. 

We discuss how to train for lifelong fitness, reduce injury risk, and protect your back and joints based on your age and personal goals. We also discuss how to prevent back pain, build core stability, and explain how “McGill’s Big 3” exercises protect and strengthen the back. Dr. McGill, who is exceptionally fit in his late 60s, describes his low-time investment, personal training routine, and the specific exercises he uses for mobility, strength, and cardiovascular fitness. 

We also discuss controversial issues in the back pain and rehabilitation field, including how pain originates, the biopsychosocial model of pain, and treatments such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP). This episode provides clear, actionable tools to strengthen, prevent, and remedy back pain and injury so you can be pain-free while enjoying sports, exercise, and daily activities at any age.

welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday [Music] life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Opthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine my guest today is Dr Stuart McGill Dr Stuart McGill is a distinguished professor of spine biomechanics at the University of waterl as a professor for more than three decades Dr McGill has analyzed the spines of injured people as well as healthy people and develop methods to treat spine injuries and pain as well as to improve spine biomechanics in anybody he has authored more than 250 peer-reviewed research articles on these topics making him a true World expert during today's episode we discuss spine Anatomy as well as the common sources of back pain and we discuss some of the controversies as to the origins and different treatments for back pain as you'll quickly learn there is no one specific source of back pain nor is there one specific solution to back pain but as Dr McGill spells out very clearly there are things that anyone and everyone can do in order to strengthen their back and to reduce the amount of pain they may be experiencing he explains some specific ways to self- diagnose your back pain which of course is critical for understanding what specific things to do as well as to avoid in dealing with any pain and as it relates to applying in sport and in everyday life Dr McGill and I also discuss several of the Avid controversies within the field of back pain and the treatments for back pain we talk about the so-called bioc psychosocial model of pain which points to the various sources that pain can arise from everything from emotional to lack of sleep to specific locations in the spine and brain and elsewhere in the body and the ways those mesh together to give us what we call pain as well as to direct us towards specific treatments for pain that tend to be especially effective Dr McGill is a true encyclopedia on the topics of back physiology and Anatomy sources of back pain and treatments for back pain so it's truly a special opportunity to be able to learn from him in such immense detail and in such a clear and actionable way by the end of today's episode you will have a quite thorough understanding about the anatomy and physiology of the back as it relates to a healthy back to back pain and of course you'll have various remedies for dealing with back pain preventing back pain and for strengthening your back for all sorts of different kinds of movement not just for exercise and Sport but also to move through your daily activi pain-free and with ease and Mobility at any age before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching research rols at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Helix sleep Helix sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are customized to your unique sleep needs now I've spoken many times before on this and other podcast about about the fact that getting a great night's sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance now one of the keys to getting a great night's sleep is to make sure that your mattress is suited to your unique sleep needs what does that mean well if you go to the Helix website you can take a brief two-minute quiz and it asks you questions such as do you sleep on your back your side or your stomach do you tend to run hot or cold during the night things of that sort maybe you know the answers to those questions maybe you don't either way Helix will match you to the ideal mattress for you for me that turned out to be the dusk mattress made by Helix I started sleeping on a dusk mattress about 3 and 1/2 years ago and it's been Far and Away the best sleep that I've ever had so if you'd like to sleep better by sleeping on a mattress that's customized to your unique sleep needs go to helixsleep.com huberman take that brief two-minute sleep quiz and Helix will match you to a mattress that's ideal for you right now Helix is giving up to 30% off mattresses and two free pillows again that's helixsleep.com huberman to get 30% off and two free pillows today's episode is also brought To Us by better help better help offers Professional Therapy with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years initially I didn't have a choice it was a condition of being allowed to stay in school but pretty soon I realized that therapy is an extremely important component to overall health there are essentially three things that great therapy provides first of all great therapy consists of having good rapport with somebody that you can really trust and talk to about the issues that you're dealing with second of all that therapist should provide support in the form of emotional support or directed guidance and third expert therapy should provide useful insights insights that allow you to better understand not just your emotional life and your relationship life but of course also your relationship to yourself and to career goals and school goals meaning excellent therapy should also Inspire positive action better help makes it very easy for you to find an expert therapist with whom you really resonate with and that can provide the benefits that I just described if you'd like to try betterhelp you can go to betterhelp.com /h huberman to get 10% off your first month again that's betterhelp.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by waking up waking up is a meditation app that offers hundreds of guided meditation programs mindfulness trainings yoga needra sessions and more I started practicing meditation when I was about 15 years old and it made a profound impact on my life in recent years I started using the waking up app for my meditations because I find it to be a terrific resource for allowing me to really be consistent with my meditation practice what I and so many other people love about the waking up app is that it has a lot of different meditations to choose from and those meditations are of different durations so it makes it very easy to keep up with your meditation practice both from the perspective of novelty you never get tired of those meditations there's always something new to explore and to learn about yourself and you can always fit meditation into your schedule even if you only have two or 3 minutes per day in which to meditate I also really like doing Yoga Nidra or what is sometimes called non-sleep deep rest for about 10 or 20 minutes because it is a great way to restore mental and physical Vigor without the tiredness that some people experience when they wake up from a conventional nap if you'd like to try the waking up app please go to waking up.com huberman where you can access a free 30-day trial again that's waking up.com huberman to access a free 30-day trial and now for my discussion with Dr Stuart McGill Dr Stuart McGill welcome thank you sir great to have you here um I'm a big fan of your work I've watched a lot of your other content read your books and I'm excited to discuss today what makes for a really strong resilient back what causes back pain and how to relieve it and perhaps the bigger issue is what all of that allows for in terms of mobility and functionality not just in sport but in everyday life so to kick things off I'd like to ask a question that I think is on a lot of people's minds most people aren't thinking about their back unless they have pain so what causes back pain you start with the easy questions let me give context before I Define it as tightly as I can for you back pain is a symptom so let's just change the topic for a moment and talk about leg pain can you imagine asking someone well could you give me an exercise or a prevention strategy for leg pain okay so that sets the stage a little bit we're talking about a symptom for which there's a hundred or more different Pathways and mechanisms there so we've got to have a fairly comprehensive assessment now and understanding uh to focus on the type of back pain and then matching an appropriate uh inter intervention I was listening to the your new podcast uh with Andy Galpin this morning the perform podcast the perform podcast yeah and he said uh I'm going to try and follow the three eyes and it was I think gather information interpret the information and then intervene so it's the same kind of deal here and of course that's pan medical condition shall we say so with that cont text I'm going to answer it like this what causes back pain genetics loads the gun exposure pulls the trigger and then the psychosocial millu around the individual influences how they respond to the pain so there's a start we can break it down in those three categories if you wish sure So when you say uh genetics loads the gun uh what comes to mind mind because it's my experience is that um I have a right shoulder that sits a little bit lower than my left shoulder unless I'm mindful of that uh my dad has the same thing and I can you know put an ankle on my other knee a bit more easily on one side versus the other I tend to pronate one foot a little bit more than the other when I run these are subtle things they don't necessarily result in back pain but I'm guessing that a lot of that is either developmental overuse particular sport I'm regular footed I skateboarded a bunch so I push with my right foot I kick a soccer ball with my right foot those sorts of things but let's assume that genetics played some role created some bias if I were to tell you that which I just did would then you immediately think to a particular intervention if I told you okay you know I I have a little bit of lower right side pain which I occasionally do I know I've got this imbalance that was loaded by genetics and presumably experience as well and would your mind immediately go to a particular uh origin of that pain or perhaps even more importantly a particular remedy to that pain or do we need to drill a little bit deeper and really understand um more about what I do what I don't do if I'm more thin set or heavily set at the level of of bone structure you know what are some of the other questions one would ask in the investigate category my thought would not go to one or the other but it would go to both and I'd start that conversation with this uh analogy uh let's talk about breeds of dogs we both love dogs if I said to you we're going to take two dogs and we're going to train them for the Greyhound track one's a greyhound and one's a St Bernard how do you think you're going to make out the St Bernard no matter how you train it or condition it will never make it to the uh performing on a greyhound track you're going to end up with a broken uh St Bernard so there's a little bit of a start from a big perspective but now let's drill down and talk about spines uh it's interesting when you look at the basic anatomical structure of an individual we just did that with dogs imagine if took a thin Willow Branch I could bend that Willow Branch back and forth over and over and it wouldn't accumulate stress but if I took that same Willow Branch and loaded it top to bottom like an ibeam it would just bend and break so it supports bending Cycles but it doesn't support compression now I'm going to change that uh Willow Branch into a thicker stick and I bend the stick once and it shatters in other words the uh thickness and Radial diameter being larger means the stress is bigger in bending however let's compress the same stick it can bear tremendous compression so there's a very fast example on spines there's a a fellow who uh has the world record in consecutive situps thousands of them given what I've just said what's your prediction do you think he has a big strong fellow with a thick spine or do you think he's a very Slender Man with a willowy thin spine he's a willowy bendy guy who can just keep bending up and down off the ground bingo bingo he has to be there's no option so there's a start on the genetics not everybody can play offensive tackle and not everybody can be a gymnast or uh not everybody can simply tolerate sitting in a chair being a computer operator there's a very mundane example for you could I ask you a question about um the willow versus um thicker thicker trunk um example can we look to torso thickness or wrist thickness or ankle um circumference as a way to of assess ourselves uh as to whether or not we are like likely to be more willowy or um Redwood like I mean I it should be obvious just by looking at ourselves knowing ourselves but for instance I have a short torso I'm kind of thick through the Torso front to back I always have been since I was a kid but and my wrist the wrist circumference isn't isn't small but isn't isn't huge I had a a a Bulldog Mastiff um and he would often look at me and I knew in his mind he was thinking my wrists are really thick compared to yours Andrew I knew that's what he was thinking he had forearms he had forearms like a like a long shoreman and of course he had never done any any work whatsoever actually primary goal of the Bulldog is to do as little work as possible in life um but I have friends who you know have thick knees some have smaller joints smaller ankles can we make some general assessment about our spine without Imaging it by looking at some of these peripheral markers absolutely yeah so the uh knee width the bi iloc Crystal width which is the width of your iliac crests uh hip width uh are all surrogates to indicate General heaviness of the skeleton um so yes that's that's one good marker um but there's more to the story for genetics and how bendy a spine can be um the shape of the disc matters so if you take on average a group of top golfers you'll notice that their spines uh that the disk shape if we were to cut through which is a transverse scan on an MRI the discs are more ovoid if you take someone who can bear a lot of compressive load the discs look more like a limma bean and that's called a limacon shaped disc and of course the discs are in repeating fashion throughout the spine top to bottom correct um and the discs are the soft tissue that allow for mobility of the vertebrae the uh the Bony segments exactly they are the joints but they're not a ball and socket joint they're actually a fabric of layer upon layer of collagen fibers and we can talk about that as well what a beautiful adaptation right take a bunch of bony if you want to be able to bend a bone right you need to um break it up into segments kind like beads on a necklace and um and then in between those beads you put some pliable yet um uh it I guess a tissue that you can still compress so it's both pliable and it can it can squeeze down and become more narrow in the vertical Direction and it can also you know squeeze down on one side uh or the other to to some degree yeah we evolved discs and there really is no other better architecture people say well why don't we have ball and socket joints in our spine and the reason is this can you imagine uh stacking five oranges one on top of the other and then you could make them Mobile by putting a ball and socket joint in between them the amount of control that you would need on every single orange you move one orange you have to control all the other it's Mission Impossible we would uh I would do an experiment with students in my lectures I would take four coffee cans and put a tennis ball between each coffee can and then I would put a rope at the front and the back of each coffee can and then one on the side and I had four students take those four ropes and then I took another four students who had the ropes on the next coffee can and then on the next coffee can and then I'd say Okay group flex the spine forward so the students on the front would pull a little bit but the guy on top had to pull more than the uh next coffee can and then the next coffee can a little bit less vice versa the people on the other side had to pay out the rope in sequence and and then I would say okay now let's twist a little bit anyway you could imagine it was impossible to control and then I took out the uh uh tennis balls and I put in what was a disc a big round cylindrical piece of foam rubber all of a sudden that added stiffness so now because the body uses stiffness as the control parameter now we've added control in that the foam rubber would create a buffer and as the deviation in motion occurred the foam rubber would add more resistance so it was an automatic control and it that that's what a shock absorber does on a car it has an elastic element plus the damper but it's the elastic element and we're going to talk about stiffness and stability I hope uh that that really creates the control so that's why we have evolved discs it's highly efficient I can bend the spine to tie my shoe but if I have to uh carry home uh these days heavy shopping bags I need stiffness of that flexible Rod so it doesn't collapse or uh years ago I might have been carrying home an animal for dinner and uh I needed those discs to provide the stiffness in a very economical way and in a way that didn't create stress contribution uh concentrations the way ball and socket joints would so that that's an evolutionary necessity um also when we look at spines there are the column vertebrae with the intervening discs but behind them there's two more joints and those are called facet joints and they guide motion those facet joints have a variety of angles they can have open angles which allow you to twist so if you took a group of golfers could you imagine uh if they had facet angles like this you can't twist so facet angles that are too close together basically a small angle if the angle is orientated for and a you can't twist and you won't find if if if you're dealing with a group of professional golfers you'll find that they all have open facet joints is that genetic it's absolutely 100% genetic now interestingly enough when you Arch back when the facet joints are orientated open as I'm describing when you Arch Back one pushes hard on the other like shingles on a roof that stresses a bone called the pars bone and uh gymnasts for example get a very uh typical fracture pattern called a spond alol lth thesis which is a fracture of that bone and then the spine shifts a little bit at that joint uh I'm just finishing rehabbing a pro tennis player who had the same thing after they tried to have too much range of motion in their serve the coach gave them excessive extension to try and put more miles an hour on the ball but it didn't suit the spine and they ended up having a stress fracture I mean is it fair to say that um if we can um if we are naturally flexible uh for instance like my sister can you know like her fingers can bend back really easily her a shoulder extension which I guess for people that aren't familiar with shoulder extension you know she can um like let's say you're you're leaning up against a railing with your back to the railing the railing is just uh let's just say is um just above lower back height and you can put both hands on it parallel so your arms are are close together like very close to the Torso and then and people don't don't do this quickly because because you can tear you can tear something or injure something but then with feet about I don't know a foot or two away from from that uh bar um you can do a knee Bend and and basically the arms go back behind you like I happen to have a fair degree of shoulder just natural shoulder extension ability I'm not particularly flexible quote unquote but that's just how I'm structured I have some friends that can't do that to save their life right um but I wouldn't consider myself hyper flexible my sister is a bit more flexible we're related obviously um so would people like her or people that tend to be pretty flexible naturally um would they be wise to avoid certain activities if their goal is to remain painfree I mean you talk about the St Bernard running um on the Greyhound track you know we all can enjoy things recreationally but of course we don't want to injure ourselves so is somebody who's naturally flexible should they avoid certain Sports and activities conversely if somebody is naturally stiffer thicker spine thicker joints should they avoid certain activities that's a huge question and there's many more variables to uh consider um but I will say that when we are rehabilitating a uh athlete or just a person to get back to work they're an occupational athlete we take all of this into consideration so as you were describing your sister arching back um a I know she has plump discs discs that are full of fluid uh to allow the mobility to take place in the diss I also know that if we looked at an x-ray from the side you know the posterior spinus processes if you run your thumb down the midline of a person's back you will feel the bumps of bone up the middle of the spine those are the posterior spines uh she will have a large space between each one when she's standing upright so when she extends back those spaces will come together and eventually the spines what we call it kissing spines and it takes me back to some of the old Russian techniques for bench press they would bench press with a huge arch in their back and then other people would say oh I'm going to try and mimic that particular bench breast technique because it allows you to get much more Force so to latissimus dorsy a stiffer back and you get a different Force vector and and actually more effective uh force on the bar they didn't realize that when we work with a person who has a huge Arch they have big spaces between those spinus processes and if you don't have those big spaces you are going to crush the interspinous ligaments which naturally are between those spaces and uh you will now fire off a whole set of uh uh new problems so what is a mechanical advantage for one person is a mechanical disadvantage for another do you follow so it's it all of this uh matters going back to the dis being a fabric of layer upon layer of collagen strands typically uh the disc is about 80% type 1 collagen that is the stiff strength collagen about another 20% is elastic collagen type two but there's types three through 10 that bind those collagen fibers together that's where there's a much greater degree of genetic variability so there are some people who uh can get away with doing many sit-ups they have a slender spine and they have the type of binding collagen that holds all those fibers together but if I wanted to work these fibers of my shirt apart get them to delaminate I would create repeated stress strain reversals the resistance of that fabric depends on the stuff holding the fibers together so there will be binding fibers there that's where the genetic uh variance lies in many people so even there the person's resilience to repeatedly doing a bending drill is determined by your parents to some degree both in the size the collagen type three through uh 10 makeups as many of you know I've been taking ag1 for more than 10 years now so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast to be clear I don't take ag1 because they're a sponsor rather they are a sponsor because I take ag1 in fact I take ag1 once and often twice every every single day and I've done that since starting way back in 2012 there is so much conflicting information out there nowadays about what proper nutrition is but here's what there seems to be a general consensus on whether you're an omnivore a carnivore a vegetarian or a vegan I think it's generally agreed that you should get most of your food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources which allows you to eat enough but not overeat get plenty of vitamins and minerals probiotics and micronutrients that we all need for physical and mental health now I personally am an omnivore and I strive to get most of my food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources but the reason I still take ag1 once and often twice every day is that it ensures I get all of those vitamins minerals probiotics Etc but it also has adaptogens to help me cope with stress it's basically a nutritional insurance policy meant to augment not replace quality food so by drinking a serving of ag1 in the morning and again in the afternoon or evening I cover all of my foundational nutritional needs and I like so many other people that take ag1 report feeling much better in a number of important ways such as energy levels digestion sleep and more so while many supplements out there are really directed towards obtaining one specific outcome ag1 is foundational nutrition designed to support all aspects of well-being related to mental health and physical health if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com huberman to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs with your order plus a year supply of vitamin D3 k to again that's drink a1.com huberman unless somebody is seeking to be a worldclass athlete in something in which case they should probably pay attention to their genetics and see whether or not it lines up well with a given sport although there have been you know exceptions where people who were incredibly um genetically um uh let's just say biased toward um not being able to perform well in a sport have nonetheless succeeded in performing at a world-class level the but those are exceedingly rare exceptions um for most people who want to do things recreationally like the heavier set person with a thicker spine who wants to golf or um do a um you know or do ballet perhaps um or the thinner willowy person who wants to get into powerlifting for instance um are there certain things that they should each consider and embrace as activities in order to make them themselves more resilient more pain resilient and more um apt to have higher performance for instance would the willow person so to speak do well to build up some of the musculature around the spine to compensate for the thinness of that spine and would the person with the heavier uh or thicker spine uh do well to um try and encourage more pliability of their discs somehow the answer is yes but it's a very limited yes so if I can set the stage and and give some context here every system in the body requires stress for Optimal Health think of the cardiovascular system the muscular sceletal system the endocrine system even the psychological system it needs stress to create adaptation for robustness but you cannot cross what's known as The Tipping point because if you do you start building cumulative trauma of some form whether it's emotional trauma psychologically or it's cumulative stress at the tissue level at the level of the cell uh so we have to talk about those tipping points we've got to Define where they are try and expand them adapt them but don't cross them so with that context now we can talk about uh a person's suitability for the stresses on different parts of their body associated with different sports we can talk about the rate at which the adaptation occurs the amount of Del loads and rest that are required all of these things are genetically influenced um the way that they perform the movement is going to move the stress concentration here's an interesting uh demonstration for you if you go to the Olympics and look at the podium winners of a javelin thrower they look identical do you think the swimmers look like the javelin throwers no they don't but they look like each other but they look like each other the people on the podium look very similar in structure yeah let me just give another very poignant example of that consider a sport that has three very separate demands of the athlete consider a triathlete the triathlete has to swim a certain distance then they bike a certain distance and then they run a certain distance have you ever known a person who comes out of the lake or the pool whatever it is first winning the triathlon doesn't work that way what suited them to be a fish fast in water uh they have to be somewhat floppy in the ankles because they're creating a fish's fin longer in the Torso uh uh consider uh a uh a power lifter performing a butterfly stroke it wouldn't look very pretty then they get on the bike where they have to stiffen to stiffen the core I I don't know if you know bike design well I'm sure you do you're paying for stiffness of the frame that's what a really Elite not know that yeah so when a person pushes on the pedal the frame doesn't Flex because that would be an energy leak you pay for a very stiff frame so every ounce of force that you apply to the crank handle to propel you forward propels you forward instead of being wasted and bending the frame the same way uh the the cyclist will lock in on the bike they'll squeeze the saddle between their their their legs uh lock into the bars lock their core down so that when they uh create power power through the hips and through the legs it's transferred to the power it isn't transferred to bending their willowy body that is very different from the neurology and the mechanics of a swimmer now let's run to run uh the most efficient Runners store and recover elastic energy in tune Springs uh a wonderful book to read is the the Lost Art of running but by Shane benzy who studied the Kenyon Runners and how they store and recover elastic energy with each stride almost the same way as a kangaroo would a kangaroo is more efficient when it hops versus plotting along using Ecentric concentric muscle contraction so uh again the polar opposite of a swimmer it's a very tuned stiffness the most efficient Runners for the Third Leg of the triathlon pre- stiffen they have a pre-contraction of the muscle so when the foot hits the ground they're already storing the elastic elements and they get that back for free but if the Springs were not tuned and they stretched away their muscles just to be passive Elements which serves them very well in the swimming uh element think of doing a pogo jump so you're just pogoing through the ankles now if you had no tone in the leg you just flop into the ground and you would have to use concentric Ecentric muscle contraction but if you stiffened too much you're now a piece of iron and you won't be able to jump either but you'll get a beautiful resonance a beautiful Pogo when you have the tuning just right so when a muscle contracts it creates Force we all know this but people don't appreciate you're also tuning the stiffness if I maximally contract my muscles I can't move so athletes have to tune muscle if they're impacting athletes but they also have to pulse and relax pulse we're talking about Mike Tyson before the uh podcast today and the mechanics of how he pulses and then he's got to relax to get closing velocity of the Fist to the opponent and then when his fist hits the opponent he turns to Granite and it is just such an awesome experience to to feel that a little bit it's one of the joys of my life working with Elite athletes to feel their athleticism but then dissect it down as to how they do it so there's a lot in that but that lesson from the triathlete really shows us how you can't be good at everything there's always a trade-off with athleticism and the genetic part and then of course in the appropriate training to optimize and express that genetic gift through technique through technique so some athletes are very loose some athletes are very tight some are very elastic you won't hit a golf ball 330 uh yards if you're not an elastic athlete you'll notice if you measure a golfer who can hit 330 yards they don't test very strong they have a beautiful tuned elastic body uh you can almost see it if you've worked worked with enough of them there's a smoothness to the muscle so underneath the skin is a fascial net someone who can throw a baseball 110 115 120 mil an hour will be the same but now you have a very asymmetric elastic effect so um I know that you loath and avoid generalizations um with good reason but given that most people people listening to watching this um are probably not aiming to become Elite athletes I know I'm certainly not um can we safely make at least one or two generalizations about what we each and all can do to try and avoid um let's say back pain and injury um it by either diversifying our training or avoiding certain types of training for instance let's take the three major phenotypes um and and this is obviously not how the world works but the classic you know ectomorphic phenotype very thin very willowy small joints long and live you know um or live the mesomorph thicker more muscular um uh and then the so-called endomorph the more heavier set maybe even carrying some extra body fat Etc don't really know what's under there they could fall into either of the other two phenotypes I could imagine based on everything that you're saying that A good rule of thumb would be avoid the types of activities that are outside of your natural genetic propensity um based on body type at least in the extremes like if you're not very bendy don't do seven days a week of yoga okay but I could also Imagine the opposite which is if you're not very bendy do seven days of yoga because that's going to allow you to become more bendy or the person that is naturally shaped more like a shot putter let's say the myomorph or uh endomorph and you could say well um there'd be great powerlifter I mean I knew kids like this in high school you know PE class they're like okay weight training today none of us have done weight training and then the kid you know lies down and you know and pushes you know 3:15 you're like oh goodness you know like that's that's wild um but maybe they shouldn't be weight training if their goal is to be all around fit to be a which I think is the goal of most people to be able to you know carry some luggage at the airport without you know having to stop every once in a while and suck for air to be able to you know lean down and grab something out of a cabinet you know you know pick up a kid you know you know do some hard uh labor in the yard you know move some logs and things like that just be able to do stuff without getting injured without being so sore in the following days that that you feel like you need um extensive rehabil itation so again I know you like to avoid generalizations but should we make it a point to train against our predisposition in order to offset the imbalances that would otherwise occur or would we be wise to lean into our strengths and just not touch stuff that Taps into our weaknesses I understand the question the answer is I don't know but but I know people will say oh this professor he he's avoiding the the question and I'm not going to do that so I'm going to tell you how I find the answer and it's through assessment and I'm glad we're getting back to back pain by the way because it's my real uh the Cornerstone of my expertise our assessment is very comprehensive it starts out by me simply asking the person tell me your story and some people never tell me about their pain when I ask them to tell me their story they will be telling me about their family life and the pressures that they have to still go to work because they have two kids in school or four kids in school or uh they might tell me about the passions that they have or they might tell me about their goals so the goals are the beginning of answer answering your question Andrew we all know people who aren't suited for a certain occupation or they aren't suited or or they I'll take myself for example I had a high school careers counselor tell my father well Miguel he's not really suited academically he should go to trade school and so I I registered for for for plumbing school no I just R UBS cuz clearly that's not the way you went not that going to Plumbing that going to Plumbing school would be a bad decision for some but in your case you went a very different direction I I think I would have been okay as a plumber sure but anyway uh my point in that is what are the goals uh then the assessment I'm I'm paying attention to the person's learning style how are we going to coach them and then we get down to the details of their pain what's the nature of the pain is it when they get out of bed in the morning is it associated with a certain activity is it associated with certain motions postures or loads and uh hone does does the pain change does it start out on one side of the back and then later in the day it's in the left glute or does it go down to your right toes all of things these things are telling me about the stability of the pain uh it it's giving me Clues on what I'm going to assess then we go and assess them and it begins with what we call provocative testing I'm purposefully provoking their pain if I can provoke their pain I've nailed the mechanic if I can't provoke it it's not mechanical okay well that tells me something now so now I'm starting to see um I know what their job is I know what sport it is they want to do I know enough about that job in sport that I know the physical demands I know the psych uh the psychological demands do they have what's required of the job or Sport and then I test that if it triggers their pain we have a problem so now we have to focus the training very specifically because people do not have infinite training capacity they only have so much and when you're hurt you have even less so we try and focus on things that are going to make a difference to enable them to have the ability to meet those specific demands that we've identified so do you see how it's it's a long-winded answer but I I know how to get there to know how to train them so now that we've recognized the very specific nature of their pain pathway and it may be something that's going through the linkage in other words um when they uh run I I could give you an example of if we put a group of Canadian hockey players on an elliptical trainer they don't do very well because typical of the sport the hockey players tend to get stiffer in the hips it's the way they are they skate a little bit flexed and they carry all Heavy skates and heavy equipment down the legs they get stiffer in the hips when they go on the elliptical their hips don't have the range of motion and their spine and pelvis gyrates with every rotation on the elliptical trainer the elliptical gives them back pain if they already have motion triggered back pain we take another group who has mobile hips they do very well on a tical trainers the stress doesn't go into their backs so now do you see why I know why one group does well with elliptical the other group does not I know why one group who they I'll give them uh a lateral sheer test which is basically a bear hug I pull their pelvis towards me as I hook down their shoulder in my armpit so I'm shearing their spine laterally if that triggers their pain exactly I had a pro hockey player the other day I gave him the lateral Shear test and he had a right-sided flash of pain going around his right flank it exactly replicated the pain I just found with Precision the mechanism okay what's the antidote I put my fingers into his oblique muscles and I said push my fingers out and he did it too hard he says oh no that that that hurts even more okay dial it back a bit tune what we're trying to achieve here here fight me just a little bit I repeated the formerly offensive test the symptom was gone so now I'm getting more Precision on knowing what I need to do he was doing the Poff press the Poff press is a long lever exercise so you take a load usually with a cable or a band that's held laterally and you increase the length of the lever which you have to resist because it's punch it out from the body yeah you try and it it it's causing you to twist but it also creates a tremendous Shear load on your spine that was triggering his pain so we took out the Poff press which for him right now is replicating his symptoms but if you're playing in the NHL you should be able to do a Poff press you follow y yeah it it's it's a requirement of the rigors of professional hockey but he can't do it now so this is informing the programming that we're going to do so if somebody has pain in a given movement say standing up um after they sit for too long right um a particular style of hip hinge you know deadlift or or squat or when they run for instance would it be wise for them to you know think about the exact movement that makes the pain the worst in the moment that they're doing the movement or afterwards because often times pain will will arrive after we engage in a certain activity but during the activity that pain is shut down which by the way is an interesting phenomenon on its own right and um you know might be worth some uh mention as to like couple of the reasons why that that occurs we always think oh blood flow it's warm but clearly it's it's more it's much more than that more than that yeah for sure um so let's say I've uh pain in a knee when I run should I avoid running in that gate that causes pain and work around it um seems to me that would be the The Logical choice right every person that comes to us comes with back pain so initially we avoid it we can have a neurological discussion if you like we can have a biomechanical discussion or we can have a psychological discussion we can take it in the framework of any of those if we like if the pain is causing a sensitization I'm going to use the example here of stubbing your toe you stub your toe once okay well it hurts a bit and the pain goes away fairly quickly but if every day you stubbed your toe you would increase the sensitivity so that you don't have to stub it anymore all you have to do is lightly touch that sensitized toe and you are going to have a maladaptive heightened response so if we keep creating pain on that toe it will never get better MH so we have to start a desensitization wind down which is tissue based but it's also neurologically based as well and uh so so because everyone comes to us with pain we work very hard to hack our way around it so let's say sitting uh causes their pain all right we'll find out that when uh we do a sitting test if they sit slouched that causes their pain when they sit upright their pain goes away so I will give them a uh lumbar support which I'm just happening to use now I had to sit on an airplane for 5 hours yesterday coming to see you and this allows me to not get back pain on the airplane while I'm sitting because if I sit flexed for 5 hours I will have a grumpy back and I won't feel like when I get into the hotel to go for a walk which is uh and and train a bit because that's what we have to do to create a stress below the Tipping Point to optimize health so it's it's the same thing in putting together the program first of all know the cause and try and eliminate it so we'll teach them uh you you know we spend a lot of time with spine hygiene we teach them uh how to to hip hinge your squat we teach them how to Lunge how to get to the floor we teach them how to roll without twisting their spine into pain but using their ball and socket joints uh we teach them how to do a baby's crawl uh which eliminates the Torso twisting which in their current state will offend the sensitized pain trigger that must be humbling for adults to get down and do a baby's crawl hey it's it's so humbling to take a world record holding athlete and humble them right back I as you know I've I've had the current holder of the world's alltime record squat Brian Carroll and I Brian and I have written a book together so I can use his name what's the squat record 1,36 PBS if you can believe that down to parallel down to parallel no no other human has has done that that was four years ago now no one's replicated it does he wear a one of those elastic lifting suits when he does that he do yeah so he's putting on an exoskeleton of stiffness but I want to come back yeah to how humbling it was to have someone who already held World Records in squatting in two different weight categories and I had to show them how to get off the toilet but that's another story and we both laugh at this now but that was what pain had done pain had corrupted his movement patterns and he forgot how to squat but he held the world record that's how corruptive pain is to the neurological engram and we can talk about inhibition and facilitation and all of the things uh I mean I'd love to have that conversation because I know who I'm sitting with the the neural aspects are fascinating when he does that um incredible squat poundage um does he take the bar off a standard um squat rack and then walk it back or is he is it one of those ones where the bar is suspended from two hooks and then he takes it from there yeah so that particular lift was lifted off a monolith where he didn't have to walk it out so he takes it off so it's hanging from hooks then the hooks away the reason I ask is um it sounds like he's optimized for one very specific movement and a couple of you know uh couple of planes and nothing else because walking with a thousand plus pounds on one shoulders is also a feet and of itself okay shuffling backwards as it were all right you're not letting me off the hook which is fine so I've worked with competitors who compete in strong man and they can carry and walk with 1,000 lbs on their shoulders it's called the super Yol uh another client of of ours who uh held the the world Wilks score in the ipf international powerlifting Federation where they do not lift out of a monolith they take the bar off a squat rack and they have to step back and that is uh if you don't have enough lateral Al strength and control in your torso that's when you become hurt not during the squat it's during the walk out so it's a trem it's a very different feat of strength so you're very astute to say lifting from a monolith is a different athleticism and strength distribution then an ipf style where they lift off a rack and have to walk it out so you're standing on one leg so can you imagine a th000 pounds coming down your axial Spine down your midline it hits your pelvis and then it has to Shear across the pelvis and go down the stance leg as you're stepping back with the right so it requires tremendous strength to hold the pelvic platform up on the swing leg side and uh so that that is a tremendous core strength component so best not be uh carrying a willow spine for that one you want to be like a like a a mirwoods redwood um well you want to be built like Blaine Sumer who's another one of our uh clients I've worked with Blaine for quite a number of years I love the analogy to dog breeds I love going to dog shows I've only done it a few times not to actually see the Prancing around of the dogs that doesn't interest me at all best part about a a really excellent dog show as you go back behind the the arena where all the different breeds um reside so you can see the lineup of the the finest Irish wolf hounds the finest um English bulldogs at Etc you know hundreds of different breeds and you really get to see these genetic extremes not just of structure but of temperament and you get to see the similarity and temperament of the Bulldogs and of course there's variation some of them are a bit more Jolly others more stoic um you know the Terriers are magnificent in their own right um and as you pointed out earlier with respect to the podium more similar to each other within breed than across breeds in terms of temperament but there's variation within breed the reason I bring this up and the reason I bring this up now is that if you look at the movement of those animals even just the way they walk whether or not they um enjoy a a flexion of the Paw as they stride or whether or not they tend to stride differently I don't have language for this I'm not an expert in this but I have a visual system that works and I can see that they may move differently they actually walk differently even at the same Pace um and then you look at human beings shorter taller medium more Li more heavy set um and it's amazing that we don't take this into consideration that we all move very differently even within species but that we we um B into these groups so when someone walks into your laboratory as it were your clinic SL laboratory do you are you paying attention to how they move into the room irrespective of pain 100% I uh we we we time the clients I see 1 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon and they're three-hour appointments so I know when they're coming I watch them get out of the car if I can and that's when the assessment starts uh but just to go back to the dogs my sister is a vet her husband's a vet and her daughters in vet training so we have these conversations all the time do you know she's already made an assessment of that dog on how it's going to behave when she injects it or has to do a rectile exam or whatnot in what dog or breed and even in cats which ones she's going to muzzle because she's usually right on on who's going to get bet H yeah and uh interestingly as well it's how the uh dog feeds off the owner and she can look at the owner and usually determine how the dog is going to behave so talk about the psychosocial millu around dog behavior absolutely going back to your question when a person walks in so I've had gold uh have I had a gold medalist in Sprints yes I have from the Olympics uh I've had a silver medalist I've had just what every athlete that you can and then a person walks in off the street all with back pain in your mind's eye conjure up the image of a good Sprinter do you think they have a flat lower back or do you think they have a lot of lordosis which is an extend tension Hollow in their low back a sprinter now what what will they have I recall seeing Michael Johnson sprinting very upright yes so when I think upright I think either you know flat lower back or a little bit of a of a of an arch in the lower back you know this kind of yeah he was 200 meters wasn't he 2 and4 well I think he was a 200 and 400 he was um which is unusual someone could win golden both well I'll I'll think of some of the sprinters now the 100 meter men and women they you will find they have a lot more lordosis than the runners yeah they have a and what that does uh I'll just explain the running mechanics here for a minute so if you're running along you have a center of mass you have to bias the force under your feet behind the center of Mass to propel you forward because if it's in front of the center of mass you're actually breaking which wouldn't win you a gold medal so footfall has to occur behind the center of mass and then you get a very brief period of time to create an extensor pulse and then recover the leg if you can pre-t turn the pelvis with a lot of lordosis in the spine you get much more power development behind the center of mass through the extensor range if you have a flatback it's difficult now you've just shortened up the range that you can pulse into propulsive forces a Sprinter turn B the body yeah but you'll notice it's very difficult for a sprinter to kick high so you'll you know I I look at these different forms in the combat athletes if you look at someone who can kick high in a round house they will tend to have a flatter back so combat athletes tend to have a flatter back going back to the runners you'll notice that the Michael Johnson's and the more the runners with more distance have a flatter spine they're more upright and they're tuning that uh uh ability to store and recover elastic energy where where the Sprinter out of the blocks it's horsepower it's concentric and Ecentric muscle pulsing but uh anyway there there there would be uh an example since you you mentioned it with running uh the the style of running the event they're not running isn't running running is very different and again look at the podium winners of the sprinters versus the 10,000 meters very different architecture I'd like to take a brief break to thank one of our sponsors element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium in the correct ratios but no sugar now I and others on the podcast have talked a lot about the critical importance of hydration for proper brain and bodily function research shows that even a slight degree of dehydration can really diminish cognitive itive and physical performance it's also important that you get adequate electrolytes in order for your body and brain to function at their best the electrolytes sodium magnesium and potassium are critical for the functioning of all the cells in your body especially your neurons or nerve cells to make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of hydration and electrolytes I dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning and I drink that basically first thing in the morning I also drink element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing especially on hot days if I'm sweating a lot and losing water and electrolytes if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element.com huberman spelled drink LM nt.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with the purchase of any element drink mix again that's drink element.com huberman to claim a free sample pack I love where this conversation is going because there's tremendous variation in body shape and form out there and I'm certain that by now everybody listening is starting to think about oh am I more uh likely to have a willowy spine a thinner spine or a thicker spine the kind of pliability or um what you call vertical stacking resilience that a uh one spine or the other would have um and it brings me back to this question of what can we each and all do to try and create the strongest back as well as limit the propensity for pain assuming we don't don't have it yet okay so um I would say I'm kind of in the middle I'm neither extremely live nor am I shaped like a you know like a kettle bell kind somewhere in between um so for me I make it a point across my training week to include three resistance training sessions three quote unquote cardiovascular training sessions one long one medium one short cardiovascular session the lifting sessions are geared toward building or maintaining strength in a balanced way for me everyone is going to have different requirements in other words nothing is skewed toward one particular outcome like endurance or strength or power and I think most people probably want something similar because they'd like to be able to meet the various demands of life so I frame the question I'm about to ask that way because as people start to assess themselves the question arises again should we try and compensate for our weaknesses by emphasizing a certain style of training a little bit more and if so what does that look like for the spine you said earlier and I love this quote and I want to make sure I attribute it to you now and going forward that all systems in the body require Stress For Better Health Optimal Health for op thank you for Optimal Health so assuming that somebody has a a a thinner stature they're more bendy would they be wise to build up the muscles of the core um not just the abdominals but the obliques and the lower back muscles you know all around the spine in order to give it more stability and would the person who has a thicker torso thicker spine thicker joints do well to emphasize some additional yoga training um some additional um anything that allows them to be more bendy I'm going to go back to the fact that they're coming to me with pain we are going to figure out through the thorough assessment what triggers their pain most people it's true are don't want ultimate performance they're not being paid $10 million to be able to throw a fast ball or something like that they want to enjoy life let's say they love golf my job is to get them sufficiently robust and out of pain to go and play recreational golf so it becomes a moot point now whether they have a willowy spine or not I will look at their their basic golf swing uh if I can divide that up just just binary uh some people are what we call Twisters they don't have a lot of hip mobility and they twist their spine so it's called The X Factor engulf and they store and recover elastic energy again it it is an elastic athleticism but the next person isn't so much a twister they're a Turner they have what we call Quick hips so their hips turn and their spines don't sustain as much twist and then we measure well when they impact the ball if they have a 100% violent lateral Crunch and then we measure them and assess them and that turns out to be their pain trigger what we do is we don't allow them to go to 100% in lateral Crunch at impact they go to 95% and that just moved them off the Tipping Point so they're not stubbing their toe or slamming into the pain sensitizer just stay off the D sensitizer now so backtracking a little bit but making sure that I'm doing that with purpose you need to know what generates the pain in order to try and localize the pain it all comes back to the assessment but then the goal is not to repeat whatever creates the pain correct perhaps what I'm hearing the goal is to get near the proximity of the pain but not go there not generate the movement that that recreates the pain but you know take the movement as far as one can without creating the pain and then think about where the instability or weakness or biomechanical failure is contributing to the pain okay so now I understand why if I can just add one I don't want to interrupt but this is a good juncture Andrew then we get into the volume of exposure so remember the Tipping Point we can have somewhat of an offense to their former pain but if we do it sparingly that's another key so it isn't a matter of selecting the exercise sometimes as much as it is controlling the volume and then having a period of time off or a d load or whatnot so it may simply be um I've I've got a an athlete that that comes to mind right now in fact I I got a an email it wasn't an email it was a WhatsApp message oh I just won so she said an international tournament today and they play every day but in getting her back it was a matter of we have to do these things that were former pain triggers but control the volume uh you can think of again combat athletes jiujitsu requires a lot of spine mobility and typically Jiu-Jitsu athletes get pain when they use too much spine Mobility what we do is we limit their training in other words they have the skill of jiujitsu but they don't need to push the end range every day because if they do they're in so much pain they can't train so we back off the volume and I could tell you stories about professional football players they were their strongest when they were in college their bodies can't take the heavy strength training once they get into the NFL they don't Squat and deadlift what they used to they're they're they're they're they're they're they're limiting the depth they're pulling off blocks it the game changes and it's not what people think and well and there's some wisdom to to not pushing into pain and extremes all the time if the goal is to have a long Arc of Fitness or athletic career a good friend of mine who's very accomplished in the fitness Community he says one of the best ways to get and stay in excellent shape your entire life is to train consistently train reasonably hard and we can talk about what his recommendation is I'd love your your thoughts but as best as one can to not get hurt you know we forget about this we hear so much about training consistently and pushing hard but the not getting hurt part is is key as well um here's his recommendation on intensity can I share it with you and just get your thoughts yeah okay I have a short attention span can I just put add added value to that don't get hurt getting hurt is tremendously asymmetric let me uh do you know the book by TB Nasim oh Nim TB Nim an antifragile yeah oh an antifragile he quotes our work he quotes my low back disorders book as an example of antifragile medicine interesting anyway um when when you talk to uh uh uh TB in an economic sense if I gave you $100 to invest if you had a 50% gain you'd end up with 150 bucks if you had a 50% loss you'd end up with 50 it's much more hurtful to lose 50 than the relative Jolly you would get of gaining 50 yeah there's some Neuroscience certainly some psychology certainly some Neuroscience to support that right in terms of how we reset our um kind of uh reinforcement threshold right and so it is so asymmetric with injury training if you push is taking a risk you might gain a little bit in short-term resilience or short-term performance but you have a chance of really screwing things up and an injury is really asymmetrically harmful MH so when we work with people and athletes we really try and avoid injury because of the asymmetry of the consequence injury is bad that's the first part that I I wanted to say the second part is people train hard and they feel a muscle burn and and they talk about muscle but they don't talk about their joints and the key to long life is don't mess up your joints you can train hard and build muscle but muscle is adaptive and resilient joints are not so much and if you start messing those up when you're younger by training too hard you'll find that oh I was training at this intensity because I wanted to be strong when I'm 70 and 80 they'll find that no their knees ache they can't get down on their knees anymore they have to crawl up a chair or a wall very sad picture it it is don't mess up your joints so that's an overarching principle to of which the spine is one obviously but uh that that's some wisdom with uh training intensely when you're young don't base the outcome on muscle think about the joints no it's ex excellent recommendations for everyone um his suggestion and by the way this is not for competitive athletes this is just for exercisers uh if you will is to make 85% of one's workouts across the year at about 85% of maximal intensity and output so still constraining the total length of a session to whatever the goal of that session is whether it's resistance training or cardiovascular training but to not go all out to go at 85% of one's subjective understanding of what all out on that day would be on that day to make 10% of one's workouts across the year at somewhere between 90 to 95% intensity of what one could gener that day again 100% all out being subjective for that day and then 5% or even less of their workouts all out everything you could possibly give quote unquote leaving it all on the mat um whatever phrase one prefers and I like that recommendation because it keeps things in check and it also creates an awareness of how intense one is training and it allows us to not um let the great night sleep or the extra cup of coffee that we had or the great song that happens to be playing or the competitive of spirit that's arising because someone joined you that day or asked you to join a workout to take you into the domain of harming yourself in fact I I can look to the times when I've been injured training and almost always it's because somebody invited me to join their workout and we got into a little bit of a competitive spirit and I'm not an ultra competitive person but you know you you push yourself to 100% on that day um and two weeks later you've got something you're dealing with or two days later you've got got something and you go God was that really worth it and I think unless one is a competitive athlete and that's competition day it's probably not worth it right well I'm very sympathetic to the overall sentiment of what you just described but I think it's it's much more individual than that you can take a younger person and drive them quite hard as some trainers do and they have success a young person responds they recover faster Etc you try doing that to a 65-year-old and you'll find that they don't recover as quickly they need many more de lo and rest days so if you go to 85% you just committed to a 5day rest well maybe that's not wise if you went to 50% you only need one day of rest between so do you see how you play and you optimize this and it's like taper what we call tapering down an athlete or you know in my life uh I have seasons uh up until two years ago I rode snowmobiles hard in the winter two years ago I hit a rock at 100 miles an hour on a lake I fractured my spine you can spot the professor so that was my passion I I I had to so my training would start in August every year I'd get into shape to ride sleds fairly uh aggressively I couldn't do it all year Andrew i' I'd become injured so I I would have a cycle of three months getting ready and then really have some fun um but obviously I I I don't do that anymore but my my point in telling that St story is uh I need much more information than just okay 85% you may get away with that when you're 20 to 25 I don't think you're going to get away with that when you're 50 as an example as we optimize performance in our clients uh sometimes you got to leave a lot of gas in the tank because you want to train every other day uh certainly if you do two days in a row 85% there's no way so do you see what I mean it depends on their age their injury history their genetics and their body type and all the rest of it what are we actually pushing to 85% is it a distance on a run is it a deadlift weight uh that's pretty heavy yeah here I'm thinking about intensity meaning um well for resistance training let's say that one could uh complete six repetitions at a given weight um but if they had a gun to their head they could complete nine right um well then you're doing six again this is crude crude calculations right but six maybe seven maybe cheating a little bit on that seventh repetition if it's a run and like for me on Sundays typically there's a long slow jog um but the slow in that component is a little bit subjective so am I pushing a little bit harder than I'm comfortable or am I hitting kind of a cruising Pace right okay so 85% of Max intensity for me would be staying at cruising pace and occasionally bumping up the the speed a little bit um but on allout day if it happens to be one then it's long quote unquote slow distance but I'm trying to increase the speed of what I'm referring to as slow so again this is all very objective but we know on a given day whether or not we're pushing past our comfort zone or not um and I'm not somebody who relies heavily on heart rate monitors and things like that um what I rely on is my consistency this is the way that I've decide to stay in allaround shape for you know more than three decades I feel like I'm in decent shape I'm not a great athlete I'll never be the strongest person in the room or have the best endurance or the most speed or explosiveness but I'm pretty sure I can keep up with most things pretty well and I don't have pain and I feel very grateful to not have pain and I think it's because I've adopted a a stance of um I don't want to call it moderation but of modulation well uh I I appreciate all what you've said in my world everyone has a back pain history so it's always I just let the guy it's it's the information that we gather from the assessment that guides our decision on how we're going to a get the mo of pain build some base resilience which is tuning their body strategic Mobility strategic stability now if if one thing we haven't talked about is is various types of pain and how yet that impacts on how we're going to approach their programming for life you did a podcast with somebody I I can't remember what it what their name was but it was a pain podcast and you were developing this idea that if the mechanism of their pain was really part of the changed engram they were traumatized at at the time of the event or maybe it was a history of sexual abuse or whatever but I can detect that person almost always I'll start to put my hands on them to feel oh is there any intelligy here and they recoil that's an abused person that's a that's a very characteristic response so you start putting together some of these reactions and and you and you note that there's something deeper than an injury to a part of their spine yeah we had um Dr sha Mackey that was it yeah Dr Shawn Macky is our um head of the essentially the pain division at Stanford School of Medicine um he's an MDM PhD and he's a big proponent of the bioc psychos social model of pain which probably makes sense for us to discuss now as the name suggests it incorporates psychological elements it incorporates of course physiological elements and it points to as I recall seven or more sort of paths to dealing with pain some of which include um thoughts about one's emotional state stress level um sleep um I mean all of these things clearly play a role in pain and Rehabilitation from pain right I love that uh podcast by the way because it's so consistent with what we've found and what we do if a person has it was just a mechanical exceeding of their Tipping Point and they now have some tissue damage we address that by creating a strategy that they don't move or load in a way to stress that and we allow the injury to heal if we can and and we should talk about whether the the the disc adapts or you have to manage it but but that's another very interesting topic to get into but nonetheless we are tuning their body with strategic mobility and stability uh giving them core exercise unleashing their hips and shoulders Etc and we will have a reasonable level of success and We Know by the way what our success is because uniquely we follow up with every patient we see to know if we were successful or not but now we have that person and I can think of many examples just to give a spectrum perhaps the person was in a car accident they survived but the person beside them who might have been their mother died so now they're carrying a hell of a lot of emotional trauma guilt trauma maybe they knotted off at the time of the accident they were driving tremendous psychological stress maybe they were sexually abused or whatever that rewires their brain so now they come in and the pain pattern doesn't fit we do physical stressing of their various tissues and the reactions they change their very they're they're they're not what they should be the way that their brain perceives the pain has been rewired if we give them the traditional approach of giving them more Fitness and ability it won't work we can't break through that maladaptive response we completely change now it might be just to desensitize and you'll laugh at this we might get a feather and brush it over further back and they say oh yeah that that triggers my pain really yes oh and now I'm getting a headache okay so we have to come up with what can they do without triggering that maladaptive response and it might be that simply the most simple of movements where the affrant and Ence all the information going into that engram which is forly triggering pain we now figure out what it is that doesn't trigger pain and then slowly desensitize it with repetition never triggering pain and then we expand that repertoire so you've heard of fibromyalgia which is a little bit of a catchall term but a flashing light uh surprising someone they're walking down the street and someone comes out of a shop and and surprises them somehow and that triggers off this massive pain response uh we do that with very gentle love doing the things that doesn't cause pain and and try and slowly expand that engram into a pain-free one there are those in uh what's called work hardening it's usually funded by insurance companies so if you have intransigent back pain we are now going to get you to do your job we start out with an hour a day you're a brick layer you're going to lay bricks for an hour tomorrow you're going to lay for an hour and a half and occasionally they have some success or they have some really miserable failures and the person says I cannot do another day of brick laying for four hours even though it's only a portion of my job and so now they get kicked out of the program because they're called a non-compliant in other words there's something psychological wrong with them and they're shattered those are the people we see so these These are you know talk about the bioc psychosocial approach I I know I get labeled sometimes as the biomechanist and I ignore all the psychosocial but these are people who've never read our work and they don't know it so I really appreciate you bringing this because I'm not a often asked uh this perspective but again I know with your background you'll appreciate all of this yeah surely the you know the nervous system is involved in generating movement and feedback from the muscles and propri reception and uh as you're describing the nervous system uh creates our sense of pain there's an emotional component to it as Dr Macky pointed out and as you're reinforcing and the neural circuits that control quote unquote pain or give rise to pain um involve the Confluence of all of these things at some level and I I appreciate that you're willing to go into this biopsychosocial model of pain and and acknowledge it um because I think all too often in this space of biomechanics and and pain and back pain in particular um people you in some cases get labeled as only subscribing to one particular pattern of Remedy or one particular framework and that's simply not true it's just not true um in fact I'll go so far as to say that that's actually a reflection of other people placing a singular lens on you and your work as opposed to your work having a singular lens I know that you look at things through the um rather complex prism that is back pain and back Rehabilitation um so thank you for touching into the biopsychosocial model and we'll put a link uh in the show note captions to that episode with Dr Macky because he went into this in some some depth and so it it is the case that we've covered uh that model in um in pretty extensive detail there's something that uh you said to me once that I really want to make sure we highlight which is that people who embark on a particular style of training not just sport selection but style of training like resistance training with heavier weights versus endurance training running longer distances or swimming longer distances will sometimes cultivate a certain should we call it personality style or reactivity style that is probably independent of who they started off as I mean you can never separate these things completely I mean we we could argue um people who have a lot of mental endurance pick endurance sports or people that are rather ballistic in their personality here I'm playing psychologist um pick sports with a lot of speed and Ballistic uh motion involved but perhaps the reverse is also true that the more we engage in activities for which the nervous system is required to generate a particular pattern of movement like ballistic movement or endurance or strength that we exacerbate certain aspects of our mental self our emotional self as well I realize this is not the stuff of um detailed peer-reviewed studies necessarily or at least I'm not aware of them but in your experience working with a variety of different people from the general population who engage in different activities as well as athletes who engage in very different activities and let's keep in mind the discussion we had earlier about dog breeds they are selected for not just based on physical fena type and movement but also personality type right temperament what sort of broad correlations have you observed in say endurance Runners do they have more mental endurance for other activities versus say strength athletes or sprinters do they tend to have less but tend to excel in other domains of their mental life you're right in that I haven't seen good science to back up this whole issue but after working with people for 40 years years and seeing the extremes of the phenotype I I do have some opinions on this and it comes from coaching so if you take an athlete who has by Nature they're very explosive neurologically they're quick they're explosive but they can't do it for very long it's almost and and I I hate using this label but it's it's just a way to describe it they have attenion deficit now I've been told I have this every High School teacher would have told you yeah Miguel he's attention deficit is now maybe it was just I wasn't interested in what they were talking about my brain was thinking about something else but I I I think I do have a certain degree of attention deficits if someone's not holding my attention I'm thinking of something that's more important the more explosive the athlete is the shorter the time you have to coach them that they're present with you the less explosive they are the more time you have to coach them so I will say that I find that really interesting um and I can think of a number of self- experiments uh that I'd like to embark on of you know including more endurance training at particular times of year and seeing how that correlates with um mental focus and endurance for say writing or preparing podcasts things of that sort um but of course now that I have some sense of what the answer could be I'd be biasing the the outcomes but if it's a self- experiment and the goal is simply to to shift one's um uh mental life or or behavior then I don't know that it matters that much C can I go with a little anecdote there that you may appreciate I'll get a call from a uh a coach say an MBA coach and it'll be uh with their medical staff and they'll say we have this player they play 18 minutes a game can you help and they have a back pain history could you help us to get them to play 27 minutes a game and then I'll investigate and understand the player and then I I may ask a question to the uh coach what puts paying bums in the seats in the stadium and they'll say well what do you mean and I said well it's that player that we're talking about that player is magical for the 18 minutes that they play because they're Sparky they're explosive if we train them and they have a plastic physiology and neurology that we can train so that they can last 27 minutes you realize that you're trading off the explosiveness you cannot have a really high V2 Max and be maximally explosive they're competing mechanisms one's a fast twitch mechanism for Speed and explosiveness and the other one one is an endurable physiology and you trade one for the other so do you really want to compromise that explosiveness and and you see this when you're uh uh on a team getting a uh combat athlete ready if they are neurologically explosive you design the fight and the training that they pretty much have to win in the first round and if they don't win in the first round they're going to gas out and uh the person who is uh preparing to compete against them is training to survive the first round and then come on in the second so they're training endurance to compare those two different athletes from a psychological point of view uh and if you do it enough I I think you'll come to agree with me and you will notice that there is how you coach them uh it it has to be short consumable bites and and it's not that they're any more or less intelligent they get it but but you have to be on Q and choose your words be efficient do you see what I mean the coaching style changes quite a bit do you think that if somebody has pain that they should have the capacity both to like lean into and push into the pain not exacerbate it but to you know sit with with it and and feel it as opposed to just avoiding it how should people think about their own pain and how to work with it that's the reason I'm asking right it depends and it's a dance so I can give you some examples one one chapter in my back mechanic book it's called well it's about surgery and should you have surgery we did this uh because as you know in our experimental clinic at the University we followed up with every patient we ever saw we would assess them and then we would subcategorize them into different bins if a person was told you've tried everything you've been to the chiropractor you've been to the physical therapist the osteopath you've had a surgical consult uh you've been to the psychologist Etc and you failed every single one of them so basically you've been conditioned to fail we tried a process called virtual surgery so I'm defining the group now you've tried everything and you've been told the last thing for you is surgery that's the subcategory of people that we're now going to talk about and I'll say fine you can go and roll a dice and have surgery most of them don't want it obviously and I'll say but what we're going to do is try virtual surgery and I make a bit of a a production out of it I anoint them like a knight I touch them on the shoulder and I say that's your surgery and I'm looking into their eyes and now I give them one of these we're looking into each other's Soul now you've had surgery you're going to behave like you've had surgery tomorrow your first posts surgical recovery day you're going to lay in bed relax get up for a pee every 2 or three hours have short little shuffles the next day we'll add a little bit more Etc we give you a posts surgical recovery program a really good one and then we start tuning the body strategically stability Mobility eventually adding a little bit of endurance long before strength and then getting the movement patterns Etc if the person was an exercise addict as well so you can imagine the person who has the personality that you're describing they tell me in the interview you know I have to ride the elliptical for 40 minutes every day because if I don't I'm going to murder my kids and my husband because that's my stress relief oh my goodness not not literally but that's what they'll say as a as painting the picture that person a treadmill right or exercise okay so they've won that negotiation with every previous clinician well they're not going to win it with me because all I care about is outcome my job is to get them better by whatever means so uh I have to tame that surgery Works in a lot of cases because it's forced rest surgery for that exercise addict forced them to have rest and allowed them to desensitize so we fake it and we do it now for the evidence we followed up with every patient and in a 2-year follow up 95% of those people who avoided surgery but did the virtual surgery we're glad that they did yeah that answers the question it's uh follow the advice of the clinician and it gets back to this issue of of predisposition to move a certain way to therefore avoid other forms of movement to engage in certain activities but not other activities I I realize that I'll get in trouble if I say you know 70% of the training that we do should be in line with our predisposition and 30% should be uh countercurrent to that but I'm kind of veering towards numbers more or less like that right I mean we know for instance in the um machine learning algorithms that relate to learning in the nervous system that a rough this is a rough estimate of difficulty should be about uh 15% of questions or challenges so these could be cognitive challenges or physical challenges should lead to failures noninjurious failures getting the answer wrong about 15 % of the time tends to optimize learning across a number of different domains okay like is that true for everything is it true for language math dance is no but it's true for a lot of things that's an argument that's used a lot and I I uh however as I said I've I've done the work and I've done the followup and I have an opinion for a reason we start out by giving them the tools to not have pain from a physical point of view uh that's really important from a psychological point of view we've just empowered that person they are now in control because they never had the tools a they didn't understand what the real mechanism of pain was so they had no strategy to downregulate it if I'm a neuroscientist or to desensitize it but now they know with some Precision what the moves the loads the activities are that cause their pain they know the Counterpoint points what actually are beneficial for their pain and they begin this life of having as little pain as possible now I go back to uh the Tipping Point and all systems need stress but in the beginning we cannot cross the Tipping Point and that's really the essence of your question when do we start pushing them now to allow a little bit of pain some people start it way too early we do not we know where that Tipping Point is and we keep building the training capacity of being pain-free until we have a margin of safety now it's that margin of safety that we start to play with can we expand the volume of training and get them ready to go back to work or to go back to their sport or maybe they just want to play recreational golf we've talked about that eventually we're going to go to the point where they're we're butting up against The Tipping Point now now we have another conversation remember what the goal is how important is it for you to set a personal past and deadlift or to play 18 holes of golf 5 days a week would you settle for three and and now they they've had a year of no pain their life has changed they're they're they're they're mentally in a different place uh they have their answer and they they converged on it themselves I'm not 18 I'm 55 years of age I've got two young grandkids I'm looking forward to playing golf with them when I'm 75 so do you see how when we bring them through that way accepting a certain amount of pain that's that's more of a younger person's Outlook there's still some Warriors left a lot of us soften up as we when as we get older but you know I just think of my own journey I trained heavy as a kid and I remember remember my dad saying why are you doing this you're you're you know you're really shortening your athletic career not that I had one but uh you know and uh he was right and now my my training has totally changed but I as you know I I have no pain I I uh I'm I'm still fairly physical yeah you're in great shape at 67 yeah just just remark remarkable shape for those listening and not watching I encourage you to take a look at the top card or the YouTube video I mean stew is moves around great and um and you're I mean well your your posture is great and you're you're an awesome shape for any age um much less 67 um so that's a testament to your methods well the the point was it's okay to push when you're younger you don't have the capacity to push now if I go into pain I'm in pain for a few days not an hour so you're cautious yeah and older people will will get to that point I'd like to ask you about Mill's big three I know that again you loath to um impart generalizations on people but at some point you realized that people need something to do to work with in order to try and quote unquote pain prooof their back or reinforce their back so um we did a video that um included the big three we'll provide a link to those in the show note captions where I perform the big three probably not perfectly admittedly um I I should have invited you to critique my form and we can always shoot another another one of those but I think it captures the big three well enough um the bird dog the roll up and the side plank right um designed to build strength and stability around the spine and to Stave off back pain or some cases rehabilitate back pain an enormous number of people wrote to us and commented how much the big three have helped them so I just want to make sure that it's clear that despite the fact that you are appropriately reluctant to say that the big three is the solution to everything in terms of back pain for everyone they have helped a a large large number of people um avoid and in some cases rehabilitate back pain if you were to add a fourth exercise to the big three what would it be depends on the assessment let's say somebody has a willowy spine and they want more spine stability they want to be able to generate more spine rigidity for whatever purpose what are their pain triggers uh they have a lower back pain on one that's unilateral um and when they sit too long and then stand up it feels like that that side is locked up and there's some pain shooting down the leg okay so they've got mechanical back pain they've got neurological involvement if it's shooting down the leg how old are they early 50s maybe in their 40s or older a big range so they will have some discogenic disorder there's there's a disorder of the joint and uh it will be causing the nerve to react uh in such a way and when they walk a bit 10 15 minutes they tend to feel better ah okay so they have a younger spine because uh discogenic disorders are more common among younger people and sitting is the causitive pathway going for a walk is the relieving pathway but that will switch over when they get uh older is that right yeah sitting becomes the relief and walking then becomes the uh exacerbator of their pain well again I need to know with some Precision what the uh pathway is but if they have neurological uh Parts I need to know why what makes them worse so I might have them sit upright in a chair grab the seat pan of the chair and pull up I'm adding compression does that cause more nerve uh radiation if it does they've got a little bit of compression in toolerance okay so now I have to choose an exercise that is not compressive uh By Nature um if I move the nerve so if I extend their leg at the same time asks them to look up it releases the whole spinal cord and all the nerve roots from above and it pulls it from Below in other words it flosses it through if that causes pain as they're doing it they've got nerve friction if they do it and it's tensile tension then it's it's nerve tension so these are these are very different uh uh mechanisms of their pain and they require different approaches so do you see why I'm still hedging on that that that next exercise it might be mobilizing the nerve it might be giving them more thoracic spine extension through a thoracic uh and now they've taken the load off when they sit and uh stand so you can imagine standing you can palpate your erector spine a muscles and they might be relaxed you poke your chin and those muscles come on and if the but it the cramp was on one side and if it was muscular that's probably not related to this uh that's still a very discogenic sign there's a bulge or there's something off that's mechanical that we will determine I might just say walk more but not in a single dose and and again I've described all of this in in back mechanic instead of walking an hour in one dose have three 20 minute walks walking for an hour increase the risk of getting pain walking for 20 minutes guaranteed you have no pain so do it in three doses you've just guaranteed success so I might add another exercise but I might program it very strategically as well what are your thoughts on um inversion tables and anti-gravity boots um and things to deload the spine right well uh again if you you follow our work we do uh do uh D loading of the spine through traction uh it's usually applied by one of our trained clinicians and the reason for that is let's take that younger person again as you just described maybe laying on their tummy as they exhale they allow the low back to sink into the table increasing the lordosis which is we measured this in the lab if they have a posterior disc bulge with an open Fisher which is probably one of the more common ones the that maneuver Vacuums in the disc Bulch if that immediately reduces the pain down their leg I would say lay prone and have someone pull on your legs along the plane of the table five or six pounds per leg now the next person comes in and say oh that hurts well now we play what we call Jazz this is the art of therapy I'm playing with how we're going to apply a twisting torque to their feet M no no decompression table does all of this it doesn't have the art it's it it it's more of a brutal hammer and to really get difficult people because remember no one has back pain and says oh I think I'll go see Miguel it doesn't work that way we only get the ones who've failed 10 previous attempts every other every other treatment no we've got to know we've got to have some skills here well I started doing the big three on the basis of your book um and it certainly has help my lower right side back pain that occasionally flares up I also noticed I've gotten stronger in various lifts but the most Salient consequence has been when I run I feel like my torso can um uh stay more upright as I can kind of cycle my legs underneath me like I'm pedaling on a bike and I feel like I have endurance for days that's exactly what you should feel so you've improved the cylinder so the diaphragm pumps up and down inside the cylinder to allow you to lung ventilate if you don't have that athletic diaphragm you're entraining your abdominal muscles the oblique muscles to the breathing effort while you're running it wears you out it also compromises your spine so you need those muscles to form a girdle and hold it all together now I know enough of your history that I suspect you will have a little bit of a disc bulge I do yeah I had a whole body um scan right um for just you know for fun I guess is the sort of thing I do for fun and indeed there's a I think it's like an L3 L4 bulge uh on one side which is fully consistent with the the pattern of pain that I've had right um and I've managed to avoid for a number of years now doing um Cobra type pose um these kinds of things the Cobra doesn't work for everybody but it is a powerful vacuum in of certain types of dis bulges so I'm glad it works for you and you found it and it will work for some others or it will make the pain worse than some others and there's tests for figuring that out I notice if I travel and it forces me to sit for long periods of time and then the next day I train with any kind of hip hinge movement it flares up again right don't forget to use your Lumar on the airplane right yes Dr Mill gave me this uh little pillow they call it the Lumar that inflates you putting in the lower back and it's um It's a Wonderful tool right um that gives you resilience for travel if one didn't have access to that um they could just roll up a towel and put in their lower back AB absolutely yeah or sitting in a lecture uh if they're a student travel with it sitting in a restaurant people who go and say oh my back's killing me after sitting in that booth in the restaurant you might get some funny looks but you'll be the person still mobile and not complaining about your pain uh when everyone else is is grunting I'm past the funny looks I'm I'm okay with that that's that's a that's an advanced neuroplasticity trick that comes with age yeah I'm right there with you I have a a question about walking yeah um these days we're hearing more and more about benefits of walking after meals walking several times per day blood sugar regulation I think it's all wonderful anything that gets people moving in healthy ways um I think is terrific when it comes to walking uh none of us want to be the person paying careful attention to our gate especially when we're not in pain and things of that sort but if you were going to recommend a daily walk is there a duration and speed that you think you know could be beneficial in terms of staving off back pain um just you know General posture things of that sort are we talking about a Brisk 5 minute walk or a Brisk 20 minute walk this kind of thing I'm with you 100% with the notion that walking is one of the most healthy things you can do I get stuck a little bit when you want me to give numbers in a generic broad application ranges are fine if I saw the person uh and they have a back pain history I would know uh a should I just leave walking alone and tell them to walk it's quite fine that's not your problem but we still want you to walk three or four times a day but I I I know what the question is and you want some general rules on all of this um don't walk to pain so if your Tipping Point is 40 minutes you can't go and for a 40 minute walk you've just guaranteed that you will be unsuccessful in having a pain-free day but can you walk 20 minutes good walk 20 minutes three times a day now you've got a full hour of pain-free walking guaranteed so it was the exposure and how you dosed it throughout the day um if the person has discogenic back pain they will find that they don't like to stand in one position for very long sit in one position for very long or do any single activity for a long period of time so the the key for their daily regimen is to keep changing posture so something like a sit stand desk desk at work would be a really good idea but now the magic comes if they could sit for 20 minutes stand for 30 minutes and walk for 10 now that was the magic that just of the dosing that uh allows them to do their job as a computer programmer or whatever it is where they're a slave to the computer there's no option so there's an idea uh there um in my own life it's a habit I walk after every meal I walk before I go to bed and that's my time with my wife and my dog and it's it's our routine and it is uh even when we we we travel in the winter we Drive South we break up the drive and we do our walks and uh it keeps us painfree if i s it doesn't matter who you are if you sit all day uh chances are you will cause pain I can talk about damage which is interesting we've probably loaded more spines than any other laboratory in the world I I think that's a fair thing to say if we put a cadaveric spine that is what we call a virgin spine in other words it came from a young donor it wasn't traumatized uh so there's no pre-existing cumulative damage to it if you put it in a sitting posture you cannot create new injury so if a person has never had back pain and I can give you an example you know that the person that they're probably overweight and all they do is sit it's so unfair they don't have any back pain and then their colleague is much more fit they go to the gym every day they have back pain and and and they think this is so unfair but what they didn't realize is they are not training wisely at the gym they they are probably uh going far too hard in a short period of time with too much intensity and they're creating a little bit of microt trauma so now they just made sitting painful so so do you see what I mean you can't injure the spine sitting if if you have no pre-existing injury but if you have pre-existing delamination of the collagen an old disc bulge sitting for a long time will then make it painful if ever there were two exercises that bring to mind Notions of back strengthening and potentially back pain it's the deadlift and the squat what are your thoughts on deadlifts and squats as a function of one 's age one's perhaps phenotype Ecto Endo or myomorph or any other factors that would lead you to say yes deadlift Endor squat no don't deadlift Endor squat or maybe you should deadlift Andor squat okay uh those who know me know it could be any of those three options at the highest level every exercise is a tool and it's a tool to reach a specific goal so in our world of limited capacity when a person is fresh coming out of back pain or they're training to really achieve something physically have they defined the goal and have they chosen the best tool to keep as much capacity as they can for training other things that really matter the deadlift is an an extraordinary exercise and and as you know I I don't know of anyone who's been involved with more world class deadlifters than myself through the back pain uh relationship so you know on one hand I can say well I love the deadlift and on another hand I can say I hate the deadlift I can tell you Andrew that if you take the clients who ask for consults now and they're under 30 years of age I will say half of them will say in their interview with me it started with a deadlift so I would say that is getting onto the category of an epidemic and yet I will still tell you I love the deadlift so there's a lot of variables here a lot of moving Parts the deadlift is a tremendously neurologically dense exercise whether you're lifting a light weight or a heavy weight I love these bodybuilding uh charts that say oh well to do a deadlift it it it lights up the erector spine a the glutes and the and the quads perhaps every single muscle of the body should be involved to a deadlift every single muscle there are no agonists and antagonists every muscle the full fascial complex will be tightened up to take the slack out to pull a bar from the ground that's a good deadlift uh that's what minimizes the risk of injury and as you know competitive deadlifters will actually put on a exoskeleton of even more fascial stiffness it's called a lifting suit but not everybody obviously is uh in that category now I'm going to talk about one of the most potent Pathways to disc herniation so we have the disc from an anatomical point point of view it's a gel core wrapped with layer upon layer concentric layers of collagen fibers that in order to get a dis bulge or a disc herniation they needed to delaminate and the gel nucleus when it's pressurized under a heavy Bend will seek the weak spot between these fibers work through the delamination and create a disc bulge there's been several recent studies now that have done assay investigations of the harvested nucleus in a in a disc surgery more than half the time that harvested nucleus contain fragments of broken endplate broken endplate comes from excessive compression and then you go into the history of the person oh well maybe they fell on ice and they pile drived their back there's a candidate mechanism to create small fractured bits of end plate but then they will say no this whole discernation story it started with a deadlift two years ago my back got a bit Tweaky after that I kept deadlifting and what not and then they find the fragments of bone so more than half of that harvested nucleus shows evidence of an overload and compression when you put that together with with with the history and again it's it's not the fault of the deadlift it's the fault of the progression uh there are some trainers who will take a person from an unfit State through to lifting in a deadlift twice their body weight in half a year when you look at the stimulus to bone growth it takes a lot longer than half a year and when you look at the uh characteristics of really successful deadlifters they're not Young men and women they are people who've trained their body over many years to get that density of bone because that that really is the weakest link uh in a deadlift as far as uh back injury goes so there's something to consider first of all um let's go back to the back pained person now and there are some people who do not perform an assessment and they say oh if you've got back pain the symptom of back pain pain do deadlifts well well hold on a second one of the first things we do after we've assessed them is to try and get rid of the cause that almost always involves teaching them how to bend at the hips and not stressing and creating concentrations in the spine it's called a hip hinge uh then we may put a load in their hands and then we have to assess their hips to determine whether the hips have shallow sockets or deep sockets in other words what's the hip range of motion that will allow you to pick a bar off the ground there are many people who shouldn't be picking heavy bars off the ground uh when you look at the size of an Olympic I call them cookies but a a 45lb plate I suppose uh that was arbitrarily chosen in fact it was actually chosen that if someone dropped the bar uh on the ground your head could fit between the bar and the ground that was where that original size of the came from is my understanding of it people lifting alone quite often is that why oh yeah well there's lots of YouTubes of those injuries but anyway yeah that's uh that's something that I both encourage and discourage people from searching for because it can scare you appropriately but it's also can be traumatizing to see right so now we've put together the idea of uh what Anatomy do they have in the hips and where's the Tipping Point in picking something off the ground we may start to progress the uh hip hinge into a loaded situation if the person doesn't have compressive load triggers to their back pain pattern uh I doubt we'll be pulling a bar off the ground though we will Elevate the bar and put it on blocks so if you come to backfit Pro and you look at our our uh rack that has uh 1300 lb there available to lift if you wish they pull off pins in other words we're we're were matching the height of the pole to their biomechanical Optimum uh in the beginning and then we have to decide is the deadlift the best tool to get them to their goal you know I I did the podcast with uh Peter AA and Peter had a uh a little section on the deadlift and he asked me the same question but he just told me his personal story of conflict and whether he should be deadlifting you know he's had a couple of spine surgeries as a younger man when you know none of us knew better in those days I suppose and my answer was to him and a lot of people took it and I we got a lot of blowback on this that it was a generic answer for deadlifts and it wasn't it was an answer for him where I started to talk about well maybe for yourself why don't we walk backwards up a hill in a monster walk style and you will feel the quads burning how many squats and deadlifts do you really need to do and then neurology comes into this you walk backwards up a hill say it's about 50 yards your quads are burning then walk down to the bottom of the hill and walk forwards up the hill the brain says I'm perceiving exhausted quads let's go get the next in the hierarchy your glutes it's a fabulous stimulator to glutes so there you go I've just found a better tool for a person who has limited capacity deadlift was not the way to go they're going to walk backwards up hill and then they're going to walk forward and really uh feel tremendous exhaustion if that's how they get their jolies and if that's what we need in the athleticism to keep them going and building robustness what are your thoughts on um glute ham raises I'm a big fan of Nordic curls and glute ham raises for the posterior chain to me a glute ham raise folks can look it up is basically a deadlift into a leg curl into a hamstring leg curl except that your feet are um instead of uh being on the floor for the deadlift part you've rotated yourself uh 90° um so that the feet are effectively at the wall right that and from the bottom position up to the parallel to Floor position that's more or less a dead deadlift right stiff-legged or partially stiff legged deadlift and then the rest of the way is the Nordic curl or the leg curl to me that seems like almost the perfect exercise for the posterior chain hamstrings and glutes which is why I do them regularly what are your thoughts about them for back strengthening and for people that are trying to avoid back pain both in the present and in the future it's exactly the same answer that I gave you for deadlifts a it depends and B is it the best tool to reach the goal that is an auxiliary exercise it's not a deadlift it's just challenging a part of the chain involved in the full chain that's required for a deadlift if I go back to some of the criticism after that original uh deadlift statement there was a lot of older fellas who were who were saying you know I love the deadlift when I stop deadlifting my back pain actually increases and uh deadlifting keeps the bogey man away I get it okay that was the right tool for them but I can tell you about the characteristic of those people they will be somewhat unidimensional in their athleticism I will bet you dollars to Donuts actually Donuts are getting more expensive now so that that's that's a poor analogy that worked when I was a kid but anyway ask them to throw a football ask them to swing a golf club I'll bet you the ones who say deadlifts are good for their back pain won't do well in either of those activities so it's a it's a very unidimensional because they can't generate that kind of twist and snap with the uh with the throwing a football for instance like the the stiffening up of the body precisely the right moment and the relaxing of the the arm the flicking and and spiral a deadlift is not a pulsing strength it's a grinding strength and again if you want neurology to adapt to create you know when again I know people don't like when I do this but when I I I love uh athletic examples and I learn so much because it's like a car mechanic working on a McLaren uh and then a dump truck which which carries heavy load and then a Baja eraser which is incredibly endurable because it shows you in terms of engineering and automotive technology what is possible so when you work with a great athlete you learn what is humanly possible so something like a deadlift it teaches the nerves to carry electricity when you measure a very good deadlift it is an exhausting but think of it what is strength strength starts with this thought and now you have to densify that thought then you have to densify the pulse train down through the nerves and you've got to teach the nerves to carry that amount of electrical pulse and you've got to teach the muscles to utilize it so in terms of grinding strength capacity a deadlift is pretty good but does that have to do with most people uh with back pain a few years ago the professional golf Community LED by a few personalities got into heavier lifting now this was rather odd if you go back to the old days of Jack Nicholas and Gary Player and Arnold Palmer do you think they lifted heavy weights and I think Arnold Palmer is still playing I mean some of those guys back when were were known for having a few alcohol sure drinks plus smoking cigarettes on yeah uh on the course but but but my point is the more you deadlift the less you will be able to throw a football and play golf so if your goal in life is to be generally able to enjoy a a a really diverse array of activities be careful on the tools that you choose uh so going back to the the the the pro golfers of say uh 15 years ago when a few of them got into Olympic lifting which is heavy hip mobility down to the Deep squat for the snatch and tremendous uh shoulder Mobility uh and deadlifts not one of them to my knowledge and I know some of them intimately well hit the ball further but they ended up with sore knees and disc bulges essentially really heavily compromising their careers and then a few of them and I've worked with quite a number of them have now backed off that heavy lifting and they have less pain far more resilience and I think they're going to be playing a lot longer for it so I know that's going to create uh some controversy but so be it well that's okay I mean I I've gone on record saying that I'll do and and genuinely do heavy hack squats hack machine squats leg extensions those kinds of things Alternatives that for me have just led to you know progressively more of what I'm looking for when training legs um and and back of course lower back and I do the glute ham raises and I can do all of those without pain um I don't know the last time I ever did a deadlift I I was never particularly strong in the deadlift but if you're telling me that avoiding deadlifts as I get older heavy deadlifts that is is going to help me avoid back and hip pain then you know I'm I'm all for avoiding heavy deadlift if you want first of all I don't put you in the category of high risk for osteoporosis which is mineral loss from your bones through genetics and uh way under the Tipping Point in terms of load stimulation so I'm not worried about that for you so if I was that would justify a he heavier loading regimen for now but as Alternatives uh a rear leg elevated split squat you can do it just with body weight or consider this interlace your fingers put them behind your head become a peacock lift your your your chest up now do the split leg rear elevated uh squats like lunge squats and and you're potentiating the erector spiny and the whole stabilizing me mechanism by pushing up and resisting do you see how I flare do I need to flare my elbows back uh you can do yeah okay now do you see how that just stimulated your whole upper body and the more you push and traps everything light up right you just lit up your whole erector spine a we did all of that without a heavy bar you could do a goblet squat hold it in front now the whole body takes a more upright attitude uh it's more knee load if you want more knee load and less back and hip load or you know a back squat you add more hip and low backload and you take some off the knees so you can band the knees we can really play jazz on this to optimize the best variant to get optimal reward with with minimal risk and that will change as you recover from the back injury it will change with age it will uh change with other coorilos would be uh another example now you've added a balance challenge as you get older your risk will not be mitigated by deadlifts because the biggest risk as you get older is falling that will really change your life as it does in many people do you have the agility and neural dexterity that when you stumble can you get your foot out ahead of the center of mass which is now ahead of the base of support so you're going to fall you got to get that quick so it's hip power quick restr the fall and really mitigate against catastrophe which is that fall so do you see how that changed but can I just finish off with one thing and I want to talk about deadlifts and capacity as well and again it's it's a lesson that we learn from Elite athletes when we have an athlete whose goal it is to set a world record be it in deadlifting or squatting or whatever they can't train maximum deadlifts and squats two or three times a week it is just to exhausting and the recovery period required between training sessions becomes so long they actually lose the peak off the training progress so we do it through auxiliary exercise so when I think of someone like Brian Carroll you know again this is all sort of content validity types of arguments I get it but until someone produces a few more winners I I'm I'm going to stick with the the way our science has shown to go if you train and really push you know you're talking about training at 85% well are you going to set the world record if you only train at 85% probably not but if you go to 100% youve got to take a couple of weeks off so instead you do some auxiliaries like Brian used heavily the belt squat machine which you can really train hips legs Etc tremendous power but it doesn't take or exhaust the whole upper body and back system where you're not loading the spine or compressing the spine that's right because it it you just can't do it so if do you see why you know it's very difficult for me without knowing the person knowing what the goals are knowing what their future risks are is it a bone mineral density issue or is it their knees are getting a bit cranky now or whatever the I I have to choose the most efficient uh tools occasionally it's a deadlift but I also told you that right now there's too many young people influenced by social media who are trying to set oh I'm going to set personal the best in deadlift not really knowing how to densify the neural Drive take out all the slack so when they grip the bar the final squeeze of the bar actually gets the the the bar moving they're breaking it from the floor with they're so stiff throughout their body and they they don't know this yet um and they they end up with a a back injury and and those are longlasting they're hard to recover from you talked about the so-called biblical training week I love this uh it's something that I plan to adopt for myself it's not too far off from what I do now but it's distinctly different enough that I'm excited because it's going to require some psychological adaptation physical adaptation tell me what is the biblical training week and why is it so useful it is the underlying philosophy of how I train now it wouldn't have appealed to me when I was in my 20s and 30s in those days it was all about uh strength power looking good impressive Etc but you know my joints aren't what they used to be uh my training has evolved with my age so the name training uh biblical training week came from the idea that every major religion has a Sabbath day a day off and I I when I was a kid and working with my dad you you didn't do any work on Sunday and that was his day of allowing all the cumulative work during the week to adapt and settle out so it's a very wise thing to do there's six days to train in its basic form two days a week I Strength train two days a week I work on the things that are a bit sticky and not moving moving very well because I'm getting older and I have a few injuries so those are the mobility days two days a week I work on my ticker cardiovascular system things to challenge uh my heart Etc there's more caveats to all of this so I live in a rural setting most of the time uh we heat our cabin I live in most most of the days the week by wood so I have to split firewood if I split firewood I've checked all the boxes it's cardiovascular training it's Mobility training and it's strength training so it's also a lot of power so I've done my training for that particular day but I wouldn't split wood two days in a row I wouldn't strength train two days in a row I wouldn't Mobility train two days in a row so that's another caveat don't do the same thing two days in a row and allow this soreness to really develop into into something another thing that suits me well is routine I try and go to bed at the same time get up at the same time so th th those are the basic tenants of the uh biblical training week the components of each you know I've I've had some neck trauma some shoulder trauma I broke my hip I'm hip replaced uh these are the things that I focus on for strategic uh Mobility uh the strength training is a little bit of bodybuilding a little bit of strengthen patternings so uh patterns of a squat a lift a lunge a push a pull uh Etc so I don't run because of my hips but in the summertime I will swim kayak uh canoe but I'll I'll put a bit of beef into it a bit of effort I ride my bike uh in the winter I cross country ski uh shovel snow is a big part where I live um Etc so those are the uh oh by the way I do do the big three six days out of seven and I didn't really discuss that of why they're essential we didn't invent those exercises but we measured we were one of the few groups in the world to actually measured spine stability in a quantitative way doing the big three was the most efficient way to guarantee spine stability but spare the spine while you're doing it well some people will say well why are you sparing your spine it's allows me to have capacity The Limited capacity to do other things so why why would I waste them all on core training the other thing is we live in a linkage so the spine is a flexible Rod there's no coincidence that either end of your core is a ball and socket joint the shoulder and the hips if I wanted to put P you or an object a heavy door perhaps at the University or at a shopping mall say I could bench press 300 lb well I can't anymore but say I could the bench press muscle is the PEC major let's look at the architecture of the PEC major the PEC major crosses the shoulder joint distal to the shoulder joint to where it connects on the upper arm bone the humorous the muscle contracts and creates the desired push but proximal it connects to my rib cage look what it does it collapses my torso into my shoulder which is an energy leak that is anti- push but if I can use core control and core stiffness and lock down proximately 100% of that muscle activity now goes distally to the athleticism so you may have heard the expression a stronger core makes you stronger throughout your body well how does that work I've just explained to you that when you create proximal control and stiffness it directs the athleticism distally if you want to wiggle your finger quickly you had to stiffen your wrist if you want to wiggle your arm quickly you had to stiffen your upper arm Etc so the mother of all proximal stability is your core in exactly the same way a heavy equipment operator using a backo the first thing they do is they put down the stabilizers which are posts that go into the ground and lift the tires off the ground to stabilize the tractor so that now the arm can be the athlete pulling Earth failure to stabilize you're just pulling the tractor around so core stability is essential for ability and performance it's arresting all little micro movements I'm we're all shrinking you you will notice this probably over the next decade the dis heite is now shrink Ing and there's going to be a little bit more micro movement in the discs is there anything that can be done to offset the shrinking not that I know of hey people will ask with an hanging or uh anti-gravity boots that oh well I've measured that yes it uh will it will increase disc heite for 15 minutes and then gravity and the hydrostatic pressures will cause the fluid flow and the fluid flow there's a little bit through uh laterally through the dis but most of it comes through the end plates so from the vertebral body into the nucleus of the disc and you can draw fluid in under tension but the hydrostatic pressure overrides the osmotic pressure in gravity and then the discs lose all the fluid so it's a 15minute uh effect I feel like every tissue in the body has been the uh Target of an attempt to either restore its more youthful State um or somehow augment its um I don't know resilience over time so these days we hear a lot about FDA approved treatments using so-called platelet rich plasma PRP injected into the knee or PRP injected into an ovary or PRP injected into whatever tissue it is that people are attempting to restore uh youthful state to is there any evidence for any compounds or injectable um drugs that can restore the um tensile strength and thickness to the discs I haven't seen any evidence of PRP doing so now I didn't condemn PRP throughout the body I swear by it for uh stubborn muscle tears interesting in in one example uh ball and socket articular joints uh they it there's no question not all the time but uh it it can make a a measurable difference but not injected into the dis so uh I I just need to give a little bit of a context to this now if we take someone's dis who's never been traumatized so they're a young person uh they can expose their spine to Mobility be it yoga or ballet or whatever and they will probably increase the range of motion and Mobility they can strength Trin and toughen the collagen in the Imp plate and build some bone and in other words they can do both Andrew they can increase the the the con constituent strength of the various parts and they can create Mobility but once you have an injury to the disc and you lose a little bit of dis height the world changes it's not so easy to adapt those full range of athletic abilities anymore so now you're forced to make a compromise most people we can get them to do one or the other they can maintain Mobility to play golf after a disc injury or they want to pop up on a surfboard that's their thing in life they just want to be able to Surf I'll say good we can manage it's no longer adapting we can manage you to to achieve that but you're going to have to back off the dead lifts and uh some of the strength exposures because they will just further compromise the dis heite of a damaged disc and we can do the opposite if you want to strength train and bear a load you're going to have to give up the mobility so that game that Dance with the Devil that comes after the after the back injury so I think the question was a little bit about adaptation uh if you haven't experienced dis damage yet you have a lot more leeway to adapt your spine after that it becomes a game of management and encouraging uh an athletic ability you become a little bit more uni-dimensional and if you want a little bit of everything okay but you have to be very modest you just have to try and Achieve sufficient Mobility sufficient strength to do whatever to just to get through life and it's and it's a bit of a dance so I don't know if that gives a bit of a context that's perfect yeah uh could you walk us through your biblical week training with some examples of what one could select from the buffet of training options right um okay I I can so Le let let's say to today I'm going into our Clinic gym and I will start with uh doing the big three so I will do uh bird dogs and I'm going to work on good form and then I'm going to put some d nism into it uh I don't lift the leg so much I push the heel away and it really causes you to lock the core to create the proximal stability and then pushing the heel Away really engages the glutes and hamstrings then I draw small squares I Square out with the hand and foot down towards the midline and up so now I'm creating a little bit of a disassociation through the ball and socket joints with I want which is what I want with the core or control so that is translatable we did an experiment with the Pensacola fire department by the way where those firefighters who were trained with a coach who explained why they were insisting on certain exercise forms we measured them doing fire ground tasks before the training sessions in other words we measured them uh putting up a fire ladder advancing a loaded fire hose which is a tremendous reactive push as you know uh piking open an elevator door chopping a hole in a burning Roof then half the group trained with this attention to exercise form and we explained the principles to them and then the other uh half of the firefighters had trainers who were more like cheerleaders trying to get them to do more reps and encouraging them both groups got fit and then we measured them all again out of on the fire ground remember now we never trained them how to do the fire ground tasks they went back to the fire ground those who trained with the cheerleader types of oh just do more reps had more known injury markers do you know valgal collapse of the knee is a very strong predictor of future risk of ACL injury being one of them so there would be an example of that um A sagittal plain spine motion under load I mean every study that surveils groups who have to bend down through their spine and pick up more load has a much higher incidence a bill maris's study showed 10 times the risk factor to having a dis injury U if if if you do that so uh I will then do side planks rolling side planks uh I will do a variety of uh abdominal exercises the modified abdominal curl that you're familiar with and I'll do some uh glute uh Bridges MH then I'll do them one-legged and I'll get the arm involved and crossbody um I may put a kettle bell on my belly and do some hip thrusts uh that way but a very mindful way I'm focused my brain on squeezing the glutes uh pushing the feet away uh Etc then I will probably stand up and do the strength patterns so I'll go over and do uh pushes now uh consider a push-up which rather than me load heavy with with a with a bench press or something like that I'll do push-ups you know the Clapping push-up where you dynamically explode up clap and go down I'll do a variety of those very Dynamic power generating pushes then I'll do some pulls uh I probably won't do a row with a barbell but I'll do an inverted row pulling on a TRX pronated grip pulling into him grip power breathing and exploding really trying to get some power into it uh then I will go to um probably a split lunge rear elevated foot uh squat lunge squat with the techniques that I showed you hands interlaced behind my head peacocking high pushing back pulling forward and now doing the the lunge squat so that's that's challenging my balance uh the whole extensor chain uh strength uh Etc I might do some bilateral squats uh with my hips uh I've broken my ankle I do heel elevated squats usually with a banded knee and sometimes I just use my brain and try and spread the floor then I get into the auxiliaries so I broke C4 um I have to uh yeah not not a good thing playing football uh hockey hockey head down into the boards classic anyway um I uh can't really do shearing exercises where I push against resistance that will get my neck a bit cranky so I take out the shear I get tall I push my tongue hard to the roof of the mouth and I Grimace so now I've activated all the flexors and I put my hands underneath and I just push up isometrically and I control so there's no Shear anymore but I've really started to build the flexer uh family keep your neck strong it's important for me yep now put your your chin poking retract now push up you got it that's it push your tongue yeah don't go crazy and add add a little bit of endurance to that I appreciate the neck work that you do though which I have a four-way neck machine but I don't require one I've actually found that taking a plate lying on and wrapping in a towel lying on one side making sure to hook my foot under the wrench and stabilize with my other hand on the ground and then just gently doing repetitions Jeff Cavalier from athl Nex has a great set of videos on this where he really spells out the dangers of things like neck Bridges they can be done but there's a risk there um that probably outweighs the potential benefits for most people right but every once in a while I can't help myself and I do some bridges y i cuz I really enjoy them if you're ler at University of Iowa you're doing bridg for a good while you're probably okay doing neck ridges yeah I get teased for saying this too often but the the value of having a strong neck is just um hard to overstate you don't have to have a big neck but a strong neck for the sake of stabilizing the whole shoulder G girdle excuse me during um pressing and pulling lifts uh for posture um for you know feeling like your head is stably placed on your body think of every pulling motion where does it start the trapezius originates off the neck stack that flag pole and really get those muscles ready to pull it it requires a a stiff strong neck absolutely so every strong puller yeah my Bulldog was alive um he had the larger neck in the house um but it's again it's not about um building size into the neck it's really that strength and stability right that I just think translates to so many things that are valuable anyway I'll finish out my strength routine with some more auxiliaries uh people laugh at this I call it sword play the amount of athletic gain that we've achieved with sword play I take an iron bar like a uh you know the old uh weer dumbbell weight it'll be an iron bar about that long and I'll put maybe a two pound weight on the end and then I grab it and I do figure eights over here over here over here around there you wouldn't believe I have professional hockey players in the NHL who say wow those figure eight sword plays my wrist shot my Slap Shot have two are tennis players I've never had such power and finesse off the racket because of that Sword Play exercise yeah this is interesting um I love older exercise books and recently I came across one called heavy hands this must be from the 70s yeah and the the entire book was centered around people being encouraged to carry some dumbbells during exercise not all the time and doing some lunges or walking uphill and getting the weights out from their body and um and I was kind of chuckling about it on the one hand pun intended but at the same time you know we know based on a number of really good studies using neuroimaging and functional scoring of neural system function as one ages that the ination of some of the distal muscles and the fine control of the the digits you know fingers and toes and foot uh foot uh toe spreading and things like that um even calf size and atrophy um are Fairly reliable markers of the extent to which there's been degeneration of the upper motor neuron Pathways um other brain areas or not so the idea of keeping the nervous system and neuromuscular connectivity youthful by quote unquote heavy hands or maybe ankle weights provided they're not going to induce injury makes a lot of sense waiting the most distal portion of our body um in order to generate adaptations I think is going to be something that returns to the uh kind of modern uh sphere of of fitness and Longevity may I give you a couple of comments please that was fabulous it's so much fun when I see someone getting out of their car and and walking up to the clinic door and I can see the muscle wasting on their calf and they'll say oh I have to get out my EMG uh nerve conduction velocity scores here I said are you kidding me you telling me the doc needed to do an EMG conduction velocity and all they had to do was look at your leg we know exactly the nerve roots that are deficit because I know exactly what serves those muscles that have wasted I mean it's it's crazy how technology has made so many people oblivious to the signs that we all show that was my first comment but the second one was going back to the oldtime books I collect a lot of those actually uh I have quite a library of the old time strength books from some from the 1800s the old inch book of strength and oh they're fabulous uh Indian clubs are you familiar with Indian clubs so it's a wooden club that looks like a bowling pin basically but some of the old style Indian clubs were this long well there's uh a great manual strength athlete that not too many people have heard of uh John Brookfield he lives in North Carolina Pinehurst North Carolina in Pinehurst there's a sculpture a very heavy steel that johon bent with his bare hands to make this sculpture with and yeah he'll he'll take heavy rebar and bend it and you know put on strength shows with his hands he's fabulous fell too by the way I uh he's he's got a set of Indian clubs I can hardly pick one up but he just picks up this Indian club and it was from some famous guy from the 1800s and somehow he got the the Indian clubs and they're about this long but he can just get them and play sword play with very heavy Indian clubs there's actually uh a good friend of mine he's an Australian fellow Andrew Lock I don't know if you've ever heard of Andrew Lock and Andrew has collected kettle bells and Indian clubs from the oldtimers he's got quite a a lovely collection in Melbourne where where he's from in Australia but uh they're wonderful exercises and none of these things require fancy equipment one could imagine just grabbing a hold of some either well an iron bar an iron bar yeah I really think there's something to this loading of the distal limbs um cautiously right properly but there's something there in terms of keeping the neural Pathways healthy and Alive because we know they atrophy with age and that explains in part the the calf muscle atrophy which as you point out is a well-known clinical marker for neurod degeneration yeah um well simply things and you can certainly comment about this I try and do things with my opposite hand so today I'm just going to brush my teeth comb my hair with my opposite hand now don't ask me to throw a a ball because I'm a but you know if I'm splitting firewood okay it's 10 reps this way 10 reps that way uh and that that's all in an attempt to keep my brain as uh movement competent and dextrous as possible well certainly when I resistance train if I'm doing anything standing I make it a point to um stagger my stance yes um and at the same time to make sure that my belly button is pointing forward so that I generate some anti-rotation um effort uh so that most of my abdominal work can be um placed within the workout for other things I do some Pikes and some direct abdominal work as well in the roll up and and things of that sort that you've recommended but I find that um from a coordination standpoint and especially from a balancing the musculature and the strength on both sides of the body this is extremely important and I know this because after years of skateboarding where you push with one leg that was when I was younger um boxing I'm traditional stance as opposed to Southpaw you know you start getting into all these imbalances um that and it goes Way Beyond anything aesthetic I mean the aesthetic stuff is might concern certain people but it was more the feeling that I could turn to my right very easily without pain turning my left I felt stiff and it was just a imbalance in um some of the muscles controlling uh anti- rotation so I think that weaving asymmetric stance weaving um the requirement for symmetric balancing of the musculature on both sides of the midline just makes you know all the sense in the world to me uh especially if one is going to be a regular exerciser which hopefully people are well if I can convince you to uh consider the biblical training week all of that fits into your Mobility days yeah let's talk about those because you talked about the strength days what about the two days of Mobility well G given my history I do thoracic spine extension MH I do a little bit of neck work uh hip mobility but again I have a a certain capacity there that I can't uh overdrive and then uh once I've done the targeted ones I just go through the motion of of every joint and uh don't add load and then I will do uh the footwork so with my background I'll do a little bit of Shadow Boxing I'll play uh uh traditional Southpaw um Etc if you could just repeat the cardiovascular days since in depend on the time of year of I I I really like to be outside so if it's winter time and uh I for some reason couldn't go for a cross country ski that day or whatnot I will ride a stationary bike in in the clinic I'd prefer not to but I will uh if it's summertime I'm riding outside and uh uh I could uh kayak swim canoe um just go to the Hills and walk with Tico my dog hard and that might be my cardiovascular uh that day and uh going back to the genetics which is how we started this uh uh podcast uh have you ever had your athletic panel done from a genetic base in other words they look at your genes and determine what you're genetically good at and what you're genetically horrible at do you know that I mean I know a few things that I'm horrible at but you haven't had it tested genetically no okay I have and they gave me a panel of 10 athleticism now interestingly enough if I didn't have my athletic panel and you just asked me to check am I good at this or am I bad at it and check somewhere in between I would have got every single one 100% right interesting yeah so I know my abilities and it aligns 100% and other words I'm ultra which is the highest for grip strength I always knew that you know they're a pair of hands but if I got my hands on you in football you weren't getting you know what I mean I I've always had a very good grip strength so genetically that came through was Ultra and the other thing I was Ultra at was I can be quick for the first 35 milliseconds boom if you want something done like that I I can usually pop it you know when I was playing hockey uh you typically it's a 45502 Anor robic blast and you sit down for 3 minutes there's two more shifts and then the coach Taps you on the helmet and I'm still breathing heavily and my two line mates they're they're ready to go again I was terrible at recovering from an from an athletic anerobic blast guess what I'm the worst possible genetic category for Recovery of uh uh heart rate and I you know i' i' I've worked with some of the best heart rate recovery uh people and I'm hopeless at it I have a feeling I'm naturally inclined to do endurance work because once I start running distance I can just run and run and then eventually it just feels like the um the stopping comes from you know I don't know some nagging little injury or something like that or pain as opposed to anything stopping me from continuing to run which is unfortunate because I tend to like the the shorter workout type stuff right it brings us back to what we were talking about earlier uh try and do a balance of of those um and everything in between I love the biblical training week and given that currently I've been doing three days of resistance training total per week and three days of cardiovascular training all it requires is Shifting one each of those days toward Mobility training still taking the full day off each week make sure you take that day off you will be less painful with your joints I predict when you're going into your 60s and 70s and knock on wood having a blast when you're 80 that's the plan and I've certainly had a blast today Dr McGill this has been amazing I mean you've given us such a wealth of knowledge about the back it's Anatomy neurology the sources of pain for those that have back pain Avenues to relieve back pain avenues for people to Stave off back pain including the big three but not limited to the big three you also gave us a wonderful window into the Precision with which you approach assessment and during the introduction and also in the show note captions um I mention and link to the many clinicians that you've trained all over the world so that if people want to try and access um direct coaching and Rehabilitation they can do that I also really appreciate the books you've written and we linked to that as well um back mechanic and I really just appreciate your Devotion to public education through your own channels through your students the many many many many peer-reviewed papers that you've published I mean I can't overemphasize this enough you have a you know vast number of highquality peer-reviewed Publications in these areas and um it's just wonderful to sit across from somebody who's devoted their professional life to this really important area that so many people confront whether or not they be athletes or conventional exercisers or just people who are experiencing some pain or want to get in shape or all of the above so on behalf of myself and everyone listening and watching watching I just want to

Transcript Language: English
So it's very clear that smoking, vaping, dipping or snuffing is bad for skin appearance and health. Bad, bad, bad. Every dermatologist said this. Why? Well, with smoking, you can imagine why, okay? A lot of carcinogens and toxic end products generated from smoking, even from vaping. Yes, even from vaping, it will make your skin age faster, that's clear. But it's also the substance itself. Why all of those things, in addition to increasing inflammation, nicotine itself is a vasoconstrictor, so you're doing the exact opposite of what you want when it comes to skin health and appearance. And that's why people take things like BPC-157, that's why people take nicotinamide, that's why people are trying to improve the hydration status of their skin. So if you're somebody that's vaping nicotine, or even taking nicotine in some other form, pouch or smoking nicotine, and you're interested in having youthful-appearing skin, you are really shooting yourself in the, I don't know, face?
