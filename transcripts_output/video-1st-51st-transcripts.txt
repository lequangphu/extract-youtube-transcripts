Transcript Text:
The way that I've been looking for my optionality is in alt beta. I think that some of these altcoins are I I think we may have a selective alt season if Bitcoin starts to rip. And I I think certain assets will drastically outperform uh Bitcoin. Most alts won't, but I I'm looking for a couple that will. And my heristic like basically you and I talked about Hyperlquid on that awesome podcast we did with Felix on the lows. I bought some and ever since I bought it, uh, I've been kind of pacing around my office trying to defend or try trying to poke holes in the idea that a project like Hyperliquid that takes 95 plus% of its fee profits and dividends them back to users in the form of token buybacks. I'm saying like I'm trying to understand why that's any worse than owning equity in a great company. And I haven't been able to like basically it's almost better than owning equity in a great company. It's it's like owning equity in a company that gives you a pro that basically takes their net income every year and just dividends it out prorata to the equity holders in a profit share style fashion. Um, and so it's like I think fantastic businesses that are anti-fragile and benefit from volatility. Like the best business in crypto is an exchange and this exchange like the token is linked to the project via buybacks and if we get a crazy Bitcoin move like let's say you're right. Let's say we get a volatile move up past 100K. People will be trading their their balls off on Hyperlid and fees will go through the roof. And I think there's sort of like a reflexive buyback mechanism in there that will help pump your bags in addition to just the general rising tide lifting all ships in crypto. So I think that like one way to play a rally is to buy IBIT calls or call spreads, probably just calls because the V is low. Another way to play it is to take projects that are showing relative strength to Bitcoin right now for good reason like Hype. Um, hung out with the chief last week. Uh, he towilled me again. Tow's TA's looking good. Looks like some good some good trading teflon. Like I think that one might be a good one. Um, Salana maybe. Uh, I mean really I'm looking I'm looking at Pendle Hype and Tao. Yeah, those are those are I think my I'm I think you might get an option like move in those. short short ETH long these things and just wait six months and be up 100%. I think it's the right the right trade. I mean ETH again I won't beat a dead horse. It's [Music]

I think this time what emerges from this cloud of of crap is going to be Bitcoin and a very small handful of solid projects that will probably perform for the next few years. I think that I think retail is finally tapped out of memelike investing. This episode is brought to you by Kraken OTC. Get access to 247 trading services for high- netw worth individuals and institutional clients to execute orders over $50,000. You'll hear more about them later in the show. [Music] Hey, nice to see you. Welcome everyone to another 1000X. I'm pretty happy today because the market's down 3%. Both NASDAQ and S&P, but gold is up 3%. And that means my portfolio is doing pretty well and Bitcoin's up, which means that my portfolio is doing even better. You know, things are things are kind of heating up. I mean, this is this is one of those scary moments for people that hold equities where equities are just slowly grinding down. They're melting lower. But the market is acting kind of how you would expect it to, right? So there are two types of equity selloffs. There's the everything selloff where people are just deleveraging their book. And in that world, you just open up your trading view and you're like, "Holy [ __ ] why is literally everything red?" And then there's this kind of sell-off where there are things that are up and equities are down which just means that there's reallocation happening which is much scarier than just an everything selloff for equity holders at least. I don't know. I'm I'm feel I'm still you know in the last podcast I said that I shifted my portfolio to gold that I was giggle bullish on gold. That seems to be playing out. market seems to be terrified uh right now of you know holding holding equities which I think is reasonable given the environment but uh you know there there are pockets of opportunity I don't know Jonah Jonah what are you seeing yeah I mean the the gold is just ripping like a like a real like an alternative uh crypto asset let's say uh it it doesn't look like a you know $25 trillion asset. It's It's not It's not pricing like that. It's pricing like a micro cap that's ripping in some sort of alt season, which is bizarre to see because, you know, gold will put in decades where it just does absolutely nothing or underperforms everything else. And then you get one of these and like you said, um, you know, makes you think twice about the stability of global markets. And, you know, there's this acronym, it's it's called TINA. It stands for there is no alternative. And that acronym has historically applied to the S&P 500 because you know like institutional capital is just starving for places to park cash. It's their job and frankly there's really not a lot of options. So the S&P 500 has been this fantastic place to park capital for a very long time. So, when it when it like sells off briefly and then does a quick V-shaped bounce, um, you know, allocators can feel okay about leaving their money in stocks, but this isn't a V-shaped recovery that's happening. It's starting to like bottom out. I don't know. We could talk about letters like L-shaped or U-shaped, or maybe it's just a freaking bare market like you said. Maybe the whole thing's the bottom's about to fall out. So, allocators are spooked. And since there is no alternative to equities really, you know, they're searching for anything right now. And anything that disconnects to the upside, obby becomes an alternative in an environment like this. So gold started decoupling to the upside, you're not going to get fired for buying gold, right? So the fact that it decoupled to the upside created a momentum, a rally begat another rally, and so on and so forth. and gold has just started pushing higher. I think gold is previewing what's about to happen to Bitcoin because ultimately um allocators are scared. Bitcoin is the only other you know you can't be like maybe you Avi can be 100% in gold but most institutions can't. So, you know, once you've got once you're maxed out on gold, what else do you diversify into that's sort of decorrelated from equities in gold? Like, historically, Bitcoin's been correlated with equities, but now it's starting to not be. Uh, and that's that's been really amazing to see Bitcoin outperforming. So, if you go to our favorite trusty chart of Bitcoin over NASDAQ, I I prefer IBIT Spy because they have the same clothes. Oh, I could do I bit do do whatever you want. I like the Bitcoin chart just because I can see the history, but I do agree that now it's cleaner to use IBIT. Bitcoin over equities is at they're at the highs. Yeah. I mean, that that ratio is literally at an all-time high. It's ne it's the only time it was higher than it is today was one day which was Monday January 20th which was when Trump got elected and Bitcoin put in that crazy candle or Trump got you know sworn in whatever. Um that was uh then then we started trending down for a bit and now now now we're back at the highs. I mean, the the level of relative strength that Bitcoin is showing tells you a lot about what's going on. It tells you that Bitcoin is decoupling from equities because people are viewing this as a digital gold right now. I mean, I think in my mind, there really only two reasons why Bitcoin is trading the way that it is. The first is that you still have idiosyncratic buyers like Sailor that are in the market. and that's keeping it up. But the second is people are done selling because of equities. Like whatever whatever happens to equities at this point, unless there's a complete and total collapse, uh you know, I I think it would probably take another 10 15% down in equities to to trigger this. Bitcoin's doing just fine because the people that are selling on equity weakness and tariff warries and and all that stuff about short-term liquidity hits and repositioning, they all got out when we had that uh massive flush down to 74. So now people the people that are holding Bitcoin are are kind of just in it now. Uh and there's no real reason to sell. And there's allocation happening because of this new global dynamic that you know we we've discussed at length the last podcast which is why I'm bullish gold but just to reiterate in a in a multi-olar world crossber assets not tied to a state become a lot more valuable. Yeah right. Um you know the US the US dollar is devaluing right now against the rest the rest of the world which is kind of what Trump actually he wants that euro dollar is 115. That's crazy. It was trading basically at par uh a couple months ago. Well, you understand that's really that's really good for Trump because you know if if if the dollar if the dollar weakens and Americans have to buy uh you know more goods from America that's that's a good thing. Yeah. Trump and and his and his tariffs makes American goods more competitive. People are he's all about that trade deficit, right? Yeah. And trade deficits will go down if the currency goes down. So, if that's his metric, you know, he's getting what he wants. People are saying that the United States is trading like an emerging market uh right now. Um I don't know if I buy that, but yeah, like is there any is there anywhere that's not trading like an emerging market by that metric? I It's a great point, honestly. Like, yeah. I mean, honestly, yes, it kind of is, but the whole world is. Yeah. I mean, like maybe Switzerland is trading like uh a flight to safety market, but yeah, I mean, I don't really I just think we're entering uncharted waters. I still think that the beast that Trump created is one that he can control. Before we get to that, like you brought up a really interesting feature, which is that Sailor has been buying all the way down. What was his average print? Like 84 $85,000 a his his average buy of all Bitcoin is now almost $70,000, which in my opinion is scary. I mean, this guy this guy really needs to stop. Yeah, I think I I think he really needs to just stop. Somebody somebody should give Sailor a call and say, "Hey, man. Uh there's actually something called being too much of the market." Yeah. I mean, he's gone a little bonkers. You You've been, you know, a a vocal fan of his financial engineering. I guess technically if the underlying business that he's got at Micro Strategy is enough to service his debt, then he's not gonna get stopped out, but somehow these sorts of things always end badly. It just it my gut feel like yours right now is a little bit uncomfortable. Yeah, I don't like it either. With that being said, one trade that if you're not on the institutional side, you're probably missing or you're just not paying attention to is that there are a lot of private placements going on right now for Micro Strategy competitors and competitors not just in the US market but in other markets. So, if you I don't know if you've heard of Metaplanet. Uh, MetaPlanet is Yeah, Meta Metanet is in Japan and it is buying Bitcoin like a madman. Kind of like MSTR. It is now the world's 10th largest corporate Bitcoin holder. Uh, they've stated they want to acquire 21,000 BTC by 2026. And the trade's been going nuts. I mean, these guys the these guys have done very well. Uh, I mean, their stock price has done very well. And there was a private placement and people are up like 70x on that because they basically launched at a low at basically flat premium and now they're trading at a massive premium to NAV because I think everyone has looked at the MSTR model and they're starting to say wait a second. There is a tremendous amount of appetite in the market for nonreourse leverage on Bitcoin. And that's really what I think MSTR is at the end of the day is you you you buy it and it accumulates more Bitcoin over time and hopefully the premium blows out because people think that it's going to keep accumulating Bitcoin and there's going to be there's going to be even more demand for that non-reourse leverage. People are like wait why are we letting Sailor take all the money? Why don't we go launch our own versions of this? There's another one uh called Meluse in Brazil. Um, there are there's a Salana one that just that just launched that just announced that they're launching. Uh, and I personally wouldn't be surprised to see a lot more of these projects go live. Uh, potentially, you know, even at a much larger scale. I mean, most of these are between 50 million to 400 million. There could be a couple billion dollar ones launching because there's really no reason to let Micro Strategy like play this game alone. Like, why not? I think that's that's that's starting to happen, which is very bullish for Bitcoin. Very very bullish. I have no take on the trades themselves. Uh especially if you're buying them on the open market. I mean, I have no idea if you're going to make money. Uh but a lot of these private placements, I think, are probably reasonably good trades. You just have to poke around uh to try to to try to to try to find them. And you know, you got to be a big check, you know, one to five million in them. But that's what's happening because people realize like we've talked about, hey, this financial engineering from Sailor is pretty damn good. Maybe we should get a slice of the pie. And I think that's going to continue. I mean, you saw GME doing it now. Um, basically, I'm I'm like I'm I'm I'm bullish on Bitcoin, not just because, oh, decoupling from gold, blah, blah, blah, global macro. Like, there there's a genuine flow dynamic here that's helping Bitcoin out. This episode is brought to you by Kraken OTC, one of crypto's longestr running exchanges with over a decade of experience.

I mean, there are whales in gold, too, right? Like, who's the big whale in gold right now? And who started this whole rally? It's the PBOC, the People's Bank of China. They're divesting US uh USissued securities for obvious reasons. And you know, to the whole point about TINA, there aren't many places you can go. Uh gold is is one extremely viable place. And China, when it participates in commodities markets, including gold, understands that it has a lot of pricing power. When they stop buying, prices go down. and they continue buying, prices go up. So, they probably know full well that they're just going to be pumping their own bags for the next uh 5 to 10 years as they divest from US securities and roll it into gold. Um, so that's I I'd say I feel a little more comfortable betting on the PBOC as a whale in a, you know, in a precious metals market than I do betting on Michael Sailor in the Bitcoin market. However, like Bitcoin is just at an earlier stage of where gold is at now, right? Like gold probably started on a lot of corporate balance sheets for thousands or maybe hundreds of years uh when it was when it was basically the global reserve currency and companies needed to stack it in order to transact and manage it in their treasuries. That's kind of what's happening with Bitcoin. you know, a few forward-thinking companies are saying, "Hey, like this is the non-s sovereign money of the future. Uh, let me have some on my balance sheet. I can, you know, I think if you're going to invest in one of these private placements, it's really just it's really just high-grade or maybe high yield credit analysis, you have to be able to go into the credit the issuer of these debt securities and understand what their cash flows are. And if you're, you know, an a seasoned financial analyst and you're good at this stuff, maybe you work in equity research or investment banking or you have some background as a consultant or you went to business school, you should be able to tell um whether or not these companies are a going to be able to service their debt obligations uh for the de the debt they raised to buy Bitcoin and b whether they're required to do so by covenants or not and whether they can just take your money and rug you or whether they're lit legally required to um you know service their debt with cash flows from the existing businesses and if you know boxes A and B are checked then uh you basically just have to it just comes down to the valuation. Are you buying at a smart or a stupid valuation? And you know, honestly, it's it feels a little bit Ponziish, but then again, so is gold, right? Like, uh, ultimately, you know, we talked about this maybe 50 episodes ago, but look no further than the the um the money exhibit at the British Museum to see the nonsensical things that people have ascribed value to and means of exchange to over the over the centuries, right? Like why why not Bitcoin? And I think ultimately um we will I think the real bull moment will come for Bitcoin when uh the asset class graduates beyond the naive bouquet and the Michael Sailors and the um these other sort of debtfueled buying instruments out there and and graduates kind of into the world of like the US starts accumulating Bitcoin on the open market for a strategic reserve. the European Union starts uh buying Bitcoin on the open market for a strategic Bitcoin reserve because it becomes clear that that in a multipolar world um sovereigns are overallocated to the US dollar for global trade and it feels like we're getting like and I would have thought that point would have been like it would have come extremely gradually over 20 years but it's starting to happen quite suddenly because of these tariffs and in macro investing you really have to watch for decouplings like this. Like this may be the first time that um crypto has decoupled from from stocks in a bare market since is it ever. You know what's interesting is that normally the way that crypto decouples is that it bottoms first and then it it sort of rallies out harder from the uh you know from from the equity markets like the equity markets will go down a little bit more maybe for like a few days to a week and then they'll they'll rebound but Bitcoin's already already rebounded at this this point. That seems kind of not that actually is not really what hap is happening right now. Yeah. Um, Bitcoin bottomed on Monday, April 7th. That's same day that NASDAQ bottomed. And then you had that massive move up when the tariffs were reversed from NASDAQ. And then NASDAQ started bleeding out again, but Bitcoin didn't kind of held, right? Right. And that's a little bit of a different dynamic than what I was describing before where you know you you still have the straight line down in NASDAQ but Bitcoin started started to go up. This is Bitcoin showing relative strength um not bottoming first if that makes sense. I I think there's actually there's actually a distinction there which is a much more powerful indicator. Yeah. Because then it's a hedge. Then it actually like then for the trillion or tens of trillions of dollars worth of equity capital out there, Bitcoin instead of just being like a correlated thing that moves first becomes something that protects your equities. Nobody wants to sell their equities. We all believe in human innovation. We all believe in the American market, right? Like nobody actually wants to say, "All right, this is it. End of the empire. It's over. You know, it was a great experiment, but you know, let's get bearish stocks until they go to zero." That nobody's gonna make that bet because it's just been the worst bet ever. and probably will be proven terrible again. We just don't know when it's going to bottom out. What the world is looking for is a hedge. And if bit the second Bitcoin proves it's a hedge, oh my goodness, Avi, this is it's going to get silly. It is going there's just not enough C. Like gold is so much bigger than Bitcoin. Bitcoin could get silly if it becomes an institutional equities hedge. I 100% agree with that. And the f the like the the takeaway because I want you guys to always think about trading and you know how to make money and not just pontificating about macro is I think that means that the tales on Bitcoin are really underpriced right now. And if you wanna, you know, I'm not I don't trade options a ton um because I I only do it when I really have edge, but Bitcoin VS for the end of the year are sitting in the mid50s basically all the way up to 170K. I think I think that's a lift personally. Like I I I think I think you know and this probably What's the deck 31st $170,000 uh strike call cost? It's $3,000. Oh, that sounds cheap, right? That's kind of what I'm saying is like it's not I mean may maybe I I personally think that this happens that this happens sooner rather than later. So it's kind of a now it it happens now or it doesn't really happen like we get from at least from this particular decoupling moment we get a really big boost in the next two two to three months. So really I'd be looking at like 100k you know I'd be looking at June 27th 100k and that you're looking at 3.5K. If it goes to 100 120K, I mean, that's a solid 6x for you at a pretty Well, it's more the VA would rip if it were Well, yeah. I mean, I'm talking like at expiry, right? Like if if if at expiry terminal value, it would you would 6x. Um I mean, yeah, I think I think you could you could probably make more if it obviously happens very quickly. I think you would your money if it hit 100K. Like I think it like let's say that in a month it's trading 100K. I think the V would be so high that you would have 6xed your your initial investment. That's my options trader intuition and that makes it I think a very a very attractive play in my mind because people for some reason are not you know and and that V is like 50 vol which is pretty pretty damn low. Um yeah, 50 V is uh I mean that's like somewhere between oil and natural gas just to compare it to real world assets. Um equity V tends to be I guess the VIX is trading what is it that's pricing in a 2.6 just did the quick math pricing in a 2.6% move a day. Yeah. Which is pretty low. I mean if today we're up two and a half%. Yeah. But VIX VIX is at 34, man. Yeah. Like what worries me about getting Bitcoin options are are a really nice trade right now. If if you want to express bullishness on BTC, I really love BTC options. I I agree with you. I I'm not disagreeing with you, Obby. And I think that if uh BTC options are a little bit tough for you to access um or you feel uncomfortable trading on that was that was what I about to say. Yeah, go and trade some IBIC calls. I think that that's uh those are those are super liquid. Um, I you know, honestly, the way that I've been looking for my optionality is in alt beta. I think that some of these altcoins are I I think we may have a selective alt season if Bitcoin starts to rip. And I I think certain assets will drastically outperform uh Bitcoin. Most alts won't, but I I'm looking for a couple that will. And my heristic like basically you and I talked about hyperlquid on that awesome podcast we did with Felix on the lows. I bought some and ever since I bought it, uh, I've been kind of pacing around my office trying to defend or try trying to poke holes in the idea that a project like Hyperlid that takes 95 plus% of its fee profits and dividends them back to users in the form of token buybacks. I'm saying like I'm trying to understand why that's any worse than owning equity in a great company and I haven't been able to. Like basically it's almost better than owning equity in a great company. It's it's like owning equity in a company that gives you a pro that basically takes their net income every year and just dividends it out prorata to the equity holders in a profit share style fashion. Um, and so it's like I think fantastic businesses that are anti-fragile and benefit from volatility. Like the best business in crypto is an exchange and this exchange like the token is linked to the project via buybacks and if we get a crazy Bitcoin move like let's say you're right. Let's say we get a volatile move up past 100K. People will be trading their their balls off on Hyperlid and fees will go through the roof. And I think there's sort of like a reflexive buyback mechanism in there that will help pump your bags in addition to just the general rising tide lifting all ships in crypto. So I think that like one way to play a rally is to buy IBIT calls or call spreads, probably just calls because the fall is low. Another way to play it is to take projects that are showing relative strength to Bitcoin right now for good reason like Hype. um hung out with the chief last week. Uh he towilled me again. Tow's TA's looking good. Looks like some good some good trading teflon like I think that one might be a good one. Um Salana maybe uh I mean really I'm looking I'm looking at Pendle Hype and Tao. Yeah, those are those are I think my I'm I think you might get an option like move in those like short short ETH long these things and just wait six months and be up 100%.

A great trader once told me, you know, I spent most of my career trading options. That was my bread and butter. You're never supposed to buy options unless you expect the market to move fast, right? And this it's very rare for markets to move fast and usually they move fast to the downside because everybody's long and then there's a panic. Those panics are very difficult to predict and so buying puts puts are expensive. Puts skew always trades at a premium to call skew. It's kind of a losers game. I don't like buying puts. Uh I really like selectively buying calls in scenarios like this where for once in a blue moon both of us do expect the market to have a reasonable probab reasonable probability of moving fast to the upside and that that would be uh again just for everybody listening it would move fast because of institutional investors piling into Bitcoin and sovereigns piling into Bitcoin as a hedge against their US equities. Um I think if it's going to happen, it's going to happen in the next three to six months max. Yeah. And this is Yeah, basically I agree with you. I I I personally think that 88K, which is where we are right now, is just an unstable price. Yeah. It just doesn't make sense for Bitcoin to hang out here. Either we are both completely off base. It's possible. Um, and Bitcoin is just being supported by Sailor and like one other player and once they're done, I mean, Sailor announced that he was done this morning, but once the other guy's done or whoever is buying is done, then it just collapses. Or there's a genuine repositioning happening here, which is more of the camp that I I lie in and they're genuine flows that are coming in and Bitcoin is much higher very quickly. Yes. So, you know, but one one one way or the other, I mean, like one one way to play this is maybe maybe you buy some 74k puts and buy some 100k calls. I mean, if you know you were you were weak and a scaredy-cat, you could do that. You know, if you're if you're strong like an aux, you could just buy the calls, but up to you. I I I prefer not. I like I I'm so allergic to buying options. I spent most of my life selling them. I think that uh Theta is the silent killer. You shouldn't buy, you know, bet on too many things happening at the same time. Fall's not that cheap. You know, like cheap fall in Bitcoin is like 30% or below. Yeah, but I do think that the market's mispricing it right now. To the upside, for sure. To the upside is mispricing it. You could also buy some puts, you know, you could buy some puts on ETH and some calls on BTC. That's another fun trade. If I bought If I Yeah, that's smart. If I bought a strangle, I would be looking to actively like dynamically hedge the puts and leave the calls naked in the bottom drawer. Like if the market shanked to the downside, I would be either buying delta or selling out of my puts and leaving the calls on. Um, yeah, I I think that's I think that's right. I mean, if you get like a, you know, may maybe the market will gift us with another run at, you know, 80 85 or something like that or 83, we'll be able to we'll be able to scoop that. You know, I I was reasonably caught off guard just by like how little we moved while while the equity markets were were tanking and and going all over the place. I mean, from Saturday, April 12th to Sunday, April 20th, we moved in like a $2,000 range on BTC. I I I can't say that was like a, you know, expected. If I mean, if you'd asked me on that Saturday, hey, is Bitcoin going to move in a $2,000 range for a week, I would have said, no, you're nuts. Yeah. Um, but now we're make, you know, we've we've broken out of that tiny little mini range and I think that we're going to see some some vault pretty soon. Yeah, 5% day. I was going to say I I think we're both we both are kind of like wanting to talk in the same direction, which is about alts. I think if we do get a rally, I think that like this finally in crypto, this next rally will separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to altcoins. I think that, you know, last summer we had people investing in billions of different meme coins. Pumpf fun was the only long-term beneficiary. Most other people probably lost money on it. I think this time what emerges from this cloud of of crap is going to be Bitcoin and a very small handful of solid projects that will probably perform for the next few years. I think that I think retail is finally tapped out of memelike investing and we'll finally like we'll finally buy into our thesis that you have to have some financial linkage between genuine project revenue business revenues and uh you know underlying tokconomics. What do you think about that? Like is that I don't know man. I think you're just stating what's already happened. I actually had a conversation earlier today where it struck me. We're done. Like the.com boom era of crypto is over. Yeah. This is the this is the part where Amazon takes its lead and never gives it up in crypto where I mean I I'm sorry to say it, but I think your old seasons are over. They're just not coming back because everyone let's put it like this. ETH kind of it took the wool out of everyone's eyes and you know took took off took off the shade where people realized holy crap if ETH can be a sevenyear long pump and dump like [ __ ] I mean I really can't buy anything unless it makes money unless it's an actually like useful useful product and even if it makes money I got to stay on top of it because ETH made money for a bit and was deflationary for about three and a half seconds and then it stopped being deflationary and it stopped making a good amount of money and then it promptly basically went to zero. And I think this is really, you know, this is shocking to a lot of people. I think crypto is going to stop being that casino in a sense. The only thing that brings it back is the world has to start feeling really wealthy again. And you you kind of you kind of need like a you need like a COVID like dynamic where people just want to punt on things left and right or you need you know GDP growth to be like 5% for some reason and everyone's just feeling flush with cash and the stock market's up 30%. But basically like until you see that already happening. I mean, and even then, I don't know. Or you need a $150,000 Bitcoin and all the incelss feel rich and start hyper gambling again. But yes, I take your point. I just have one issue with how you framed it. I'm not des I would argue that I'm not describing what already happened. Like, Saul BTC is 70% off the all-time highs, right? Like, and Salana's as legit a project as any in crypto. Um I think my my point is that there will be a very selective um altcoin season limited to let's say two dozen tokens or less that comes during the next rally where those tokens actually outperform Bitcoin. Um, I'm not, you know, both of us have been saying all seasons are over and yes, the.com boom is over, but I I still don't think I'm describing a boom that's already occurred. Yeah, I you know, the the boom part. Yeah, it hasn't it hasn't occurred yet, but I I guess what I was trying to articulate is just like we're in the process of the wheat being separated from the chaff right now. I mean, yeah, it's just the chaff is going to zero and the wheat isn't. Um, and the wheat's not rallying yet. Yeah. And and the wheat the wheat will rally. I mean, the hype hyperlid did well since I since I told you to get in on it. Good good trade, man. Um, thank you for cluing me into that. Golden Hyperlid. I should just retire now. I mean, I I think I'm going to start I haven't sold any Hyperlid. I think I'm probably going to take some like some profits around $20. Think about it, Jonah. Don't even think about it. Last episode you were saying to think about it. 30. 30. Okay. 30 20 25 to 30 you can scale out of a little bit. We're too close to 20. Like we've spent we've spent five days in this 17 18 range. I think that we punched through 20. Have you ever I can neither confirm nor deny if I've used Hyper Liquid. Yeah, I can't confirm or deny either, but I've heard from folks who have that it's pretty pretty faking amazing. The UX is No, it's great. It's great. I mean, honestly, it's a it's I mean, it's just a top tier product all around, and I'm hoping that we find more. Earlier in today's episode, I mentioned Ledger's latest products, the Stacks and Flex, and I wanted to take a few seconds to tell you more about them.

You know, one thing that I've grown to appreciate that if you're listening to this, you know, if you're if you're in crypto and you're trying to figure out this space and you're this is not an ad. This is not an ad read at all. Like we we don't do those. We don't we don't we don't do those. But you need to subscribe to research services like yesterday. Uh because it's very difficult to do all of your own work. And basically my entire day is spent reading research reports. You know, I'll name them. Uh Block Works obviously they sponsor this podcast. We love you Block Works Research. But Msari and Deli are also very good. Misari is still good even after the departure of our beloved leader, our dear leader. Oh wow. But wow, you know, you you kind of need to be reading a lot and actually diving in. I mean, like you got to go on DeFi Lama basically every single day and you have to talk to people that are in all the different ecosystems. I mean, the TOW thing is a great example of this. You know, if I didn't know chiefing and you didn't know chiefing, there's no way in hell I would know that DTO was popping off, that people are actually using it and that even though there's a ton of friction, it's growing and there's TVL coming to the chain. Like I how would I know? What's your favorite metric on DeFi Lama, by the way? I'll tell you mine. You tell me yours. I mean, it depends on what I'm looking at, but I mean I I don't really look at TVL. I just look at fees and I look at fees and fees and unique users. Fees is my favorite 7-day fees is my favorite metric on uh DeFi Lama because I like I said before, you know, feel this is your chance to disagree with my thesis. By the way, I I only I think we're past the dot moment, too. I think only real businesses will survive. And because it's all on chain, you literally have a dashboard telling you in as granular like format as you like how much money these businesses are making. And you know, even even Amazon stock didn't have that back in the day. They reported quarterly. So I just look at fees to see like it's like, okay, Tether 7-day fees, $130 million. Like no way to invest in that. Damn. Okay, Circle is next. Can't invest. pump next can invest Jupiter next questionable tokconomics but that's cool I don't know man if Jupiter starts passing back revenue the thing about fees that's kind of difficult is revenue and fees are different right let's play revenue then you know re revenue for Jupiter is 240 million annualized and fees are almost a billion because they have to pass back whenever you're looking at a DEX you got to remember fees are also paid like they're paid out to liquidity providers. Yeah. Um so you know fees can give you the full picture but for dexes they don't. Well for hyperlquid fees equal revenue because it's a for for hyperlquid fe that's what yeah for hyperlquid fees equal revenue. Yeah. For Jupiter they don't um because liquidity providers get get because it's an AMM. Yeah. Correct. Um now the revenue is still still pretty good. Hyperlid 7 million. So they're making a million dollars a day. Freaking crazy. Obviously, Tron is up there, too. But Hyperlid is the sixth highest protocol when it comes to rev 7-day revenue in the world. Uh then it's above it. It's Axiom, Tron, Pump, Circle, and Tether. So basically, Hyperlid is the most investable and I think the price to earnings is still kind of in line with what you'd see in the NASDAQ, not what you'd see in like a mania style environment for tech. So it's it's probably okay here. Yeah, I love that metric. It's that that that ratios that ratio is pretty solid. But I mean, yeah, go just go on DeFi Lama, go read research reports, try to find the things that are actually making money and performing well. I mean, like curve curve curve, I think, is going to be a winner as well, just generally. Yeah, I bare posted curve, which is sometimes what I do when I'm under underucated on a protocol. I was like, they're not really doing enough to compensate their users. And then somebody replied to me like, "What are you talking about? Look into their tokconomics." Sent me all the white papers. And I I did my research and it does indeed seem like Curve is is passing a lot back. Uh the problem with Curve, so I was wrong. Um the problem with Curve is I don't I just on this they make 159 I'm just looking at this dashboard. You know, fees are $300,000 a day. Revenue is $159,000 a day. like not too shabby if you're just a couple of couple of guys that created a protocol, but if you're trying to invest in the token at what's the FTV right now, let's see here. Curve I just think I just think that as stable coins heat up, people move to Curve as a as as a play. Yeah, it was really useful during the last sort of 2022 23 crisis. TVL of curve sorry not TVL uh FDV of curve is 1.3 billion so 1 so 153 150,000 a day sorry for 7 days times 52 weeks that gets you to 7.8 8 million a year. So FTV 1 300 by 7.8 that's a hold on my cell in Excel can't show me that many digits. That's 167 PE. I'm not sure that's necessarily the greatest uh entry point, but who knows? I'm not an equity investor. Maybe we need to pivot, you know, maybe we need to start hiring equity analysts to value crypto companies on the, you know, the way that equities work because that is that is a direction we're headed. Yeah. You know, the game the game has become a lot harder. You know, if you're not getting good information from good sources and talking to the right people, it's basically impossible to make money now. I I wouldn't say impossible, but it's very hard. I mean, in the in the alt world, I mean, it's pretty freaking hard. Yeah, especially if you don't have a like a finance background. I guess the thing is markets never get easier. But crypto is still, relatively speaking, a lot easier than, you know, say the US equity markets where you're just going head-to-head with Ken Griffin on every trade. That's that's an uncomfort that's an uncomfortable place to be here. We're still kind of pre like the rails aren't really there yet for the institutions to actively trade altcoins. And if you want to get even deeper into the weeds, like let's just since we were talking about Tao and DTO, let's just use like Tao as an example. One layer removed from altcoin trading on liquid exchanges, liquid crypto exchanges. One le one one level of sophistication below that is like trading subnets on TA, right? Like a tweet will come out about some subnet like Barry Silbert will will pump one of the subnets in a tweet or an interview and then it'll rally like a couple hours later and it'll rally a lot and you have to have TOAO to play that game. So obviously you're you can't really trade these versus dollars but if you're inside of that ecosystem it's even more inefficient. So, you know, I can't say that I've I'm invested in TOAO right now. I'm not. Uh I'm I've kind of wanted to enter last week, got lazy, and then now the price has pumped by 20% and I feel a little bit worse about it. I'm just kind of still mulling it. But I think that like if you're willing to if you want to actively click trade something that's quote unquote easy, you have to search for these ecosystems within ecosystems that are going to perform. And uh if you end up doing well there, you stack more TOAO. And if Tao performs, then uh you know uh the chief, you know, to quote the chief, it's kind of like DeFi summer, you know, do um stacking ETH using DeFi, just good good trading on chain. You you stack more ETH and then ETH would rally and your returns would compound. So maybe there's some opportunities a few layers below the the surface of the onion there. I'm just, you know, spitballing here. any any other ecosystems you're looking at, Obby? No, I need to start deep diving into into a few. I need to do a refresh of the Salana ecosystem. See if anything is out there. I mean, if anyone listening is it's like one of those people that just got obsessed with a specific random niche ecosystem and knows everything about it, let us know. Yeah. Yeah, send us a DM on Twitter and just let us know what you're so interested in and we'll cover it on the next podcast. I think that could be kind of fun. Like go go go find like you know this this podcast we we always we always offer like ways to think of the market and trades and right now the way to trade and make money is to is to go deep and then express it through pairs. Yeah. You know, I mean, we can we can talk all day about directionally trading macro and and BTC, but also there there are other ways to make money. I mean, with the exception of this of like not having topt ticked Bitcoin at 108, um, or, you know, I'm just speaking for myself here, maybe you did, but with the exception of not having topt ticked Bitcoin at 108, I'm pretty proud of our general macro long-term analysis. Like, we've had the call right since the lows. uh and we haven't really suggested that people stop out of their long-term core length even on these pullbacks and it's you know this asset class is showing all the signs of performing versus the dollar over the long haul and it already has performed versus equities. It's on the highs versus equities. So if you've been in Bitcoin like you've you performed admirably versus your peers in the equity markets. Um, so I'm I'm actually like to give us a little bit of credit, I am I am quite proud of the way that we've foreseen this particular uh, you know, bit just Bitcoin's performance. Um, going forward, I have not lost any conviction in that macro thesis. But aside from just giving up on most memecoins and most altcoins, I do I do feel underprepared for like the micro analysis that allows you to replicate compounding returns in a DeFi summer or maybe this next one is is tow. I don't know. So yeah, to all of our listeners, hit us up. We've got a telegram room. It's the uh it's called the Niger Delta Avengers. There are links to it in our our Twitter bios. Um, follow the thousandx agents. It it it puts out pretty good daily recaps now. Um, you know what? Maybe maybe I should just ask a thousandx agent. Yeah, I can't wait for this terminal to go live, guys. I mean, if you haven't been paying attention, Jonah mostly, but me sporadically, have been helping build this beautiful, beautiful terminal. And I think when it launches, people are going to be like, "Holy [ __ ] I cannot believe that this thing uh that they actually managed to launch something like this because it was kind of like a spare time little [ __ ] project that's now actually pretty useful and pretty serious. So, keep keep an eye out. Listeners, should we haven't haven't hopped in the chat yet? Should we walk the listeners through like what it's going to do? Like the the V1 is going to do?" Yeah. Jonah, give them give them the rundown. What's it going to do? Okay. So, here's the elevator pitch. Um, a terminal is a, you know, a place where you can interact with markets and get information. Uh, the Bloomberg terminal is the most famous terminal in the world. I used it for almost two decades. It's very, it requires you to be very proactive. You have to go in there with an idea of what you're searching for. Um, you kind of have to say, I want to see this chart or I want to compare these two assets or I want to look for this particular type of news. You have to have that idea and then you have to know the terminal language to communicate it to Bloomberg. Um, very powerful tool, tons of data, excellent product. What we're trying to build is a slightly more reactive terminal where you have two panes, a left panel, like a left pane and a right pane. The left pane is a feed of news articles um analysis that our our sort of bot has gleaned like it basically synthesis of of views about different tokens that it updates throughout time and posts in the form of like basically it's trained on our podcast to sound and think and act and and express views like we do. So, it's a combination of news, uh, bot post synthesis of markets, and then, um, previous chats you've had with our bot on the left pane. And then when you click on one of those, uh, sort of terminal news articles or posts, on the right, the text of that post or news will pop up. And unlike a traditional news story where you just read it and think whatever you want to think, this this terminal will give the user the ability to talk to the article. Um, and the bot will respond as if he were having a conversation with the two of us about the article. Like for example, a user could say, "Hey, you know, this uh this article talks about Dogecoin. I'm long some Dogecoin. What does this mean for my position?" And the bots might say, you know, "Hey, not financial advice. This is actually pretty medium to long-term bearish your position. You should think about um managing some risk here. Uh and here's why. Here are three reasons. And it's basically like a way for you to talk to financial data in English and receive responses in English and chart format. So, that's kind of what we're working towards. Avi describes it as the world's best crypto analyst. Um it's a product that both of us wanted ourselves and it's cool that we can build it in our spare time with our awesome dev. uh who has semi-doceded himself uh not his name but his Twitter handle online. Um so yeah, basically that's what we're going to be launching in the next couple weeks. It's actually a lot more work than we originally expected but um in the age of AI programming things is in order we didn't need 50 people to build this. We needed just you know a couple people. So keep your eyes peeled for that. It's I'm I'm psyched. I mean just as a user I'm kind of psyched. Okay. And chill. We'll end it there. Sorry guys for uh for badgering you. We're just actually we're just really excited about this. This is this this is going to be good. This is gonna be really fun. Yeah. We didn't say buy the token. We said check out a project that we worked on where we can, you know, help you. So, it's less less scammy than most shills. We we genuinely want your feedback. So, we'll be announcing it on the podcast when it goes live and, you know, you can tell us if it's great or terrible. Um, well, good stuff, man. Likewise. I will catch you in another week. Yeah, see you next week. Uh, who knows what's in store for us. This market's crazy. I can tell you BTC up, ETH down. That's all I'm saying. [Music]

Transcript Text:
So, what are you are you looking at any indicators for um I I know that you're like buying kind of like call options on projects shifting their tokconomics and you're doing that via pairs trades against ETH which I think is very intelligent portfolio construction. I'll tell you what I'm looking at as like a breakout indicator for the whole market when big capital inflows come in and support the valuable projects, the bitcoins of the world and the scams alike. Um I I know I I've talked your ear off about the BTC spy ratio, but I think it's smarter to look at IBIT versus SPY, the ETF, because they have the same open and close. They're both New York hour hour products. And we're in a solid uptrend. And I think if that if I bit SPY, which is currently trading 0.9 009, if that approaches or breaks through the cycle highs, which would be 0.1, um I think that that will be a signal to the participant base that Bitcoin is a is decorrelating to the upside. And I think that's when capital really starts to flow into crypto and we can start to see some mania like moves again. What do you think? Yeah, I I mean I think it's like as as you always say, it's good to good to watch the SBX BTC ratio. Um any others we should be looking at? The the one the one that really baffles me right now is is Bitcoin Gold. I mean, gold has just been on a gold has just been on an absolute tear. And I think a lot of it is people searching for a new reserve currency. A lot of it is, you know, in in a multi-olar world uh where you can't rely on the hegeimon uh to keep a stable currency, what do what do you do? You you buy gold. And look, if you look at Bitcoin, Bitcoin's done Bitcoin's done reasonably well relative to equity markets. I mean, you you see a massive equity market collapse and Bitcoin, you know, holds holds up okay from from what was it from the peak to trow on NASDAQ, NASDAQ went down 25%. It's pretty nuts, huh? Yeah. uh from peak to tro on BTC we went down the 30 32%. That's pretty damn good ratio for for for an asset like this. Uh, and I do think a lot of that was also because a ton of people were in the market trying to buy and like pushing it up to that to that 109 level because there was just rampant speculation on the SPR which turned out to be false. So like I would classify, you know, I I I would really think about it without that like how much did Bitcoin go down because equity started collapsing. uh you know that probably started at 96 down to down to 74 which is only 23%. Um so if you really think about this, Bitcoin's performed extremely well. Yeah. And I think a portion of that is people allocating to Bitcoin for the longer term in the same way that they're allocating to gold. If that wasn't happening, I would have expected Bitcoin to be back back in the 60s with with with S&P crashing so hard. I mean, look, uh, NASDAQ is down to it, it it got down to January 24 prices. It got, you know, a April April 19th when Bitcoin was substantially lower than than it than it than it was today. I mean, this is telling you this this is part of the extremely bullish long-term story for Bitcoin. Just back to gold for a second. Like there's one big actor buying a lot of gold right now. It's the People's Bank of China. Like they publish their reserves and they've been adding to their gold reserves for five consecutive months now. And I think part of this is like they own a lot of US treasuries. As the US and China go through this ugly divorce, China's selling off its US treasuries and they have to put the money somewhere, right? And there aren't a lot of alternatives right now. So, they're really stashing uh physical and financial gold on their balance sheet. That's going to continue. And China alone can push the price up price of gold up quite a lot. I'm not a particularly good gold trader. I wouldn't, you know, I did call this trend, but I I don't I'm not like heavily invested in it personally because it's not a market that I follow um the way that I like to in order to invest heavily in something. But ultimately, like yes, gold will continue to go up. I think Bitcoin is ultimately a much better alternative reserve currency than gold. Gold had its its heyday. Um, also gold can literally trade sideways or down for decades. Like maybe Bitcoin can too, but it hasn't yet. So, I have a lot more confidence in Bitcoin um like catching up with gold than I do with um gold. I'll I'll just leave you with this and I'll ask you to think about it. Uh we are in the midst of a generational shift in economic policy and general approach to geopolitics. We are genuinely entering into a time of multipolarity. I think that warrants a decade long bull run. I mean that's just my my take. Yeah. But what does that look like? Like gold might double in a decade, but Bitcoin could 10x. Yeah. I'm I'm not saying that I'm not saying that gold's going to outperform BTC, but I mean it has been doing extremely well rel you know rel relative to BTC and that's because why it's the first place that people go. Yeah. Right. it, you know, Bitcoin, Bitcoin is not, it's going to take longer for Bitcoin, which has been around for 15 16 years now, to replace something that has been traded for 5,000 years. It's going to take a lot longer than uh than than than 15 16 years. Might take 20. Yeah, I'm I'm kind of hoping it takes five, but that's that's good. Maybe I should go and buy a little more gold. Um, I I don't have enough to move the needle. I I still think and make sure make sure some of it's physical. If gold sells off 60%, it's going to be at a like around, you know, basically around $2,000 an ounce, which is a level that three years ago would have been considered like screamingly expensive all-time highs in nominal terms. Um, if Bitcoin sells off 60%. I think that's kind of a level where you look at it and you say this is the best trade of a lifetime. So that's kind of your downside, I think, for both assets. Upside for gold is like a twobagger over 5 to 10 years. Upside for Bitcoin is like a 5 to 10 bagger over that same time period. So to me, the riskreward looks better in Bitcoin. But I will I will concede that um gold has more of a track right now. It's also it's also portfolio construction, right? Yeah. For sure. It's gold is up 10%, Bitcoin's down 25%. Wow. You can buy a lot more Bitcoin now if you you know rebalance your portfolio. Some of some of some of that has to be taken into account, which is what I I mean I I personally did that. But I I regret this, but I sold gold to buy uh to buy to buy BT because my gold position had just absolutely um you know, this is one of those times, by the way, I wish I there's better better way for me to tax because I sold gold for a profit and bought BTC and I'm down. So, I you know, might have might have to get in and out of that thing to take take some losses. you can move to the US because because on on paper I made money this year. Um anyway, what I was uh what what I was trying to say is that I at some point I think that that trend that trend is going to reverse but um at least for the next six to 12 months I'm very bullish on gold and gold miners as well. And and don't forget you can one you can buy options if you really want to be crazy and get juiced returns juiced returns on gold. And the other thing is I just think that there's also a higher probability of gold going up than uh than than Bitcoin because gold over what time frame in the next in the next year year or so. I think there's probably I think there's probably a you know the go gold gold gold is up from this point I think in probably 80% of the scenarios and bitcoin's up probably in like the next in the in 60% of the scenarios. I see what you mean now right um so that that that's why that's why I like it as part of the portfolio. I agree. I I you know touche on portfolio construction. I totally concede that. I think your expected value of percentage returns is higher for a dollar in Bitcoin than gold. But I I will concede that it's it's going to be a much more volatile journey in Bitcoin than gold. And it makes sense to add gold to the portfolio to diversify and give your your book a higher sharp so that you can take bigger draw downs in Bitcoin which has the the bigger upside potential. That's that's a a very and then and then reallocate [Music] 350.

I'll just go back to the basics here. When it comes to trading a market like this and investing in a market like this, you only ever play at the extreme. Just don't touch the market when it's in the middle of a range. This episode is brought to you by Kraken OTC. Get access to 247 trading services for high- netw worth individuals and institutional clients to execute orders over $50,000. You'll hear more about them later in the show. [Music] Welcome back everybody to another ThousandX podcast. We're coming to you live from New York and LA to talk about a slow market day. Slow market day, but busy market in general if you zoom out a little bit. Yeah. Today, today was, you know, there's a little little bit of up, a little bit of down. I mean, if you look at the last if you look at like a 12-h hour chart, kind of nothing's happened since Saturday. We've just been chopping in a tiny little range. But before that was just absolute pandemonium. Yeah. I mean, we re we tested that 75K level twice and held it. We recorded that absolute banger podcast with Felix where we said buy with both hands and then the market proceeded to rally and now we're sitting 10 to 15% above where we talked about that. Um and so I guess the question that's on everybody's mind is what do you do now? Like what are you supposed to be doing with these gains? My answer is that we have not left the high V market environment yet. like that we are still in the craziness even though we've taken a little bit of break. So, I think that cash again is extremely valuable when you're in this type of market and you should be if if you bought anything lower, if you added to your stack lower or if you made a trade and this is your trading capital, you should be at least in my opinion 20 to 50% lighter with that capital that you bought earlier. H if you if you if you bought anything just because there's a ton of vault right now and you know the probability that we trade 78k again is reasonably high. It's not it's not zero, right? It's not not 5%. It's probably you know 30 40% in the in the next in the in the next month, but it's also probably 30 40% that we trade 92 in the next in the in the next month or so. I just think that there's there's a lot there's a lot of V vol to be had. Uh this is I think where we go into chop and recover mode. Uh but Jonah, what do you think? I mean I I it's hard to disagree that we're going to be in a range for a while. Um does seem like a good idea to start trading around the range. Just one little addendum to your point about maybe taking some profits if you bought lower. Um I don't forget to tax loss harvest if you bought higher. None of this is tax advice or financial advice, but check with your tax adviser and see if you can harvest some losses here. That's that's a that's always a good thing to do when markets pull back. Um because uh that's free money. That's free money right there. Um short-term capital losses can be harvested against ordinary income to the best of my knowledge, you know, from your W2 job if you've got one. So all all of that's very uh very, you know, just just extra ways to add to your stack. Um, I think that I I'm sad to say that I think you're right. I think we are heading into a choppy range. I think we're in the middle of it. So, I think it's kind of a weird time to lighten up, but maybe you're right. Maybe we're headed straight back down to the lows. You talked me into buying some of the hyperlid. By the way, I really like that one. And now my portfolio now consists of three line items. Bitcoin, Salana, and Hyperliquid. and I'm debating whether to just liquidate all of my Salana and get it and and move that capital over into Hyperlquid. That project seems like it's got real legs. Um mainly because of the element. I mean, it's it's it's as simple it's as simple as if it makes money, it's a better project than the projects that don't make money. I mean, it's pretty it's a it's a reasonably straightforward thesis is that this thing is making money handoverfist and there are just not that many other things that do. Uh, you know, not only it not only does it make money, it attributes that value back to token holders. Like there are plenty of projects out there that make lots of money like curve where the token if you hold the token like it's just you get some voting rights or some useless crap. like why should anybody Hyperlid actually dividends the money to the token holders uh in a legal way? I do I do think that and hopefully I'm right. But I I I do think that's going to change over the next year or so, which is why again I think one of the one of the things that you can do when the market pulls back like this, like if if you're still interested in trading crypto, uh is you can start to accumulate some of the things that you think will have a good 3 to six month trend. And if you want, you can short the things that you don't like against it. Like for example, one of the things I'm doing right now is I'm slowly accumulating everything in the RWA world and I'm shorting ETH against it. And I'm trying to focus on the things that are actually making money like Curve with the idea that at some point in the future they're going to they're going to pay back their token holders. like they're going to take that revenue that they're generating and they're going to pay back their token holders like slowly accumulating some plume and pendle and curve and ao again and maker actually as well and basically just shorting ETH against that or sell or you know you can b you could borrow ETH to go buy those things there there are a bunch of different ways you can you can go struct structure it you know just make sure not to get too overlevered you're when you're doing that you don't want you don't want to you know, you don't you don't want to get into too much trouble there. But yeah, I mean, I think that that that trade plays out very nicely in three to six months. I like the way that that trade is structured. like I would hate to own those assets versus US dollars because you could you'd have to take you could take a ton of pain before you know the tokconomics change but versus ETH like I you know just based on my limited clicking around during your your dissertation there I you know it does seem like a lot of those assets trade kind of lock step with ETH probably because they keep them in line they they've been they've been outperforming I mean I I grass is underperformed. That's another one that I added that because that's actually making real real revenues. The founder accidentally disclosed actually that they were making mid eight figures in revenue. Um we got to figure out how to get that back to the to the token of course, but all these things that are that are revenue generating that have some sort of thesis that will crop back up again in the next six months because I mean that's just that's just how crypto goes. I mean, you know, at some point in the next six to eight months, there's going to be, you know, a two week mania of RWA assets and probably a twoe mania of AI assets and probably a twoe mania of L1's again um I think at some point in the next six six to eight months. And so now is actually a reasonably good time to start accumulating them. And the reason I'm shorting ETH is because I don't, you know, I don't know if the market is done going down yet. I mean, for for for all I know, ETH trades a thousand this year. Um, you know, and I'd buy I'd probably buy it back there and then start writing these things outright, but kind of until we're in the until until we're in the trend up market mode and we're in the when we're in the chop zone, there's kind of no reason to do anything other than pair trade. you basically buy when things are are like at the lows of the year now, which a lot of these things are not. Uh and other than that, you know, you're not you're not going to ride these things outright in my personal opinion. Just doesn't make a ton of sense. I agree. Um yeah, you can't ride them outright. Yeah, you can't. They're like alt season is just too it's never coming and these alts are too dangerous. And also like if you're waiting for tokconomics to change, you're sort of you're sort of st you're playing a game of chicken with the the founders of the project, right? Like like who's going to who's going to who's going to sort of swerve first? Is it the token holders or the founders? The founders by now should be like it it should be crystal clear to any crypto founder that if their token is not getting actively bought back with project revenues, it's just a memecoin. and the memecoin cycle ended like mid last year. So, their token is going straight to zero. And yet, there's still this human greed element where like a founder even even looking like 0 per token in the face and thinking to himself, wow, my token is going to get deep donkeyed by the market if I don't change something. Like, it's still this like deep-seated lizard brain human instinct that says no. Hey, like clutch as many pearls as possible. Like don't let anybody else get the revenue. I want to keep it all for myself. Which is and you know like by now like watching Aerodrome just destroy unis swap on base or watching Hyperlid just destroy its like onchain competitors. Why? Because they they they do buybacks, right? Like they attribute value to token holders. Like it like the playbook is so obvious and yet and yet what are these other projects doing? Like I'm talking about viable projects here that generate real revenue. Why aren't they doing more buybacks? Do you Why do you say three to six months? Is there something behind that, Obby, or is that just like your gut feeling? Uh, it's been I mean, candidly, I just pulled it out of my ass. Um, but I do I I do I do think I do think that's that's what gives the market enough time to digest what's really happening because BA basically the the thesis right now is we because of these tariffs and because of the way that Trump governs uh it is no it is much harder to do business now actually uh in a in a in a volatile environment. uh we're not really sure how the tariffs are going to affect cons consumption consumption yet. Um and that that all of that uncertainty and uh degradation of consumption is going to lead to the economy turning out uh poorly or like you know start started starting to see data come in badly. In six months from now we're going to know if that's played out. And so basically either we'll be on the we'll be in the middle of a spiral or we'll say okay looks like actually nothing really bad is happening. Time to go up now. You know at at some point in the next six months we're going to we're going to figure that out. I think we're going straight back up. I I'm so bullish like risk assets over that time period.

Even like in the next month, you think that there's a much higher chance that risk assets go up than go down? No, next month I'm with you. I think we get like wild volatile chop. But six months, like Trump doesn't have Trump's not Xi Jinping. Like he doesn't have a lifetime to figure this out. He's got six months. And if he doesn't have it figured out by six months, uh he's going to lose the midterms in a big blue wave because the Democrats will credibly like the Democrats are a headless chicken right now. But if this continues, they'll be able to come into the midterm election like look at what happens when you elect Republicans. They just do random things that screw the entire economy and send us into tail spin chaos. Like what? Correct. Like why would you vote for Republican? And that's a very good like uh stump speech to give. The Democrats will win in droves and then Trump's agenda. Trump will be a lame duck for two years. And you know your quote is Trump is proTrump, right? Like if his goal is to be on Mount Rushmore, like he's going to be more like Herbert Hoover. uh his legacy is going to be more like Herbert Hoover than than you know Abraham Lincoln if he sends the economy into a tail spin and then gets his uh executive authority basically blocked by by a Democratic Congress for the final two years of his presidency. Like that doesn't make any [ __ ] sense. So obviously he started this spee he started this whole chaotic spat of volatility with a Rose Garden speech. He could end it with a tweet and we already saw him back down. Like this was my thesis Aby. My thesis was that even Donald Trump doesn't have the balls or the mandate to see the economy into a proper depression in order to uh in order to do what he wants to do. And we literally saw him flinch. He just flinched. He just tweeted the market back up. Like he Oh, truth did. He literally posted it back up. And uh he's just going to keep doing that. Here's the thing. He's just really going hard after China. And while I agree with your statement, Jonah, that he blinked when it when it came to the rest of the world, he blinked. But I don't know if he's going to blink with China. I mean, he really wants to [ __ ] stick it to them. And this guy does have a pretty big ego. So, I think it's not improbable that things crash again. And you can see I mean, let's put it like this. You can see a revisit of the lows in the market because he's decided to really stick it to China. Yeah. Because there's like no more bilateral trade between China and the United States. Like 300% tariffs. I I I could totally agree with you, Abby. This could totally devolve into like a third grade playground style tit fortat with like zero adults in the room and people, you know, chi Xi Jinping and Donald Trump just like hiking tariffs on each other. uh tit like yes that could happen. Yes, that would be bad for the economy. Um but that can't happen simultaneously with Trump shutting off America from the rest of the world too. So um basically what this could be is the beginning of a you know the creation of like an east versus west hemisphere like countries are going to have to pick like are you trading with China? Are you trading with the United States? Are you kind of like sleeping with both women or what do you want to do? uh and that you know this this is this is could be the beginning of the big separation. I don't necessarily believe that it will send markets lower for a variety of reasons over the long run. Over the short run, we could get like wild chop and some crazy like V-shaped plunges into bare market territory that quickly reverse. But like over the medium to long run, I don't think markets go down on this. I think it's just uh it's like volatility but not necessarily bearish. you know. Yeah. I think I think so. I was reading I was reading a note put out by Peter Zahan, who's sometimes a bit of a quack, but I think but but yeah, but I think makes really good points here, which is that this basically goes until the rest of the world chooses whether they're going to gang up on China or not. Uh, and and what Trump's what Trump's trying to do is he's trying to force people to make that decision and this game comes to an end when everybody makes their decision. And if it's a no-brainer decision, well, I mean, that's what I that's what I hope too as a as a as an American, you know, it's it's a no-brainer decision. Um, I think China's been abusing the world. You know, I I do I don't disagree with Trump that China has been taking advantage of the of the World Trade Organization and been taking advantage of uh global trade for a very long time. Um and basically playing dirty versus all other countries. Now, what I'll say is that, you know, from our standards, they play dirty. It's just that we choose not to play the games that they do, right? Yeah. that that's that's really it at the end of the day. And it's also it's a system thing like we you know it's much harder for liberal democracies to play that game. Um but you know if we wanted to overthrow our republic and install a fascist dictatorship we could do it. Uh you know we probably don't want to do that. No we don't. I mean you have you have a good point right? like so you know from from that perspective I do think it makes sense for the rest of the world to uh to team up with the US but I think that there's also this idea that the US is a dying power relative relative to China and do you want to do you want to join the rocket ship or do you want to get on the sinking ship is I think something that people are weighing right now and unfortunately I think a lot of people do view the US as the sinking ship in China as the rocket ship. I know a few people who feel that way for sure. Like that is I mean every single Chinese person I know feels that way. Yeah. But they they read state controlled media. Um I mean even even the even the ones even like the even the like Chinese Americans that I know, they all think that. Oh, I know a bunch. But um those are the ones who fled the People's Republic of China for repressive repression reasons. Um right. Put it this way, Obby. You're right. We could certain, you know, the United States could certainly play the same games that China plays, but we don't. And I, you know, I actually have experience doing business in developing countries, some of which, you know, physical oil business. Some of which, some of these countries are would be considered as like warlord uh run tinpot republics. And my experience uh trading physical oil in those countries was like, "Wow, look at what you have to do to get a barrel of oil out of um you know, the creeks in Nigeria." Like you have to basically bribe every single person along the way. Like what a horrendous system and just enrich you know line the pockets of people who touch that oil. But then after a while I was like well um you know who am I as a western business person to comment on the Nigerian style of doing business like that's just how things work in that part of the world. It's not unique to Nigeria. There are, you know, there are lots of parts of the world like bribe is a dirty word, but we could come up with like a synonym for it that, you know, you could you could call it like you you could call it like spreading the wealth or like socializing the income of of the, you know, the asset the the the crude oil, the physical the physical assets like it, you know, call it what you want like there are differing business cultures around the world and doing business with Chinese people in China is very different than doing business with Russian people, which has its own challenges. Similarly, you know, their challenges dealing in Iraqi, Kurdistan or Nigeria or anywhere else. So, who are we to comment as Westerners on how China chooses to do business? However, there is a reason why um like certain types of capitalism uh enjoy Cambrian explosions of success and others just kind of wither and die. And I think it's probably easier to collaborate with actors who are, you know, uh, adhere to the letter of the contract that is signed rather than those who don't. And I would put China into in the category of those who don't. I would put the United States into the category of people who do. Obviously, under Trump, um, US trade policy is more unpredictable and volatile than it used to be, but I I don't think there's like IP theft going on or any of the any of the dirty tricks that the Chinese have used. You know, state basically state sponsored industries flooding the world uh with goods and, you know, currency manipulation to basically stop out manufacturers and other countries to centralize it all in China. Like, I don't think any of that's going on in America. And so I think if you if you do basically decide to get in bed for the long run and get married with China as a trading partner, you are effectively subjecting yourself to a style of capitalism that that for which there's no precedent of success. Right. So to me, that's why it's an obvious an obvious decision. You're on mute. I'm not going to disagree with that. I mean, that that makes that that's 100% true. And I actually want to take take it even a step further and say the the disrespect for intellectual property uh is a tremendous issue in any industry that has this problem. I mean just tre tremendous issue and you can actually even see it in crypto. I think part of the reason that people are so extractive in this industry is because they doesn't matter what you invent. Uh somebody else because it's all open source, somebody else can copy it immediately. So unless you have the strongest morals and you know you're you're a top 5% in terms of ethical fiber of being your job is to invent something and then extract as much money as possible from it as quickly as possible because in six months you're going to have 300 billion different copycats using your technology and trying to steal your trying to steal your clients. um you know that like so so the the idea of invent something and then get wealthy that's that's what makes capitalism work. I actually think capitalism it's much harder to make capitalism work in a world where you don't have strong intellectual property laws because then you just incentivize again you incentivize well one you disincentivize actual invention um you incentivize waiting around for somebody to invent something and then ripping it off and having large distribution systems and pushing it out there as fast as possible. Basically what I think in a nutshell is that if the rest of the world is going to have a pretty easy choice to choose the country with a strong legal system over the country with an arbitrary Xiinping's brain determined uh you know set of rules and basically like you know against that backdrop the United States has a choice um we are the world's biggest customer uh so what kind of customer do we want to be do we want to be the type of customer like my former customers in a region which shall go unnamed that gave you know basically we would sell the we would buy we would buy $60 oil from them for $50 a barrel they would give up $10 a barrel they'd give up almost 20% of the value of every barrel just by being idiots on every single trade or so do you want to be do we want to be a customer that's that dumb and gives up that much value, that much edge, or do we want to be a customer like Walmart that just like haggles their suppliers down to the bone to the point where if you sell goods via Walmart, if you put your stuff on Walmart's shelves, you're making the thinnest possible margins that you will tolerate because they have haggled you down until you are you're ready to walk away, right? And I think that like I sense where all of this is going is the latter category, right? like we keep to strong laws and we become a slightly tighter customer that gives away less edge. In the meantime, there's going to be a tremendous amount of volatility. Over the medium to long term, I think it'll probably make markets go up quite a lot.

I think Quinn had a tweet today about how the S&P still has the basically the same earnings expectations and and multiple as it did at the beginning of the Trump presidency. If you think the tariffs are going to stick around for a while, you you you have to revise that lower. Like the m the multiples have to come in because the margins are going to shrink for these guys because I don't think that they can pass the entire cost on. I think that some of it will come will come out will come out of I mean and even if it doesn't right that they're going to sell less goods. Um and but I do think at least you know some some percentage of that's going to come out of the margin and so that's going to rerate and maybe once that happens and the data comes in then then I can start to be ridiculously bullish and hopefully that's in the next month or two. I mean you know I I'll I'll just go back to the basics here. When it comes to trading a market like this and investing in a market like this, you only ever play at the extremes. Just don't touch the market when it's in the middle of a range. Like touch. Yeah, that's why I don't want to sell anything like I don't want to sell any of my hyperlid right now. I kind of respectfully disagree with what you were suggesting earlier. I I feel like we're in the middle of the new range. Yeah, I was I was thinking more from the buy side, from the from the sell side. It's like if you're up 50% on a position in this type of range, like maybe sell a little bit, you know, if you're up 10 15% on Bitcoin, okay, maybe sell a little bit, you know, of of of what you bought. Like get get that get that cash in your account and redeploy it when something absolutely nuts happens. That's fair because I because I gu because I guarantee you it will. I actually think that um right now this $84,000 on Bitcoin is a is a horribly unstable price. I actually think basically every price on the market right now is a horribly unstable price and that for whatever reason V isn't I think you know at the money V is 48 on Bitcoin. That doesn't really make a ton of sense to me. Um either way that's about the same as crude oil. V I mean look let me be a little vulnerable with you Aby. Uh we're friends. I can I can tell you how I how I can be vulnerable with you. Um I think I'm really good at knowing what to do in the immediate term, like just what to click on. Uh you know, if something's about to get absolutely daddied, I can get out of it. If something's about to rip, I usually have a sense for that. And over the long run, like my macro thesis have have buoyed, you know, a nice healthy two decade long career. So, I'm pretty confident in myself there. I kind of suck at the medium term. Like I don't really like okay, Bitcoin's trading 83. I like what is 78 or is 78 next or is 90 next? Like I I'm so blind there and that is like your like you have so much strength in that category and this is why I really enjoy these conversations. like as much as I am long-term bullish and that that leads me to want to uh just try to find entry points uh in in this market, you know, there like you said, there's tons of volatility and cause for concern. Like for example, the New York Fed survey of consumer expectations like percentage of people expecting higher unemployment in a year rocketed over the course of the last week. um you know New York Fed survey of consumer expectations like hey are you somewhat or much worse off in the next 12 months than you were before. That one rocketed over the last week like people inflation expectations are rocketing. Um, credit card credit card balances are rocketing like all sort you know people are you you read stuff on Twitter about people like using using buy now pay later to buy their Coachella tickets like it's getting like there there's some leading indicators that are showing some you know predicting some really like savage uncomfortable near-term volatility. I personally don't know how to navigate that. I'm just kind of like waiting waiting for lower lower lows to try and buy more. if the market really roofs, uh, maybe I'll take some stuff off, but right now I'm kind of in my blind spot here. So, I I respect what you're saying and I I um people who have your strengths, I would recommend they lean into them, but recognizing your weaknesses is an important part of trading as well. Thank Thank you. Thank you for your vulnerability, Jonah. is very very very very touching to tell me that you are are are less good at a somewhat useless skill that doesn't matter that much. What? Range trading? Are you kidding me? Very very very very range trading is a very I've made the vast majority of my money um you know on on longer term trades. To be completely honest, this is just one of those things where you kind of have to you kind of just have to wait and see. Like I'm not calling for 90 and I'm not calling for 75. I'm just saying, you know, there there will be V. So be ready for it, but but be ready to be aggressive when the market gives you the opportunity to be and you just can't be aggressive if you're already if you're already fully deployed. The other thing that you have to uh that that you have to pay attention to is dislocations in a market like this. uh you know there there was a there there's an interesting trade once uh M started to get liquidated over over the weekend if you started to if if you understood why why that was happening you could you could have caught you could have caught the trade and experienced like a you know you could have shorted something and it's down 50% in like 15 minutes which wasn't which was which wasn't so bad. Um, this is the type of market where dislocations like that will happen, where things that are weak will kind of blow up because there's kind in a in a in a not you kind of need I mean you need a bullish market to prop up a prop up a scam. Um, you know, and and a lot of things break when there's not enough capital in the system as well. And so these these things are just just stuff to look out for I would say. You know it's it's definitely right now a reasonable market to trade dayto day. Um but I mean my my focus right now is just on accumulating those accumulating those pairs and then every now and then if you see something you can really you can really attack it. Earlier in today's episode, I mentioned Ledger's latest products, the Stacks and Flex, and I wanted to take a few seconds to tell you more about them.

So, what do you are you looking at any indicators for um I I know that you're like buying kind of like call options on projects shifting their tokconomics and you're doing that via pairs trades against ETH which I think is very intelligent portfolio construction. I I'll tell you what I'm looking at as like a breakout indicator for the whole market when big capital inflows come in and support the valuable projects, the bitcoins of the world and the scams alike. Um I I know I I've talked your ear off about the BTC spy ratio, but I think it's smarter to look at IBIT versus SPY, the ETF, because they have the same open and close. They're both New York hour hour products. And we're in a solid uptrend. And I think if that if I bit SPY, which is currently trading 0.9 009, if that approaches or breaks through the cycle highs, which would be 0.1, um I think that that will be a signal to the participant base that Bitcoin is a is decorrelating to the upside. And I think that's when capital really starts to flow into crypto and we can start to see some mania like moves again. What do you think? Yeah, I think I mean I think it's like as as you always say, it's good to good to watch the SBX BTC ratio. Um, any others we should be looking at? The the one the one that really baffles me right now is is Bitcoin Gold. I mean, gold has just been on a gold has just been on an absolute tear. And I think a lot of it is people searching for a new reserve currency. A lot of it is, you know, in in a multipolar world uh where you can't rely on the hedgeimon uh to keep a stable currency, what do what do you do? You you buy gold. And look, if you look at Bitcoin, Bitcoin's done Bitcoin's done reasonably well relative to equity markets. I mean, you you see a massive equity market collapse and Bitcoin, you know, holds holds up okay from from what was it from the peak to trow on NASDAQ. NASDAQ went down 25%. It's pretty nuts, huh? Yeah. uh from peak to tro on BTC we went down the 30 32%. That's pretty damn good. I mean damn good ratio for for for an asset like this. Uh, and I do think a lot of that was also because a ton of people were in the market trying to buy and like pushing it up to that to that 109 level because there was just rampant speculation on the SPR which turned out to be false. So like I would classify, you know, I I I would really think about it without that like how much did Bitcoin go down because equity started collapsing. uh you know that probably started at 96 down to down to 74 which is only 23%. Um so if you really think about this, Bitcoin's performed extremely well. Yeah. And I think a portion of that is people allocating to Bitcoin for the longer term in the same way that they're allocating to gold. If that wasn't happening, I would have expected Bitcoin to be back back in the 60s wi with with S&P crashing so hard. I mean, look, uh, NASDAQ is down to I it got down to January 24 prices. It got, you know, a April April 19th when Bitcoin was substantially lower than than than it than it than it was today. I mean, this is telling you this this is part of the extremely bullish long-term story for Bitcoin. Just back to gold for a second. Like there's one big actor buying a lot of gold right now. It's the People's Bank of China. Like they publish their reserves and they've been adding to their gold reserves for five consecutive months now. And I think part of this is like they own a lot of US treasuries as the US and China go through this ugly divorce. China's selling off its US treasuries and they have to put the money somewhere, right? And there aren't a lot of alternatives right now. So, they're really stashing uh physical and financial gold on their balance sheet. That's going to continue. And China alone can push the price up price of gold up quite a lot. I'm not a particularly good gold trader. I wouldn't, you know, I did call this trend, but I I don't I'm not like heavily invested in it personally because it's not a market that I follow um the way that I like to in order to invest heavily in something. But ultimately, like yes, gold will continue to go up. I think Bitcoin is ultimately a much better alternative reserve currency than gold. Gold had its its heyday. Um, also gold can literally trade sideways or down for decades. Like maybe Bitcoin can too, but it hasn't yet. So, I have a lot more confidence in Bitcoin um like catching up with gold than I do with um gold. I'll I'll just leave you with this and I'll ask you to think about it. Uh we are in the midst of a generational shift in economic policy and general approach to geopolitics. We are genuinely entering into a time of multipolarity. I think that warrants a decade long bull run. I mean that's just my my take. Yeah. But what does that look like? Like gold might double in a decade but Bitcoin could 10x. Yeah. I'm not I'm not saying that I'm not saying that gold's going to outperform BTC, but I mean it has been doing extremely well rel you know rel relative to BTC and that's because why it's the first place that people go. Yeah. Right. it, you know, Bitcoin, Bitcoin is not, it's going to take longer for Bitcoin, which has been around for 15 16 years now, to replace something that has been traded for 5,000 years. It's going to take a lot longer than uh than than than 15 16 years. It might take 20. Yeah, I'm I'm kind of hoping it takes five, but that's that's good. Maybe I should go and buy a little more gold. Um I I don't have enough to move the needle. I I still think though like and make sure make sure some of it's physical. If gold sells off 60% it's going to be at a like around, you know, basically around $2,000 an ounce, which is a level that three years ago would have been considered like screamingly expensive all-time highs in nominal terms. Um, if Bitcoin sells off 60%. I think that's kind of a level where you look at it and you say, "This is the best trade of a lifetime." So that's kind of your downside I think for both assets. Upside for gold is like a twobagger over 5 to 10 years. Upside for Bitcoin is like a 5 to 10 bagger over that same time period. So to me the riskreward looks better in Bitcoin, but I will I will concede that um gold has more of a track record. It's also it's also portfolio construction, right? Yeah, they're deorrelated for sure. It's gold is up 10%, Bitcoin's down 25%. Wow, you can buy a lot more Bitcoin now if you, you know, rebalance your portfolio. Some of some of some of that has to be taken into account, which is what I I mean, I I personally did that. I I regret this, but I sold gold to buy uh to buy to buy BT because my gold position had just absolutely um you know, this is one of those times, by the way, I wish I there's better better way for me to tax lost harvest because I sold gold for a profit and bought BTC and I'm down. So, I you know, might have might have to get in and out of that thing to take take some losses. you can move to the US version because because on on paper uh made money this year. Um anyway, what I was uh what I was trying to say is that I at some point I think that that trend that trend is going to reverse but um at least for the next six to 12 months I'm very bullish on gold and gold miners as well. And and don't forget you can one you can buy options if you really want to be crazy and get juiced returns juice returns on gold and the other thing is I just think that there's also a higher probability of gold going up than uh than than Bitcoin because gold over what time frame in the next in the next year year or so I think there's probably I think there's probably a you know the go gold gold is up from this point. I think in probably 80% of the scenarios and Bitcoin's up probably in like the next in the in 60% of the scenarios. I see what you mean now, right? Um so that that that that's why that's why I like it as part of the portfolio. I agree. I I you know, touche on portfolio construction. I totally concede that. I think your expected value of percentage returns is higher for a dollar in Bitcoin than gold. But I I will concede that it's it's going to be a much more volatile journey in Bitcoin than gold. And it makes sense to add gold to the portfolio to diversify and give your your book a higher sharp so that you can take bigger draw downs in Bitcoin which has the the bigger upside potential. That's that's a a very smart and then re and then reallocate. Yeah. Oh, can we can we can we end the podcast there or do you want to call me smart everybody? You are smart. We all love you Obby. That's why we keep you on here. you know, the committee of people that is we This is my podcast, Jonah. It's my podcast. Love you, man. Uh, this is a good one. Let's definitely wrap it there. Before we start saying dumb [ __ ] I'll see you soon. See you soon. Later. [Music]

Don't get behold. That's all all I'll say. Just whatever you do, do not get behold. You know, at at some point everything is going to start going back up again. Like don't don't worry. You know, this is this is not about betting on global collapse. This is about figuring out when this particular show is going to end. This episode is brought to you by Kraken OTC. Get access to 247 trading services for high- netw worth individuals and institutional clients to execute orders over $50,000. You'll hear more about them later in the show. [Music] We're live. We're doing Welcome. Welcome to the stream everybody. What is up everybody? I guess we'll just uh we'll let a few people trickle in, but we're doing it. Jonah, you have the nicest background I think I've ever seen in a live recording that I've been in. So, props to that. Thank you. Um I live in a nice area. It's really uh really beautiful here. I would say it's definitely a good place to forget about how much money I'm losing. And uh I would be recording next to the usual white wall, but um that area is out of commission at the moment. So you're stuck with me outside with the crappy uh microphone. Doing well. I love it. Jonah, you know that you know the background I miss the most? That butterfly gun. You need Felix. I know. I don't know if you ever seen this thing. I don't think so. No. Jonah, why don't you explain your butterfly gun? So, during the um crazy flash crash bare market of 2018 or just before it, I decided to buy a piece of art. It's a um North Korean AK-47 covered in dead butterflies and the bullets are filled with different commodities. And I thought this is a good commodity trader art piece. So, I commissioned it from the artist, told him I'd pay for it in cash to get a discount. And then, um he started working on it. And then this was sort of at the peak of a very good year. And then the market basically my P&L went down by 80% between when I said done on that to when I owed the money and got it delivered. But I didn't flake. I took delivery and now I have um the hardest thing that you could possibly import from London to Los Angeles. North Korean fully automatic uh gun covered in in dead animals filled with Sounds like that could be in the Denver airport. You know, they have like those insane graffiti. Oh yeah, you've heard all the conspiracy theories there. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's like Illuminat. Yeah. Um okay, I think we have enough people in here that we can stop [ __ ] posting and actually get down to the brass tax. Um good to see you guys. You know, it's been a couple weeks. We we all got together at the digital asset summit and it was a ton of fun and yeah, it's just fun to, you know, collide the different worlds of of my macro world and and your guys' crypto trading world and and see where we intersect. And, you know, there's a lot of crossurrens, too. You know, Jonah, you were you were trading oil when I was probably 5 years old. So, you know, there's a there's a lot of different crossurrens there. So, um yeah, man. I thought it'd be fun to just chop it up and see how we're thinking about things. Um Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so so far so far so good. I'm glad that you pointed out Jonah is an old man. I like to say that to him as well. But, you know, by by being by being an old man, he has some actually pretty amazing perspectives on on how these types of markets trade. Um, you know, as a as like a as a guy that has not been through monumental shifts in global economic order before in my trading career, I have to say this has been one of the, you know, more difficult things that I've had to do is is navigate this without without blowing up. I think a lot of people um you you can you can kind of sleep on what on what happened uh you know pri prior to prior to it actually happening there are a lot of people you know okay yeah maybe maybe he'll put tariffs on I think even heading into liberation day if you had pulled the vast majority of market participants I don't think they would have said you you're going uh 20% or 16% straight down in 3 days um that was you know yeah I I'm curious Yeah, I I'll share mine, but I'm curious about your guys' thought process going into that because, you know, I was there watching the live stream that day and, you know, going into it, I was 50/50 on what was going to happen and was just ready to to hit the green button or hit the red button depending on on how things are going to transpire. And I know myself personally is, you know, we we we got that initial Wall Street Journal, you know, it's just been a nightmare the past week for, you know, just like these news media putting out these headlines and just, you know, swinging multi-t trillion dollar assets in one direction or another. And this all started when initially during that tariff announcement, Wall Street Journal, I think, was the one that came out with the the 10% flat tariffs, universal tariffs, which if you looked at expectations, that was pretty strong on the lower than expected side of things. And then, you know, I saw that and hit the green button. And then pretty quickly the, you know, the almighty chart of doom came out and just sent everything spiraling in the other direction and had to quickly get out of those at break even and then just, you know, went the other direction and just got out of almost everything else I had. And, you know, it's the beauty of being just singular traders, right? You know, we're not I mean, maybe you guys are trading multi-billion dollar books, but I'm not. So, you know, I could just pretty much get out instantly. And it feels like what has happened the last three days since, like market trading days since, is just been everybody else catching up because, you know, the pod monkeys, the multistrats, and the CTAs, it takes a lot longer for those guys to unwind their books. And, you know, the last, especially Friday to me seemed really interesting in terms of just all out degrossing. You know, there's gold down, you know, equities were down, and then we started to see rest of world equity down, which was a new thing that really didn't transpire. So, yeah, it just felt like we're finally we saw the full-on unwind of all those books and yeah, like what were you guys thinking about going into it versus what happened? Well, go going into it, I wasn't, let's put it like this. I was not expecting the Trump administration to be calculating tariff rates by dividing, you know, imports versus exports. Like, I was not that that that was not on my on my radar. And I have to say that to me is what made it a very dangerous situation because it takes away the logic of of a lot of it. Right? If if and you're actually seeing that play out right now. If prior to that you were thinking, okay, these guys are going to, you know, Trump is going to get out there and he's going to put on a ton of tariffs on these countries in order to get them to reduce their tariffs. That's that's actually a lot easier to solve than the situation that we're in today. Like Vietnam comes back and they say, "Well, we'll go to zero tariffs." And Trump says, "No, no, no. There all these other things that you're doing." Vietnam's like, "What what can you can you explain it?" And then there's no like real explanation uh for for what what the other things, you know, it's like vague accusations of currency manipulation and uh and we need to export more to you than than than you export to us. Um so it makes the actual calculus for getting out of this, I think, a lot a lot more difficult in my in my personal opinion. And so I think that, you know, the the idea of, okay, well, this is a negotiation tactic to maybe these things are sticking around for a long time, I think is why the market reacted the way that it did. Cuz prior I mean, prior to Liberation Day, I think even, you know, even like the top 25% of bears were probably thinking this is a negotiation tactic. And I think that that has shifted a ton now to hey, maybe maybe these things are sticking around for a while. That's what people are that that's what the bears that's what the bears are thinking. That's what I was what I'm trying to articulate. This certainly wasn't in my laybook. I didn't expect this either. I was bullish coming into this whole thing and you know happy to own that and tell people how I I think about trading when you are wrong and get punched on the chin because it's very important to not fall into a couple of obvious traps in a situation like this. If you're somebody like me, I'm not currently trading a multi-billion dollar book. I'm trading my own book, so I don't have like a risk manager tapping me on the shoulder and telling me to get out of stuff, which helps. Um, you know, I think the interesting thing is I am pretty well connected in the pod shop world and I've heard that a lot of a lot of pods have blown up over the course of the last month and a half, uh, particularly in the last three days. So yeah, I think you know, Felix, you mentioned gold being down that that shows you that there are forced liquidations going on uh in portfolios and so you know Balazne or Millennium or Citadel will fire the portfolio manager, delete their login information and then somebody else at the fund is responsible for liquidating the that particular book, right? Yeah. And it can get sloppy. So I think that's you're seeing a lot of that right now which is why everything including gold is down.

And so, you know, we can get into some of the frameworks of how we're thinking about this in terms of like the economic impact, but that reason is mostly why I've started to buy somewhat aggressively is Friday. And then also today in some respects, we've seen a lot of of of those force sellers that the force deleveraging which we haven't seen in the weeks lead up Friday when it started. I think that's I I saw a chart in the daily shot suggesting that last Friday on US exchanges all of them combined more shares of equity traded than ever before. It was the most active single day in US equity market history on a just like obviously dollar notional basis but also shares basis which really tells you something. So I think uh I think that you know Avi and I talk about this a lot on our crypto pod. When you see big volumes and a reduction in open interest that usually gives you a sign that the move is almost done. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So that's why you know you got to start thinking about just you know I had a I hosted the the Ford guidance roundup with Quinn and the Macro Dirt Boys Tony Greer and Jared Dillian who are you know awesome veteran traders. And it's just great to to discuss these ideas of just how do you go about catching these knives where you see these four sellers and you're like, "Okay, this is a rational selling." Um, you know, when I think about equities down 20%, that's we're getting we're getting into pretty decent pricing of a recession. Um, so, you know, you start to see on, you know, trading around the margins here that you want to be getting in front of that. And to get in front of that is, you know, the way we put it on that roundup is that you have to eat a few [ __ ] sandwiches before you really catch that bottom and and start to see the other side of things because, you know, like I think about the last time that we went through one of these was March 2020 and I made the mistake of having a shopping list and getting excited but always thinking there's, you know, there's going to be the next leg lower and then that's where I'm just going to, you know, buy everything all at once and then bottom ticket to perfection and then ride that, you know, into eternity. And you know, I I I'll be happy to admit that I missed I missed that pico bottom because of that reason. Whereas, and I'm sure you guys can explain how you think about this, but you know, you got to trunch it out and and get in front of this thing a little bit at one point, even though you may think that it'll go lower. And that's the situation that I feel like we're in right now. I already ate a couple [ __ ] sandwiches on the way down here. Um, and I'm done. I'm done with that. So, basically what I'm doing now is I'm afraid to catch this falling knife, but I don't think I'm g I might not bottom ticket, pico bottom ticket, but I do plan to buy more when the thing looks like it's starting to like grind higher, right? Like once I I don't want to try and catch the falling knife. I want to try and buy a a green shoot style rally. AI always has a slightly different perspective on this than I do. Um, but that's how I look at it. Yeah, I I like I'm I'm more of a trader like you, Felix. So, I try to wave it in when things look like like they're imploding. I mean, the best thing that any trader can do is buy for selling because it's it's really it's very scary actually to buy selling and you don't understand why it's h why it's happening because what that means is that somebody else knows a lot more than you and somebody else is probably selling for a reason that you haven't figured out yet and then you just end up totally totally nuked. Uh but that was actually kind of what tipped me off is when everything started going lower. Exactly. Um when when you when you have when you have gold lower when you have I mean the bonds bonds started going lower and you know equities were going lower and every it was correlation of one on the first day on liberation day if I remember correctly that was not the case at all actually. No, it wasn't like gold gold was up. Uh things were the market was reacting kind of the way that it was supposed to react. Uh which makes it, you know, okay, I don't know, maybe there's just a massive repositioning, but once everything starts reacting onetoone, then you can say, okay, I'm going to start nibbling. Now, the issue is you never know how far that's going to go. Um and so what you what you try to do is basically just chip in when things look nuts. Um, and then give it give yourself give yourself wiggle room, right? So that you're not completely out. Um, the way that I like the out of out of dry powder, the way that I like to do it is basically I look I I basically just look at the charts and I go this is this is kind of my like my line in the sand. Like this is like a really, you know, this is the most extreme that I could that I think is a 5% chance of this actually happening. And at that point is when I want to be 100% long and then I'm going to scale in scale in until there. So for me um that was uh actually 4 460 on uh on spy. that was like my okay that's like where I'm I'm sho I'm shoving absolutely everything in um and let me get up to like you know because I say it's I think it's a 5% chance of that happening like I'll deploy 80% of capital before that point and then like you know have save like at that point I'm probably only buying like 10 20 10 15% if that makes sense like I try to that that's how I try to do so I'm never fully filled uh unless something like like literally insane happens I think that's I think that's a bit of PTSD uh from uh March of 2020. Um like when when I just got like completely blown out that that was that was painful and I and I think that's kind of stuck with me. Yanowitz has a great tweet about this today. He he tweeted um he he literally said I don't know whether it's it's normal or not to I'm paraphrasing here. I don't know whether it's normal or not to feel totally fine about this equity market selloff. Maybe, you know, I've been in crypto too long, but somehow these big jack knives lower in price uh when you've when you're when the asset that you trade is as volatile as Bitcoin or one of or worse, one of these altcoins, somehow this doesn't feel that dire. And I I certainly, you know, I I think Avi and I always talk about trying to maintain a strong balance sheet in either your personal book or your workbook and not be forced to sell. So, I, you know, I've heeded my own advice here, so I don't feel that scared. I'm definitely done trying to pick the bottom. I'm going to be buying when it grinds higher again, which, you know, I may miss a V-shaped recovery, but I'll certainly catch a U-shaped recovery. I in terms of how this recovers, I would love to get you guys' take because this is this is, you know, even though I'm an old man, I'm not as old as Jared Dilly and he and I both worked at Lehman Brothers, but I'm still pretty old. I've never seen anything quite like this before because this is a man-made calamity. Everything was just great before Trump decided to royal things. On the one hand, part of me thinks this should be a lot less scary than an exogenous, you know, out of left field thing like a global respiratory virus pandemic or the global financial crisis which sort of just spiraled out of control and started for you know it was just it was out of control. It wasn't. This very much feels in the control of one guy and he could unwind it with a tweet. And I don't know whether that makes this a a way easier buy than those previous two crises I mentioned or a way harder buy because maybe Trump is just so insane that he's just going to keep pushing the envelope. I What do you guys think? Yeah. The issue This is what I'm debating a lot with too and I mention I tweeted something along those lines earlier today as well mentioning that it's just crazy that this is self-inflicted. The issue is if this keeps on for long enough, it has it it scars the economy regardless of if we revert back. So there's a few ways you could look at this. So, you know, we've seen the Atlanta Fed GDP now that has been coming out and it's just completely off the rails and completely skewed by some very very, you know, like outlier events that are impacting imports data in terms of trade. So, you know, regardless of, say, for example, Trump tweeted out, "Okay, just kidding. You know, let's let's turn all these tariffs off. We're all good." The fact is that there's already a ton of imports that have landed on the economy. There's already a ton of delays in terms of hiring plans and capex investment plans from companies. There's already all these dynamics happening. And and you make this point that everything was fine and dandy going into this. I actually disagree somewhat. you know, in in mid December, I started to talk about a growth slowdown in the economy. And I think, you know, I was pretty strong on the camp that it wouldn't be a recession by any means. I'm still not fully sold on the idea, although it's very close right now. But even if we took out the the tariff stuff and and the and the Trump fiscal retrenchment, there's already beginning to be some signs of the labor market slowing and some of these more in the weeds data points that told me that the the economy was more fragile than I think a lot of people expected and and and thought. So I think that there was that that nasty combination of like a nasty recipe that was created of of those dynamics paired with highly overvalued US equities. You know, if you looked at just, you know, broad surveys of institutional books, they were all in on US. The idea was you never need to own rest of world equity again. So there's like these these technical factors paired with that that I think set up the ideal catalyst. So you know, now I think about it. Okay, what would happen if you know we get to Wednesday and we learn that a lot of these these tariffs at least you know if we say that the 10% is you know flat and there for good which I think it is but the the reciprocal tariff stuff you know we're starting to see some discussions of you know do some countries decide to retaliate like China is doing like Europe is starting to talk about doing or is it the other side of the the boat of you know the Vietnams or we'll get into this I'm sure but there's talk of of of Scott Besson going to lead the negotiations with Japan as opposed to Lutnik, which is very interesting. That was a pretty key signal for me. But you know what? If we get to Wednesday and this all reverts somewhat, does that have, you know, does that undo the effect on the economy? I don't think so entirely. Um, but I do think it would be enough to see a very solid bounce and and rally. Um, but would it completely revert? I don't think so. That's how I'm thinking about it.

Yeah, it's it's kind of hard to thread that needle. I'll say that it the move today reminded me a lot of the fake ETF headline that Bitcoin had a while ago. Do do you remember that where you kind of just cleared out you just like cleared out a ton of positioning? Uh and then everyone started going, "Wait a second. If that's how Bitcoin is going to react to the ETF, I better get in." And I think that could contribute here to a similar mentality, which says, "Oh, wait. If if NASDAQ's up 7% in 10 minutes because of a fake announcement, I mean, imagine what's going to happen on a on on a real announcement." And so I think that's probably enough for for for a bare market rally, which is kind of what I'm kind of what I'm betting on. The the issue is that I I I do think that these these tariffs are a lot stickier than people are giving them credit for, uh, you know, in in the in the long term. And so if if I start with that view and I go, okay, you know, Trump's been talking about tariffs for 40 years. He's finally he's finally got them in place. He really does like genuinely wants to increase manufacturing output of America. That doesn't happen in a situation where the tariffs immediately go away. Like I I think the rest of the world tariffs might be a negotiating tactic, but the tariffs with China I'm not so sure about. And so I think I think those end up those end up sticking, which is what I'm nervous about. But there's a lot of potential good news for the rest of the world that could come out in the next call it week or so which I think would send up the market a lot and you would see an extremely aggressive bare market rally. Yeah. Um Aby, I'm glad you brought up the China thing because I think that's really really important. Um the way I spent the hour before this live stream digging into um a few different press releases and stuff that happened today. We had uh the the Council of Economic Advisors chair Steven Moran had a speech and there were some some interesting tidbits in there that that paired with a friend of mine Danny Dean who's been on the show a bunch of times. He has a Substack. He put out this free note where he was gaming out the what is the big, you know, what's the big goal here? What's what are we actually trying to do behind all the chaos and the volatility? And he really thinks that this is about aligning Western countries to go after China at at full force. And you can, you know, you start to see that that that Cointelegraph analog headline this morning. You know, it it was so specific. It was so confusing for that to come out and not be real that, you know, you got to wonder if it was some sort of trial balloon because if it were to occur, I think it does make sense for okay, you know, let's we're keeping the 10% on everybody and then the reciprocal stuff. Let's get to let's get to the table and negotiate, get those deals done. But China, we're actually doubling down on you. And I think there's a lot of focus on on completely reshaping the economy and you know you can set aside your your personal opinions of the execution of all of this and I do think it's been been quite poor but I think there is some some valid pursuits that need to occur in in this reordering of the global economic order. I you know you you look at you know I'm Canadian. I'm I'm the victim of this idea of of you know trying to become the 51st state and this this pursuit of Greenland and the Panama Canal and uh you know I'm a total geopolitical LAR but you know you just think about what what are they trying to do in terms of just solidifying the western base to go against China in terms of these these capital and trade wars. And so I do think there's something there that we need to keep in mind. And to that point, I don't think this is something that just reverses randomly. Um, especially for China. I mean, I think the blue sky scenario for Trump is that you have extreme tariffs against China and, uh, negligible tariffs against everybody else. And based on the way things are already going, um, you know, early reports of Ursula von Lean coming to the table to negotiate a 0% for 0% free trade agreement with the United States. Japan, you know, Israel already lowered their tariffs to zero. I it doesn't seem out of the question to you know I it's optimistic for sure but it's not out of the question to say hey in three months there could be basically a new WTO that doesn't include China like the United States could have agreements with most major trading hubs Southeast Asia um you know including Japan uh the EU and Latam and Canada just you know this new sort of trade paradigm where there's no tariffs and then China could be 150% tariffs as that trading, you know, that sort of trade war escalates. I think that's what Trump's endgame is. And I think that the, you know, I I think a lot of people out there pretty much it's a universal consensus amongst the financial market participants both on Twitter and who I speak to in my circles that Trump has made a terrible decision. I don't my my bubble doesn't really include like the opinions of too many bluecollar um you know laborers in middle America just because I happen to live on one of the coasts and I worked in London and my background you know I would love to get the take of like somebody who's who's doing you know theoretically the main street type people that um Bessant is referring to saying this is helping. I'm not sure it helps them. I'm sure they I'm sure they're in favor of it, but like that that's not who we speak to um you know in the the forward guidance or the thousandx telegram rooms more like young kind of risk takingaking risk-taking types. So it's not clear to me whether this is a popular decision or not. But I think Trump is taking too much flak from the people that I speak to. I think that if obviously if this is the the beginning and the end of his strategy, he just hikes a bunch of tariffs, drops the mic, and goes golfing for the rest of his his term. Yeah, that's obviously terrible policy. It's a huge policy error and the economy is going to get destroyed. But I think instead of that, I my sense is that this is more like a, you know, Queens New York style real estate negotiation where somebody comes up to Trump and says, "How much for your building? It's not for sale uh a trillion dollars, right?" Like some some crazy stupid opening gambit. And um you know, as I close out this thought here, just one final boomer reference. I don't know how many of you youngsters have seen the movie Zoolander, but in it, uh, Hansel says, and I quote, "Don't you know I'm Loco, man?" Um, and I think that quote is kind of, uh, kind of what Trump's trying to do here. I think he's just gone so over the top to make everybody think, "Wow, this guy means business. He doesn't care. He's golfing today, um, in the midst of all this chaos." Like it does if if you were going to if you were going to like if you're a foreign leader who's just been tariffed and you're trying to decide between, hey, do I retaliate? Do I just wait this out? Do I try to come to the negotiating table? I think that Trump's crazy enough that that maybe it incentivizes coming to the negotiating table. So yeah, in that Steven Moran piece I mentioned, there was, you know, they they released the remarks and I'll just read out a couple points to tie in this whole, you know, game theory of of getting the western world together, getting the rest of the world to pay their fair share for this this US security guarantees. So he says, "In my view, to continue providing these twin global public goods, there needs to be improved burden sharing at the global level. If other nations want to benefit from the US geopolitical and financial umbrella, then they need to pull their weight and pay their fair share. the cost cannot be solely borne by everyday Americans who have already given so much. And so he also pairs in and says, you know, what forms can that burden sharing take? He gave these five options. So first, other countries can accept the tariffs on their exports without retaliation, providing revenue to the US. Uh second, they can stop unfair and harmful trading practices by opening their markets and buying more from America. Third, they can boost defense spending and procurement from the US, buying more US-made goods and taking strain off our service members and creating jobs here. Fourth, they can invest in and install factories in America. And fifth, which is the most interesting one for me, is he said they can simply write checks to Treasury that help us finance global public goods. So you hear all of that and then you see what's going on in terms of these ge geopolitical games that we're just speculating on at this point. But a lot of write write checks to the treasury. Yeah. That's that's which No. Okay. Yeah. But like think about what he's saying there is is you know we've heard this talk and a lot of it came from from him is like you know issuing these century bonds where other countries need to buy these hundred-year bonds you know that are zero coupon bonds. They get no coupon. you know, if if inflation goes up, they're just they're going to get wrecked on the price of those bonds. There's just a cost of doing business uh for those security gantries. That's their perspective. That's not my own. I'm just saying that might be how they're thinking about it. Yeah. I mean, it kind it kind of makes sense from that from that perspective. I mean, I'm just thinking out loud here. If uh if your goal as Trump is to isolate China and and attack China, you know what they're going to do? you know, they're going to be offloading uh a ton a ton of your debt and you need to figure out how to get people to buy it. Um and and and basically what what you're saying and what he's saying is that I'm going to I'm going to use you know, if if you go in there and you buy up a bunch of our debt, that's a way to get out of this for you. So, you know, he put he puts everybody in a tough position. He only wants one person to actually be there. But the, you know, the the selling of the treasuries that China is doing because he put everyone else in a tough position will be absorbed. I think maybe there's there's a little bit of that speculate that maybe there's a little bit of that game going on. Yeah, there is this whole idea, you know, today Treasury bond sold off pretty aggressively for where the market was at and there there are some people speculating that it was China selling. I I think it was more so just market dynamics. You know, we Friday the the market panic priced in outright recession. Um, and I think it's just, you know, some big players taking some profits, rotating, you know, target date funds, rebalancing from from bonds that have been doing well into equities, that sort of thing. But I think underneath there is also some validity to the idea that, you know, if we're getting into these into a capital war, um, the most powerful tool they have is to market sell bonds. So, it's a distinct possibility. I don't think it explains the entirety of the price action today, but it's definitely something to think about. No, it's it's something to think about. And I I mean, if if if you if you go with the if you go with the angle that he's he's really he's really thinking about this um you know, deeply. The only thing that makes sense that we've been able to come up with collectively is that he's he's targeting China and and he's he's targeting that area of the world. And so the the idea here would be a controlled demolition. Like what you don't you what you what you don't want to do is have them accumulate all of this leverage and basically sit on it until the moment where they could use it the most, right? Like imagine like imagine a a hot war breaks out and then suddenly like the financing costs on America's debt go through the roof because because of what China does. I mean you really you really don't you really don't want that. So might might as well for you know might as well force them out now you know when it's not you know the maximum pain to sell it and think back to co you know when we saw that supply chains were so dependent on China that is something that we didn't really solve since then a lot of this I mean there's no shortage of takes on why this is the stupidest economic move in history um you know the economist published an entire magazine to that effect it does you know just looking for positives here it does seem on a number of fronts like you know to give Trump the benefit of the doubt even if he doesn't deserve it um does seem like there there were a lot of band-aids that needed to be ripped off that he inherited you know um debt debtfueled sort of deficit spending um you know major supply chain deficiencies that to Aby's point you wouldn't want to work out in the middle of a hot war uh all this you know debt debt ownership uh in the wrong hands needing to get shifted to the right hands. It it's you know he if if you're looking to just continue with the status quo which you know the the economists forecasted would send America into bankruptcy by 2037 or something all else being held equal. You know he could have definitely cruised through his term without making any changes. he did get elected on not revolutionary but like you know kind of big change big change uh big talk about big change and so to some extent I feel a little bit stupid for not sniffing this out right I I came into this term feeling very bullish seeing the bullish reaction to his election as you know a signal that what he was going to do in his second term was going to be constructive markets just like it was during his first term I didn't quite grasp uh the monumental nature of what he was saying. You know, like to Aby's point, he's been talking about tariffs for 40 years. I didn't really grasp just how just how serious he was about it and how unabashed he was going to be in his execution. So, I don't necessarily blame him. He hasn't just like this. This shouldn't be a surprise and I'm I'm annoyed at myself that I kind of got caught wrong-handed on it. But now, now that we're here and markets are 20% lower, I maintain the view that I, you know, that we talked about when we were sitting on the floor at at um at DS in New York, Fij um I I do think that he doesn't have enough mandate to tank the stock market that much further from here before, you know, basically the midterms could get a blue wave and uh you know, maybe maybe he a supermajority in Congress could start uh bypassing his veto if this if this really becomes unpopular and too destructive. So yeah, I just, you know, I I think we're supposed to expect a U-turn. Jonah, I I felt I felt stupid as well because if if you really think about it, uh he he he fooled us in the same way that he's fooled so many people. Like he says so many outrageous things and then acts on a few of them and but but then you don't you don't take any of it seriously. And so, you know, we he kind of just comes in and we're like, "Yeah, he's a pro business president. Stock market's going to go up. all this other stuff that he's talking about. Yeah, he's talking a big game. Uh, you know, who who knows if they're actually going to do it. Um, but then then he actually does it. Uh, and that that that that was painful. What I what I will say to to bring this full circle back to back to Bitcoin, uh, this is actually pretty damn good for crypto. Uh, in in in the in not not even not even in the, you know, everyone says midterm to long term. I actually think this might be very good for crypto in the short term. Yeah. You know, like in the next like two months. Go on, Avi. Go on. Tell me more. I'm finally I'm finally I'm finally, you know, Jonah likes to say he's so bullish you can't see straight. Like I I can still see a little bit, but I'm I'm pretty damn bullish.

Um I Yeah, I do want to So, yeah, let's talk about that. And I also want to pair it with as traders how we're viewing what's priced in terms of these downsides. So, okay, we've we've come in with basically, you know, obviously there's the tail risk of further retaliation cascading, but for the most part, it feels like a lot of what's out in the market now is marginally the worst possible outcomes. you know, we're talking we we have 100% tariffs on China on the tape right now, right? So, it's like do we go to 200%. I don't know. Like, um, so you think about that and then, you know, we have we're on the other side now. We've crossed the Rubicon and now we're talking about negotiations. We got Scott Bessant. So, again, this was very notable for me because Scott Bessant has not been involved in trade talks. He's going to Japan to lead the trade talk negotiations with the with the US trade representatives. It's not it's not, you know, it's not Ludnik. They they had the Rottweiler out there for for bringing the stick out and whacking them, but now they're bringing in the carrot potentially. Um Scott Besson is a lot more measured in his approach. So, we're getting to that next phase now where the only real headlines are going to be negotiation ones. Um and are we priced for any sort of negotiation ones? And then looking at how that gets paired and you know, Bitcoin's been very resilient. And quick question. Quick question, Felix, on what you just said. Uh very quick question. Did you do you interpret you you tweeted that Bessant is going to negotiate with Japan instead of Lutnik? I interpreted your tweet to mean uh that Lutnik is getting sidelined in the Trump administration. Did you instead mean hey they've got the good cop Bessant and the bad cop Lutnik and they're sending in the good cop which means that they want to get a deal done like what did you mean exactly? Yeah, I'm 50/50. I think it's either we we don't fully know. It's either, oh [ __ ] you know, we got a 20% equity correction and bond yields are still surging. This is not a good trade-off for us. Let's pull let's let's let's sideline Letic get Besson in there. Or it's what you say, good cop, bad backup situation. Um, it doesn't really matter what the outcome is. The fact is that we're going to go marginally from this insane rhetoric to somebody who's a lot more measured. So, I don't know. I'm I'm 50/50, but I feel like the outcome is still the same on the margin of what's priced. What do you think? Um where I I'm expecting a bunch of trade deals and the market to go back up and I've been so wrong. I didn't expect that. I I thought this would be one of those little 5% uh sort of pullbacks that you can buy with both hands like like we've seen so many of since the global financial crisis. I did not expect this. So take what I say with a grain of salt. I I remain I I'm not selling a dime worth of worth of risk assets. I'm not selling crypto. I'm not selling equities. I think from here I I tend to believe a crypto will outperform equities. the BTC S&P ratio has has been more resilient than I would have expected. Uh it should very very very rare when it goes to the downside. I mean that out performance is very rare. Is that what's is that what's making you bullish in the short term, Obby? I I haven't heard you short-term bullish crypto in a while. Yeah, just because I've been short-term bearish for a while, but you know, and that's just because I haven't uh you know, my my framework on crypto, which I've repeated so many times that anyone that's listened to the podcast is going to get sick of hearing this, uh but it's it's value and momentum. Uh you know, in order for crypto to go up, you either need it to be going up already, uh and people buy into the momentum, or you need people to view it as a as a quote unquote value price. And there are two things that can turn Bitcoin into a value buy. Uh the first is price, just simply price itself. Uh you know, maybe maybe you go back down to $50,000 and we haven't psychologically you haven't seen $50,000 in such a long time that you think it's your only chance to ever go buy it. The level gets defended and then suddenly you're going back up. Uh or some good news comes out that is actually beneficial for Bitcoin and and beneficial for crypto. And I think that that's a little bit of what's happening right now. Regardless of what you think of when you know are the tariffs good are the tariffs bad regardless of any politics regardless if you think they're going to stay or they're going to go the reality is that we have kickstarted a slow roll into a deglobalized world and I think that is going to continue the the tides of nationalism are rising both politically you know politically geopolitically uh from on a local level on a on a on a national level people are becoming more concerned within themselves than they are. You know, nobody wants to be part of the global community anymore as much as they used to be. Um, and you're you're seeing this everywhere, but there's still a tremendous amount of demand to be interconnected globally. So if you shut down a ton of different pathways between countries and and a ton of different uh valves of commerce between countries but you may but crypto still exists uh then crypto inherently I think gains gains a piece of that pie because there's still demand um to hold crossber assets to be to be part of a global economy. Uh but if you're getting if if that's getting shut down weaker over the next 6 to 12 months then I think that the and because there are sources of demand that are getting shut down then bit then bitcoin goes up in that in that per and I think it's also outside of that just a fear trade. Um you know I think bitcoin went down and gold went down because of what we were talking about liquidations across the board. Uh but they're become, you know, they're both now geopolitically significant assets. Let me give you a concrete example. Let me give you a concrete example of of what you just said, Avi. So Bitcoin is a commodity. I think we can all agree. It's it's also a currency, but it has a lot of commodity- like characteristics. When you enter a multipolar world, commodities become valuable because they can be bartered by independent third party nations between two trade waring or hotwaring nations. So for example, take a commodity that I know well, crude oil, and take the country India, right? America and Russia don't do direct trade with each other anymore. Um, India can buy tons of Russian crude oil and tons of American products. Um, and they can, you know, they're they're kind of they're kind of like this trans shshipment hub in the global matrix of capital flows because they're able to buy Russian oil, right? Mhm. And as capital controls are a byproduct of tariffs and trade wars and del globalization to use Aby's word. Um you as as the world deglobalizes you need more trans shipment hubs just like what India's pul pulled out of their hat uh to sort of intermediate between Russia and America in the middle of that that scenario. So I think Bitcoin will end up being one of like kind of an alternative reserve commodity/currency that can intermediate uh between different geopolitical hemispheres. It makes a lot that's so interesting because I am bullish I agree with all that but I'm bullish on Bitcoin for some some other reasons as well. So, a couple actually during the digital asset summit during we did a live roundup and I asked um Quinn and Mike what was their you know one trade if they wanted to put forth and I put forth one as well and the trade I put forth was short Q's long Bitcoin vol you know V matched or delta matched or whatever you want to call it. Um and the reason was because NASDAQ and so US the US economy was pulling back on fiscal retrenchment. um the economy was slowing and on the other side of the equation was every other country was beginning to stimulate fiscally stimulate because of a reaction function to Trump tariffs negotiations. So at the time we saw Germany talking about a $500 billion you know defense spending and then now if we fast forward to today we have headlines sitting the tape about China frontloading stimulus to offset the tariff wars. So okay, Bitcoin is a global reflection of global liquidity and some other things as well. But that's one way to think about it. Q's are specific more to the US. So my idea was to short the Q's because it's, you know, every every signal is going in the wrong direction. The the Fed was complacent and not doing anything and they didn't want to get reactive or proactive, sorry, like they were in September and start to ease. The fiscal situation was deteriorating um and the economy was slowing. So, I was bearish on the NASDAQ, but I thought Bitcoin would outperform, relatively speaking. And and that's largely what happened. And I think, you know, I had that trade on. I sold it a little too early. It would have been a really great one to sell on on Friday when when Bitcoin was doing super well and NASDAQ was down 20%, but sold a little early, but the thesis remains. So, I think that that thesis will continue further. Um, Bitcoin is a global liquidity asset and every other country is going to have to stimulate now to offset the negative growth shocks that come from, you know, one of the smartest economists that I've seen, Brad Settzer, who he's he focuses on global trade. The way he framed this whole shock is imagine global oil rose 70 bucks overnight. Like, you understand what that means, Jonah? It's like the cascading effects are huge and and it does lead to lower growth that needs to be offset. So I think for that reason, Bitcoin has a lot of upside and I think that's been some of the resiliency. Now when I think about when I put my trader hat on on Friday, I was buying equities handoverfist and less so Bitcoin because I was worried you know that was when everybody was talking about the decoupling thing and you know Bitcoin was was doing its own thing and then you know pretty quickly it reverted to 76,000 this morning. So now that that's complete I'm a lot more excited Bitco Bitcoin. Um good job waiting that out. You you you were right about you were right to wait that out. I won't celebrate too much. I will say I bought a bit on Friday, so I did eat a bit of a [ __ ] sandwich, but yeah, I I did mostly wait till today. No, I think I think that's a really phenomenal thesis and I think I think that that that's accurate and I do think that'll continue to happen and ch China is going to do, you know, they're going to do it in a big way because they're they're going to have to. Um the the other thing is I you know given given all of that uh bit Bitcoin just from a trading perspective is in a great position from a riskreward uh you know just if if you're if you're constructing if you're constructing it out uh I mean basically who are the sellers of Bitcoin? Uh the sellers of Bitcoin are the people that have made a ton of money on it uh and and and want to get out or they're the short-term traders that want to get out uh you know because they think momentum is going down and they're short they're coming in and they're they're coming in and they're shorting the market. Uh if I go and I look at the order books, the order books are just ridiculously stacked from 65k to 70 from 73k. So I'm just talking about flows now. Um and when you you know one thing is that's that's really interesting. I think one of the reasons that Bitcoin did outperformed is because you had so much momentum and craziness in the equity markets. A lot of those people that were shorting NASDAQ, you know, that three months ago that would have shorted NASDAQ uh or short shorted Bitcoin to get catch a down move in NASDAQ or just shorting NASDAQ. That's what I'm trying to say. It's like a lot of the momentum traders were just focused on equities. They're like, I don't need to go sell BT more more BTC. There's no reason for me to go do that. Uh because I can just sell equities and they're down 5%. I mean, this is this is great. And I do think there's actually a lot of that just a lot of the pod shops will use Bitcoin, which is why which is why Bitcoin started selling off on Sunday in my personal opinion because and and and over the weekend because people wanted to bet like all these momentum guys, they wanted to bet on equities opening lower and how are you going to express that bet on a Sunday? You're going to sell you're going to sell Bitcoin. That's why Sunday morning it starts collapsing. Yeah. Bitcoin as as weekend spoo. But if Felix is right and Bitcoin starts to asym like basically decorrelate decouple from Q's and outperform to the upside. Oh my god. Like so yes, Bitcoin on decoupling, but I think front running of liquidity. Well, yeah, front running for sure. So basically the whole point of this the whole point of this rant um was that I think that there are the sellers have sort of exhausted themselves for this for this particular uh market right now. Uh and there are clearly a lot of buyers waiting. I mean the dip on Monday just got eaten up so so so so fast. Um yeah. So I'm I'm of the opinion that that that Bitcoin is both has all of the positive things that we just talked about and then also from a flows basis looks really good. Yeah. I mean value momentum framework. I talked some [ __ ] dude. I'm I I I literally Friday the actually as like as a crypto trader uh that that expresses edge like I just somehow I'm I'm just much better at trading crypto than I am at you know tra trading equities. obviously think it's an easier market. Like I was buying alts handover fist on Friday against ETH uh and BTC. So I was actually shorting the hell out of um ETH and buying and buying a ton of alts when they had that like massive uh ma massive collapse in on themselves. And that that's done that's done extremely well today. And I think that they what you have to look for in in these types of situations. Alts are alts are kind of like uh you know alts to Bitcoin are what Bitcoin are to equities. Like they'll they'll often actually bottom before Bitcoin does uh because they just everyone sells that first. Like everyone gets out of that that that first. Uh and so if you're expressing if you're expressing a view it is a lot of comments are saying fartcoin coded. It is fartcoin coded. If you're expressing a view that you think you're close to the bottom, uh, it's actually historically an extremely good trade uh, to try to buy buy alt and short Bitcoin and ETH against them because they tend to bounce way harder uh, on on on the on the way up and everyone's always worried about the downside, but if you're close to a bottom, you actually have like limited downside in alts in my personal opinion. or if you like view that you're like within a day or two because they've run out of sellers relative to BTC and ETH and that's actually what happened. So I tradcoin is an incredible asset to trade like it just all the all the attention is consolidated that you know when you want high beta in crypto and you don't want to go on purp. It's just like you just go buy Fcoin and it's it is crazy. I don't I don't understand it. I mean to be to be completely honest like I I did not buy any Forkcoin and I it like it was just nuts. I'm looking at it's up 20 23%. This thing is this thing's crazy. Forcoin is is the greenest thing on my board today. Also I think it's it's so just because of what it is. It will never be an institutional asset. Uh, like imagine buying Fartcoin at Millennium, losing money on it, and then your, you know, your division manager, your boss comes up to you and says, "You lost money on what, right?" Like that prevents that that skewed, you know, if you make money on it, who cares? But if you lose money on it, you're just out the door. You're sent packing. So, I don't think anyone at any company, even a crypto trading company, will buy it. It's really just purely purely a metric of retail sentiment. So, if that thing is bouncing 25% today, it's up more than any other major altcoin. Maybe uh maybe the dgens online have finally drawn a line in the sand and decided to buy stuff. I um I take your point though, Felix. I you know, you you bring up a very solid observation that crypto in general, Bitcoin in particular, is really just a reflection of global liquidity maybe lagged three months. So like M1 money supply is three months ahead of Bitcoin prices and M1 money supply bottomed out and started rallying pretty meaningfully about three months ago. So hey maybe you know if rates get cut from here plus that maybe we are in a more constructive general environment for Bitcoin. And to Aby's point um maybe the alt the altcoin apocalypse is is finally over. I you know we've been talking a lot about how inverse alt season is the new alt season. just be short everything. Looking at the prices of some of these coins, even though most of them are completely useless, I wouldn't want to be short anymore. It's you playing with fire at these levels. I mean, I think this is just for like flipping around. Sorry, what were you saying, Felix? Yeah, I was just going to say that the framework I have is that we can get we can get a Bitcoin all-time high just on this marginal improvement of global liquidity. But, you know, without the US, but I think for meaningful breakouts in Bitcoin and for alts to really start to perform, we do need the US to to start to play ball. And the picture from the Fed side of things and and the liquidity side of things is is a bit hairier. Um, you know, I I I interviewed Michael Howell, who's like the liquidity guy, um, a couple weeks or a week ago, and, you know, he he has some really interesting statistical analysis of of Bitcoin correlation to global liquidity, and yeah, he thinks, you know, there's an interim upside tailwind for it, but things get really hairy in the spring/fall. And I agree with that. Now what we have to piece apart now is that okay well if we have markets totally falling apart like you know the reason they're not meaningfully moving is because they're scared of inflation but if you look at forward facing inflation metrics you know inflation the one good part about a hit of 20% to equities is that in my opinion is the last shoe that needed to be dropped for inflation to come back down to target. um that paired with oil, you know, breaking down meaningfully. It's it really broke a really key level. I think it's like 60 bucks now and, you know, could trend lower. I don't know if you have thoughts on that, Jonah. But overall, like you pair those dynamics, inflation is is is is done. There's going to be the price level increase from tariffs up front. But if you look at say if you look at the inflation swaps market, like the one-year inflation swaps are a bit higher, but every other swap 10 or past that, they're all cratering. Um so yeah, inflation is is is pretty much done. So you could see them start to to ease a bit more, but I think they need to wait for that to come out into the hard data unless or markets fall apart even further and then they have to intervene quickly. Um, yeah, there's really only one threat, like just since you brought up oil, there's really only one threat on the table for higher oil prices, and it's still just some kind of flare up in uh in the Persian Gulf, some sort of kinetic warfare, maybe a American Israeli operation to take out Iranian nuclear sites in subsequent retaliation. But like absent that, um, oil's going oil's going down another 10, 20 bucks. um the front spread um is still in backwardation, meaning that the front future the price is higher than the price of the second future. That's called backwardation. That's a sign that the market's still a bit constrained, which is bizarre because, you know, the price of oil has sold off so much. You would normally expect uh prices to fall in a surplus market, which is associated with contango, meaning price now cheaper than price later. It's weird that you're getting a sell off in backwardation. I think that that tells you that um the OPEC OPEC plus countries of the world are still trying to prop the thing up which means that they eventually can get stopped out of their trade as they often have let a bunch of excess supply into the market and then uh then prices really tank. So like from a just a fundamental supply and demand perspective uh the story of oil is the story of many commodities. The Bloomberg commodities index had its biggest three-day drop in a while over the last three days. I I think I think inflation is not unless you get inflation's done. Unless you get a hot war like it's really hard to imagine inflation coming back here 100%. So when's the when's the Fed going to cut? When are they going to cut cut our rates to zero and pump our bags? What's going on here? Well, that's the thing like and this is the whipsaw in in the bond market and like the stir market like short-term uh interest rate market is Friday they they priced you know I think we're at four and a half cuts pretty quickly. We didn't quite get there for a May cut. I think that's still you know it's still a ways away honestly. Um, I think I think we may see some language that gets us pretty close to a May cut or at least some language in that May in that May meeting that'll lead to some meaningful cuts. But, you know, like let's just look here where the two the two-year yield is actually interesting. It reverted a lot, but it's still at 3.78 and Fed funds is at 4.33. So, you know, there's there's there's quite a bit of cuts being priced in versus the rhetoric that came like Powell had a speech on on Friday and he sounded like he was not interested at all in cutting, but the market's fading that, you know, I think we're back to like around three and a half cuts priced, which seems fair for not going into a recession. Um, and that's sort of the battle going on in bond markets right now. Exactly. Well, that's 80% or something, 75% this year. Well, Can you can you help me understand what what uh JPA is thinking? Why wouldn't he cut? I think so. I think he Yeah, I think he's ecstatic about a 20% hit to equities because you know Catrini, if you guys read him, he has some really incredible analysis and he's been doing a lot of work on this idea of the economy being propped up by the top 1% really the asset owners of the world in this K-shaped world. And um the bottom 20% or sorry the bottom like 80% or whatever have been in a soft recession for a few years now. The consumption is not coming from them. It's coming from asset owners who keep getting richer and then keep spending because assets keep going up and they're also getting four and a half% on their cash. So I think the biggest reason we haven't seen inflation come back down to target is literally stock prices. Um also fiscal deficits as well. Um but we're seeing both of those revert now. So yeah, I think he wanted to see this. It reminds me a lot of 2018 where, you know, NASDAQ equities went down 20%. And then Pal pivoted. Um, and I think he didn't want to he didn't want to do that pivot on Friday because he has optionality until May. But I think he just needs to hold that line and make sure that inflation stays durably low here because if he starts talking Dove now a month and a bit before the meeting that's not really going to do anything useful for him. Um but if he can make sure that inflation gets durably bottomed out he can then come in with confidence I think in May onwards. So I think he's just playing a fake game in the meantime just to make sure that this is this is the one that actually kills inflation. So, I think that's a non-conensus view versus a lot of people who think Paris is going to create this huge amount of inflation. Um, yeah, but I just I don't see it. That's a really uh helpful take. I hadn't thought of it that way, like that he's kind of playing Fed theater, but it makes a lot of sense. And I agree with you. I also I think that even though sticker prices will go up on certain foreign goods as a result of these tariffs, I don't think we're going to see broad-based inflation as a result of it. If anything, I think the economic cooling effect will result in the opposite. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, like, you know, you could walk us through different oil shocks, but if if you see 70 bucks rise overnight, like, yes, that'll that'll hurt some inflation initially, but really it's a growth thing that comes afterwards, right? Yeah. Yeah. I I think that we are in for a lot of volatility. So to borrow one of Bobby's ideas, cash is is worth a lot more right now than it was three weeks ago. Um sort of play the highs and the lows. I I do think I I I don't believe Larry Frink when he says that markets could drop another 20%. I think that if uh if SPY is down 20% from here, it's like Trump is is a lame duck for the next three and a half years. And that's not I think he realizes that he's got that intuition and that's not what he wants. Now, I didn't I didn't expect things to get this far, but we're kind of flirting with the lows that I was uh predicting few weeks back as like a worstc case scenario. Like I thought this was a 5% probability, but possible and I thought that anything below here was just sort of out of the question. I kind of maintain that belief. Um I I just I just don't think there's enough political capital in the world for a president to tweet the stock market down more than 30%. Come on. Yeah. Um yeah. Yeah. And I mean like getting back to the trader mindset part is you know we can do all this this big brain talk of you know 40 trust game theory Julical stuff but it's also like if you get a VIX at 50 and equity is down 20% you sort of just have to buy a bit um that just those are just times when you just buy a bit and yes it can turn into a bare market rally. I'm pretty closely watching whether that's the case to get out of those. But yeah, I do I do feel like you just need to get in the front of this thing and you know, eat those [ __ ] sandwiches for a bit. A agreed wholeheartedly alternative. There is no alternative. You like where's the cash going to go? Like it has to go somewhere. Cash keeps getting generated and like people aren't going to put it into foreign equities. They're down 20% too. Like it's the the the other thing that you know people tell people talk about all the time. It's like Trump Trump's not doing this for for for the for the rich for Wall Street. You know, he's he's he's doing he's doing this for Main Street. But I think 60% of Americans own equities. It's like clear majority own equities. And uh you know if equities are off too far for too long consumption I mean the recessions are going to be horrific because all of the like what you were saying all of the consumption comes from the the the top uh 20%. So you know I I I do I do think that there there is a point where even even Trump feels pain. Yeah. Um but you know I I I agree VIX VIX at 50 equities down 20. Like take take a stab. Don't don't be don't be a don't be a don't be a [ __ ] Just like by a little bit. Just get in front of it, man. This is what we live for. Like it's just this is what we do. Just just stop. Like don't get behold. That's all all I'll say. Just whatever you do, do not get behold. You know, at at some point everything's going to start going back up again. Like don't don't worry. You know, this is this is not about betting on global collapse. This is about figuring out when this particular show is going to end. Yeah. All right, guys. Well, that was a lot of fun. It's good to catch up again. Yeah, this was great. Thanks for having us on. Yeah, likewise. Always good to do these collabs and chop it up. Thanks everybody for watching, too. That was awesome. Thanks. Yeah, thanks for dropping by. Adios. [Music]

Transcript Text:
I think you just have to remember that this market is the market that you take profit in very quickly. You get a little bit of pop and then you're out. You just you just shove it out. Uh and that's how I'm looking at trading this trading this market right now. I mean, honestly, I think like get getting short here still is like, you know, can you can honestly probably short ETH at this point get get down to like 1500. This episode is brought to you by Kraken OTC. Get access to 247 trading services for high- netw worth individuals and institutional clients to execute orders over $50,000. You'll hear more about them later in the show. [Music] And we're live. H happy liberation day, Avi. Happy liberation day. Are you are you enjoying being liberated from your wealth? Yeah. Yeah. I'm uh I feel liberated from my hopes, my dreams, my money, my future. Uh this is a pretty scary feeling for sure. But I guess the whole point of these tariffs isn't to help out. Um bros like us. No, it's not. And it's not I mean I guess what I'm struggling to figure out is who exactly it's designed to help. Uh, but what's really interesting is that we're we we now collectively get to experience something that people haven't really experienced since World War II, which is a complete re-imagination of America's place in the world and an upending of world economic order to a degree that, you know, was, I think, basically would have been unheard of four years ago at the, you know, even even two years ago. at this point just because I I don't think people took this this tariff stuff that seriously from Trump. I mean, look, even even the even leading conservative voices are like, "What what the hell are you doing, Trump?" Yeah. Um, you know, he he clearly he clearly has a plan in in his head. Uh, you know, hopefully the tariffs are not going to go into effect for another four days. I think April 6th and April 9th are the two major days that uh he he put out in terms of implementation of tariffs and so we have a little bit of wiggle room. Hope I think what he's hoping for is that people are going to come out and say all right we don't want to deal with this. Um you know we'll take our tariffs off, you take your tariffs off and then everyone returns to a free trade world. But uh you know for now it's it's hairy. It's it's it's definitely very hairy out there. I think, you know, I've been I've been fairly quiet. I don't think I've tweeted in like two weeks. That's cuz I haven't had really anything interesting to say. Um, you know, I think this just goes back to the framework that I always discuss. Uh, right now the momentum is down, you know, and we're not clearly at value levels because, you know, you have the you have the equity market puking out below us. you have uh you know altcoin sort of sort of bleeding. We're down you know we're down about 15% from the highs on NASDAQ. Maybe another 5 to 10% to go. I do think that BTC below 80 is a good buy midterm but other than that I mean I just don't really have any strong convictions in the market. I don't know. I I I do think we're closer to the end just because like well what what what else is there to do at this point? Uh but yeah, I mean what do you think? Yeah, I think that like this may be the flush that marks the bottom. I think this is what you buy. Um you know, I've been I I didn't really see this sell-off coming. You're not always right as a trader. So definitely, you know, there's when you when you say, "All right, this is it. this is the time to buy and you've said that a couple of times on the way down there's sort of this risk that like you know your credibility is a bit damaged but you know I have been recommending Bitcoin I haven't recommended other alts and Bitcoin's not really that deep in the can right now it's you know we're trading where we were you know just like a few hours ago realistically like We're on March 31st the lows were 81. Now we're 83. So it's not really like that crazy to buy this. I think Bitcoin is showing relative strength right now. And I think that you're supposed to take heat of that. Another thing is like you know just having been a you know you'll probably res this will probably resonate with you too. like just having been a business person, it's um I think it's a little bit shortsighted to to fault Trump for the immediate impact of these tariffs. Like I can I I can sort of empathize with the idea of having a more nuanced multi-part strategy than just like everything I I say and do has to make the stock market rally that that minute or that hour. like I can see maybe a long game being played here where the tariffs are hiked there's some pain uh there's some contraction other countries you know enter into negotiations and then ultimately what ends up happening is you know the tra the global trade picture looks a little bit fairer tariff tariffs come back down and in the midst of the turmoil uh the Fed has a little bit more scope to cut rates so you know I don't think I don't think we're we're going to enter like a crazy recession as as a result of this. I think it's more just like the kind of situation that you look for when you're when you're trying to like as a markets person, like the kind of situation that you try to have to understand the rationale for rather than like just feel annoyed about your static long portfolio. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, I I understand what you're talking about. I mean, sort of two two points here that I want to make. One is I I I don't think I think Trump could have played this as a long game a lot better. I think coming out and basically saying I'm going to take on the entire world at the same time is a little little silly. I think that was him trying to get things done too fast. If he had gone region, even just region by region, if not country by country, and tried to negotiate with them and used his stick to negotiate, it might have been a smoother ride. But I also understand that he, you know, he he wants he he does want there to be pain. I think that that's like part part of the calculus. Um but that with with with all with all that said, right, we know that he wants there to be pain. um you know, but we know that he can't have too much pain because he's he's the stock market president and no matter no matter how much I think they jawbone about not looking at the market and looking at the yields, uh I think that they they do care about the market at the end of the day. Um you know, that's also a barometer for how presidents are measured. And we know this guy has a reasonably large ego. And so if the market's down 30% to start his presidency, I I think that he's going to be he's going to be looking at that and going, "All right, maybe, you know, I got I got to fix this for my image." Um because what he what he what you don't want is you don't want to get elected in and then immediately have the market nuke because of because of your policies and then you kind of lose a mandate to govern because people lose faith in you and he needs to he needs to avoid that situation. Um, yeah, with with with all with all of that said, I mean, ETH is like B basically als RWA alts are doing are doing okay. Um, kind of just [ __ ] across the board. They're just not going to be there just won't be any buyers for these things at all until Bitcoin gets back above 90. Um, basically these things can have these, you know, can can have bounces, but they're straight line lower until VIX is down and the market relaxes. I mean, this is just it's just a a [ __ ] a [ __ ] time to be to be an alt, but So, are you saying that inverse alt season is still the new alt season? Yeah, I'm saying I'm saying the inverse alt season looks honestly it looks pretty damn good. But I mean, I've got my eye on a few things that I think could still do well. Um, you know, if you just give them give them a little bit of time. I've got my little RWA basket that I've been talking about. Uh, you know, with the the pen the Pendles of the world, the you know, Pendle, Plume, Curve. I'm sort of waiting on good levels for them to start adding and I' I'd be adding that against ETH because I I do think these things over the next year are going to gain a lot of traction just because of the regulatory clarity that's coming. But other than that, I I'm I'm pretty much cashed up. Um you know, waiting for spots to deploy because you know place to be. What was crazy about today is like how badly the Wall Street Journal rugged the entire complex including equities because are down more than Bitcoin. Did you see this? Like equity futures are down 3.2%. Bitcoin's down 2.6%. This episode is brought to you by Kraken OTC, one of crypto's longestr running exchanges with over a decade of experience.

Yeah, I think some of that what is it? GME buying. Yeah, which was good. You know, keep keeping keeping that up. But did you see you see the Wall Street Journal, they came out with an article at 4 p.m. that said that the tariffs are going to be 10% which is lower than estimates and then everything just gigaped. Yeah. And then immediately it came out that that was false. Oh my god. Yeah, it's crazy. The whole market was sort of like the markets opened up today. I think everybody was expecting this to be like a Well, it was like a sell the rumor, buy the news kind of thing. And then Trump just came out came out swinging. I mean, what what are the all-in tariffs on China now? Is it like a 100%? Obviously, it's not something 50. It's I think it's 54%. So it's 34% new in addition to the 20% that already already is there. I'm not Hold on. Let me let me just quickly basically one of my one of my contacts is Ryan Peterson who runs flexport and he was saying remember these duties that were announced are on top of existing duties. So for China, you have original duty of 7 and a half to 25% duty from section 301, 20% from earlier this year, 34% today, and then he said 25% for China's purchases of Venezuelan oil. So that's over 100%. So it's 54% higher to buy Chinese goods than it was at the before Trump was elected, but there are still other duties floating around there. Like some of these I'd like to see a list of all-in tariffs. Like these are these are some savage numbers. And Avi, I want to get your take on this. Like my my take is that my take is that it will not result in I think I think consumption will drop as a result of this. Like I think that economics 101 will kick in and higher prices will result in lower demand. And ultimately, I think that like yes, everybody's profit margins will get squeezed and yes, prices of certain goods will will be higher, but like I don't think that I don't think that people are just going to pony up and spend this extra money. I think it's really going to crimp consumption um which will obviously trickle down into other recessionary type type looking data. What do you think? You're on mute. I I think that I think that you're right on that on that point. I mean, you as as we've discussed before, tariffs don't, you know, it's not it's not just a tax on foreign goods, it's a tax on domestic goods as well. It's just consumption in general. Uh, and without without wages going up, I mean, what we're what we're going to see is I think we're actually going to see like a reasonably deflationary effect overall from this. Um, one of the main reasons I think that is because if you look at the levels of consumption, uh, the people earning more than $250,000 a year make up a much larger percentage of consumption than they have in the last 40 years. And with the stock market going down, those are the those are the people that hold assets. I mean, I mean, I know just like myself, like I'm like I'm poorer today than I was yesterday. So, uh, I'm I'm definitely going to be saving money a bit more, right? So, it's like it's like a natural thing, right? Yeah. It's like, uh, you know, I'm looking I'm looking at buying a house right now. It's like, okay, well, like, how much money do I want to spend on a house? the answer is a little bit different today than it was. Uh I mean not actually but you know just as you feel you you know you feel like okay well maybe I should be a little bit more frugal you know now that now now that I'm 15% poorer than I was 3 months ago. You know I think it's funny like I I I think that what got Joe Biden fired from his job wasn't the dementia. It wasn't the policies. It was just inflation that occurred during his term. And so I think that, you know, the Republicans are going to basically be subject to the same medicine if if we have inflation, going have to take the same medicine. So I I kind of agree with you. I think that while, you know, sticker prices on certain foreign goods will inflate, the overall impact of these tariffs on the economy will be, you know, a cooling effect, not a this won't heat things up. This won't cause consumption. Uh this is like reverse stimulus. So basically it'll like basically what I think is coming next is a tax cut package. I think that you know okay they basically just introduced a massive tax on consumption. Now they're going to have to cut taxes somewhere else. Otherwise they're just kind of like people that hike taxes which is not what they were elected to do. And that's not really their branding. They're the tax cut party. They always have been. So I think we should expect bullish tight news for crypto from here. Like if if Trump manages to cut taxes to zero for everybody who's earning under 150k, which is the plan. You know, Bessant's gone out and said that. Let's gone out and said that. Like let's say they get close to that. That's pretty bullish for things that retail likes to yolo like crypto, you know. Um, what gets worse from here before the the stuff starts to get better? Like it it's hard to imagine anything happening that's worse than this and Bitcoin's holding up pretty well. I don't know. It to me the setup looks bullish. Yeah, it's it's a good it's a good thought exercise, right? I mean, whenever you have whenever you have a narrative in the market that's causing fear, you have to ask, well, how old is that narrative? And, you know, for for a while, I think which is why which is why we got a balance. um for for a bit up until Trump announced this whole liberation day BS is that all of the all of the bad news had been absorbed and there wasn't new bad news to come and then Trump comes out and goes well there's by the way uh liberation day is coming soon I'm going to be tariffing everybody I was like oh market's like okay [ __ ] I I guess that's new bad news we can we can go back down but now we're at a point where okay we're we're done again you know we we've hit we've hit all the bad news um and so then the questions are like what are you know sort What are what are the knock-on effects? And then what are what are the ways out? Uh and then what's more likely? And what do I mean by that? Well, ways out mean how does this situation resolve itself? How does it how does it get better? Uh it gets it gets better uh if Trump walks back the tariffs or if there's negotiation room. Um or if just nothing changes and and data and data remains constant. But both of us think that consump consumption is going to be hit. Um, I think that the basically the only way that they avoid a recession is if they actually do manage to pass like a reasonable amount of tax cuts. Otherwise, I think by definition like we're it's very hard to see us not heading into a recession, which might which might be, you know, very possible. They they pass big tax cuts and then the tariffs get removed and then we go up in a straight line for forever and always until the end of the Trump presidency. Um, but he he has boxed us into a little bit of a tough position here. I mean, these these tariffs are pretty extreme, Jonah. These are some pretty nasty tariffs. These are big ones. I mean, put it this way, Obby. Uh, a guy in the chat says, "Why do you think there won't be a recession?" Let me respond to that and respond to what you just said. I don't think there will be a recession because unlike every other flirtation with recession that I've experienced in my 20 years in markets, this is the first one that's intentional, like self-inflicted, intentional, like predictable. Like normally it's [ __ ] out of left field. It's COVID. It's um oh my god, like a subprime mortgages. No one even thought about that until it was too late, you know, or um you know, flash crash or all these random things that happened over the years. This is the first time where like a bunch of politicians, policy makers, and technocrats have like gotten together and created a managed recession. And because this is like man-made, like it feels like the timing is so kind of obvious when you look at it that way. It's it's like if you're going to take some painful medicine, keep using this medicine analogy, you do it right at the beginning when you're you're still on your honeymoon period and people are giving you a little bit of grace. your first 100 days. You don't just like let this malaise continue into the midterms and then get destroyed and then let it continue another two years and then get thrown out of office in disgrace having not completed your agenda and having your legacy tarnished or destroyed. Like, no, you rip the band-aid off while you can, which is immediately, and then you start to rebuild the foundations that you you were elected to rebuild. So, this is not a partisan comment. Like, this is not something that that's like me trying to defend Trump. I'm just sort of like reverse engineering what's happening here. And the reason why I think that we won't end up in a recession is because since this was created in an entirely manufactured artificial fashion, it can be unwound just as easily. None of this, like none of these tariffs can't be unwound. None of this is creating a beast that the Trump administration can't control. Foreign countries will always be happy to sell their goods to America, the world's largest consumer, uh, at any price, tariffs or no tariffs. It's not like this is doing any permanent damage. So, if we start to like get into real trouble territory for the S&P, I don't think Trump's just going to like stick it to the American economy. Like it's not it's not just rich people who own assets. It's like businesses are assets. And if everybody's stock price is in the toilet, like hiring slows down, wages get cut, people get fired. Like it's it's a it's bad times. Like Trump's not an idiot. The people around him for the most part are aware of these basic economic realities. So be, you know, just in some because this is man-made. It can be undone just as quickly as it gets done as it was done. And it probably will be if things get too detrimental, which I you know, maybe they will, but I I dou I doubt that this spirals into something crazy. Yeah. I I think I mean what you hope for is that it just doesn't spiral out of control, right? I mean, it's it's it it's one thing uh some some things end up being sticky, right? For example, if there's a significant amount of job loss and that's what prompts everyone to be like, "Okay, [ __ ] now." You know, we're we're we're heading we're heading into a recession, we should probably reverse these tariffs or do or do something about it. Some of that stuff's sticky, right? Um like some of those jobs just won't won't be won't be coming back. Um so there is, you know, there's I think a time limit on this sort of stuff. I do I I do tend to heir on the side of yes this is this is a flush and this and this will be over. A lot of people right now like in this moment are pointing out that BTC is holding. Basically every single time I see NASDAQ down a ton and BTC is holding that just means that there's a delay because there's an idiosyncratic buyer in the market. And this time we actually know the idiosyncratic buyer. It's GME. So, basically what I'm trying to say is like don't don't put too much weight on that. Um, you know, I'm like I'm not a buyer at 83. I'm a buyer at 78, you know, and I know that's, you know, five five, you know, 5%. It's not not a huge difference, but if you're a trader, makes sense, right? Like, this is actually a phenomenal market. If you want to trade, all you have to do is just trade at extremes. Like if you get if you get a billion dollars of liquidations or you get if you get a 10% down day from ETH or you know an 8% down day from BTC which is very possible that's that's a buy. That's like a all right let's let's let's let's wave it in and then sell some on the sell some on the on the pop. I mean, and this market, I think you just have to remember that this market is the market that you take profit in very quickly. Like, basically, you get you get you get a little bit of pop and then you're out. You just you just shove it out. Uh, and that's how I'm looking at trading this trading this market right now. I mean, honestly, I think like getting getting short here still is like, you know, can you can honestly probably short ETH at this point, get get down to like 1500. I feel like ETH is going to triple digits. Where does the Ethereum Foundation get liquidated again? I wonder. I I I haven't been following it back. I don't know. But 1,200 or something was the rumor. We're trading 1788 right now. That asset is just cursed. It's down 6%. Yeah, totally. Totally cursed. I mean, like I I can easily see 1500 shortly in that thing. Even if BTC holds like if BTC holds the low, but it sells off to uh 77. I mean, I think ETH is at 1500 in that case. I would say lower than that, which is very possible. I mean, some puts puts are probably, you know, if if you're worried about your portfolio, puts are phenomenal here because this is it's it's this type of situation where you just have to be humble with your own skills and you got to say, I don't know what's going to happen. This is a once in a 80year event and you should probably not take massive swings or do anything too crazy with your portfolio unless something like truly nuts is happening in the market and minus 3% from BTC today is not truly nuts. Yeah, that's that that that's my take. This episode is brought to you by Kraken OTC, one of crypto's longestr running exchanges with over a decade of experience.

Equally, as a response to that take, if we get a flush, that's the flush that like like let's say that let's say that Bitcoin really flushes. Let's say it goes down to 75K. I I would think it'd be crazy not to buy that. I What? What news is going to come out next? With what money, Jonah, you said you're all in cash, Avi. I mean, I Yeah, but you you've been buying you've been buying the dips. I mean, I I I haven't blown my entire wad. Let's put it that way. Like, I I I really I'm careful about not blowing my entire wad. I I have made some money on shorts. I've traded in and out of If you need a place to stay, let me know. Jonah, hobby, it's over. Just throw in the towel. No, I mean honestly like I I'm fine because I follow the advice that we give again and again on this podcast, which is don't use leverage. Uh don't don't bet more than you can afford to lose. We're still doing we're still above like Trump's election levels. I was happy then, slightly happier now, just disappointed that we're not like immediately mooning into his first 100 days. Now I I just like let's it I can see why why the world is pissed off. The world the markets participant world is pissed at Trump right now. Let's just sit here and and war room this situation. How like what could what's something that could happen that could make this worse? Like for example I let me just think of something crazy. Let's say that China's like all right we're just hiking our tariffs another 50%. And then Trump responds by hiking tariffs on China by another 50%. And now suddenly like, you know, your cheap Chinese crap on Amazon is, you know, more than twice as expensive as it used to be, right? I guess that's the the big risk. That's that's what you're afraid of if you're if you're Yeah, you can short altcoins with confidence. A lot of them are just going to zero. But Bitcoin or stocks, if you short that here, what are you hoping for? What do you you're hoping for that, right? I mean, what what what you're really what you're really hoping for bit Bitcoin's Bitcoin is just going to follow equities at this point. So, really, what you're asking is, you know, what what stops equities from going lower? And equities right now are just pricing in a reasonable contraction in GDP because of lower lower trade and lower consumption. At least I think that's I think that's what's happening. Um, and that is very plausible. I mean, here's here's the reality of the situation. We don't know what the [ __ ] is going to happen with these tariffs. Like, we don't we can guess, but when's the last time that we had tariffs this extensive put on uh goods? I mean there are arguments to be made that it doesn't matter that you know a lot of people are reasonably price you know a a lot of this consumption is reasonably price insensitive uh and you know what it what it actually eats into is it eats into the savings of Americans I don't know that's a stupid argument in my personal opinion uh but it it is an argument that you can make because who the [ __ ] knows uh when it when it comes when it comes to this you can maybe uh it produces American innovation suddenly figure out the next months how to produce the same slop at they're right because they're putting R&D into it. Maybe a bunch of companies build factories here or like Yeah, exactly. Like who like genuinely like who the who the [ __ ] knows? But that's kind of the issue, right? Like the issue is that nobody knows. Um, and with that in mind, uh, like the most likely outcome is that you do end up in a recession because you do have a massive a massive hit to consumption at least in the in in the short run. And so I think that's that's what the market is responding to like that that's what everyone is so is is so is so nervous about it. Um, you know, and you kind you kind of need like you you you need the ship turned around uh by stimulus in some in some way, right? Yeah. And maybe that stimulus is coming. I mean, I don't think it's to say that. I think it would be weird if the like they pretty they've been pretty open the administration about how they're not just going to hike taxes and then walk away without doing anything else. Like this is all part of an extremely well telegraphed agenda. Most of which is relatively stimul stimulatory. No taxes on tips, no taxes on any income under 150k. Like, we're going to lower income taxes across the board. We're going to give you bigger state and local income tax deductions. Like, we're going to going to pump domestic manufacturing. We're going to move unproductive people in the government into productive parts of the, you know, private economy. So I again like you know if you're short right now what are you hoping for? I with all of the information that's been priced in today you know lower earnings are priced in lower consumption is priced in. Oh we we have perfect information on what happened in the past. what what you're hoping for if you set a fresh short on Bitcoin and S&P at current levels and those two are trading with very high correlation right. Yeah. I mean what what what you're hoping for on BTC I think is like okay so I I wish I could share a chart here because all right let me just finish the sentence. You're hoping that the government loses control of this. You're hoping that that this spirals out of control and even if they, you know, even if stocks are down 10%, the government brings the tariff uh tariffs back down to zero that some beast has been let out of its cage that cannot be controlled. That's what you're hoping for if you set a fresh short. Well, you know, hoping I mean betting on betting on I think I think I think it's a better better phrasing. Hopefully, you're not hoping for anything when you trade. Um, but like on on Bitcoin, if you go to the 3-day chart, it's actually just such a clear short setup. Um, from a from a technical perspective, you get you you basically you get to stop out above 88 and you get to target the previous highs of 73. So you have a, you know, 7% move to the top side, uh, 10% move to the downside. seems reason like that, you know, that seem pl and and you have the momentum on your side, which makes the riskreward better. That that just seems like a a reasonable trade that a reasonable trader could could take. Um, with, you know, with with S&P, I think what you're what you're betting for is you're you're betting on a like a one-touch of 5,000. Uh, and and you can and you can get out. And I don't, you know, the the the way the way that this is the way that this is going to play out is uh all of the fears are going to be front-loaded. Like this is going to this is going to end uh by Monday of next week. My personal opinion um like whatever whatever price action is going to happen is going to get priced in by by mon by Monday of next week. we're going to get some move over the weekend which is likely going to be negative if there's no change in the news. Uh and then you get the flush on Monday and then you're going up straight. Um that's my that that's that's my take because you need again you need more bad news to come out. It can't just be the same thing over and over and over and over. Earlier in today's episode, I mentioned Ledger's latest products, the stacks and flex.

I think like I agree with Yuan Leu in the chat. SPX touching 5,000 would be a gift. Like you what matters is the second derivative of the news, not the news that just came out, right? Like is the news going to get worse from here or better? Hard to imagine it gets worse. I don't know. I I I I you know I tend to have a bullish bent because over the course of my career like I started in ' 07 there was the immediate global financial crisis and then the stock market basically rallied in a s straight line from 666 all the way up to 600 0 right that's like you know nearly a 10xer so I I've built my career over a period of time where if I had been a perma bear or even a perma range trader on risk assets, I wouldn't have been able to sustain my 20-year career. I would have gotten blown out. So, I tend to have a bullish bent. But there's method behind the madness. Like, it's not just that, oh, I I grew up over a bull run, so I'm a bull. No, it's like something very important happened in '08. Something gamechanging like as important, I would say, as the US going off the gold standard in the 1970s. What happened in 2008 was that the United States of America uh and governments around the world in parallel decided to underwrite risk in the economy. That was sort of like a first and I don't think that that genie can be put out put back in the bottle without stocks going straight back down to 666. So, I think that if things really get bad, which this isn't like having seen actual recessions and actual crazy sell-offs, this move in stocks from 6,000 to 5,500 doesn't seem that crazy to me. Like th this feels totally tolerable. And in Bitcoin, going from $108,000 for one unit of our magic internet money to $83,000 for one unit of our magic internet money. Like that though, that's not crazy, right? If things get actually crazy, I think we're backs stopped. And this just isn't that crazy. Frankly, I think Trump was was right to to rip off this band-aid. Sorry. Not right in the sense that like I agree with what he's doing because I I don't necessarily, but like his calculation that he could get away with it now will probably be proven correct. Yeah. I mean, I think ba basically what you're basically what you're trying to say is this is this is a this will be a short-lived crash. like this this is this is not the destruction of an economic system that's going to take you know you know there's there's in in your words it's not going to be uh one failure then another failure then another failure then another failure there's not going to be a lean and an AIG there's just going to be this is this is going to happen there's going to be a cascade and then we're done um yeah I I tend to agree with that I think the only thing is figuring out where like where we're done um and that that's what we've been trying to debate is like when when does when does the bad news end? Maybe what you're supposed to do is stay on the sidelines and then start buying good news when it comes out like when the administration starts doing things that are supportive of markets then you can you can start buying. I don't know but then they might come out and do another you know you know what's done really well gold. Yeah. 3200 like gold is insane. Remember when the target for Bitcoin was a gold market cap of 10 trillion. Mhm. Now gold is a $22 trillion asset. It's pretty it's Hold on. Let's see. I mean, gold is gold is 30. That's It's just so insane, man. Oneway train. Like just straight one way like over the last year. Just straight up. I'm glad I own a ton of gold. You do? Yeah. Why? I I don't understand that one. I've never been a very good gold trader. Uh I don't own gold uh in in like my investment portfolio. I own a bunch of physical gold. And by a bunch, I mean I own like a substantial amount of money in physical gold, but not like a huge percentage of my personal portfolio is in this physical gold. My wife owns the gold in this family. on me. I I just think it's uh you know it's it's it's good. You know, you never know when you're going to need it. Do you have like gold bars or are you just talking about like earrings and wearables and stuff? Um so I have a bunch of like stuff that I bought from India like earrings, uh bangles, uh necklaces, all all that sort of fun stuff. I could see you and uh some of the other crypto nuvo ree guys like in in their late 20s early 30s like you guys act like NBA players in their rookie season, you know, like um like I'm not going to name any names or dox anybody, but you're like, "Oh yeah, I love the gemstones like the gold." Uhhuh. You're literally like Kevin Durant in Uncut Gems, you know? I'm We're Look, I'm on top of the game. What can I say? I like to treat myself. It's true. It's better to have gold gold um gold earrings than fartcoin right now. Anyway, for sure. Long story long story short for the listeners. Uh bid Bitcoin when it's when it's collapsing in on itself, preferably between 73 and 78K and just wait. Short Ethereum to zero. uh buy some puts and then you know throw darts at your watch list and pick any alt to short and you should be happy except for the RWA ones. Yeah, I think some of these shorts like look at my my favorite bell weather for for shorts. The thing that's down the most on my entire board today. Can you guess what token it is? Aby forcoin. Um whiff. Whiff. Yeah, I was looking at whiff. Whiff is down 12%. This thing is just the smoothest death spiral I've ever seen. I don't have I'm honestly It's like It pisses me off that I closed my short at $1. I shorted it at 120. It went to a dollar. I was like 20%. That's great. [ __ ] Would have been I reset my whiff short. I closed it for a while, then I reset it because without a whiff short, I felt naked. You know, you know, sometimes when you have one of those one of those positions that you take off and you just feel like you feel like feeling naked's one way to describe it. Another way is like just something feels missing in your life without that position, you know? Like you I don't know. I kind of I kind of feel that way about the wave short. Yeah, that's fair. All right, dude. All right. You ready to to call it? I'm ready to call it. I gota I Let's Let's do another one uh later this week. Yeah. Let's record on Sunday like we usually do. Record. Yeah, we'll record on Sunday. We had to do something. It's an emergency stream for this crazy crazy thing that happened. All right. All right. Adios. Adios. Thank you everybody. Bye. [Music]

and we're live h happy liberation day Avi happy liberation day are you Are you enjoying being liberated from your wealth yeah yeah i'm uh I feel liberated from my hopes my dreams my money my future uh this is a pretty scary feeling for sure but I guess the whole point of these tariffs isn't to help out um bros like us no it's not and it's not I mean I guess what I'm struggling to figure out is who who exactly it's designed to help uh but what's really interesting is that we're we we now collectively get to experience something that people haven't really experienced since World War II which is a complete reimagination of America's place in the world and an upending of world economic order to a degree that you know was I think basically would have been unheard of four years ago at the you know even even two years ago at this point just because I don't think people took this this tariff stuff that seriously from Trump i mean look even even the even leading conservative voices are like "What what the hell are you doing Trump?" Um you know he he clearly he clearly has a plan in in his head uh you know hopefully the tariffs are not going to go into effect for another four days i think April 6th and April 9th are the two major days that uh he he put out in terms of implementation of tariffs and so we have a little bit of wiggle room hope I think what he's hoping for is that people are going to come out and say "All right we don't want to deal with this." Um you know we'll take our tariffs off you take your tariffs off and then everyone returns to a free trade world but you know for now it's it's hairy it's it's definitely very hairy out there i think you know I've been I've been fairly quiet i don't think I've tweeted in like two weeks that's cuz I haven't had really anything interesting to say um you know I think this just goes back to the framework that I always discuss uh right now the momentum is down you know and we're not clearly at value levels because you know you have the you have the equity markets puking out below us you have uh you know altcoin sort of sort of bleeding we're down you know we're down about 15% from the highs on NASDAQ maybe another five to 10% to go i do think that BTC below 80 is a good buy midterm but other than that I mean I just don't really have any strong convictions in the market i don't know i I I do think we're closer to the end just because it's like well what what what else is there to do at this point uh but yeah I mean what do you think yeah I think that like this may be the flush that marks the bottom i think this is what you buy um you know I've been I I I didn't really see this sell-off coming you're not always right as a trader so definitely you know there's when you when you say "All right this is it this is the time to buy and you've said that a couple of times on the way down there's sort of this risk that like you know your credibility is a bit damaged but you know I have been recommending Bitcoin i haven't recommended other alts and Bitcoin's not really that deep in the can right now you know we're trading where we were you know just like a few hours ago realistically like we're on March 31st the lows were 81 now we're 83 so it's not really like that crazy to buy this i think Bitcoin is showing relative strength right now and I think that you're supposed to take heat of that another thing is like you know just having been a you know you'll probably res this will probably resonate with you too Avi like just having been a business person it's um I think it's a little bit shortsighted to to fault Trump for the immediate impact of these tariffs like I can I I can sort of empathize with the idea of having a more nuanced multi-part strategy than just like everything I I say and do has to make the stock market rally that that minute or that hour like I can see maybe a long game being played here where the tariffs are hiked there's some pain uh there's some contraction other countries you know enter into negotiations and then ultimately what ends up happening is you know the tra the global trade picture looks a little bit fairer tariff tariffs come back down and in the midst of the turmoil uh the Fed has a little bit more scope to cut rates so you know I don't think I don't think we're we're going to enter like a crazy recession as a result of this i think it's more just like the kind of situation that you look for when you're when you're trying to like as a markets person like the kind of situation that you try to have to understand the rationale for rather than like just feel annoyed about your static long portfolio you know what I'm saying yeah I I understand what you're talking about i mean sort of two two points here that I want to make one is I I I don't think I think Trump could have played this as a long game a lot better i think coming out and basically saying I'm going to take on the entire world at the same time is a little little silly i think that was him trying to get things done too fast if he had gone region even just region by region if not country by country and tried to negotiate with them and used his stick to negotiate it might have been a smoother ride but I also understand that he you know he he wants he he does want there to be pain i think that that's like part part of the calculus um but that with with all with all that said right we know that he wants there to be pain um you know but we know that he can't have too much pain because he's he's the stock market president and no matter no matter how much I think they jawbone about not looking at the market and looking at the yields uh I think that they they do care about the market at the end of the day um you know that's also a barometer for how presidents are measured and we know this guy has a reasonably large ego and so if the market's down 30% to start his presidency I I think that he's going to be he's going to be looking at that and going "All right maybe you know I got I got to fix this for my image." Um because what you what you what you don't want is you don't want to get elected in and then immediately have the market nuke because of because of your policies and then you kind of lose a mandate to govern because people lose faith in you and he needs to he needs to avoid that situation um you know with with with all with all of that said I mean ETH is like basically alts alts outside of maybe some RWA alts are doing are doing okay um kind of just [ __ ] across the board there just not going to be there just won't be any buyers for these things at all until Bitcoin gets back above 90 um basically these things can have these you know can can have bounces but they're straight line lower until VIX is down and the market relaxes i mean this is just this is just a a [ __ ] a [ __ ] time to be to be an alt but so are you saying that inverse alt season is still the new alt season yeah I'm saying I'm saying the inverse alt season looks honestly it looks pretty damn good i mean I've got my eye on a few things that I think could still do well um you know if you just give them give them a little bit of time i've got my little RWA basket that I've been talking about uh you know with the the pend the pendles of the world the you know pendalo plume curve I'm sort of waiting on good levels for them to start adding and I' I'd be adding that against ETH because I I do think these things over the next year are going to gain a lot of traction just because of the regulatory clarity that's coming but other than that I I'm I'm pretty much cashed up um you know waiting for spots to deploy because I you know place to be what was crazy about today is like how badly the Wall Street Journal rugged the entire complex including equities because they down more than Bitcoin did you see this like equity futures are down 3.2% bitcoin's down 2.6% yeah I think some of that what is it gme buying which is good you know keep keeping keeping that up but did you see you see the Wall Street Journal they came out with an article at 4 p.m that said that the tariffs are going to be 10% which is lower than estimates and then everything just gigaped and then immediately it came out that that was false oh my god yeah it's crazy the whole market was sort of like the markets opened up today i think everybody was expecting this to be like a well it was like a sell the rumor buy the news kind of thing and then Trump just came out came out swinging i mean what what are the all-in tariffs on China now is it like 100% obviously something 50 I think it's 54% so it's 34% new in addition to the 20% that already already is there i'm not hold on let me let me just quickly basically one of my one of my contacts is Ryan Peterson who runs flexport and he was saying remember these duties that were announced are on top of existing duties so for China you have original duty of 7 12 to 25% duty from section 301 20% from earlier this year 34% today and then he said 25% for China's purchases of Venezuelan oil that's over 100% so it's 54% higher to buy Chinese goods than it was at the before Trump was elected but there are still other duties floating around there like some of these I'd like to see a list of all-in tariffs like these are these are some savage numbers and Ovi I want to get your take on this like my my take is that my take is that it will not result in I think I think consumption will drop as a result of this like I think that economics 101 will kick in and higher prices will result in lower demand and ultimately I think that like yes everybody's profit margins will get squeezed and yes prices of certain goods will will be higher but like I don't think that I don't think that people are just going to pony up and spend this extra money i think it's really going to crimp consumption um which will obviously trickle down into other recessionary type type looking data what do you think you're on mute i I think that I think that you're right on that on that point i mean you as as we've discussed before tariffs don't you know it's not it's not just a tax on foreign goods it's a tax on domestic goods as well it's just consumption in general uh and without without wages going up i mean what we're what we're going to see is I think we're actually going to see like a reasonably deflationary effect overall from this um one of the main reasons I think that is because if you look at the levels of consumption uh the people earning more than $250,000 a year make up a much larger percentage of consumption than they have in the last 40 years and with the stock market going down those are those are the people that hold assets i mean I mean I know just like myself like I'm like I'm poorer today than I was yesterday so uh I'm I'm definitely going to be saving money a bit more right so it's like it's like a natural thing right it's like uh you know I'm looking I'm looking at buying a house right now it's like okay well like how much money do I want to spend on a house the answer is a little bit different today than it was uh I mean not actually but you know just as just a little bit you you know you feel like okay well maybe I should be a little bit more frugal you know now that now now that I'm 15% poorer than I was 3 months ago you know I think it's funny like I I I think that what got Joe Biden fired from his job wasn't the dementia it wasn't the policies it was just inflation that occurred during his term and so I think that you know the Republicans are going to basically be subject to the same medicine if if we have inflation have to take the same medicine so I I kind of agree with you i think that while you know sticker prices on certain foreign goods will inflate the overall impact of these tariffs on the economy will be you know a cooling effect not a this won't heat things up this won't cause consumption uh this is like reverse stimulus so basically it'll like basically what I think is coming next is a tax cut package i think that you know okay they basically just introduced a massive tax on consumption now they're going to have to cut taxes somewhere else otherwise they're just kind of like people that hike taxes which is not what they were elected to do and that's not really their branding that they're the tax cut party they always have been so I think we should expect bullish tight news for crypto from here like if if Trump manages to cut taxes to zero for everybody who's earning under 150k which is the plan you know Besson's gone out and said that lutnick's gone out and said that like let's say they get close to that that's pretty bullish for things that retail likes to yolo like crypto you know um what gets worse from here before the the stuff starts to get better like it it's hard to imagine anything happening that's worse than this and Bitcoin's holding up pretty well i don't know it to me the setup looks bullish yeah it's it's a good it's a good thought exercise right i mean whenever you have whenever you have a narrative in the market that's causing fear you have to ask well how old is that narrative and you know for for a while I think which is why which is why we got a balance um for for a bit up until Trump announced this whole Liberation Day BS is that all of the all of the bad news had been absorbed and there wasn't new bad news to come and then Trump comes out and goes "Well there's by the way uh Liberation Day is coming soon and I'm going to be going be tariffing everybody." I was like "Oh market's like "Okay [ __ ] i I guess that's new bad news we can we can go back down." But now we're at a point where okay we're we're done again you know we we've hit we've hit all the bad news um and so then the questions are like what are you know sort of what are what are the knock-on effects and then what are what are the ways out uh and then what's more likely and what do I mean by that wells out mean how does this situation resolve itself how does it how does it get better uh it gets it gets better uh if Trump walks back the tariffs or if there's negotiation room um or if just nothing changes and and data and data remains constant both of us think that consump consumption is going to be hit um I think that the basically the only way that they avoid a recession is if they actually do manage to pass like a reasonable amount of tax cuts otherwise I think by definition like we're it's very hard to see us not heading into a recession which might which might be you know very possible they they pass big tax cuts and then the tariffs get removed and then we go up in a straight line for forever and always until the end of the Trump presidency um but he he has boxed us into a little bit of a tough position here i mean these these tariffs are pretty extreme Jonah these are some pretty nasty tariffs these are big ones i mean put it this way Obby uh a guy in the chat says "Why do you think there won't be a recession?" Let me respond to that and respond to what you just said i don't think there will be a recession because unlike every other flirtation with recession that I've experienced Mhm in my 20 years in markets this is the first one that's intentional like self-inflicted intentional like predictable like normally it's [ __ ] out of left field it's COVID it's um oh my god like a subprime mortgages no one even thought about that until it was too late you know or um you know flash crash or all these random things that happened over the years this is the first time where like a bunch of politicians policy makers and technocrats have like gotten together and created a managed recession and because this is like man-made like It feels like the timing is so kind of obvious when you look at it that way it's it's like if you're going to take some painful medicine use this medicine analogy you do it right at the beginning when you're you're still on your honeymoon period and people are giving you a little bit of grace your first 100 days you don't just like let this malaise continue into the midterms and then get destroyed and then let it continue another two years and then get thrown out of office in disgrace having not completed your agenda and having your legacy tarnished or destroyed like no you rip the band-aid off while you can which is immediately and then you start to rebuild the foundations that you you were elected to rebuild so this is not a partisan comment like this is not something that that's like me trying to defend Trump i'm just sort of like reverse engineering what's happening here and the reason why I think that we won't end up in a recession is because since this was created in an entirely manufactured artificial fashion it can be unwound just as easily none of this like none of these tariffs can't be unwound none of this is creating a beast that the Trump administration can't control foreign countries will always be happy to sell their goods to America the world's largest consumer uh at any price tariffs or no tariffs it's not like this is doing any permanent damage so if we start to like get into real trouble territory for the S&P I don't think Trump's just going to like stick it to the American economy like it's not it's not just rich people who own assets it's like businesses are assets and if everybody's stock price is in the toilet like hiring slows down wages get cut people get fired like it's it's a it's bad times like Trump's not an idiot the people around him for the most part are aware of these basic economic realities so be you know just in some because this is man-made it can be undone just as quickly as it gets done as it was done and it probably will be if things get too detrimental which I you know maybe they will but I I doubt that this spirals into something crazy yeah i I think I mean what you hope for is that it just doesn't spiral out of control right i mean it's it's it it's one thing uh some some things end up being sticky right for example if there's a significant amount of job loss and that's what prompts everyone to be like "Okay [ __ ] now." You know we're we're we're heading we're heading into a recession we should probably reverse these tariffs or do or do something about it some of that stuff's sticky right um like some of those jobs just won't won't be won't be coming back um so there is you know there's I think a time limit on this sort of stuff i do I I do tend to heir on the side of yes this is this is a flush and this and this will be over a lot of people right now like in this moment are pointing out that BTC is holding basically every single time I see NASDAQ down a ton and BTC is holding that just means that there's a delay because there's an idiosyncratic buyer in the market and this time we actually know the idiosyncratic buyer it's GME so basically what I'm trying to say is like don't don't put too much weight on that um you know I'm like I'm not a buyer at 83 i'm a buyer at 78 you know and I know that's you know five five you know 5% it's not not a huge difference but if you're a trader makes sense right like this is actually a phenomenal market if you want to trade all you have to do is just trade at extremes like if you get if you get a billion dollars of liquidations or you get if you get a 10% down day from ETH or you know an 8% down day from BTC which is very possible that's that's a buy that's like a all right let's let's let's let's wave it in and then sell some on the sell some on the on the pop i mean and this market I think you just have to remember that this market is the market that you take profit in very quickly like basically you get you get you get a little bit of pop and then you're out you just you just shove it out uh and that's how I'm looking at trading this trading this market right now i mean honestly I think like getting getting short here still is like you know you can honestly probably short ETH at this point get get down to like 1500 i feel like ETH is going to triple digits where does the Ethereum Foundation get liquidated again i wonder i I haven't been following it i don't know but 1,200 or something was the rumor we're trading 1788 right now that asset is just cursed it's down 6% yeah totally totally cursed i mean like I I can easily see 1500 shortly in that thing even if BTC holds like if BTC holds the low but it sells off to uh 77 i mean I think ETH is at 1500 in that case i should say lower than that which is very possible i mean some puts puts are probably you know if if you're worried about your portfolio puts are phenomenal here because this is it's it's this type of situation where you just have to be humble with your own skills and you got to say I don't know what's going to happen this is a once in a 80year event and you should probably not take massive swings or do anything too crazy with your portfolio unless something like truly nuts is happening in the market and minus 3% from BTC today is not truly nuts that's that that that's my take equally as a response to that take if we get a flush that's the flush that like like let's say that let's say that Bitcoin really flushes let's say it goes down to 75K i I think it'd be crazy not to buy that i What What news is going to come out next with what money Jonah you said you're all in cash Avi i mean I Yeah but you you've been buying you've been buying the dips i mean I I haven't blown my entire wad let's put it that way like I I I really I'm careful about not blowing my entire wad i I have made some money on shorts i've traded in and out of If you need a place to stay let me know Jonah just just Obby it's over let's throw in the towel no I mean honestly like I I'm fine because I follow the advice that we give again and again on this podcast which is don't use leverage uh don't don't bet more than you can afford to lose we're still doing we're still above like Trump's election levels i was happy then slightly happier now just disappointed that we're not like immediately mooning into his first hundred days now I I just like let's it I can see why why the world is pissed off the world the markets participant world is pissed at Trump right now let's just sit here and and war room this situation how like what could what's something that could happen that could make this worse like for example I let me just think of something crazy let's say that China's like "All right we're just hiking our tariffs another 50%." And then Trump responds by hiking tariffs on China by another 50% and now suddenly like you know your cheap Chinese crap on Amazon is you know more than twice as expensive as it used to be right i guess that's the the big risk that's that's what you're afraid of if you're if you're Yeah you can short altcoins with confidence a lot of them are just going to zero but Bitcoin or stocks if you short that here what are you hoping for what do you you're hoping for that right i mean what what what you're really what you're really hoping for Bitcoin's Bitcoin is just going to follow equities at this point so really what you're asking is you know what what stops equities from going lower and equities right now are just pricing in a reasonable contraction in GDP because of lower lower trade and lower consumption at least I think that's I think that's what's happening um and that is very plausible i mean here's here's the reality of the situation we don't know what the [ __ ] is going to happen with these tariffs like we don't we can guess but when's the last time that we had tariffs this extensive put on uh goods I mean there are arguments to be made that it doesn't matter that you know a lot of people are reasonably price you know a a lot of this consumption is reasonably price insensitive uh and you know what it what it actually eats into is it eats into the savings of Americans I don't know that's a stupid argument in my personal opinion uh but it it is an argument that you can make because who the [ __ ] knows uh when it when it comes when it comes to this you can maybe uh it produces American innovation and suddenly like there are American companies that are figure out in the next six months how to produce the same Chinese slop at lower cost because they're they're forced to right or I because they're putting R&D into it maybe a bunch of companies build factories here or like Yeah exactly like who like genuinely like who the who the [ __ ] knows but that's kind of the issue right like the issue is that nobody knows um and with that in mind uh like the most likely outcome is that you do end up in a recession because you do have a massive a massive hit to consumption at least in the in in in the short run and so I think that's that's what the market is responding to like that that's what everyone is so is is so is so nervous about it um you know and you kind you kind of need like you you you need the ship turned around uh by stimulus in some in some way right yeah and maybe that stimulus is coming i mean I don't think it's to say that i think it would be weird if the like they've pretty been they've been pretty open the administration about how they're not just going to hike taxes and then walk away without doing anything else like this is all part of an extremely well telegraphed agenda most of which is relatively stimul stimulatory no taxes on tips no taxes on any income under 150k like we're going to lower income taxes across the board we're going to give you bigger state and local income tax deductions like we're going to going to pump domestic manufacturing we're going to move unproductive people in the government into productive parts of the you know private economy so I again like you know if you're short right now what are you hoping for i all with all of the information that's been priced in today you know lower earnings are priced in lower consumption is priced in we we have perfect information on what happened in the past what what you're hoping for if you set a fresh short on Bitcoin and S&P at current levels and those two are trading with very high correlation yeah i mean what what what you're hoping for on BTC I think is like Okay so I I wish I could share a chart here because All right let me just finish the sentence you're hoping that the government loses control of this you're hoping that that this spirals out of control and even if they you know even if stocks are down 10% the government brings the tariff uh tariffs back down to zero that some beast has been let out of its cage that cannot be controlled that's what you're hoping for if you set a fresh short well you know hoping I mean betting on betting on I think it's a better better phrasing hopefully you're not hoping for anything when you trade um but like on on Bitcoin if you go to the 3-day chart it's actually just such a clear short setup um from a from a technical perspective you get you you basically you get to stop out above 88 and you get to target the previous highs of 73 so you have a you know 7% move to the top side uh 10% move to the downside seems reason like that you know that seem pl and and you have the momentum on your side which makes the riskreward better that that just seems like a a reasonable trade that a reasonable trader could could take um with you know with with S&P I think what you're what you're betting for is you're you're betting on a like a oneouch of 5,000 uh and and you can and you can get out and I don't you know the the the way the way that this is the way that this is going to play out is uh all of the fears are going to be frontloaded like this is going to this is going to end uh by Monday of next week my personal opinion um like whatever whatever price action is going to happen is going to get priced in by by mon by Monday of next week we're going to get some move over the weekend which is likely going to be negative if there's no change in the news uh and then you get the flush on Monday and then you're going up straight um that's my that that's that's my take because you need again you need more bad news to come out it can't just be the same thing over and over and over and over it's got to be That's what I'm saying that's what I'm saying i couldn't agree more i think like I agree with Yuan Leu in the chat spx touching 5,000 would be a gift like you what matters is the second derivative of the news not the news that just came out right like is the news gonna get worse from here or better hard to imagine it gets worse i don't know i I I I you know I tend to have a bullish bent because over the course of my career like I started in '07 there was the immediate global financial crisis and then the stock market basically rallied in a s straight line from 666 all the way up to 600 0 right that's like you know nearly a 10xer so I I built my career over a period of time where if I had been a perma bear or even a perma range trader on risk assets I wouldn't have been able to sustain my 20-y year career i would have gotten blown out so I tend to have a bullish bent but there's method behind the madness like it's not just that oh I I grew up over a bull run so I'm a bull no it's like something very important happened in '08 something gamechanging like as important I would say as the US going off the gold standard in the 1970s what happened in 2008 was that the United States of America uh and governments around the world in parallel decided to underwrite risk in the economy that was sort of like a first and I don't think that that genie can be put out put back in the bottle without stocks going straight back down to 666 so I think that if things really get bad which this isn't like having seen actual recessions and actual crazy sell-offs this move in stocks from 6,000 to 5,500 doesn't seem that crazy to me like th this feels totally tolerable and in Bitcoin going from $108,000 for one unit of our magic internet money to $83,000 for one unit of our magic internet money like that though that's not crazy right if things get actually crazy I think we're backs stopped and this just isn't that crazy frankly I think Trump was was right to to rip off this band-aid sorry not right in the sense that like I agree with what he's doing because I I don't necessarily but like his calculation that he could get away with it now will probably be proven correct yeah i mean I think ba basically what you're basically what you're trying to say is this is this is a this will be a short-lived crash like this this is this is not the destruction of an economic system that's going to take you know you know there's there's in in your words it's not going to be uh one failure then another failure then another failure then another failure there's not going to be a lemon and an AIG there's just going to be this is this is going to happen there's going to be a cascade and then we're done um yeah I I tend to agree with that I think the only thing is figuring out where like where we're done um and that that's what we've been trying to debate like when when does when does the bad news end maybe what you're supposed to do is stay on the sidelines and then start buying good news when it comes out like when the administration starts doing things that are supportive of markets then you can you can start buying i don't know but then they might come out and do another you know you know you know what's done really well gold yeah 3,200 like gold is insane remember when the target for Bitcoin was a gold market cap of 10 trillion mhm now gold is a $22 trillion asset it's pretty it's Hold on let's see i mean gold is gold is 30 that's It's just so insane man one-way train like just straight one way like over the last year just straight up i'm glad I own a ton of gold you do why i don't understand that one i've never been a very good gold trader uh I don't own gold uh in in like my investment portfolio i own a bunch of physical gold and by a bunch I mean I own like a substantial amount of money in physical gold but not like a huge percentage of my personal portfolio is in this physical gold my wife owns the gold in this family on me i just I just think it's uh you know it's it's it's good you know you never know when you're going to need it do you have like gold bars or are you just talking about like earrings and wearables and stuff um so I have a bunch of like stuff that I bought from India like earrings uh bangles uh necklaces all all that sort of fun stuff i could see you and uh some of the other crypto nuvo ree guys like in in their late 20s early 30s like you guys act like NBA players in their rookie season you know like um I'm not going to name any names or dox anybody but you're like "Oh yeah I love the gemstones like the gold." Yeah uhhuh you're literally like Kevin Durant in Uncut Gems you know i'm we're Look I'm on top of the game what can I say i like to treat myself it's true better to have gold gold um gold earrings than fartcoin right now anyway for sure long story long story short for the listeners uh bid Bitcoin when it's when it's collapsing in on itself preferably between 73 and 78K and just wait short Ethereum to zero uh buy some puts and then you know throw darts at your watch list and pick any alt to short and you should be happy except for the RWA ones yeah I think some of these shorts like look at my my favorite bell weather for for shorts the thing that's down the most on my entire board today can you guess what token it is aby fortcoin um whiff wiff yeah I was looking at whiff whiff is down 12% this thing is just the smoothest death spiral I've ever seen i don't know i'm honestly It's like It pisses me off that I closed my short at $1 i shorted it at 120 it went to a dollar i was like 20% that's great [ __ ] would have been I reset my whiff short i closed it for a while then I reset it because without a whiff short I felt naked you know you know sometimes when you have one of those one of those positions that you take off and you just feel like you feel like feeling naked's one way to describe it another way is like just something feels missing in your life without that position you know like you I don't know i kind of I kind of feel that way about the wave short yeah that's fair all right dude all right you ready to to call it i'm ready to call it i gota I Let's Let's do another one uh later this week yeah let's record on Sunday like we usually do yeah we'll record on Sunday we had to do something it's an emergency stream for this crazy crazy thing that happened all right all right adios adios thank you everybody bye

there's a theta decay to the bearishness here every reason that we're bearish has been talked about now for at least two to three weeks totally agree and so there's all of it's already out in the open and yes it could get worse but basically every day that goes by that it doesn't get worse if there's not a new catalyst to send us lower it's more likely that Bitcoin goes higher and in the short term and the reason is because people have d-risked this episode is brought to you by Kraken OTC get access to 247 trading services for high- netw worth individuals and institutional clients to execute orders over $50,000 you'll hear more about them later in the [Music] show all right what's going on everybody uh we got a big collab going on here today from the Digital Asset Summit we're on day three and you know we just had to run it up again like we did in permissionless so we got the thousandx guys i'm here for forward guidance we're live on the floor in the expo hall things are going off it's been a wicked few days and yeah just really great to catch up with you guys what's going on yeah thanks for having us here this is this has been an awesome conference i do have to say so many people a lot more optimism than I expected given the fact that you know at ETH Denver it was just absolute tragedy despair everywhere and if you go on Twitter you think that everyone's like on the verge of suicide i mean it's like this is great people are people are talking people are doing real things yeah it's it's been awesome here um first of all thank you for for working with us on this podcast you're the hostess with the mostest we love you it was fun to to talk to up you know in Utah last year um yeah I echo what Obby said i think it's kind of interesting like Mikeo the co-founder of Blockworks tweeted out this thing that went viral said um I've never seen the institutions more bullish than the the natives which is food for thought right like it the people here are psyched about crypto and the people on Twitter are in a state of despair because they're either ETH maxis who have just you know basically seen their net worth deplete over the course of what should be a bull cycle and then you know a lot of altcoins are down 80 90% from the highs so I think like the real dgens online are depressed but these are not the dgens and we did a we did at our panel on on Tuesday we did like an audience Q&A where we said you know raise your hand if you've sold core holdings um over the course of this you know selloff from the postelection pop and it was like five people in an audience of basically basically nobody raised their hand and that's when it kind of clicked in my head what's going on and where the optimism comes from it's that everyone here has a portfolio and that they're allocated for the long term like basically 80% of the people that you talk to here are the institutions are the people that bought into Bitcoin thinking this is going to become a massive asset over the next 5 years and so they're probably pretty happy because they allocated to the crypto space maybe they bought you know 50 to 80% of their portfolio in Bitcoin and the rest of it maybe in ETH Salana and so they're still up they're still look you know they're still pretty happy whereas all the people that are depressed are the ones sort of on the cutting edge of crypto whose portfolios probably look a lot more like 80% random altcoins that have marketed themselves very well and then a tiny maybe tiny bit of Bitcoin and so obviously they're depressed because if you look I mean ETH is down 20% mhm since the election that's that's pretty that's pretty nuts like that is a that is a truly doomed asset right there yeah i think this theme is so key and it's so interesting on on so many different facets you know one of the most interesting things for me is that that you know retail implosion that we've seen has been entirely you know self-correcting like there hasn't been a catalyst necessarily it's just this you know like maturation moment it feels a lot like you know where you know the pumped up fund thing like yes there was the Trump coin that Mark Deo top of that idea but overall you know it was just a self-cleansing moment and at the same time you look at what's going on on the regulatory front of you know finally banks can custody crypto in a proper manner you know the SAP thing and all of that and suddenly you know these asset allocators that have a much longer time horay and they're getting excited for these prices and starting to come in and yeah it it feels like our industry is growing up and and that's going to make a lot of cryptogs a bit sad probably and and that's okay that's just you know it feels like this continued bifurcation between you know the the suit version of crypto and the retail like on the cutting edge like you say well I mean it's the world's smallest violin playing for the OGs who are sad like they they can they can cry all they want in their villas in Monaco and the like leaves leave leave some for the rest of us OG's i think to to me like Avi and I like to talk a lot about you know whether Bitcoin is rich or cheap whether certain you know crypto asset X is rich or cheap um Avi has a great model for you know basically determining where participants are going to get excited my model is a little bit different so I appreciate A's take and I overlay it with my own which is kind of flows based so like where are the flows going to come from over the next 6 to let's call it 24 months and if you know what we're talking about here remains the case which I think it will which is institutional flows like those flows are really going into Bitcoin um people are going to say "All right there's trillions of dollars of wealth out there in portfolios maybe we start upping the basis points allocated to Bitcoin from zero to 10 basis points and 10 to 20." So that's where the inflows are going to come from so you can feel good about Bitcoin but like those people are not going to be buying your shitcoins they're not going to be buying your bags or they're not going to be if Bitcoin is a stretch for them they're certainly not going to be reaching into like risky alt world meanwhile in risky alt world like you know deepin a sector I hate in order to run you know physical hardware and share it with people you get rewarded with shitcoins you need to sell those shitcoins somebody has to buy those shitcoins and it's not going to be like retail is tapped out they're on Twitter talking about how how suicidal they are the institutions are not going to buy those coins it's the same story for you know name your your vaporware project out there or or even some of the good projects like it's going to be a real tough time given you know inflows into Bitcoin are going to buoy that asset outflows from all these other tokens seem kind of limitless at the moment without an excited retail base to absorb them so I think the playbook has to change i think it totally does yeah like I I'll just say that you know even speaking to some of like the liquid funds here you know they're not even interested in in dropping in front of that you know I saw that in back in January we saw that there's like 32 billion of unlocks hitting alts this year and we have like the same amount of alt capital which is like this much and then you know there's like the the institutional version of Bitcoin out here and that's where all the money is going to your point um they don't want to get in front of that train either so it just feels like most of the alts that exist today it's just going to be this continued bleed as people try to get out and I'm starting to think about what is the next the next 2.0 know structure of of these alts and what does that structure start to look like that where the dynamics are a bit more positive for the space and I don't know if I figured it out I'm curious if you guys have thought of it I've got I I've you know I just to go back to the flow's comment for a second I think the word of the year is saturated like the market for alts is just saturated why were people buying these things they were buying them because they would go up it was like kind of like a lottery ticket right there was this massive dream that oh you could buy a memecoin and it would you know 100x it a,000x and you'd put in $10 and you'd walk away a millionaire and that extended not just to meme coins but to a lot of altcoins in general like even L1's oh my god you know maybe Salana is going to take over the world and everything is going to run on Salana and then what you get is you get hundreds of different types of L1's launching hundreds of different kinds of memecoins launching and the moment when Trump launches that draws everyone's eyeballs to crypto and that was a moment in my opinion of peak saturation at that point there was nobody else that was going to come in that wasn't convinced about crypto before that they were going to come in and gamble on this thing and so that's where we are now we have the maximum of people that are willing to gamble on an asset that doesn't have real value in the market but billions and billions and billions of dollars of not just uh you know old issuance of unlocked tokens but new issuance of new coins like every month a new coin is going to launch right that is going to claim to try to take over the world like Barachchain with the L1's launch you know Monad's going to launch it's just a diffusion of capital bitcoin is not saturated because Bitcoin has new flows from institutions that are slowly coming in because they have a 5 to 10year uh thesis on the Bitcoin market that it's going to grow because it's genuinely valuable so that's where we're headed we need people to be able to look at an altcoin or separate coin in crypto and say I have a five-year thesis on this i'm willing to allocate because I think this thing can generate a lot of cash pass it back to its holders and operate as a real successful company in the context of uh crypto right the gambling era is over in my personal opinion this episode is brought to you by Kraken OTC one of crypto's longest running exchanges with over a decade of experience with Kraken OTC high- netw

crypto taxes with no guesswork thanks to Cryptotax Calculator for making today's episode possible let's talk macro for a few minutes here cuz Jonah I actually really love the sequence that you outlined on on Twitter a couple weeks ago cuz I'm thinking about it quite similarly where you know it feels like you know we have a lot of these these fiscal policies that are being frontloaded in terms of the painful points and the sequence of of how that tracks into risk assets can you just I I'd love to hear an update on how you're thinking about that sequence and where we're at in it yeah thank you um I might have to remind myself on the exact ordering of bullet points five six and seven but I put out a really detailed road map for what I think the Trump administration is going to do so I think Trump has surrounded himself with a much better team this time than last time and I think that they're acutely aware of what they have to do so first let's lay out what they have to do then let's lay out how they think about doing it and what that means for macro so what do they have to do trump got elected on a mandate to shift you know he talked about tariffs a lot you don't elect a tariff man if you don't want tariffs right he got elected he's got the mandate so you he's kind of trying to shift taxation from income some of the taxation from income to consumption that's a big deal and then on the other side of the equation he also got elected on this mandate to kind of uh basically shift GDP contribution or some of it from government spending tons of money to like maybe government spends a little bit less and we'll have those people uh produce money in the private markets privatization so some of the some of the GDP contribution goes from government to private industry so those two things that he got elected on are big big game changers right and markets don't like game changers uncertainty so he I'm sure they knew there was going to be a little bit bit of indigestion when you try to force those two parallel agendas through at the same time now how do you get there right i think Bessant is is a real markets genius like I've followed him for years and like he's Scott Trump's ear and I think that Trump and Bessant together are aware that they have a certain amount of cushion to mess with before things really head south as they pursue these dual agendas and they're constantly monitoring that cushion and some of it's the stock market some of it's related to interest rates but like basically I think the stock market could sell off another 20% from here maximum maximum probably 10 before these guys start to panic and and cushion things and let's remember all of the volatility that we're seeing in macro and Bitcoin is trading one for one with macro right now BTC SPX is stable stable as ever right all the volatility we're seeing in macro has been created by talking heads uh right it's not like some It's not like an asteroid hit a a demand center like it's just Trump talking about what he's going to do so he can walk it back right so I think they're watching the stock market if we're down another 10% they're going to start cutting interest rates you know and and after they cut interest rates they can do QE so they got plenty of cushion i think you should feel safe buying risk assets on another dip from here and just finally to wrap it up the as as they watch that cushion here's how I think it's going to play out the first thing is like you have a lot of cushion so you can talk tough shove your tariffs through shove your agenda through and to hell with the people who are upset about a 10% pullback next thing that I think drops is ceasefire in Ukraine commodities tank uh inflation gets lowered then they can really cut rates that stabilizes things they suddenly have more cushion uh because stock markets will go back up then from there after they cut rates I think they can start getting a little bit more bellose with Iran they can start pushing through their tariff agenda more aggressively screwing with NATO uh you know firing more government workers then unemployment goes up cushion comes down and then after that I think they can soften up a little bit and uh and pump the gas a little bit more with fiscal and monetary when you say push tariffs more aggressively how is that possible like you know I I don't know i don't know if I agree with that one i think they're being pretty pretty darn aggressive with tariffs but the rest the rest of it he's talking aggressive but he hasn't implemented a lot of tariffs yet and what I mean is he can actually like like really like like put them through the the one the one thing that I'll I'll say that I I want to focus on your use of the word cushion i I think that there's actually much less of a cushion than we all expect and let me just take you back to kind of how we ended up here inflation gets out of control and that really hits people that don't own assets the most and so you go forward three years from 2022 we're now in a situation where if you actually look at the data the consumption from people earning more than $250,000 a year is at its highest in 30 years a percent of consumption from those people in the economy and that means that the stock market is actually more important today than it has been at any point in the last 30 years for the continued growth of the American economy because if the stock market crashes a huge percentage of consumption starts to decrease because these people start to feel like they're hit and the people earning more than $250,000 a year are the ones that have the most asset exposure and so what I get a little bit nervous about is if he has this view you know I have a lot of room to maneuver on the stock market and it comes down and then consumption crashes and growth really slows that's going to be a very painful painful few months even if he starts to reverse course at that moment it still takes you know a month or two and potential like you know 25 30% down in the stock market before that washes itself out i know I ramble a lot but can I just one comment there before we pass it back to you guys i while I agree with you I think that Trump is also very he has good political intuition and no politician especially not Trump is elected with a mandate to tank the economy cause unemployment cause chaos i mean there would be a big blue wave uh in 2026 if if we're if the economy and the stock market are in trouble in 2025 right he he so he has a time window to maneuver to and that time is now and then he's got a really U-turn out of it so I think like I I think you will see even Donald Trump panic i I agree with you on the time because I I think every president has some amount of time i forget who was saying this and who we were we discussing this with every president has some amount of time where they can blame the current issues on the predecessor right and that I think is probably the first year of the presidency so he kind of has a year to get through this to get to the other side and then three years and then another year prior to the midterms to show immense growth and actually that we're in a better spot because of what's happened and that he fixed his predecessor's mistakes so I do think we're only two months into the Trump presidency like we we can't sit here and say "Okay we're done now because Trump is governing in a very unpredictable manner." Now predictable in his mind but unpredictable from the mind of investors and you see that with the VIX trading above 20 consistently uh we actually had for the first time in like 15 years we had uh sorry not 15 years for the first time except COVID in like 15 years we had the VIX go up for four weeks straight normally what happens is a VIX spikes really hard it's a reverting asset and and and it's actually been trending which is kind which is kind of weird right this is this is a dream setup for these institutional Bitcoin investors behind us though because they're going to get their dips that that they want to buy like bare markets are only bad if you're planning on selling if you're looking to go from zero basis points to 10 bare markets are awesome i mean it also it also sucks when you have a large expenses coming up but you know Yeah i will add a couple points to just um that framework that you articulated which like like a wedding maybe like like the wedding I'm planning right now i'm like oh my god please go a lot this episode is brought to you by Kraken OTC one of crypto's longest running exchanges with over a decade of experience with Kraken OTC high- netw worth

no guesswork thanks to Cryptotax Calculator for making today's episode possible um I I agree with a lot of the points that you mentioned in terms of this idea of you know I think first off I don't think we're going into a recession you know it's this interesting dynamic like you say like a lot of this uncertainty and volatility is the people talking you know it's it's Howard Lick and Scott Besson going onto the news every day and saying different things too which is also difficult because now it's hard for us to piece apart what's the actual true goal here but the economic data is weakening but it's still nothing less recessionary like so when I think about you know if we just look at equities for a second you know we're down 10% or so so far we're into a correction um and I think a lot of that has been driven by positioning everybody was long Mag 7 going into 2025 that was the place to be um positioning got super super stretched in terms of valuations and then you just have a little prick of a of a catalyst and I think it's a lot of it is a rotational wipe that also looks macro driven so interesting yeah so okay no rotation from mag 7 to what just stock to everything ex back home capital is going back to Europe it's going back to China um so I think a lot of it's being pulled out cuz think about this i've been saying it a few times lately but you know I don't think it was fully anticipated what was going on in in terms of Germany's announcing like a $500 billion fiscal investment um they're unleashing deficits for the first time in in decades spending more on their own defense yeah and so boom yields started soaring and and as that occurs the euro goes higher and so you have that at the same time that you know all these say these these European asset allocators are allow long mag 7 if they're long mag seven and they're not currency hedged they're down 10% on on NASDAQ and then they're down another 7% on the currency if they're not hedged so you're down 17% so if you know if you're getting the tap on your shoulder and it's like why the hell are we doing this when the DAX is outperforming you know the Q's this year so I think a lot of that capital selling mag 7 going back home so I think it's a huge rotational with some macro headwinds as well and one thing that worries me about that so actually I listened to a forward guidance it was either two or three ago was really good where you guys talked about the trade going from US stock market to the European stock market is this sustainable is this what's going to continue to happen in the future or is it the trade's played out and it's going to mean revert and we're coming back well I mean if you look uh a lot of the move has actually been driven by European defense stocks so if you look at Ry Metal out of Germany it's up like 200% since Trump getting elected you look at BAE Systems which is headquartered in London up a ton and so my question heading into you know over the last month was is this going to continue or not that's my question as well and so I kept trying to find uh you know statements from German politicians or other politicians that would give me some indication of whether it was happening and I came across uh one guy he's a conservative MP in in Denmark and he comes out on Twitter and he says "I was instrumental in pushing through the F-35 purchases from the United States uh this can no longer continue uh we have to start reinvesting in you know our own domestic production." So somebody follows up and they say "Well you know what if what if Trump decides to start playing nice i mean you can't just you can't just massively shift production and then Trump starts to be nice and then you guys are allies again and then you've wasted all this money and his response was well it doesn't matter because once you experience volatility for the first time you can't put all of your eggs in that basket again you can't say okay well yes he was crazy for 3 months but now he's pivoted and now he's going to be my friend again you have no idea right even if the Democrats get a president elected and then there's you know in in in 2028 and then in 2032 it goes back to the Republicans basically what I'm trying to say is I think the politicians in Europe and around the world are now coming to the conclusion we can't put all of our eggs in a volatile political system and if anything we're seeing the volatility of our political system go up over the last 15 years not down that's a that's a mega trend the genie's out of the bottle the genie's out of the bottle so I'm I'm a little bit more nervous about that i I have a more kind of nothing burger take on this like I having lived in the UK for 10 years of my life which I guess is on the continent of Europe and watching the UK divorce itself from Europe i have a very bearish view on Europe um and on the UK i think that all like yes there will be more domestic defense spending and so the European defense industry is probably a good sector play but would I buy the DAX the CAC the Footsie like hell no I think that basically I think Europe has a massive problem one is just over taxation and general like socialist uh vibes over there that's that's more of the culture uh especially in southern Europe uh where people just work less it's a fact it's good climate whatever and then the other thing is that I think the European Union is going to break up in 10 to 20 years and okay so in the short term maybe you could still get a pop in European indices but like the the long-term impact you're already seeing like far-right politicians getting elected all over the place because of the intractable problem of uh borderlessness in the EU the immigration it's not working for their culture uh basically they they they've passed the event horizon of what that does to societies um and I think just this massive long-term headwind is created when you know that the European Union as a as a union it's a peace project like it's going to go it might not happen this cycle or the next but how can you feel good about stashing your portfolio in in those entire markets when that might be coming you feel like you're dancing between the raindrops you have to sell the one thing just to finish the point I agree with Avi that all of this Trump based volatility is creating you know what the other long-term stage like the other long-term table that's getting set here is we're heading towards a multipolar world people aren't just going to hope that the United States pivots back to being nice like we're headed to a world where there's going to be like European countries a China sphere of influence a United States sphere of influence a Russia sphere of influence and the only asset that can really perforate those hemispheres especially as they start to become more combative with each other is Bitcoin so I think you know from a long-term perspective you can feel good about Bitcoin becoming you know kind of a darkhorse candidate for an alternative reserve currency as the EU breaks up and currencies get effed with uh I think Bitcoin is going to become a better store of value than even some of the G20 currencies it any any currency that's not in the G20 Bitcoin is already better than holding that currency there's no debate but like just to finish out the thought here I really do I I really do think you know going back to the US just finishing on the US I think that Trump isn't stupid like the Democrats have nothing right now they have nothing they're they're they're a headless chicken running around trump could just hand them an a really unifying issue if he tanks the economy and sends it into a recession i don't think he's stupid enough to do that you know yeah yeah totally there's I I agree with so many of those points and I think it's the key tension here between is this a mean reversion trade in Europe or is it a continuation i'm I'm somewhere in between but I do think short-term you're right there's a lot of exuberance short-term um there's been this rotational flow u tying it back to Bitcoin like you mentioned I want to ask you guys as traders so here's what I'm thinking about like you said Bitcoin's trading one to one with US risk assets for the most part and and that's been tried and true for a long time now but it's also a global asset and it's driven by liquidity and so you have let's let's assume Europe does this fiscal stimulus and aside from that you know you got Japan or sorry China going pretty big too so if you have these huge in fiscal impulses coming from other countries at the same time that the US is trying to do the opposite right now and then that gets reflected in in you know NASDAQ correlations you're finding this lever between global liquidity from the rest of the world versus QQQ correlation which one wins out in terms of setting the price action for Bitcoin it's a it's a really really good and difficult question to answer um there are a few parts here well the biggest drivers of Bitcoin price in my opinion are China Japan and the US europe is kind of a non not really a big player in terms of direct directional flow like if you go look at if you go look at time zones so this is some a trade that I've put on basically every few months when there's a huge discrepancy in time zone since like 2019 you look at the EU time zone you look at the US time zone and then you look at the APAC time zone and almost categorically the EU time zone has the least amount of liquidity it has the least amount of consistent direction in terms of flows like you don't see you know there are periods of time where you see every US session it goes up and then in the EU session it sells off and the AP pack session it sells off you don't really see that in the EU session a lot there's never consistent flows so I'm I'm not so worried about what happens there so let me talk about China and let me talk about Japan so from that from that perspective the Chinese stock market is doing very well right now and that's actually bearish for Bitcoin because a lot of the people that buy Bitcoin and allocate to Bitcoin do it in hopes that they're going to that they're going to outperform their own stock market and for a long time the Chinese stock market was stagnant so a lot of you know Chinese individuals were punching like pushing money into BTC in the hopes of outperforming a a strong Chinese market I think is is is neutral to bad for BTC and then it's also about if you look at the the Japanese stock market you have to look at the yen right if the yen is getting stronger that's bad for BTC if it's getting weaker that's good for BTC and so those are kind of the levers that that I would look at for figuring out what actually matters my answer to you right now is I have absolutely no clue same like what what what exactly is happening because it's not clear like the yen was getting a bit weaker the Chinese stock market is is is strong the US stock market is weak and that may shift mh um but that's that's what I'm looking at you know if there's a week of the Chinese stock market starts going down the US stock market goes up a little bit and the yen is flat like I'm I'm getting balls long BTC earlier in today's episode

breathe markets it's it's all we mostly think about and none of us really know which one's going to win out from that what do you do here do you just derisk and wait it out so here's what I think so when I was uh basically a young trader at Leman Brothers I worked for a real superstar a mentor of mine who I still respect to this day his name is Jeff Saki he uh he's a big credit trader works at Citadel now and what he gave me one of the best pieces of advice I've ever gotten as a trader when I was just starting out very fortunate to have this mentor and advice he said Jonah you don't always have to be 10 out of 10 sometimes the right trade is just to do nothing uh because you know sometimes there's no trade right now obviously in some market there's a trade but we're focused on a couple of things here so within our little slice of of you know like macro indices and Bitcoin which is what this conversation has been focused on we're in no man's land like 10% higher it's you're probably supposed to lighten up 10% lower you're supposed to be buying with both hands uh right now you know whatever your core medium to long-term views are you should have those expressed with like you know 60 to 80% of your portfolio and the rest should be dry powder I think what What are you guys doing when when when V is high every move means less right like a a 5% move from Bitcoin when V when V is low means a lot more than a 5% move from Bitcoin when V is high and so right now it's very hard to read into the minutia of direction here i mean just look at yesterday at the FOMC you know we we searched pretty high and it's given it all back it's just it's just high variance super super high variance and you know a portion of that was that the FOMC a portion of that was front running the uh the Trump video here at D like it's you know it's I will say like it's incredible how much of that moves markets yeah like every time Trump has some event that's related to Bitcoin Bitcoin will go up in the face of that and it's been 100% hit rate to short like the like the minute after he starts speaking it's like% it's not just Bitcoin dude every market i remember being an oil trader in 2020 2018 to 20 where Trump was tweeting about oil all the time i mean there were face ripping rallies a $10 rally when oil is $25 a barrel 25 to 35 because Trump tweeted that something about OPEC like Trump I never have I seen a public figure move markets like Donald Trump and so this is why my underlying thesis I'm just going to repeat it again is no he is not going to hand the Democrats a golden goose issue of look at look at Donald Trump and the Republicans causing the stupid recession again happened last time told you so uh he's he's not that dumb he's not going to do it so if we I think this is the wrong price to get 10 out of 10 max long but like if we dip you can you can bet your boots that he's going to U-turn it and he can here here's what I'll here's what I'll say on how I'm approaching this it's there's a theta decay to the bearishness here every reason that we're bearish has been talked about now for at least two to three weeks totally agree and so there's all of it's already out in the open and yes it could get worse but basically every day that goes by that it doesn't get worse there's not a new catalyst to send us lower it's more likely that Bitcoin goes higher and in the short term and the reason is because people have derisked because every nobody here is sitting around going I've sold my Bitcoin and I'm not going to look at it they're going I've sold my Bitcoin and I'm going to wait for the dip to buy back in and every day that you don't get the dip the current price of Bitcoin looks more attractive to you you might have a limit set at 70K what if it trades to 75 and then goes back to 80 what happens to that limit well historically what happens is that that guy pulls his limit and just starts buying BTC because it didn't get there and time has passed and he didn't get the dip he was hoping for so basically every day I'm chipping in a little bit more you know what I what I do is I like to This is what I call the Castanza rule it's on days when Bitcoin is up you sell it on days when Bitcoin is down you buy it you just do the opposite of like you know obvious the only surviving successful range trader in crypto say the only guy mean reversion trading so uncommon it's you know it's it's literally you just have to battle your own emotions it's so funny how that works if I wake up and I see Bitcoin's up and I'm and I think to myself a [ __ ] am I going to miss the rally like is this over for me like I have to buy back in i immediately sell that is so like it's actually it's actually insane like how well that mentality works yeah i'm so bad at that that I do the opposite and like I I've chopped myself up enough in my career that I like I just stopped trading short-term like a trades shortterm like a pro i just stopped i will not trade with a time horizon of less than a week unless I have information that I strongly think will impact markets um or I have a bot with a signal that's short-term trading on my behalf and I just I just threw in the towel on that because you can't just do it sometimes like for anybody listening who's like I want to dabble in short-term Bitcoin trading it's not something you can dabble in you have to be like Avi like you're you're at your screen and let me let me let me just you know preface this is like I'm not always right like I I do I do get chopped up i told you have to always be right if you say directional calls though yeah that's true that's true according to CT if you ever say anything wrong your reputation should be ruined forever you should actually be thrown in jail like I think being wrong is a jailable offense in Trump's America um okay guys I think we got to wrap it there we are the last recording on the Expo Hall of the Digital Asset Summit that is it if you weren't here you just missed a really great three days but the good news is that we got permissionless in June in Brooklyn if you're if you're a builder if you love the tech you got to come to that and then we're doing the digital asset summit again in London this fall so don't miss that as well but uh it was a ton of fun it was good to catch up with you guys good to see you that was that was always great that was fun thank you Felix really appreciate it thank you so much i I always learn from these conversations appreciate you having us [Music]

this episode is brought to you by kraken otc get access to 247 trading services for high- netw worth individuals and institutional clients to execute orders over $50,000 you'll hear more about them later in the show [Music] wow can't see anything how you doing obby i'm doing great yeah lights are bright up here it's a big big stage um well welcome everybody just to do some quick introductions we'll get that out of the way i am avi felman one of the two co-hosts of the thousandx podcast you know interesting i met jonah at ftx bahamas way back in the day right before the whole ftx thing collapsed and post ftx we realized there was probably a need for a place where two traders could come together and talk to each other intelligently about the markets uh you know we found that a lot of the information that you get in crypto is is very high level it's a lot of talk about you know macro and long-term trends which i think is great but you know it's it's also good to get into the nitty-gritty and figure out how you should actually trade and make money in this extremely volatile asset class so that's how we got together so thank you guys for coming out and listening to us uh talk to each other yeah thank you very much for being here i'm i'm jonah vanborg i'm the other uh co-host of the the thousandx podcast and what our podcast is about um we're trying to bring the sort of conversations that you'd hear on a trading floor into a podcast format so that when you make your crypto trading decisions you don't necessarily feel alone or live in your own little mental echo bubble of um you know potentially bad decisions you want to you want to at least stress test your ideas with other people and a lot of crypto traders out there don't really have that so avi and i are attempting to create it but it really was born of just a phone call that we used to have once a week talking about markets uh and i i learned something on every single one of these podcasts uh ultimately the the big question that keeps coming up every single week for us is okay there's all this blockchain technology being built we all we're all here in crypto because we believe that this is going to revolutionize finance and change the way that value is transferred but how do we make money from it right now like how do we get rich quick with this stuff how do we how do we position ourselves for the next day or week or month because it's a little bit harder to get excited about hanging on to something for eight years especially if that thing even if you're you know right place right time if you're in the wrong asset uh you just get left in the dust so on on that note maybe we should kick it off with what's what's happening right now why why are markets getting you know jonah i know i know our podcast is called a thousandx but i don't know if we should say get rich quick you know get rich slowly in an asset class that's growing substantially so maybe it happens very quickly yeah there you go give a little bit of a hedge to it and i mean to be completely honest things have happened really really really quickly over the last 6 months yeah i mean if you look back to where we were in mid 2024 we had had this amazing run of btc going up to you know 70 $70,000 and then for you know three four five months we kind of went sideways and we went down we went all the way from 70 to 50 because at the time there was you know there wasn't really good news propelling bitcoin up and and what had sent bitcoin to the heights of 70 was the etf flows after the etf got launched a ton of people piled in capital and we were seeing tremendous inflows and then we didn't really get anywhere until trump got elected where at that point a bunch of people start flooding into the market expecting that trump is going to be amazing for for bitcoin and for the rest of the crypto world and now we sit here today where we're actually only 20% above the peak of bitcoin all the way if you go all the way back to 2021 we also hit uh se 70k back then we're only 20% higher despite all this good news despite talk of a strategic bitcoin reserve despite the actual setting up of the national strategic reserve where it you know the government has announced they're not going to be selling bitcoin so how is it possible we're only 20% higher is is is a big question yeah i mean i've been struggling with this question as well because you know it could telegraph one of two things either a the you know the price is too low right now and there's this tremendous opportunity uh you know coming our way in the next one to three months that we should be you know prepared to capitalize on we should be hanging on through these difficult times um or b you know weakness when there should be strength as as a trader usually that that's a a pretty big red flag that that should tell you to run for the you know run for the fences so ultimately i remain extremely bullish from here and i think that one of the things that we need to pay attention to is the bitcoin s&p ratio i think that a lot of this selloff has absolutely nothing to do with crypto you know that ratio has been fairly stable throughout the sell-off unlike 2022 when the ratio tanked 2021 when the ratio ripped really you need to sort of disagregate how much of the price action is due to just general macro factors and how much of it is due to you know fear greed related to to bitcoin which is obviously the bellweather asset for our space we can talk about how cryptox bitcoin is is suffering a little bit price price-wise right now in a way that bitcoin isn't but let's leave that for later in the conversation right now i think that bitcoin is holding up much more than it should throughout this macro sell-off and i'm not really worried about the macro picture either just you know a very quick sound bite on it i think that you know it's it's time to talk about donald trump a little bit he's he's got he's got some big things going on he's transferring taxation from you know trying to transfer taxation from income to consumption that's one big thing he's got going on and then you know there's another effort within his administration to transfer gdp contribution from government spending to private spending those two big realignments are shaking markets volatility shaking markets but i don't think he has the mandate i don't think he got elected on a mandate to tank asset prices and so i think you know if the s&p drops another 10% then you're in you know you're in real correction recession territory and i think that you know they're they don't have the mandate to to suffer a much bigger draw down than that i think they'll put a a floor under the market they have ample tools to do so rates can get cut a lot from here uh before you even have to start qe there's tons of cash out there tons of private credit to cushion any dip so i think i think the s&p is floored 10% under here meaning if the bitcoin s&p ratio stays consistent like it has been you know i i think we've got a you know maybe another 10% dip in bitcoin 20% max before before the stimulus or the rate cuts start buoying things and 10%'s a lot in s&p it's not a lot for crypto this episode is brought to you by kraken otc one of crypto's longest running exchanges with over a decade of experience with kraken otc

show notes to get accurate crypto taxes with no guesswork thanks to cryptotax calculator for making today's episode possible not a lot at all and i think you you know you you you hit on the answer to to why bitcoin is trading the way that it is yeah and it's that once trump came in there was all this enthusiasm a tremendous amount of people as i said poured into the market because of all this speculation about the spr and that the fact that the government might end up buying buying a ton of bitcoin that all got baked in we trade to 110,000 and then reality sets in and what do i mean by reality well trump is governing in a reasonably unpredictable manner for equity investors and what happens when volatility in a market goes up is that the value of cash increases commensurate with that and so where do people first raise cash they raise it in the most volatile assets like bitcoin and so as we entered into a new regime of okay higher volatility in the equity markets because of a more uncertain uh political rule well people are going to sell their bitcoin first because bitcoin one is very volatile and two it just went up a ton and so this is why i think bitcoin is maybe trading weaker than some people expect despite all of this amazing good news now with that in mind i think that there always in my head there's always been two ways to think about buying and selling crypto and bitcoin specifically the two reasons why people buy this asset buy it one for momentum it's going up and it's momentum asset so i want to catch the momentum and ride it and ride it higher or two they buy it at a value level where they feel like the riskreward is extremely good so you know when when it bitcoin hit $50,000 in the middle of last year you're thinking okay well if this thing can go to 100k based on good you know political climate uh that's a that's a 2x for me and maybe i can stop out below the etf uh you know the the etf first bounce at 40k right so i've got like a really really good riskreward so you always have to think of it in terms of momentum and value so right now we clearly don't have momentum we've gone sideways to down for three months now so there's no momentum in the market so the next question you have to ask yourself is well where do people find value in btc uh you know so you look at the you look at the price targets and you try to construct a good good ratio you say to yourself okay well if i think the us government actually does buy even a tiny little bit of bitcoin this thing's going to 150k and so you think well where do i get a 2x that's 75 and that's about where bitcoin price stabilized last week and this is how i i sort of approach trading in a nutshell is you're always looking for that good ratio of risk to reward and then you're looking for well what's going to drive this higher right and what are the risks well the risks as jonah said were mainly the equity markets at this point i think that's what's it's like a beach ball underwater right now once that resolves if you see vix come under come under 20 sustain you see s&p start grinding up and not popping up i always get really nervous in markets like this if you get like a 3 4% day in equities what you really want to see is you want to see a slow steady grind higher that's that's a lot healthier and if we see that vix come down then i think bitcoin's in a really good place because people are in my opinion underallocated based on the amount of good things that have happened for it over the last 3 months speaking of underallocation i would like to ask the audience a question um you know you guys are obviously you know you have your fingers on the pulse of crypto you're here at d uh you know really trying to understand the space better and network within it how many of you sold core holdings and by core holdings i mean like i'm not talking about like the meme coins that you play around with i'm talking about bitcoin eth salana stuff that you you want it you want to be invested in for years to come how many of you sold core holdings like a nice chunk of core holdings since the election i'm going to try to see who's who's sold it feels like a very sparse number of people raising their hands here yeah not that many yeah so okay to me you know the etf outflows have been huge right but it's it's clearly not you guys and i think this is informative it's not you guys it's not the crypton natives the people who are closest to the space who are selling i think it's the people who are in for a trade they're out i think that clears the i think that clears the thicket for maybe another another rally there are a couple of exogenous macro catalysts that could totally screw everything up though um one of them i think is kinetic war in iran i think people underestimate that yes there's a you know i'm an oil trader by trade so i i think about things in commodities terms yes there's a you know a mismatch between the power of the united states military and the power of the iranian military but they do have that that straight of horm through which a third of the the world's oil goes if they're really threatened they could shut it off and the loss of that maritime traffic would cause oil to spike to god knows what price $200 $300 a barrel at least that would tank the s&p and i i doubt anybody would be thinking about buying crypto especially altcoins in that world i'd put that at a you know 5% probability right now and you're seeing in the market today i think is is reflecting you know not a huge probability obviously of that happening but the escalation yesterday in the middle east is leading today gold was up a percent equities down 2% you're seeing that fear sort of creep into the market that is a real threat for crypto and and the opposite side of that coin you know a potential macro exogenous macro catalyst is if daytona and maybe a ceasefire happen in ukraine um commodities prices are going to tank inflation comes down then the fed has pretty much no excuse to start to to hold off on cutting rates especially with federal unemployment ticking up like i think that'll be a nice macro kind of tailwind so we have these this very kind of conflicting macro backdrop but ultimately we're really just talking about bitcoin here like bitcoin does feel like great riskreward in the low 80s especially in the high7s 75k i think you're buying with both hands that's kind of like top of the pre-election range and things are so much better for crypto than they were before this election no

guesswork thanks to cryptotax calculator for making today's episode possible but you know it's it's just funny because you know when you when when we first got in to the sas class you know when i first got in in 2017 it's like this stuff didn't matter at all right whether there was a war brewing or what the equity markets were doing it didn't really matter that much for the price of bitcoin because all of the gains that bitcoin was getting were new people allocating to a completely new asset driving prices up today uh you know we're not early anymore bitcoin is a is a truly mature asset i disagree with that actually okay let's let's let's dive into that i think that you know we're all at the institutional bitcoin and crypto conference we you know i'm sure everybody in the audience can think of a trillion dollar pool of assets that has a 0% bitcoin allocation and what if that goes to 10 basis points sort of the the institutions are coming narrative but it seems realer now because the sec stopped suing institutions so i think for bitcoin there will always be new pools of capital coming in new sovereign wealth funds new sbs you know at the us state level at the sovereign level around the world i'm not worried about new capital coming into bitcoin i'm worried about new capital coming into altcoins i like sent all altcoins we're in a savage bare market for altcoins right now sentiment is dire you wouldn't know it from the price of bitcoin but it's just you talk to people you know many of you have i'm sure you talk to people in who are invested in altcoins they are down bad they should be rallying retail is tapped out it's unclear where the new source of funds is coming from so how do you how do you navigate how do you invest in altcoins in this climate you can't just sit there with bitcoin in your bottom drawer and feel okay about that you know that's that's always been my biggest issue with crypto i mean basically ever since uh 2021 is i i don't really think crypto outside of bitcoin is an asset class you can just sit in and not look at if you're buying anything that isn't btc you constantly have to be underwriting that position i mean if you told somebody in 2019 that just even 3 years later uh ethereum would be losing out a substantial amount of its market share to a new l1 people were calling you a bit nuts there were only a few people that were making big bets on alternative l1s and really sticking to it thinking okay i think these things like salana can really really grow and that's because the world of crypto is open source and that makes it very easy to innovate and iterate on any sort of platform and the people that use crypto basically up until today they have very low switching costs to using the new platforms because the reality is most of these platforms are used for speculation uh i mean even even even today and so with basically every single project outside of outside of bitcoin which is now i think proving itself out to be a macro asset and a store of value or has proven itself out they can be disrupted in a month in two months and three months and so there has to be that constant underwriting of the situation which is why joan and i are traders yeah right which is why we try to take advantage of of situations like this right if you look at the broad alt space four years ago there weren't that many choices there were a few hundred reasonable things that you could put your money into today there are thousands you know including meme coins i mean i wouldn't call that reasonable but you know it's like you know there there are so many different things that you can you can put your money into and that kind of ruins for a lot of these things the core value which was that they were used as assets of speculation yeah so if money is spread out too thin then you can't have these things go up in aggregate i think a lot of people talk about the concept of an an alt season or you know bitcoin will lift everything with it and what we've seen is that actually is not happening anymore in any meaningful way if you look since the election the vast majority of assets xbtc are down since the election now or flat and that was that that would have been crazy back in in 2021 if you said bitcoin is going to be up you know 20 30% everything else is going to be down because these things for a long time everything outside of btc acted as beta to to bitcoin they were used as basically leverage to btc today the fundamentals of these assets and companies genuinely matter and the fundamentals change pretty rapidly and if what's really interesting is if you actually look back uh over four years the total value that are that was locked on ethereum so the the amount of money sitting on ethereum in the forms of stable coins or the forms of you know you deposit into a protocol like a which is barland protocol the tvl total value locked is actually down both in usd terms because obviously eth price is down but also in eth terms which means that it's it's bleeding it's bleeding usage meanwhile things like salana you know the the chart looks a little bit better for that but who knows where it's going to be in in in 3 to four years which is why you constantly have to be paying attention right but that you know what we always talk about is we say you know i don't want to just give you high level platitudes about what's happening like how do you make money on that right like where where are you looking the beauty of today is that we have all these different instruments so basically every coin that trades more than $10 million a day has a derivative on it and what you can do is you can actually look at the stuff that's really bad and you can short it and you can look at the stuff that's pretty good and you can buy it and you can wait six months if you've done your research right and you can end up in you know some pretty good fall adjusted positions and you know that's that's a little bit of uh of of what we do i mean it's it's all about now it's about really getting smart which is why you come to conferences like this you talk to people you get to understand where is money really being allocated what's really going on uh how do i make money on this where do where do i where do i put my own money basically xbtc the only thing that's done extremely well is stable coins but you know you unfortunately you can't put your money in usdc it's not going to go to $2 it's going to stay at one so like how are you going to you know how are you going to make money on stable coins well we we have come up with a way to make money over the course of the past two months we call it inverse alt season is the new alt season go on your your platform of choice and you short garbage that actually uh the sharp is pretty high it works um these things are just down only every single day as the mania fades and as another million tokens a week get minted uh now that you know creating a blockchain and creating a token is basically commoditized there's just this never- ending supply of blockchains uh getting thrown out there with their attached tokens lots of lots of alts to short finite amount of capital infinite amount of alts makes for some good shorts so we've been shorting a lot of stuff it's it's definitely a good thing to do because it feels like consensus mentality is still kind of anchored in this 2017 or 2021 cycle mode of like hey you know altcoins are beta to bitcoin they're not anymore there's there's bitcoin and then there's x bitcoin and crypto crypto is a misleading term now because it encompasses both bitcoin and non- bitcoin so and not not to be too pessimistic pessimistic oh i'm i'm getting to the optimistic part i i i don't want to go out here and be like you know everything's garbage sell it all because there are pockets of like you got to let me you turn out of this obvious no no no you're you're the bear now i'm the bull okay no basically to finish the thought my point was who is this guy anyway um the the my point was i think that's going to work for another two to three months i really do and i think you know just going back to the the bill gates technology truism after all this is just tradable technology right the bill gates uh the bill gates saying is people overestimate what technology can do in two years and underestimate what technology can do in 10 years maybe you shorten those cycles a little bit because crypto is faster i think people are you know we're in the we're in the sort of despair phase where overestimation of crypto's near-term potential is being reckoned with but you know just listening to the previous panel in the you know the green room back there it's it's abundantly clear that this asset class is going to enable some pretty spectacular um you know financial outcomes and that's why we that's why we're here and we really believe in this stuff it's just a question of how do you how do you navigate the short term be short stuff be short bad stuff and then how are you going to know when the turn comes my particular way to have my fingers on that pulse just in in you know the spirit of what obby said giving you actionable insights um during the last podcast that we did uh during the trump crypto summit it was clear that cardano was not you know they were walking back their comments about how cardano was going to get included in some sort of strategic reserve and that it's it was abundantly clear during the the conference that no sovereign buying of cardano was going to happen equally we noticed that litecoin was well off the highs ahead of a potential etf approval so i did a pairs trade while we were talking on the podcast i shorted cardano i i got long litecoin notional neutral week and a half later my p&l on that is flat which makes no faking sense right litecoin has a story cardano has a bad story there should be some p&l in there either proving or disproving my thesis but it's flat they're like on a percentage basis they're trading tick for tick which means that all that's going on right now is market maker on market maker violence there's just one correlation algo battling another this pair hasn't moved as soon as as soon as fundamental stories start to reemerge and i show p&l on trades like that or you do that's when you know a turn is coming that's when when you when you see that it's not just like this big macro algorithmic correlation trade within crypto and that suddenly like you know oh there's a little bit of buying of the good stuff and people are getting out of the bad things that's when you know that actual catalysts are taking place so i think we're in short mode while while it's just algo on algo violence for i i think it's going to be two to three months but my fingers are on the pulse with a couple of these pair trades earlier in today's episode i mentioned ledger's latest products the stacks and flex and i

telegram or visit walletconnect.network to stay ahead of what's next i'll say i'm i'm starting to see a little bit of green roots in one specific sector which is the rwa sector i want to go back to the point about stable coins like i said you know we're not going to you're not going to make money buying stable coins so what like what can you take away from the trend if people are saying "oh stable coins are going to be the next really big thing." your question has to be well well why like why are stable coins growing so much and the answer at least my answer is that the crypto world and blockchain is just a better technology for moving value around and so when you go down that a little bit more you say well what other forms of value need to be moved around i mean you look at every other security that exists on the planet that it's going to be better if that lives on blockchain systems and so what we're seeing is we're also seeing growth from some real world asset or rwa platforms that are tokenizing things like treasuries up to you know $4.6 billion of us treasuries is now tokenized on blockchain and that sector is going to continue to grow and you're seeing you know i'm not going to name out names i don't don't want to be accused of showing for anything but you know it's it that specific area it has both now the inflection point is hitting that it's growing reasonably rapidly and it makes sense right it's like okay well we know that's what crypto is good for so these things are probably going to grow faster than your you know dog whiff hat of the world which is just a lottery ticket it's not working by the way yeah that's that was a good short and probably will continue to be i i agree with you avi i think that stable coin growth while uninteresting from a short-term profit perspective is an interesting metric to monitor in so far as it's like okay so how how much of finance has proliferated on chain well you could divide total stable coin market cap by you know the market cap of all the fiat currencies in the world you can have whatever metric you want but it's still basically it's telling you that uh you know the story the story behind ai's uh tvl metric on ethereum yes in eth terms it's it's you know below the 2021 highs but it's been rallying a lot recently from the 2022 lows all stable coins what's that telling you well okay more money is moving on chain and the next thing that the money on chain is going to want to do is earn yield and the thing after that is it's going to want to trade tokenized equities and the thing after that is it's going to want to tokenize startup equity and and you know people are going to you we we collab on some some software projects tokens are a great way to to align people really easily across you know sovereign borders without a whole lot of paperwork it's it's an awesome and you know it's awesome tech we all believe in it we're all aware that if i want to send you a dollar here in a developed market it's easy you can do it in 10 seconds on zel if i want to send you one share of spy the s&p etf it's going to take two weeks a million questions and you know two hours on the phone with somebody we all believe in crypto for that purpose so it's it's a question of when not if and yeah i agree that stable coin adoption is is definitely the metric to look at for for when that happens what what's this what's this red clock ticking down to a minute we don't have a i think i think i think we just have a minute left to to talk to each other must be that we can go we can go speed round speed round what's my last name do you remember it it's van berg okay good no it's vanborg okay what's my last name feldman there's no d feldman it's my biggest pet peeve you know it's like we try not to be so uh so pess so pessimistic on uh on things but at the end of the day i mean that's how you survive in this asset class is you you you kind of have to be pessimistic because it's so easy to get caught up in the hype i mean i've been through this cycle quite a few times and at the highs you're looking at your portfolio and you're going i am the most brilliant man that has ever ex or woman that has ever existed on this planet look it's just straight up i'm never going to sell this thing is going to change the world uh you know and it's our job to sort of provide that sober outlook that you know maybe you should uh you should really consider what's going on under the hood thanks avi going to go have a glass of cold water thank you guys for sticking with us through this monologue appreciate it thank you so much [Music]

[Music] all right we're live live it's been a while since we did a live stream Obi I got I got to tweet out the link so that people know I mean I I saw that there were only 91 people in the waiting room oh it's growing fast 120 now okay we're waiting on Trump who is late per usual thank you Trump today today's been a very very very chopp day I have to say Trump's not late Al it's rude to say Trump's late oh sorry yeah Trump trump Trump's not late he's uh playing 40 chess owning the libs by not showing up on time exactly exactly it's all intentional why would I be on time when it's more advantageous to be not on time exactly you got to keep the people guessing right keep the people wanting I like how you've been tweeting stuff about Trump that's not like fawning you know obviously he pumped our bags uh I mean look my my my politics are my politics I try to not bring him into bring him into crypto I was a trump supporter still am in some ways but I just like I liked us better when we were underdogs now that we're on top it kind of sucks because it allows people to just say really dumb things and then say but we won the election and kind of get away with it mandate and that yeah and that just kind of pisses me off because there's you know what what what I'll say is that the way that I've always viewed things is that like Liberals are in the mid curve and Republicans are on both sides of the curve so like Liberals are solidly 100 IQ and then Republicans are like 80 IQ and 120 IQ and 40 IQ and yeah and and the issue is that I'm just seeing far too much of the 80 IQ stuff recently so it's kind of getting on my nerves um you know hope hopefully the 120 IQs will be able to get them to stop being so insane but I don't know [Music] um oh I already banned one anti-semite there was already one guy Nazi posting and I I I banned him it's the live streams are back everybody you know the the Nazi posting is kind of is kind of funny to me because like I mean honestly Jonah like what you just did was was extremely that was bad for the Jewish cause I'm not going to lie you can't just go around Banning people because they claim that we're censoring people and that you can't criticize us uh meanwhile the entirety of X is talking about how the Jews drink children's blood so like I I I I don't know really what they're talking about but by you Banning that person that proves that Jews control the media it proves it you ban somebody well Jews definitely this very Niche media channel called the Thousand X podcast is that is Thoroughly controlled by Jews yeah is 100% semi controlled as they say yeah exactly I would say 75% there's Yano you and me and then there's Mike gito he's he's not Yano Yano is Jewish his name is Jason yanowitz I don't know the dude's definitely never put on to Fillin but anyway okay fair enough I don't know I I'll ask him right now hey have you ever put on filling um like conformist says hello aian Jonah hello cono conformist live streaming is great yeah it is it is great especially because you know now we've got the prices here and everybody you you know one of the things that I run into which is kind of annoying is that when we record our podcasts people always they they wait like five days and then they get mad at me about something that I said five days ago and I have to remind everybody that I am a Trader and I do change my views so like when we recorded the podcast on Sunday night uh I did say I will admit it I said that this was probably a sell the news event and Bitcoin was trading at $94,000 and then Bitcoin went from $94,000 to 82,000 down 12% and everyone on Thursday was like in my comments like you told me it was sell the news and and and now you're tweeting TW in that you know you're not that bearish on bitcoin I'm like yeah dude from the time I said that it went down 12% like I don't know how much more to tell you yeah exactly it went down 12% like I I'm sorry I changed my view it's a different price it's a different exactly different price different view yeah um and now like you know ju just just just looking looking at BTC you were trading at 88130 now 121 now 17 now 128 um but you know we're we're trading at a price that I think is over the next week too low for Bitcoin given given everything that we know and every everything that's come out I mean I still think that you know this could be a slight sell the news maybe we trade down to 85 but I'm but I'm a buyer there and and the reason I'm a buyer is because th this is a Monumental moment uh where the US is coming out and saying guys Bitcoin is very serious we've established a strategic reserve and we're exploring ways to go buy it now we always knew that it wasn't going to be immediate that the US government was not going to be able to buy Bitcoin right off the bat that it was going to be a process but what's clear is that Trump is very serious about it his treasury secretary is very serious about it his cryptar is obviously very serious about it they're going to work on this uh and somebody I I was having a debate with somebody in DMS and then I'll stop my monologue but so having a debate with somebody in DM which says you know Trump can't Trump doesn't take steps he just does something or he doesn't do something and so their take which got a lot of retweets on on Twitter because they they publicly tweeted out I won't name the person but they public I was like you know I this is this is this is not great like we you know Trump takes big leaps he doesn't take small steps and so this small step to me indicates that we're not going to get anything else right like this is it and then he's gonna he's going to move on but I I I view it sort of differently I mean if you really think about it like we're seeped in Bitcoin 247 we are deep in the world of crypto we bleed orange drink we [ __ ] crypto we we are you you you bleed orange because you're Jew I bleed red because I'm not a Jew uh but you know the long story short is that the rest of the world like they still view this thing as a crazy like a crazy little experiment they they haven't grasped that this is now a global financial asset and so yes I do think that he's going to take steps with this and no I don't think that it's going to be immediate but 88,000 I mean look we're down off the highs we're down from 109,000 to 87 that's a 20% dip and that to me suggests that a lot of the Euphoria about Trump has been washed out and I mean if you look at oi you look at positioning I think people are generally pretty nervous about Bitcoin right now and I've transitioned my mindset from short-term Trader to more okay I would like to accumulate Bitcoin below $85,000 a Bitcoin because I think in six months it's going to go higher I do think that we're gonna welome to the club Obi welcome to the longer medium to longterm Club what what you know what's funny is that you know PE people are like what do you mean you're changing your time frames and and as a Trader you have to understand what Market regime you're in um you know you have to understand what's coming and right now we're in mean reversion mode so if you look at the chart since you know for over the last week it's it's pure just literally pure meanor version like that is what the chart is it's pure meanor version and it it tends to be that Bitcoin needs some amount of time in mean verion mode before it goes back into trending mode and so my my take here is that I need to broaden my time you know I need to broaden my time Horizons you know I I can't buy buy Bitcoin and bet that it's up 30% in 3 weeks like I was bet betting before I have to say Okay well what's a good price for Bitcoin over the next three months to Let Me Wait and be patient and accumulate there so like feel like hey should I buy Bitcoin here at 87,7 187 my answer to you is be patient like you don't necessarily need to buy it right now because volatility is high but at the same time time I do think that in six months it's much higher yeah I think so too I think it's an interesting and solid take I like that you're thinking about it more the way I do this time which is you know long-term view Bitcoin goes up a lot bitcoin's legitimate now uh how can I accumulate rather than how do I trade in the short term at the risk of being flat for the big long move uh upwards I think you know I made a call on the last podcast we recorded on a Sunday night it was trading 92k I said it was going to trade down to 87 and it did but I didn't capitalize on it as I publicly announced I wouldn't attempt to do because I don't think that short-term trading works for me first of all I live in a high tax area so having my whole portfolio be short-term capital gains is you know I don't I don't want that and second of all um the like while I was right about that call being right about those short-term calls uh is fleeting right it gives you confidence to start trading more and churning more and then you start getting them wrong then your tax base is all [ __ ] up and uh you risk missing the forest for the trees which in my case is you know much much higher prices so I just I'd rather you know do what you're doing try to try to time accumulations rather than trade short term here like here to me this is the most bullish setup ever over the medium to long term like Texas just approved their legislature approved a strategic Bitcoin reserve the United States of America basically just greenl a strategic Bitcoin reserve and I I did some some back of the envelope math this morning the value of all the gold at Fort Knox is worth about $450 billion um if you were to sell 10% of that gold to buy Bitcoin um you would wind up with roughly that's that's that that that's that's a huge assumption yeah I know I'm not assuming anything I'm just giving you math I said math no assumptions here this is math so we're you sell 10% of the gold in Fort Knox to buy Bitcoin you get half a million units of Bitcoin and there's been some chatter about hey the United States wants a million units of Bitcoin you know like let's if they did that they'd send the price up $100,000 a token so maybe they'd get less than half a million units of Bitcoin maybe they'd get quarter million I don't know just assuming the worst but like at the same time you know they are exploring budget neutral ways to increase their Bitcoin stockpile that's that's been stated so we shouldn't assume that they're just going to be happy with their current Holdings we should assume they're going to try to like sell other stuff real estate and other hard Commodities like gold to maybe buy some Bitcoin they might they might not do it in the $50 billion dollar range which is what I just suggested they might do in the5 billion dollar range to start but you know the the genie is out of the bottle now and you can't put it back in and all this does is Telegraph to the rest of the world bitcoin's legitimate the IMF can't penalize El Salvador anymore for doing Bitcoin stuff the United States does it too every country is going to start accumulating Bitcoin for a strategic Bitcoin Reserve even if America doesn't like spend taxpayer dollars uh to buy Bitcoin you know other countries probably will right so this is this is a big deal there a big [ __ ] yeah this is this is the start of the game theory now the one thing that throws the wrench in the plan is just how terrible equities have been trading and so I I do want to talk about that for a minute I mean s S&P is down you know almost 10% off the highs nasdaq's down about you know a little bit less than 10% um and people are very nervous and I think rightfully so you know if you if you look at the moving all the moving averages for the S&P we've broken them you know we we bro broken the 50 we've broken the well not not the not the hundred yet but we've broken the 50 for the first time since November of 23 and that's uh you know I I think that's causing a lot of people pause and what people are nervous about again rightfully so is that all of this uncertainty around Trump and the way that he governs and the way that he acts will cause a 20% draw down in the S&P will cause a 20% draw down in NASDAQ and that drags BTC with it so why not be why not be more patient right and I do I do sympathize with that view um but before I go into my take I'd like to hear yours yeah I mean so actually plotted the Bitcoin S&P ratio this morning I'm going to see if I can sh share it uh share screen oh no I can't it's weird okay so basically I plotted Bitcoin versus S&P and before the election the ratio is 12 uh now basically like S&P was 112th the price of Bitcoin then Bitcoin ripped and it went up as high as 18 now it's back to 15 and 15 is kind of exactly where it was on Friday November 15th like two weeks after the election so basically when Bitcoin started to stabilize postelection um you know that's where we that's where Bitcoin S&P the ratio is trading and the reason why the ratio is important is because it helps you kind of disaggregate how much of this current bearish price action in Bitcoin is just Market selling off and how much of it is you know crypto specific disappointment so I think a lot of people are completely ignoring the they're not like rationalizing in their minds like how much of this selloff is related to just macro markets coming off and how much of it is like crypto specific and my answer is like very little of it is crypto specific uh there's been some you know volatility in this ratio it went as low as uh you know 13 and a half and that was the screaming buy I think basically we need to obv you and I need to look at this ratio and decide for ourselves like if this if this rtio goes back to where it was pre-election then bitcoin's a screaming by um you know ultimately a lot Bitcoin is really being influenced by macro price action and you know I guess now I owe you a a very hot take sort of like a sound bite on where I think macro is going the Administration has very clearly telegraphed they're not optimizing for S&P performance right these two seconds uh but it's also clear they're not going to let the market fall out of bed either so I think we just get some more chop I think they keep turning up the heat on markets and tariffs and doing all the things that are freaking out macro investors but you know there should be there is no alternative to buying crypto and buying snps right if these things start to crash too hard um the government will will step in they're not going to let a crisis occur on their hands so I guess the question is like how comfortable are you catching a falling knife here knowing that knowing that the administration is going to catch the knife for you at some point and it's going to rip right back once they do so for me like as long as you're not running any leverage as long as you're not doing things that could force you to sell the lows um you know I I think if Bitcoin hits 80k It's a screaming buy with both hands no matter what if this ratio goes back below 13 Bitcoins is screaming by no matter what and if the S&P trades down another 10% everything is a screaming bu uh because if it goes down more than that then we're technically in a recession and um all hell is going to break loose for the Trump people well I mean recession is based on GDP but yes I I I do I do take your point yeah uh sorry we're in like a proper bare Market let's call it and I I don't think that the Democrats are going to be nice to the Trump people if the you know he came in with this promise of economic prosperity and then suddenly we're in like a [ __ ] terrible bare Market with unemployment spiking and everything but that's you know that that's a little bit of what Trump is I think trying to message around is he knows that the actions that he's taking right now are going to cause short-term pain he he understands that and what he's trying to message is he's trying to message okay well even if they're short-term pain don't worry what Trump uh sorry what bessent said specifically is there's no Trump put there's a trump upside call option uh which I think is kind of like a funny way to I saw say things uh and really really what he's what what he's trying to say is that uh you know Trump trump is not going to announce anything to try to save the market if it's down 10 per. now if we go back to his first Administration the largest draw down that the SN uh sorry that NASDAQ specifically saw though no no no no no sorry uh let me be be more clear the the largest draw down exco okay was 20 was was was 20% and that was October 2018 to January to uh January of 2019 and I think that probably represents the largest draw down that the administration is willing to take I mean there's kind of nothing that they could have done about covid but barring a covid situation I think that that 20% level based on his PRI prior Administration is is a reasonable level to say okay well that's exactly what I just said I couldn't agree more the Market's already you know 8% off the highs so another 10% draw down and I think that's where they start to calm down a little bit with the the fiery rhetoric and the tariffs the difference is this time uh what really matters is that 10year treasury yield as well because that's what the administration has said over and over and over that they're that they're focusing on I do think if we see a draw down then we get there and my looks like Trump's live now but I just want to finish this one point um a substantial amount of the economy is being driven by the top earners and that means if the stock market goes down another 10% then we're going to see the economy really slow in a way that we haven't seen before with a down 20% stock market agreed all right let's listen to Trump is he going yeah there he is he's kind of rambling he he does that he does that I mean the the the real the real thing to watch out for is is he gonna say we're taking buying Bitcoin seriously like that's really the that's like the sentence that matters the most like how seriously is bus he taking the concept of buying Bitcoin for the government I love Trump he cracks me up but he looks like a child signing things with his [ __ ] Sharpie you know he's got his gimmick let him have it I guess yeah and Bitcoin selling off a bit here I mean yeah I I I really do think that positioning was washed out so if you see a dip here I mean I'm a short-term buyer of that dip like you know I'd buy I'd buy 855 to sell back at back at 88 I'd probably even buy here as like if if we get to the end and there hasn't been a massive selloff that's probably a buy because I think people are selling it expecting positioning to wash out yeah I mean I think what would be bearish today I guess he could say like we're going to look at doing things with Bitcoin promises made if he says like oh it's it's a really it's a it's a long road but we'll get there we'll get there eventually I mean that would be bad yeah um I think we're going to look at ways to accumulate Bitcoin without costing the taxpayer dime I don't know maybe maybe not we'll see that could be a little bearish but honestly I I agree with you I don't think that people who I don't think there's any dry powder left to sell um for stupid little reasons like Trump's commentary I think what it would take for Bitcoin to really nuke would be people like you and me deciding oh no like the Paradigm shifted back to like the Biden Administration in front of our eyes and we're giving up on on our you know $150,000 thesis because of something major that's being announced I don't think like little rhetorical things could cause a major selloff um and just like they're different you know there are different time frames and there are different groups of capital that attach themselves to those time frames so like I think the medium and the long-term you know guys are still in and have have lots of Bitcoin to sell if something C happens today which I don't think it will but the short-term guys who are just like trying to get in and out for five grand a token on bitcoin I think I think you're right they're all out the Leverage is flush the oi is down the day trading Community is either sidelined or they've converted like you did to you know maybe a more medium-term view I mean he's talking but not about crypto he's talking about the Olympics on the World Cup right now isn't it amazing that he gets the 250 year anniversary he gets the Olympics and he gets the World Cup all in one presidency who the hell is this guy next to him uh I was gonna say he looks a lot like Alejandro mayorcas the previous head of Homeland Security but I doubt it's him uh Trump probably fired that guy XI Jin ping just dropped a comment in the Fox News Feed get to to work Democrats democraps sorry with the p thanks the the FIFA president apparently thank you guda eater FIFA the most corrupt organization in the world you think crypto's corrupt wait till you see FIFA you know one of the I think I think one of the better trades that's going to come out of this in addition to buying if it doesn't if it doesn't nuke after the end of the Summit is uh if you can short if you can short cardano and hold on to the volatility like you know Pi pick pick pick your spots but I mean this thing it has not retraced its pump and they've made it very clear there's going to be zero buying of cardono or or any other altcoin it's just going to be not selling it um if if they sees it which I don't think the US government has sees any cardano anyway um that's I mean I I I think I think that's that's game over for these guys the these these guys are going to get washed out and and it hasn't gone down that much because I think people are still holding on to hope I mean they rumors that Garling house donated to the Trump Administration but I don't think that really means anything like a you know long hype short cardano trade or long BTC short cardano trade is probably a very good pair here yeah cardano's Trading I like short cardano long US dollar I like that pair so maybe I'm just going to sell little uh cardano right now hold on it's a good trade I was thinking of doing it but I just didn't I don't know I wasn't convicted enough to do it but this is what happens when you talk to other Traders you you build conviction because it's an obvious one xrp is a little bit harder one to sell because it feels like there's active participation in the company that issued it but cardano is like so clearly vaporware that um you know you can probably feel better about selling that one XR xrp is tougher because I think that they're very likely over the next four years going to go public especially under I mean especially under this Administration and I think that's that's a catalyst for them and also uh they had I mean if if if you look at xrp there's also less room down so from the time Trump tweeted or truth social or whatever the [ __ ] you call a truth social post um from the from the time that he talked about xrp in his true social post it's only there's only a 10% down to the beginning of that candle or is whereas cardano still has another 20% to go and again I think I think these are short-term trades I mean past that specific mean version I wouldn't take the trade and I think this is important just to reiterate you you always have to know where your Edge is in these types of Trades and the edge is that the buyers on the headline that oh Ada might be part of the Strategic Reserve blah blah blah all this those guys are going to get washed out at some point yeah and what and that and that might you know what what I'll say is that might also be relative to BTC so if you're really going to trade it you know I i' I'd buy it against or i' I'd short it against BTC I wouldn't necessarily do it outright although that could work as well um given given the amount of cell pressure but it's it's really against the other assets that that makes sense I mean soul is somebody said I was short Soul just just added just added Ada uh Soul's a little bit tougher because it has the unlocks associated with it so I think a lot of that negative price action was you know was was was sort of baked in like if you if you go to if you go to the soul chart it's basically already retraced the full candle mhm uh and so short soul is I think a little bit more dangerous than short Ada but short Ada I think bleeds I wouldn't I wouldn't short salana I mean Solana has real stuff going on you know salana they they could come out tomorrow and announce with some crazy new product or service on their chain and it would you'd get your eyes ripped out uh cardano that you're you're just not running that dual risk you know yeah 100% I mean bitcoin's actually holding up here a decent amount despite the fact that Trump's not talking about it or or or or anything at all um talking about the talking about the World Cup but I you know I do I do think this is this is a promising this is a promising sign I just sold some cardano um you can you can watch me get my eyes ripped out live on the THX live stream if Trump shows up in the next half hour and it's like cardano is going to be a critical element of the reserve we're going to buy as much that one as we can the rest of them budget neutral except cardano yeah I'm a buy I'm a buyer of BTC here cut under we we can cut under 87 I think that's a that's a reasonably good trade given how it's been reacting to this I mean you have to I mean you have to remember that we went up to $94,000 in a straight line after Trump announced this uh SBR and then we went down in a straight line 15% and then yesterday on the David sack tweet about Bitcoin being held but not necessarily being bought I mean what he specifically said is they're exploring budget neutral ways to add Bitcoin to the balance sheet of which by the way there are a few that they can do without Congressional approval so that's promising at least even if they buy a tiny bit that's a that that's that's a very good sign but it we sold off basically in a straight line down you know 7% uh that washed out all of the positioning and if you look at oi uh now I mean we're pretty we're pretty flat to the point where I think that this this level becomes a good base for BTC this this 85 where we couldn't break before to 87 level it's a good psychological level too because Bitcoin was kind of like before the election Bitcoin was kind of like 55 bid at 75ish that was the range and so if we trade too far below 85 then suddenly we're in the pre-election range which makes no [ __ ] sense whatsoever because in hindsight it's clear that you know a comma Administration would be very different towards crypto than a trump Administration so if you're trading in like comma Administration territory you're supposed to you're supposed to own it because the just the policies of this Administration are so clearly you know constructive on a relative basis to the previous range that's why I really subscribe to the idea by the way that I mean we're like kind of reasonably I mean think about this we're reasonably close to Prior highs given the fact I mean we're you know we're 15% away from from prior highs that occurred in a period where none of this was taking place and so to me what that what that suggests is that a lot of the weakness is directly tied to equities and based on what I said at the beginning of this podcast that I think 20% down is a bit of the limit for Trump um you know I we're at least we're at least reasonably close to the end I mean if if NASDAQ went down and another another 10% I think Bitcoin would be probably 78 which in the grand scheme of things is really not that far from here um you know another another 10% I mean I I think you're just supposed to be a buyer at that level if NASDAQ goes down another 20% cardano 10% sorry NASDAQ down 10% I think cardano is down 50% which is why I really like that long BTC short cardano trade you know um yeah this is this is the type of Market when things are uncertain and there's a lot of meanor verion and equities are doing are doing poorly there really only two things you can do in this market uh and that's accumulate when you think prices are very cheap um or pair trade and the best pair trades I can see in this market again are the the short cardano long BTC I do still like the long LTC trade because I think it's very likely that it get that it gets an ETF and outperforms the rest of to the market because of that um well now you know the last time we discussed Litecoin it was trading $140 a token which is like basically cycle highs you know you said you liked it then I asked you do you really want to buy it on the highs you said no I don't now it's down 30% it's trading 105 a token which is um bottom of the bottom of the post elction range and I like it here too yeah I mean let's like the BTC ratio is trading at 0.0012 and I think we can probably get up to to 14 which is a 20% move about yeah you know 18 18% move and so I think that's actually a reasonable a reasonable trade as well so here's the trade buy Litecoin short cardano that's a good yeah I I think that's a very very reasonable and good trade other than that I mean the Market's kind of uninspiring you have some potential for these Revenue gen generating protocol like if Bitcoin gets a bounce I think they're going to be the first to be bought but you need to bet on a sustained trend from BTC in order to see these guys do well like I think like you know I think a bitcoin's at 95 a is probably up 40% in in that particular scenario one thing I've been you know that I was right for about three and a half days and then started nuking uh was was it AI coins it looks like they've got more to go more nuking to go more nuking to go unfortunately yeah I mean I posted about this I got a lot of [ __ ] for it this morning I posted that you know using virtuals and realizing that a no code agent platform produces terrible agents um you know virtuals was still on the highs we were using virtuals our agent was terrible when it was a no code agent like that would have been the cue for like sell but I held on because I've got this mentality that holding on works because it's worked for me in the past still working for me with Bitcoin with salana it worked for me with ethereum back in the day like I got this like hold buy and hold hold on for dear life mentality it's so destructive to have that mentality in this market for anything that isn't BTC because like even when the signals are clear as day like hey this product is is not what it's supposed to be a no coding is like it's B we were holding virtuals tokens when it was clearly the next friend Tech like no one used it no one cared and I I didn't sell fast enough because of my hotle mentality um you know just got to be mindful of that stuff so I posted about that and people interpreted it at me as like they're [ __ ] on me because I recommended virtuals but even though nothing I say is financial advice and even though I owned that loss on the podcast and on Twitter um just want to say it again like I made that mistake and I'm determined not to make that mistake again which is I have to use the chain see if it's good or bad and if it's bad get the [ __ ] out immediately yeah I think one of the things that was T was tough there is that at the time I mean it was the best yeah out there and what I didn't necessarily appreciate is just how [ __ ] annoying a lot of these AI agents are yeah they're they're so bad they're you know they now now they're like commoditized under every single [ __ ] tweet uh and they're a lot of people block them a lot a lot of people get annoyed about them but I think I still think you know maybe I'm maybe I'm delusional but I still think that changes pretty significantly once they become good which probably based on based on the progress of development right now six six to 12 months out yeah I don't think you want to sleep on them at low prices let's look at the funding though Jack uh from the chat put in a good uh good tweet said funding is still negative across the board is that true let me pull out my dashboard here one second and we're live with Trump oh boy now fun funding's not negative it's flat I mean it's it's lower for sure than it's not strong positive yeah it's basically flat which kind of is negative for BTC because the average is you know 0.1 yeah um I mean xrp is negative cardono is negative which is something which is something to watch out for probably short I mean you know shorts closing which is um part of the reason keeping it up but I do think that inevitably spot takes that over and and and bleeds it lower okay I mean so basically we've in 38 minutes on this stream we've articulated three different trades one is if Bitcoin is above 87 at the end of this it's probably a buy uh on a massive like on a steep selloff also Pro probably a buy I would say cardono is a great short and Litecoin is a good long so that's that's you know a few actionable things that you can take away from this stream if if if nothing else you know if you take away nothing else from this stream at least we G we gave you that yeah luckily nothing we say is financial advice so no one's actually GNA do any of that or if they do it's not because we listen to me or you yeah all right let's see is your is your uh stream up today yeah I just see a room with a bunch of guys in suits including the Winkle VI [ __ ] Winkle by they really crushed it they're everywhere don't they all right Trump he's coming out come on yeah I'm not you know okay now now now now we're already up 600 bucks from when I was like okay time to let's see let's see if let's see if this continues it's it'sit it's bit I mean it's just such a choppy Market Jonah yeah I mean when you were when you were when you were trading actively at Cumberland and you were trying to design strategies I mean h how would you trade these events with robots I would not um I would not act actively click trade these types of things oh with trade events um so in volatile markets I wouldn't actively click trade uh in events uh I would I would sort of I just wasn't a big events Trader Obi this isn't my forte you know obviously if something is a paradigm shift like the election I would buy like I even in my post Cumberland career I would buy a rallying Market you know because if it hadn't priced enough but like things like this I wouldn't actively trade them one sec where Jonah go looks like it's just me and you boys hop in the YouTube comments if you want to say anything to me looks like I mean it looks like we're looks like we're trading trading all right we're actually starting to outperform a bit on the equity side what is what is this guy gonna say you know that's that's that's a crazy thing is you never you never know what's going to come out of his mouth I can can offhand comment like doing my best to buy Bitcoin send this market up 5% welcome back Jonah sorry about that no problem still haven't got the stream to load oh when 1,000x to5 very actually I can't say that but we we are we are actively working on a terminal which is going to blow out every it's gonna blow your mind it's gonna be better than Bloomberg basically well okay let's not go that far but um it's it's it's going to be good and I think all the people that faded it are going to be very very sad I think so too honestly um well what the what the heck is going on here in this room is that a Bitcoin I don't where are you seeing this send send the link in the chat yeah here click this there's a trophy a giant gold trophy what's crazy is that literally every stream that I click on just has like an infinite amount of this is I'm watching the fox stream let's watch the stream together so basically we have Trump to his left is Scott bessent the very first hedge fund manager in charge of the US Treasury so anybody who's saying that I'm wrong that he won't sell gold on the highs to buy Bitcoin before it 10x is I just want to remind you the American treasury is being traded by a Soros Cub hedge fund manager that's sitting to his left then there's Howard lutnick to the left of him the guy who manages the tether Treasury and is uh you know i' would say the scami person in the administration by far uh then to his right is David saaks I have a lot of respect for that guy to the right of David Sachs is an unknown guy in a suit and uh to the right of that guy is Michael sailor literally literally the the the Bitcoin buyer of this cycle so I think this is going to be a I think this is gonna be a banger it's already looking like it why do they keep talking about FIFA I don't know but Trump is doing the stop talking about FIFA I want to talk about pumping your bags why are we watching this I'm muting it somebody talk to me when it's something we care about again for is that is that a yellow orange tie that I see oh oh my oh here we go if if this were three months ago FIFA Coin would already be at 300 million imagine seeing this lineup and this YouTube video last summer imagine if you could look into the future and see this Summit what price would you associate with Bitcoin like we're in the middle of the Biden Administration and somebody shows you this YouTube video from March 7th 2025 Obi AI imagine it's last summer you don't know the outcome of the election and somebody from the future shows you just this YouTube video with these people Bitcoin would be at least $10 there he goes America will be the Bitcoin superpower of the world crypto Capital over the planet historic action to deliver on the promise he said the word soic pcoin Reserve virtual Fort KNX for digital gold he called it digital gold it's a big thing that's his words sad he didn't say bigly why didn't he say bigly that's sad hoping for a bigly already among the largest holders of Bitcoin federal government 200,000 Bitcoin owned by the US government billions and billions of dollars billions and billions the rule that every Bitcoin knows very well never sell your Bitcoin that's a little phrase that they have I don't know if that's right or not who the hell knows right barish never never sell your Bitcoin he said I don't know if that's right I like that it's been right and we let's keep it that way who knows but so far it's been right let's keep it that way also explore new pathways to accumulate additional Bitcoin Holdings for the reserve provided it's done at no cost to the taxpayers we don't want any cost to the taxpayers in addition my order directs federal agencies to conduct an inventory of all crypto assets currently held by the US government and determine how they can be transferred easily to the treasury non-bitcoin dig digital assets will be held in a new US digital asset stockpile where there will be managed properly my Administration also is working to end the federal bureaucracy's war on crypto which was really going on pretty wildly during Biden until the election came about about uh five months before the election he became a big fan because he heard how many people were in favor of it and how many people love it and respect it but I guess it didn't work out too well for him people people understood what was going on and paved the way for groundbreaking Innovations and institutional Finance under the Bitcoin Administration Regulators strong armed Banks I mean they really did they strong arm Banks into closing the accounts of crypto businesses and entrepreneurs effectively blocking some money transfers to and from exchanges and they weaponize government against Donald industry but I know that feeling also maybe better than you do all of that will soon be over and we are ending operation choke point [Applause] 2.0 now some people really suffered it was ridiculous what they were doing but in the end uh they came around but they came around for the wrong reasons they came around only because they wanted votes and they saw that tens of millions of people are you know were against them because of what they were doing I also want to express my strong support for the efforts of lawmakers in Congress as they work on bills to provide regulatory certainty for dollar backed stable coins and the digital assets Market they're working very hard on that this is a tremendous opportunity for economic growth and Innovation SS like he's not going to say anything too interesting so maybe a small sell off here really go a long way I think there going to be a tremendous a tremendous we feel like Pioneers in a way tremendous method of growth and uh things are very much tied and we want to keep it that way the US dollar long into the future we're going to keep it that way I hope lawmakers will send that legislation to my desk before August recess if they can all right let's wash out the people that much working with you and you know a lot of them and a lot of them were committed right from the very beginning so I just want to congratulate you all for being at the White House today and a man who knows more about Bitcoin it's not selling off anybody David Saxon like to have you say a few words David thank you Mr President we're all here today because card your generosity I want to thank you for that uh we're also here because of your desire to make America great and to introduce a golden age in America including for digital assets and we're here because of your love of of innovators or as you might say high IQ people we know love high IQ people and we have we have about 30 of them here in the room today these are the top people in the in the digital asset industry and I one other thing that I think uh that you love is is legal fairness uh this is an industry that was subjected to prosecution and persecution for the last four years horrible lawfare and nobody knows uh what that feels like better than you do so we really appreciate the fact that you understand legal fairness going to fight right for the right thing those words that come to mind you stand a f even in the face of an ass he kissing the ring it's an inspiration to everyone in this room I think yes your highness in oil they call people your Excellency various ministers I just want to say it's it's an honor to work for you it's an honor to to work for a president who who works every day to get so much done on behalf of the American people your Administration is moving at Tech speed it's really amazing it's actually faster than any startup that I've been part of is that your Administration mes f for a of it but that's good I mean we we had we had our dump we cleared positions and now we can go up yeah good David so the today let's sell your cardano while you pres Trump has signed the executive order to establish the Strategic Bitcoin reserve and stockpile we're going to position the United States as a leader among nations in the digital assets strategy it's important for the United States to recognize this fact and get ahead of the other nations in the digital age I we applaud the president's direction to use the digital assets already in possession of the nation and we are going to establish this Bitcoin Reserve we will use this authority to augment the asset side of the United States balance sheet as I've said many times president Trump is creating assets for the American people while most past presidents have created debt and a large part of this asset program can be in digital assets um we are going to end the regulatory weaponization against digital assets the Biden administration's actions did nothing other than publish and punish innovators and that all of you have made it here today is really a testament to your fortitude uh much of treasury's responsibility in this order relates to the tax code and determinations around risk weightings and I'm here to assure you that we are going to work with the control of the currency the IRS and we're going to resend and amend all applicable previous guidance andry doesn't like this put a lot of thought into the stable coin regime and as president Trump has directed uh we are going to keep the US the dominant Reserve currency in the world and we will use stable coins to do that thank you well that's a big one I'm going to use stable coins in the treasury bullish AF technology is at the foundation of the Trump presidency he understands technology he Embrace his technology and he's going to use technology to drive America forward the blockchain and Bitcoin technology are a key part of that thinking and embrace ing that and here today shows how much a leader the Trump Administration and our president is he understands it he Embraces it as you said you're a Pioneer in this place and this is where we're going we're using the blockchain we're using Bitcoin we're going to use digital assets to pound forward and Donald Trump is leading the way can't be more proud you today thank you very much thank you how nothing is getting said Thank you Mr President this is truly a historic day and as a crypto founder I couldn't be more proud to be part of your Administration uh you're moving at the speed of tech for sure and I will just say it's a great day to have the war on not just crypto but the war on Innovation done and under your Administration we are truly going to enter under the gold into the Golden Age and I'll just say as the administrator of the SBA small business is a tremendous Network that crypto can be deployed against and so the SBA is open to crypto so I look forward to working with um all of the leaders in this room to advance your uh efforts here thank you thank you Kelly thank you very much Kelly laugher all right Sub sub 87 I think is reasonable here thank you for the amazing see if we can get to 80 by the end of the confence can only cardo you're the one that you know what what's stable babyin I put on two trades during the Stream So when we talked about it and bought LTC when we talked about it a with everything else you're doing why way Americans love it equities closed nicely actually thank you thank you Tom thank you very much thank you I think uh nor Norm da is right they're just going around the table they're going to say one nice thing about Trump how big his dick is how cute his hair is very shy actually Cameron uh I think you said something earlier that I thought was really profound you said that a year ago you thought it would be more likely that you'd end up in jail than at the White House you got not to put you on the spot because you didn't do anything wrong but that was the environment a year ago uh but do you guys want to say something I want um sure that was actually Tyler who said that but but sorry I still I still get mixed up but uh yeah we never thought that we'd get attacked the way we did in our backyard after trying to do the right thing for so many years and always trying to raise the bar with respect to regulations so it's truly wonderful to see how things have changed and how the pendulum has swung back um in the way that it has and we've always felt that the US should lead in bit coin and crypto and it's ours to sort of lead and win and it's just wonderful what um president Trump has been doing with this and we look forward to working together and thanks for inviting us David and setting the sub thank you thank you both please I was just goingon to say Thank you Mr President um Cameron takes credit for a lot of my things I say so it's not the first time but um the US won the internet and and the US should win crypto so thank you for your leadership on this thank you both very much hi what simulation are we living in with those guys that's what I always say we need High talking to the president about Bitcoin thank you very much would anybody like to say anything please I just want to express my deep uh gratitude for the seriousness with which you're approaching our industry and how you're actually helping guide it in the right direction um I've worked with many central banks in other countries and when I was working there I was wondering why I as an American citizen can't help the United States Financial system Reach This higher level that the world is on course towards generally and so I'm very grateful that finally there's been a new level of kind of Common Sense and an adoption of of these ideas me and the other people in this room do believe that the crypto blockchain web 3 infrastructure is the next iteration oh said web three it's bearish and I think that the US should have its leadership position continue in that new Financial system and I'm I'm very very happy to see people like David Sachs secretary Bess and secretary letnik taking this very seriously with their time come them too so I'm I'm just Overjoyed to see this it out it is a big part of how the US can continue its role in the global uh Financial system so thank you thank you very much I thought it was very important that we stay in the front of this one this is a big one and as you know China is pushing forward and very very strongly as usual but we're way in the lead China is pushing forward on bitcoin very strongly stay there so I thought this was very important and we have some brilliant people sitting around this table and it's an honor to have you involved but we want to stay at the Forefront of everything and this is very important guess they unb I know you worked some of you very long long before people really understood what was happening and so I congratulate you but this is a big day being in the White House is is a big deal and you have great support thank you all very much thank you very much that it might be thought this government was suppos to be efficient thank you media thank you please oh questions this is where the fireworks happen LTC BTC just up only LTC a coin okay I'm just going to ask our producer a quick question here don't you want to keep the stream on for the uh for the media questions that's usually interesting no well that was that was fun we did we did our best Jonah we we did a stream Obi we did we did we did a stream we gave you guys some interesting trades some of which are working already some of which are not because I thought that Bitcoin would hold up a little bit better but let's just uh you know now now we wait for the inevitable flush and then the buying of the flush thank you guys for joining us thank you end stream

Transcript Text:
and there are the two different paths that we need to take in order to go higher unless on Friday the crypto Summit it's announc that the US is allocating tens of billions of dollars to bitcoin I don't think we go higher um I agree like that's like that's kind of the bar like the bar is are we getting more details over the next seven days that the us is going to be allocating tens of billions of dollars if the crypto strategic Reserve turns out to be 500 million we're back in the 80s pretty quickly this episode is brought to you by Kraken OTC get access to 247 trading services for high net worth individuals and institutional clients to execute orders over $50,000 you'll hear more about them later in the [Music] show all right guys welcome back to another thousand xod this has been a freaking whirlwind like my God Jonah just literally like the Bitcoin chart is just like the weekly chart is just Insanity right noww whipsaw the the total whipsaw I mean basically yeah one two four straight days of down and then a pause and then a fifth day where it nukes 10% in in a day basically and then now we're up 15% I mean I guess from the low to where we are here 18 19% from the low to the to to where we are I mean this is just nuts and we're still at 93 like we haven't even like we're not back into the previous range so nobody can say oh man like the chart looks really amazing right now I mean this is just this is just Madness what is going on here fun I mean you know like we were I was saying on the Pod last week it's very rare to see Bitcoin go sideways and not break down like at the highs I think I've said that 150 times in 150 different ways like Bitcoin doesn't go sideways at the highs and then not have a selloff what I was not necessarily expecting was a selloff that was you know a 20% straight down for four days was kind of expecting it to be a little bit more choppy um so that was that that was that was interesting I got bullish you know mid call it like mid to low 80s and then got we got that one final flush down to down to 78 which I think actually was was very good for Bitcoin it got a lot of the weak hands out right I think there were a ton of people that were sort of waiting for that sub 80 level to step in step in and buy and you you got a tremendous amount of volume into that level and then It reversed so quickly that the basically sellers there were a tremendous amount of sellers that sold to passive bids but nobody that was like actively waiting for that level had the time to get in and all of these sellers very likely are guys that just panicked and and still want to own Bitcoin they're just like oh man I don't want to hold this thing if it goes down to you know like the 60s like I don't want to lose any more money I've lost so much money so I actually think this is a like we've set we set ourselves up really nicely even just from a technical perspective and that's not even talking about the news that just came out this crypto strategic Reserve that our president has announced I mean what's going on there our fearless leader um couple points on what you just said so I haven't touched my book throughout the entirety of this selloff I'm just sitting on the sidelines like tweeting less you know panicking a little bit but not really because I don't really expect this thing to break down none of this was in my bingo card Obby I was expecting the market to just keep keep steadily kind of grinding higher as uh as you get more and more passive buying because the Regulatory and you know picture looks better uh so this wasn't really something that I wanted to trade into I'm at one point I was fully allocated to crypto but now now I have dry powder so I'm just I'm not going to sell this obviously I'm more just sitting and waiting for like when should I buy and I don't like catching falling knives I don't think this crypto news is really going to you know Herald the beginning of a new bull market where we just it's up only for another six months like no I think this is probably going to get sold into for a bit then it'll probably bottom out and then I think we keep rallying now there is a crypto Summit coming on March 7th which is what day is that March 7th is going to be I'm I'm of the opinion that this crypto Summit is sort of similar to all of the other catalysts around Trump so when he went on to talk you know the at the Bitcoin conference we we had a big rally into that and then and then a sell off after I mean the only like a lot of people are very excited about the idea of this strategic reserve and I do have to say I mean it's big news I mean and it's really big news for salana um xrp and uh and cardano because th those those were directly mentioned by Trump I mean cardano being mentioned is insane well I mean it's not that insane like here's my hot take on that crypto Twitter has its hair on fire over this cardano thing I think if you just go to coin Gecko and look at the top nonstable coins you've got Bitcoin check ethereum check xrp love it or hate it vaporware or not vaporware freaking coins worth almost $300 billion dollar so check uh stablecoin tether and you got BNB can't include that because it's China coin Trump doesn't like China then you got salana check usdc cardano 50 billion check and then it's like Doge lios Stak ether Tron and a bunch of other garbage so like honestly what let me just steal man this let me just steal man this okay it's the top coins except for the China coin what am I missing I don't think you're necessarily missing anything but I do think that if we're going to be if the government is going to be buying crypto should probably concentrate on the things that are actually useful and have actual potential I don't know like this this is like a weird weird argument for me to be having right because like just just take a step back for a second why would the government want to buy useless vaporware assets that don't have any real users or real future or real value behind it like like did they do zero homework I obviously agree with you AI I think I was trying to steal man the other side like cardano is everything that cryp everything that would make both of us want to leave crypto if if that's what crypto becomes I mean the logic the the logic effectively is if if you know we go with your Steelman argument you just buy the top five cryptos the logic is effectively all of these things are basically the same they're all [ __ ] and they're all scams and so let's just buy the top five because there's no different there's zero differentiation between these things and there's no way pick what's good and what's bad so let's just go for the top five yeah I mean look if Trump wanted to message this properly he'd say we're going to create a strategic crypto Reserve it's going to be mostly Bitcoin we're going to put a bit of Ethan salana in there because they have traction and then we're going to include XR I'm just saying if he wants to do if he wants to include salana and sorry cardano and xrp he' say we're also gonna put um xrp and cardano in there because they're market caps are high right like you know and they've survived a couple Cycles if he wanted to message if he wanted to message it to crypto Twitter if he wanted to um message it to the American public he he could just leave names out and say we're going to create a strategic crypto Reserve uh because you know this asset class is around to stay rather than pretending we can make it go away or pretend that it's going to go away by itself um we may as well have some skin in the game and participate if it continues to you know proliferate obviously whoever's running Trump's crypto PR campaign feels like it's like David I listen to the all-in podcast from time to time David saaks is a smart guy it feels like he's not nearly stupid enough to be put like messaging this it feels like it's Baron Trump in charge right like somebody without some some C minus nepo baby is doing this [ __ ] this is not this is not smart the way that they're talking about it and it's obviously pissing off crypto you know people Brian Armstrong tweeted that it would be better just to have Bitcoin uh in the Strategic crypto reserve and what what's the point of any of this other stuff being in there I agree with him I think that you know if if you're trying to save taxpayer dollars by like cutting us Aid cutting NIH funding all this other stuff you know because we're supposedly you know going bankrupt which you know generally I kind of agree with the Doge efficiency thing it then is hard to you know in the same same week come out and say we're going to use taxpayer dollars to buy cardano um obviously that argument has been beaten to death on Twitter like everybody knows that it's this is stupid I gu just like back to what it means for crypto though you know talking about like we're back into the we're basically back at the bottom of the range that we've been in since the election right since since the election price action it's basically been like 90 bid at 105 and we're trading 92 and a half um in Bitcoin so do like I'm really watching closely to see if we just drift back up to the center the range I don't think that's going to happen I think we probably like leak back below because this is almost like bearish for crypto in a way you you you know you know what's really leaked back below by the way eth is just cooked eth 20 yeah I mean tra bit trading at 2430 is is disgusting this episode

episode possible yeah eth is I'm not going to be back in eth for a while OB I think I think I think at this point if ever actually I took a few stabs I mean one of my one of my thesis was let me try to get long alt short BTC and that actually worked like reasonably well um a lot of these alts bottomed out against Bitcoin like especially some of the you know I was I was heavy on the AI coins like Arc and virtuals um ai 16z ai xbt these things actually bought out really nicely against Bitcoin over over the last week I took a decent size position in Soul as well against against uh BTC and then part of the book was eth BTC uh which I had to cut basically D that e BTC is a random number generator what is going on like dude I like I mean I basically had to cut it I kept every other position but I cut it 24 hours after I put on the trade cuz you know even even on the bounce it just like it just could not do anything and it was it's it's amazing how few people there are left to go buy this thing I mean like I really thought sellers had run out and I might have been right but what I was completely wrong about is that they're just zero buyers for this asset anymore oh and there Sellers and and in E Major sellers the eth foundation everybody who is interest who got into crypto in 2021 and hasn't really checked their portfolio until now like e eth is just like offered all the time it is it trades so heavy you know one point that I'll say on cardano is that it's actually held by the most like random people and what maybe they're trying to approximate is just like your average per like they want to make your average person and that owns crypto rich and they're just like I you know a lot of Americans own cardano like I mean today I actually was talking to somebody he was like uh you're into this crypto thing right you know I have some I have some of this Bitcoin and cardano that I've held for like four years now like what do you think I should do with it and I'm like you should definitely sell that cardano and move it somewhere else because then today's a great day to go sell your cardono but the dude did own cardono and you know just random guy basically h i mean to me this is just so well well okay first let let's talk about two things first let's talk about uh stabilizing Bitcoin stabilizing at the top of the range and then selling off your your kind of like technical call and then let's talk about this what this means for crypto so you you've said many times on the podcast that Bitcoin rarely stabilizes on the highs and then uh well like like i' go I'd go so far as to say it never does I mean you know the the framework that I always work off of is the value and momentum framework I've you know I I've sort of I mentioned this a lot so I don't want to Bor people with with the details but basically we needed to find uh we needed people to find Value in Bitcoin again and I think we found it people view sub 80 as extreme value on bitcoin which is why we didn't spend any time really below below sub 80 95 like you know that that small tiny range that we were trading in that 95 to 98 is not value for people right and there was Zero momentum so there was no reason to buy it which allowed a lot of which basically allowed sellers to gain the advantage because there weren't there's not a lot of new money that's going to come in and bid it in that particular area because it's not sexy from a value perspective and when you're going sideways there's definitionally no momentum so people once Bitcoin goes into wait and see mode what matters more is whether people are overinvestment C mode for for a long time we traded sideways but people were radically underinvested in the asset and so it went higher after now people were you know we were in wait and see mode Let's see what happens but people were rically over invested in the asset we're at the highs like that's that's where I want to like humbly push back on you people like us were over invested but people like but new money but this is this goes back to the original but new money wasn't coming in and that's why we sold off right uh well in hindsight it seems so yes but at the time you wouldn't I was I was making this argument at the time okay like right I mean I was I I was making that argument that there's you know there and and just to go back like think of the think of the framework there was no momentum and there was no value therefore no no momentum like you know you deserve your your credit where credit is due uh you know I maybe maybe we're just talking about different time frames here because I've been pretty bullish since you know late 2022 um but I definitely thought that while people like us were overallocated you know a new trillion dollar or 10 or 50 trillion wallet was underinvested now it I mean and probably will buy like put this way if they were if they were interested in buying before the announcement of official an official Federal United States strategic crypto Reserve they're going to be even more interested after right like if if Uncle Sam is doing it they're not going to get sued for doing it but what what I'm trying to what I'm trying to say is that there there is and currently I think this statement holds true like there is no there is nobody that's interested in buying Bitcoin above $95,000 like people are just not interested in buying it at that price outside of news I bet you if bcoin traded up to 125 on momentum there would be buyers coming out of the woodwork because of the momentum but I mean sure but that's like I mean that it's not really an argument right it's like if it goes to 125 then by definition there've already been a ton of buyers that I've been buying it in the market and what we're trying to talk about is is this going to get like where is this going to go right we're basically what you're saying is we need a catalyst to push us through to that next momentum level that brings out the momentum buyers and so that well is that appropriate two there are two things that I'm trying to articulate here um and there are the two different paths that we need to take in order to go higher Setter parabus unless on Friday the crypto Summit it's announced that the US is allocating tens of billions of dollars to bitcoin I don't think we go higher I agree like that's like that's kind of the bar like the bar is are are we announcing on Friday or like are we getting more details over the next seven days that the us is going to be allocating tens of billions of dollars if they if the crypto strategic Reserve turns out to be 500 million we're back in the 80s pretty quickly they'd be so dumb to announce that because then they' just worsen their fill price by a lot we're gonna buy a ton of ton of stuff tomorrow you go out there and click all you want tonight it would be so crazy I wonder if they're that stupid I mean the messaging has been so bad that that the answer could be yes indeed they are that dumb or Worse they're so corrupt that these these guys are not they're not trying to make money are you sure like trying to they're trying to like first of all let take a step back Trump is not trying to make the US government money with this crypto move Trump is trying to make Trump money and his supporters money this my personal take he's you whether the US government makes money or loses money on crypto is probably irrelevant to him it's kind of like you know he has this piggy like Piggy Bank thing this tool called the US government that he can use to go move crypto prices and he's going to benefit a lot from it and his constituents are going to benefit a lot from it and they're going to love him right if if he manages to send crypto higher now whether the US government ends up making or losing money is probably irrelevant yeah true and that's at least my my my take on it just to go sorry I I want to finish my thought here on the paths that we need to take um I've said this I've said this before it's momentum value momentum is generated through news so it's right now it's going to be generated through okay Trump comes out we're buying a ton blah blah blah or we have to find Value and how do you generate value is you you don't trade a level for a significant period of time right right now 80 you know $85,000 doesn't feel like tremendous value because we just traded there now if we trade above 90,000 for 2 months or a month and then we trade 85 suddenly it's on sale right suddenly that that's that's a lot more attractive you need you need people to normalize just to prices before you can start to assign value and so right now what's clear value is below 80 like C you know buy below 80 all you want and I think you're going to be happy in a year that also means you're probably not going to get it um but I also think that you know this 95 is not not value so I think that we end up ping ponging with you know outside of news outside of direct news to send us higher we probably now end up ping ponging between 85 and 95 for at least a month that that's my take okay I like there are a couple of so that take I age with some other parts of your take in the past I disagree with let me just try to articulate it very cleanly and and concisely I agree that participants anchor themselves to the prices that you know any asset particularly crypto establishes when it trades sideways for a while so if we trade we trade like roughly 100K for three months that's where participants anchor themselves then if you're trading 80k that looks cheap if you're trading 120k you see some profit taking I agree with you um so yes participants anchor to to you know ranges that are well established the part that I disagreed with you know is you know you you did say that it's rare for crypto to just range or trade sideways on the highs and then not have a selloff to me that while while I agree with that statement and I think that it's true I think it's a bit misleading because basically what you're saying is crypto goes up crypto you know stops going up it's you know it's either going to go up or down and if it doesn't go up then it's going to go down so to me it's kind of like True by definition this episode is brought to you by Kraken OTC one of crypto's longest running exchanges with over a decade of experience with Kraken OTC

crypto taxes with no guesswork thanks to crypto tax calculator for making today's episode possible if if you trade up and then plateau of course it's going to go down unless it keeps going up is is sort of what it means to me but maybe I'm just not well not no cuz I mean like it it it helps you try to understand what's going to happen next right so it's not just saying if it doesn't go up then but by definition it's going to go down while we at before the selloff when we're trading $95,000 the big question that everyone had is where's it going next is it going to you know is it more likely that we go to 105 from n from 95 or is it likely that we go to 85 um like how do I make my bets right and that was a that was a very debated question um and my answer using that framework was well we've basically gone sideways in a range from November 21st to February 23rd that is you know three months of sideways action probably goes down because of that you know like I'm betting that there's an 80% chance that we're going down and a 20% chance that we're going up that we're getting you know a pretty substantial sell off sell off from the highs it's more of a it's more of a statement that you know if you do have a range for a substantial period of time you probably should not be buying that range in fact you can probably make money shorting in that range I I mean you're proven right this last time but like I'm just looking at the the course of this Bitcoin bull market Bitcoin did it's hard to deny that Bitcoin took a few breathers and then kept rallying not not like on the election with a clear Catalyst but like you know in 2023 anyway I don't want to be leager the point I was just saying it's something where I don't necessarily like where I'm not fully on board necessarily uh but I do agree that there's a lot of anchoring that goes on uh in you know like I think your point about how people anchor to recent rages is super Salient and I guess that sort of like leads us nicely into the next topic which is you know where does crypto go from here and what does this what does this stupid cardono Reserve mean for our space like here's what I think I think I think we're not going to get any real announcements at this crypto Summit on Friday I don't think they're going to announce a specific Target amount of buying in the future because then they'll just get front run right um there or if they do you're going to see like tremendous CFT like I don't know there was this tweet that came out uh so this I don't know how valid this is but somebody wrote It's called The cooby Letter this tweet got you know a million views 24 hours ago someone took out 200 million worth of ethereum and Bitcoin Longs on 50x Leverage this meant even a 2% drop in Bitcoin would have liquidated them and then you know shortly thereafter president Trump announced this the US crypto Reserve uh you know and these these people made out like Bandits now the reason why I I believe that that actually happened and I don't think it's just fake news is because this you know this happens all the time in Commodities markets like OPEC will give people a heads up when they're going to cut Supply but not everybody you'll see positions getting taken out at like random after hours times when you know the Chic calls whoever and gives them the gives him the tip it's not illegal in Commodities because there's no Commodities aren't Securities technically neither is Bitcoin or eth so uh you know whoever did that probably just got the tip it's not it's not quite like Trump announcing the Strategic Reserve isn't quite as as guaranteed to move the market as say IBM announcing that they're acquiring a a smaller publicly traded company is guaranteed to move that smaller publicly traded Company's stock so that's why it's not illegal in Commodities but but it's still suspect Behavior and the fact that you're seeing this type of activity means that like they may come out on Friday and make some sort of like front runnable announcement but it's probably just going to be for a short-term trade I don't think they'd actually come out and delineate the size and scope of the Strategic crypto Reserve with actual like numbers of Bitcoin and cardano and xrp units that are going to get bought because then the next thing that'll happen is every every large pool of capital will just front run them and they'll get a worse fill and they'll cost the American taxpayers hundreds of millions and it'll be you know big Fiasco uh I just think you know maybe there will be something some short-term trade in there for for some grifter to to take advantage of longer term I think I think this thing probably leaks back below where it's currently trading right now like sentiment in crypto is still terrible this stupid crypto reserve it doesn't it doesn't help sentiment crypto people seem pretty pissed off about it uh it it's certainly isn't a green light for in institutions be like it's kind of a green light but they're not going to start buying now or maybe they will I don't know what do you think I I I feel like we just sort of like drift back down this is probably a pop where you sell some super crappy altcoins again what do you think yeah I'm I'm I'm I'm with you on the selling what I what I will say is I I remember when we talked about the Trump effect on bitcoin would is going to be like the Elon effect on Doge yeah that in the beginning everyone bought Doge because oh my God Elon might say something about Doge on Twitter and it might go up um and then now after Trump kind of adopted Bitcoin as his pet little project it was oh well you know there there are all these amazing things that Trump can say about about Bitcoin maybe maybe maybe he'll send it up that that's kind of played out really nicely and so now that brings me to the next stage of the Decay like you know every time he mentions crypto now there's going to be some level of Decay to it and so he kind of needs to [ __ ] or get off the pot at this point uh what I will say is that and I'm so I'm kind of I'm pissed at myself that I didn't think about this but you you can kind of predict the future with these things like we knew on February 28th that there was a first ever crypto White House Summit coming up the next week and we also knew that crypto is in the middle of a [ __ ] meltdown so you know like 80k or 85k I like I wish I had the thought like you know there's a pretty high chance that Trump does something to make this Summit not look like a total failure um you know and and gotten even even more even more bullish there uh you know worthwhile basically looking at the White House calendar I guess uh every time every time every time you take out a trade on anything now probably just look at the White House calendar and try to think to yourself well is there any incentive for Trump to help out this trade or not I mean there's a big difference between you bring up a good point like Elon did move Doge for a little while but there's a big difference between Trump and Elon when it comes to moving markets like I have PTSD from Trading through Trump's you know Trump 1. know his first presidency uh you do not fade Trump's tweets Trump's statements about things like yeah maybe if he doesn't you said he has to [ __ ] or get off the pot maybe if it looks like he's getting off the pot people start to fade it but Trump will [ __ ] like I mark my words he he will take the dump so why why why you uh why you so bearish for the first time ever then no I'm not bearish for the first time ever I I'm saying like I'm not going to sell a dime worth of crypto let me make that clear what I'm saying is Trump let's let's start with what he did to markets last time and then we'll talk about what he's going to do this time so Trump uh during covid when oil was low he caused the price of oil to spike literally like 40% or 30% in one day it was like $10 a barrel when it was trading $20 a barrel by saying that he was going to force OPEC to cut Supply right um that was the most face ripping move that that commodity like will get period that was a crazy move for a non shitcoin for the you know the world's Global energy Supply when prices were high he was [ __ ] on OPEC every day telling them that they had to stop the cuts and that he was going to put pressure on them and then he did he you know he he tweets like he wanted oil in a Range so he would tweet bearish at the top of the range and Giga bullish at the bottom of the range stock market he would tweet it up every single every single chance he got record high it's going higher we're going to do more Trump tax cuts Trump bump like Trump tweets markets in the direction that they end up going he's he's always done that right and so you know you saw this face ripping crypto rally after he tweeted the Strategic crypto Reserve all I'm saying Obby is that move has happened I don't see him tweeting some brand new like Giga bullish Catalyst on Friday that takes us another $10 higher I think the Tweet was the Tweet was the tweet and it came out today right so you know I do think that crypto is going higher I do think that I do think that we trade you know 150k easy before the end of the year maybe 200k I'm still very bullish if I were a short-term Trader um I would probably be like selling Bitcoin here to buy it back at like 87K but that's just not how I behave um I I don't like to do that because I think it's over over time too tempting to be become to chop myself up I'm better at doing longer term trades I do think that if you're looking to reduce exposure now it probably like wh you know my my least favorite coin of the moment wh wh ripped on this there's not going to be a a strategic whiff Reserve right short that one if you're looking to cut notional that's my point um but yeah does does that make sense to you like my general thesis on this yeah I I mean I get you know it remains to be seen I guess what happens on Friday uh you know I wish I had read the read the tea leaves better on that on that particular point but uh you know remains to be seen what happens at the summit I mean maybe he has another trick trick up of his up his sleeve but I'm I'm I'm fairly certain it's going to require Congressional approval to start buying a ton of Bitcoin so you know we we all we all have to wait for that I mean like one of the worst things that could happen and which is why every single person in crypto if you're actively trading or you own Bitcoin and you have you know you you you you want to be proactive about this is is you have to pay very very very close attention to what happens on Friday because if there's language that says we're really ex you know David saaks gets up there and he goes you know we're really excited to start working on this Reserve Bill and push it through Congress I mean you kind of have to sell yeah a reasonable amount of what you have this is this is more of a bipartisan issue than it was though to be completely Fair like that St whatever Armstrong's like crypto Lobby is called you know it's there are Democrats that are into this as well there are and I do think that Democrats have started to they're having to come to Jesus moment with respect to crypto at least two of the people that I know in the Democratic apparatus have approached me about uh you know potentially writing an oped about how Democrats messed up crypto because both of them realize that it you know crypto came out of the Occupy Wall Street movement in a big way and that was solid that was a movement that was solidly Democrat right the the idea of hating the big Banks if you go back 15 years was a solidly Democrat ideal like it was purely in the realm of Democrats to have that like mentality around things which is can't trust you know can't trusts like yeah like like can't trust the financial institutions that was a that was all Democrat uh back then and so they have a real opportunity and that's why if you look back at like the origin of ethereum like a lot of the major players in the ethereum network and even today it's like they they they still are Democrat I think Bitcoin always had a little bit more of a Libertarian lean but the Dems could have done well on crypto if they had just played ball instead of tried to kill it and I think they started to realize that right now so I do think that they're they will soften their stance because it's just not a winning issue for them it's just really not earlier in today's episode I mentioned Ledger latest products the stacks and flex and I wanted to take a few seconds to tell you more about them these wallets feature the world's first secure touchscreens which

Network to stay ahead of what's next so I love that you brought this up I'm going to do like a very short tangent and then come back to your point which I agree with when I in 2008 when the Dems were all against the banksters and Barney Frank and you know that the vulker rule and all this stuff was like kind of cooking in Washington to reign in the banks Reckless risk taking I had just lost my job on Wall Street at one of the big Banks called Leman Brothers the only one that these guys allowed to fail and I remember just being unemployed like wandering around downtown one day I passed suca Park and saw these people protesting bankers and I was thinking like I hate you like I just lost my job and you're mad at me you know my my company went bankrupt um screw you and screw screw everybody else who wants to demonize me uh and you know it's funny I actually haven't felt that annoyed at irrational policymaking until Biden and Gary Gensler went Ham on crypto for no reason and I do think I do think that like you know when it's something as partisan as like abortion or gun control right you do get these big Partyline votes but with crypto I think a lot of people are looking at you know operation choke point 2.0 uh Eliz Elizabeth Warren's anti- crypto Army and it's like who's gonna who's G to die on that Hill like who's gonna who wants to be part of the anti- crypto Army it's like maybe there's like a couple of retirees who are pissed off that they miss the Bitcoin trade sitting on the golf course like [ __ ] on bitcoin you know just no coiners but like the not not enough people on the anti- crypto Side Care to them it's just like a total nothing Burger whatever and then on the proc crypto side it's just you know 50 million American bag holders or more so like it just seems so irrational to to like think of it seems so irrational to like be a Washington elected representative policy maker against crypto you've nothing to gain and everything to lose and Trump literally just like painted that on the wall during the last election and proved it to everybody so so to me like I'm a little bit less worried about um things that need to go through Congress uh then perhaps most uh however I do think that if what they submit to Congress is like we need to we need to spend $100 million on cardano I think they're gonna I think they're gonna like I think it's just going to be stillborn so I think they have you know maybe what we should be looking for on Friday is like how much have you rethought your plan since the Sunday truth social post you know like are you really going to lean into this and double down or not um if they're like it's mostly Bitcoin don't worry we we're going to have a couple out of these tokens because they're top 10 and they're made in America and and you know we want to incentivize people to make great blockchains in America and we'll put them in there maybe you know if it comes out like that then I think it's okay I don't think we get a big up so well yeah I mean one one thing's for sure we're gonna have to be paying attention one point that is actually kind of you know it's it's kind of nice is that there there's been basic Ally zero uptick in oi on this move like if you look at Futures one of the highest hit rate reversal signs is you just get a ton of people slamming in on Leverage kind of looks like a you know this move looks like it was spot- driven actually it looks like people were deploying cash into this move and it it's not just a bunch of monkeys buying it on on Leverage which is a very good sign for Bitcoin so you know I'm I'm I'm torn I'm torn between thinking that hey this is this is definitely a fade because I don't think that we're getting more good news after this versus all right now actually we're just back in the range and you know we maybe we'll just go trade 100K there's another interpretation which is like yes it could be cash that could be that could explain the lack of OI increase another shorts closed or it could be that or it could just be like tons and tons of Market maker on Market maker violence with no real position taking you know just like hft washing back and forth you know because of uh volatility which is what they do they trade big volumes when things get volatile because they're all these little little games you can play uh arbitraging exchanges versus each other um you know arbitraging equities versus crypto uh mid-frequency signals telling you what's going to happen in 5 to 60 seconds uh trading that then getting out like big volume you know lots of volume will go through when markets get volatile without a lot of risk getting exchanged sometimes so um maybe I I I honestly don't know AI I think it could just be it could be a lot of really healthy spot buying it could be like liquidations it also could be actually looking funding you know looking at funding it does look like a decent amount of shorts came in on Saturday you know one one of the one of the biggest hacks in life is just paying attention during the weekends like you I think I think it's it's very it's very easy to clock out um especially if you're looking at this stuff during the week and then just not pay attention over the weekends but there's there's so many so many things that if you if you look at them over the weekend you actually gain and you do that consistently you just gain a huge Edge I mean so many so many things in this market over the last year have happened on the weekend I think a lot of people are gambling at their day jobs like they're supposed to be doing like they're on a zoom call or they're like supposed to be you know doing something professional and they're just like logged into logged in somewhere you know binance or coinbase or Kraken and just like messing around all week and then the weekend is like their break you know it's not like this is a I don't think crypto is like a nights and weekends game for most retail dents I think it's like yeah I I I wonder how many federal workers were selling in crypto during their days oh my God responded to responded to musk's email what did you get done this week well I punted on xrp bought some to got it if yeah if I had to write a email what did I get done this week oh my God changed a lot of diapers that's what I got done I I raised children can I tell can I tell you something horrible Jonah and always Obi whiff actually looks pretty W whiff actually looks really good why I think a lot of people started using it as a short leg H and I think you could actually see a short squeeze from whiff it's kind of interesting do you have uh like like do you have your oi dashboard up I don't yeah I got my oi and funding dashboard and also like it it started to outperform BTC are you still using v data which is yeah I I do I do love V but I mean I just love charting alt against Bitcoin because it really gives you an idea of the relative strength of the asset yeah and like they there there are so many alts that look really good against Bitcoin even even now um after after today's move that's kind that's kind of what I'm you know that that that's what I'm looking for is I I do I do like those types of Trades because they're so much easier to manage I mean like getting getting long those AI assets and shorting Bitcoin against them I did that when Bitcoin was at something like 85 86k and then it went down and they were all actually you know outperforming to slight underperforming BTC but BTC in that time span went down you know went down 10% and I can guarantee you I wouldn't have stayed in those trades if I had done them outright and then even though after Bitcoin bounced I mean they were all up anywhere from 8 to 20% versus Bitcoin um you know I would have made more money if I had obviously punted them outright but I would have never in a million years held that position so it really helps you manage the volatility yeah I agree I mean I'm out of my whip short now I I actually covered most of it during a podcast where you convinced me to do so it was like that one it was early Feb when the market nuked in the middle like while we were recording um I was thinking that was a fun one I was thinking of putting it back on and not yet do it at like a dollar yeah I guess we're a little if you get it like if you can get it like 90 cents to a dollar that would be a great short I think I think like short shorting it here after it's bounce and like looks pretty strong and actually you know it's it's up in the last five days it's up like every day basically yeah which tells you if if it's doing that when when bit coins going down you probably want to avoid shorting it yeah I mean the thing is it's it's flat to like with BTC is flat over the last call it 18 hours over the last seven days it's up it's up like yeah pretty solidly I don't know you're right probably probably don't want to don't want to short into a rally like this I think honestly AI I think that this Market is just going to be chaos for a while I think I do not think that this is a good trading market for click Traders with like a two to seven day Horizon I I'm I'm feeling as unconvicted in the short term as I could possibly be as convicted in the long term as I could possibly be and then the medium-term like you know let's call it a six to eight out of 10 conviction that we we're probably Higher by you know six months from here so I don't know like I just like aside from maybe some tactical opportunities like news comes out and coins just haven't moved yet and you can like click trade news and you know slower less relevant maybe onchain assets aside from stuff like that I don't think this is a market where you want to start like like really churning a lot of volume I think it's bad uh I think it's bad for that I think we'll we'll be in a much healthier environment for that once we we get a bit more clarity on what these guys have planned for crypto but the implications haven't really priced into some of the long R taale assets well maybe we need to do another emergency well we'll do do another pod on Friday to talk to talk about this that that'll be you know we maybe can we figure out a live stream yeah you know what how about this going on let's just make a rule that if it's an emergency pod we can just do a live stream like if something crazy happens we could do a live stream during uh during the crypto conference maybe we'll do that maybe we need to we need to apply for a White House Press pass like I know they're letting in all sorts of like scammy news organizations and kicking out like ABC and CBS we could say like we're why don't like we'll get the Thousand X podcast we're we're crypto news I think I think probably all we have to do is spend the next four episodes just saying really nice things about Donald Trump he awesome could probably get a press I love I love Donald Trump Donald Trump is your parents house is your parents house near the White House like could I crash there if we do a DC trip uh it actually is it's like a 15minute walk from the White House so that's great sure I I would have I would have suggested that I I was going to like stay at a nice hotel but with Bitcoin down here no no no no just just crash my crash in the parents basement we'll go we'll go walk over the White House sleep in the laundry room care all right Obby good this this this is this was good I'll see you on Friday see see you on Friday this is a fun one [Music]

Transcript Text:
we're not in a bull market or a bare Market we're in a bull market and in a bare Market we're still in a bull market for Bitcoin and we're like somehow while Bitcoin is close to the highs we're in a Savage bare market for everything else and cryp the crypto space just doesn't know how to process that because we still use this word crypto that encompasses everything this episode is brought to you by Kraken OTC get access to 247 trading services for high- net worth individuals and institutional clients to execute orders over $100,000 you'll hear more about them later in the [Music] show welcome back to another THX podcast if you haven't yet please go add our stream to your Spotify or wherever you listen to your podcast it's down below in the show notes but we got off of the Empire feed and so you need to read our feed in order to get notifications about the podcast and have it pop up on your on your app this is a first step towards being slightly more independent it's great but you know I think this year and I was saying this year it's like the last two months of price action have been so damn choppy Jonah just like insanely choppy I don't know how how are you how how you dealing with this because you know the last time that we talked about about a week ago we were basically the same price but I mean bitcoin's gone up and down in a range of six% since then which is kind of nothing for BTC but it seems like a lot of people have gotten destroyed somehow yeah I mean I haven't made any money this year doing anything that has made me money in the past the only thing that's made me money this year is shorting stuff um being long Bitcoin hasn't worked you know I guess year to date up 1% or something being long altcoins you know granted in small size has been total disaster shorting stuff uh you know that that works that's that's something you can do right now and I feel like the longer the market continues to trade in this insane range like pretty much every single daily candle for the last month basically since the beginning of February has crossed through $95,000 Bitcoin right $96,000 Bitcoin it's this is just a choppy market and the more things continue to chop sideways and the more you know more tokens that get launched over the course of this sideways Bitcoin Market the more the alt space is just going to bleed um we really need a catalyst to take us higher and it feels like we're in no man's land between the you know election day and maybe some stable stable coin bills getting passed uh or strategic Bitcoin Reserve Rumblings you know I I do my best to try and follow what's going on in Washington because I do think that's going to be where the next big like announced catalysts come from and uh you know shout out to the all-in podcast uh they had the stripe guys on they're integrating stable coins David Sachs talked a lot about you know crypto Frameworks recently I think it's um I think there's a lot to look ahead to and a lot to look forward to but um it's like it's not gonna it's not like next week right so we're kind of in no man's land and I think the the you know we've gone from player versus environment to player versus player like the goal is just don't get yourself chopped up short stuff that people who are stuck in a 2021 mentality are you know puking out of yeah it's I think I mean a a big reason that it's been tough is people kind of got used to trading I mean if you're a Trader you got you got used to looking at Bitcoin on a daily chart just like okay well what's what's the trend right and we had we had a few we had the trend from November for you know the the election all the way up to the 17th of December and then we trended down in pretty substantial range for two weeks right and then you kind of go up for two weeks and then down for two weeks and over the last month we just haven't moved at all and so it was very difficult because in that time period in the last month where we haven't moved we've had a lot of different head fakes I mean if you look we tapped 98 and broke above quite a few times and we tapped 95 broke below quite a few times Mak new lows and new highs both times where you've been trained when that happens and over the last six months you've been trained to go buy that or sell it right and what became tough I think here is that we also went from a much larger range to a much smaller range so if you look back you know the on the 16th of December we hit the 107 and then we traded down all the way to to 92 and that was kind of the major range for six weeks and now we kind of coess into a much smaller range from this 94 to to 98 and I think people got messed up because they they were trying to play the play the larger range when in reality we were actually you know cessing into a smaller range all of this to say I've said range so many damn times I think the take away here is just don't trade right here unless you know unless what you're doing is you're you're shorting some of the really [ __ ] ults after after a rally or you're looking at you're looking at some pair trades because there have been some pair trades that have worked right I mean you know for example TOA did well off the back of dynamic TOA maker has done really well recently uh which is actually really cool because not that I actually I mean maker is like a fine product and all um you know it's it's not not something that I'm ridiculously bullish on long term but what I find cool about it is that if you were paying attention to the stats you could actually kind of see it coming if you go to usds which is the coin which is a stable coin of maker now uh change it from die the market cap started Rising pretty substantially uh at the beginning of this year and so from January 1 to February 1 the market cap of this thing went up you know 20 30% and then from February 2nd to February 11th it went up another 30% and what you were seeing is you were seeing increased minting of of usds and maker price action didn't pick up until the 17th H like you you you know you you had a substantial like on the 17th from the beginning of the year uh maker uh the usds market cap went from five billion to 9 billion and then that after an almost 100% increase in the core product of what this protocol provides that's when maker started going up and some of it has to do with the governance proposal that that they that they've recently passed but I don't think that's a full story I think you know a substantial portion of that move is the market realizing a bit too late oh they're actually you know they their coin their coins getting minted it's it's getting used so that's why I say you know it's it's it's fun because you know a sign of if you pay attention to the market and you do your research you can find some traits yeah I mean those same trades I hate to bang the same drum over and over but those same trades exist on the short side too like the news headline comes out that Whi is a scam the coin doesn't move you could you could short it and then it goes down you know this is all over the place so yeah and it took it took some time for the things I mean I I shorted it at like 126 or something like that and I held it I think three days or four days and covered it at one and then it went down to 60 and I think that's you know that that that that that's a it was it was a little bit of a delayed Delayed Reaction there in terms of in terms of the massive move but I mean I definitely should have held that trade tra trade a bit longer but it does you know it is showing that there are some potential opportunities out there if you're paying attention I mean Salon is another great example of this it's just been underperforming ridiculously hard since the beginning of the year and it's against the backdrop of like bad narratives for things happening on salana not like salana specific narratives like the when when FTX blew up that was a salana specific narrative because their little and jump like their little Mafia was falling apart and the chain was also not working this time it's more like Solana's taking a hit because Javier mala's shitcoin got launched on sh salana and turned out to be a rug I don't know I still don't think that's Sal I think still a large like a big portion of this underperform okay so there are two things one is that salana went from $183 to almost 300 in a week because of the Trump trump meme coin now whenever you have that happen like if you if if a coin as big as salana goes up 60% because Trump launched a meme coin what you're supposed to say is how long does that Mania last and like how many of the people that bought those candles if you look at the weekly candle just the one candle how many of the people that bought that one candle are reallocating to salana for for the long term the answer is probably not that many I don't know I think I think that could have been a moment when people just stopped out of the rest of their eth and decided that salano was going to be their alternative L1 for the cycle but yeah I take your point there's an argument to be said basically my take on all of this on the last you know five minutes of conversation that you and I have been having my my take is that crypto native are just sick of this they're they're rage quitting crypto the people who should be moving markets shortly after news like glued to the screen click trading headlines and stuff like that whole group of people is just burned out their whole Strate like altcoin season never came uh it never rained money they're all just getting sick of this asset class throwing in the towel and in many cases that means like rage quitting their bags puking out of stuff um not car about the market you know tick for tick anymore that presents some opportunities for people that still do and can still like weather this volatility and pay attention um despite the chop and yeah I think also that means that like when when things that happen that would make you disenchanted with crypto occur like you're going to see a lot of people just like hitting the exit button selling everything cashing out and walking away uh so I think that's that's sort of what's going on in some of these asset classes people like all right you know what [ __ ] this Solana's salana was supposed to be like the global decentralized Ledger that that facilitates you know peer-to-peer payments across the world frictionlessly and for free but it turns out it's just a casino like I'm disenchanted I'm just you know oh look at this latest Javier Malay scam I'm just gonna sell everything and walk away I think that's what's going on I think that's it's a really good point and I think you can see in the charts I mean one interesting one interesting study would be how many coins are up since the Trump election and like like five that we care about I mean this is basically what's going on right now we're not in a bull market or a bare Market we're in a bull market and in a bare Market we're still in a bull market for Bitcoin and we're like somehow while Bitcoin is close to the highs we're in a Savage bare market for everything else and cryp the crypto to space just doesn't know how to process that because we still use this word crypto that encompasses everything we still think of Bitcoin is The Benchmark but like this is like I think long term that that makes me more constructive Bitcoin and everything else if you can survive the bare market and everything else because you know we're certainly like markets Peak when there are no buyers left and when you're in total Mania mode we're in the opposite of man Media mode we're in like the fear and greed index is like dipping decently into fear with Bitcoin near the highs so like that makes me think we have a lot a lot more room to run to the upside once we clear through this crap I think I think once the stable coin Bill gets passed you're going to see like major web 2 companies start deploying on crypto rails and then it's off to the races again but until then like I think these impatient crypto people these impatient dopamine addicted gamblers who listen to this podcast and of whom you know you and I probably represent uh you know we're dopamine addicted gamblers too here you know we we definitely aren't feeling

security seriously hit the link in the show notes of today's episode to check out their latest devices trust me you won't regret it with with Bitcoin just from a high level like technical perspective it doesn't look great right now so we had that 100 day moving average break a a few days ago and then on Friday it actually acted as some pretty strong resistance and normally what that means is that you use it as a momentum indicator and I think I've mentioned this on the podcast before but the two most important things to me when buying buying trading Bitcoin whatever is you're looking for momentum or you're looking for value and that's when people tend to buy into this Market when people buy in when it's going up because it's a trending asset and people buy in when they think that the risk reward is really good and the question is well how do you determine what the what the risk reward is well you kind of can get a sense of it from the average targets of a lot of people so and then look for a two for one and that's when people say Okay quote unquote this is value so back you know when we were talking before the Trump election I was saying that 50k was a value level because people were aiming for 100 like that that was the Target that everyone had on their mind it's like okay if everything goes well if Trump gets elected then 100K seems like a seems like a good Target and you know we probably don't break through the first time but you know I think I I think I can get 100K and then I can stop Out Below you know 45 or something like that and so that's like a really like really amazing risk orward so now the question is here like how do you think about that you know where where are people's Targets on on BTC like and not like the moon targets like the like the reasonable one-ear Targets on BTC and where do they where do they see value and then where where can they also stop out really really easily um and I think you know I hear a lot of okay well maybe we can get to 150 like that's that seems like the the reasonable like you know quote unquote not the not the 250k 500k million doll talk but okay you know I think we can get to 150 by the end of the year if it everything if everything goes go goes goes all right and so the the 2x from there would be 75 now I think that's a bit too low yeah I I think I think that's I think that's you know qu quite low but uh you know I don't think 95 provides a tremendous amount of value for people so what you need in order for BTC to go up is you need to believe that sailor is going to be jamming you know another $20 billion into this Market 1020 billion into the market or we get some legislation passed from states to allocate to BTC in a in a substantial way um or you get you know the federal government to allocate to BTC in substantial way until then uh we go sideways now another way that you can gen you can generate sort of a value Target is you spend enough time above a certain number like you spend another three weeks maybe six weeks above 990 then you have so many people that are kind of waiting waiting waiting okay may maybe we'll trade 90 maybe I'll buy 90 maybe I'll 85 and then they don't get it and then you sort of Reb you sort of rebase higher but I don't think we're quite there yet I mean if you look at the range from 24 we we ranged for let's let's call it 200 200 days which I think is you know I would say about half a year above a certain number and you're going to think okay well maybe that number is value so we're you know 92 days in maybe another 90 days if if you know so so my my take here is that every every day that goes by becomes a better buy for BTC but I'm in no rush to get gigal along yeah I mean if your time Horizon is short you're definitely not in a rush if your time Horizon is long oddly enough you kind of are in a rush CU you know what you mentioned about like just for example States allocating to bitcoin can you guess how much state and local government pension systems like hold in terms of assets under management just in the us alone like order of magnitude I know more than a trillion yeah six and a quarter trillion and then US public Pension funds manage 30 trillion in assets so if they're just like all right bitcoin's bitcoin's kosher now let's Chuck 10 bips in there you know that dwarf sailor it's tens of billions so um actually 1% would be 100 hund you know hundred and hundreds of billions category so 10 basis points to be tens of billions like it's nuts um how much money is just sloshing around this system that doesn't even account for private investment management there's so much money in America and I think we all get very fixated on the um strategic Bitcoin Reserve at the federal level but I think I think every day that goes by you're just going to see more and more inflows into ibit and I think that's why Larry thinkink changed his tune so quickly um so yeah like that is just incremental buying and it's what gives me confidence in this asset class and every time we nuke I'm not like looking to flatten myself out with perss and and waited out on the sidelines because I I do believe in this long-term outcome in fact I I think that we could just suddenly start you see this in other asset classes where the market just starts pumping like crazy for not necessarily the clearest reasons you know it just just flows not like headlines it could just be like a trickle of allocations turns into a you know a fire hose worth of allocations and and then you know then it's anybody's then it's just price discovery mode to the upside between now and then though um we have this weird sentiment gap between Bitcoin where there's tons of product Market fit and the out Outlook is so bright and everything else where where it's just I think people are finally throwing in the towel at the darkest moment for alts right before the dawn like you know if we'd been in this regulatory setup three years ago the market would have been euphoric um and yet the market was euphoric three years ago with no prospects whatsoever of regulatory Clarity and a you know friendly SEC so I really think we're almost there I just think people are like kind of Rage quitting at at a very inopportune time um I can't remember if I saw this in a private conversation or if I did do this publicly on the podcast but I I um no I think I think this was in a private conversation but it remains relevant right now which is I'm actually quite bullish on alt BTC ratios like I think that things are actually looking pretty good and pretty bad for BTC dominance um two reasons one is that alts have just been absolutely destroyed and a lot of them have retraced kind of the entire we talked about this at the beginning but they they they've retraced the entire Trump move and they're not encountering a tremendous amount of selling down here because I think that people are out so I mean give you an example of this I see a lot of charts that bottomed you know on uh February 9th and then they came back they bounced a bit you know they bounced like 20 30% and then that all got retraced but now they're back above where they were on February nth and BTC is basically flat actually btc's a little bit down since then I think it's down about a percent since then and what that tells me is that you know there are just not that many sellers left in the market for a lot of these things the one thing that I would be worried about if you were a holder of it is hype um I'd definitely be very nervous about holding that right now because what 10 to happen like if you expect that we get an Al season what tends to happen is that the assets where everybody has been hiding do really poorly when the rest of the market comes back and this says nothing about hype itself I'm actually like I I own it in smaller size than I I did last week but I you know I I I own it and I like it and I think that it's a great team with a great product but historically the assets that have done well during the downturns do not do well during the upturns because what ends up happening is that they do well during the downturns because they do well for like one day two days and then everyone piles in because they think they're safe and convince themselves of this narrative I think the same thing probably happens with LTC unless they actually get an ETF approved quickly um but the St the stuff that is kind of outperformed during the downturn if you want to make the BET oh you know there's going to be an ALT season like we're going to go up you probably want to trim that and buy the stuff that's performed poorly at this point H interesting yeah I mean that's definitely a that's sort of like a counterintuitive contrarian narrative that you paint there like I would think of the hyper liquid as just the most negative gamma negatively convex you know crypto asset out there what I mean by that is like if the whole Market nukes and you know token prices are down across the board and it's Despair and bare Market panic and whatever you'd think that like that's because participants are pulling out of crypto there's less activity hyper liquid is kind of like the onchain hyper Casino you know with all this leverage and no kyc and it's it's just the fun place to trade on chain uh in big size with big leverage and you know best user experience when there are fewer users uh engaged because we're in a bare market like there's probably less action on there and then you know during during like bull market pumps in crypto hyper liquid's all anybody can talk about because it's like the most fun place to to play around with you know leverage to the the long side and so I think like the whole Market just feels short hyper liquid when when the Market's rallying and the market feels like kind of long hyper liquid when the market selling off I think I think that's a good narrative but it doesn't that's just not what people are doing I think I think what yeah fair I think the reason that hyper liquid is outperformed is because it's outperformed that makes sense it's reflexivity like let me yeah let let me go hide in this thing while the rest of the Market's going down uh you know because because I want to be long something um but they start diversifying out of that kind of safe bet the moment the market starts doing well you know it's looking you know it's looking like it's outperforming here oddly Bitcoin is outperforming the stock market um S&P futures just collapsed on Friday it was uh definitely the biggest red candle of 2025 and you know we had some big ones in 2024 including Wednesday the 18th of December after some you know pretty big rally but for the most part like the stock market's getting a lot more volatile and I have to say I'm heartened by the fact that BTC didn't just collapse the way that snps did on Friday it feels like it's holding in there now obviously it's it's one day can't take too much some some of that sailor but it it is an interesting point that I mean if if you actually look at the if you look at the BTC over NASDAQ chart it it looks it looks pretty good it looks like it's really found a base you just chart BTC divided by n ndq ratio right now I see is 4.43 you see kind of a base at 4.35 we we had a little Wick down on the weekly to 4.25 but the weekly chart actually looks pretty good with a reasonable stop out level you know I I can't say exactly why uh BTC would be outperforming massively but I think it has to do with why the equity markets are underperforming um well actually let me let me ask you why why do you think the equity markets are are underperforming people are getting scared about tariffs um and I think that again it's just one day but I think I think Bitcoin not puking on tariff fears gives you some tea leaves into how it's going to trade if we enter a major trade War which is it's it's going to trade less like a risk asset that gets hurt by trade barriers and tariffs and more like an asset that's you know going to get sort of stepped up in relevance as an alternative Reserve currency if we've talked about this on the show a thousand times if if there you know the world goes multi-polar uh you do need an alternative Reserve currency um that isn't the dollar so I like that I like that perspective so like it's too soon to say but you know obviously I have to Too much exposure to Bitcoin in general and I just I'm I'm like like salivating with excitement when I see Bitcoin outperforming on tariff fears like this is this is you know it this is the time of the episode where I make my analogy to you know Commodities trading your your biggest wet dream as a Commodities Trader is that rare moment it's it's not every year maybe it's once every two to four years where everybody else gets poor while you're getting minted right for oil Traders it was like 2020 and then again in 2022 um this is like this is this could be that moment for Bitcoin if you enter like a major trade war and equities nuke but like countries start accumulating Bitcoin at the federal level on federal balance sheets and in central bank balance sheets to facilitate global trade across you know polls of the multi-polar world um so if you have like a Chinese sphere of influence and an American sphere of influence and like you know Russian sphere of influence and a European sphere of influence and everybody's kind of like at odds with one another um you know you could probably still do most transactions in dollars but the number of non-dollar denominated major Commodities and you know global trade transactions that need to happen goes up by a lot right it goes from like basically right now you've got Iran and Venezuela and you know North Korea we can talk about them later with the bit hack a couple of pariah States need it but like if you you know if you slice up the world and you know NATO's on its ass and people are alliances are getting broken and restructured like you know it's not just a couple Pariah states that need it now it's like it's it's a lot of countries that need it for more and more transactions and if Bitcoin starts to trade like you know hey as the expected value of that scenario I just described goes up Bitcoin goes up like oh my God we could be in for one of those like glorious moments as a crypto Community where we accumulate money not just as beta to the equity Market but as Alpha you know and that would be that would be pretty that that's when you know that's when you can take the proceeds of your crypto trading and actually like make a real difference in your own personal life if you get it right I mean that that would be a pretty sick pivot yeah you know bit Bitcoin goes to 200 equities equities stagnate and then you just roll it all over this episode is brought to you by Kraken OTC one of crypto's longest running exchanges with over a decade

to check out their latest wallets to go back to the original question you know why why is the equity market underperforming and why is Bitcoin doing okay I think it's just one word it's uncertainty and I don't think that the so so the market prior to Trump getting lued and this was my take as well which I've updated you know I thought that Trump was going to be very good for business you know cutting cutting regulation making it a very fair climate to to run to run your companies um I thought that there would be a tremendous amount of investment into the US and I think what has happened is that Trump has actually been a lot more unpredictable than even you know than even a lot of his detractors would have would have said he would be I mean he he's he he's a lot more manic than he was in his in his first term and he's doing a lot of lot of different things I mean from the potential of laying off a million federal workers to tariffs on countries that like Canada or were like we didn't think he was serious about that we thought that was just like a campaign pitch it's it's not just the tariffs it's that the the unpredictability of trump and mean is cozying up to Russia rejection re ction of European allies I mean all these things they just it's one word it's it's uncertainty and the markets hate uncertainty and I don't think Bitcoin does right bit Bitcoin actually thrives if the if the world becomes more uncertain and so that's I think the Divergence that we're seeing right now we're seeing companies struggling to figure out how to map uh for a future that where they don't know what the world is going to look like and Bitcoin saying hey chaos is great like this this is really good you know if if if each you know if if Europe can no longer depend on on the US uh and other countries are becoming allies and Canada is getting getting distance it's like okay well if every country is out for themselves then guess what that actually makes the game theory of Bitcoin a lot stronger that yeah much better in the past you could have said okay well the European Union is on board with the US and they're they're tied at the hip and so is Canada and so is Mexico so you know they can wait to see what the US does with Bitcoin because if the US does something with Bitcoin and it's really good then they'll still benefit somehow because you know they're they're all allies here you can't you know that that argument doesn't hold water they all have to make their own individual decisions now um and it actually it becomes more of a geopolitical tool in that case it's like well if if you think the us is going to go buy something it would be very supportive of Bitcoin all right get in there before them yeah you know it's it's it's it's more right now we're we're looking at a much more adversarial world than we were prior to Trump and you know regardless of if it's you know amazing for BTC I mean it could just be that it's just worse for I mean it is candidly it's just worse for the stock market than it is for BTC it might not even be great for BTC but it's definitely worse with stock market what like that I mean we talked on previous episodes about no absolutely and you're totally right about all of that it's it should be in the back of every crypto traders's mind to think like like the way you just described because this is a macro asset right but you know it's funny like during Trump's first Administration it was all about stock market record highs the Trump the Trump pump you know or the you know it's like the the Trump bump he was he was always like tweeting about how great the stock market was under him you know after we've talked about this a bit on the podcast about how he may be moving the B the gold post now and that might not be his like kpi for Success anymore the stock market it might be something else hopefully not a lower 10year yield dear God that would be scary for crypto but like um basically if why would why would a lower yield be bad for crypto like if he's just focused on Shoring up the bond market and making sure that that basically making sure that us Sovereign credit is as solid as possible that would mean an end to deficit spending right an end to like the the fire hose of cash that comes out of the government and that's probably like kind of a tightening event for money supply and markets and I don't I think that would suck some air out of the room uh definitely deprive the system of capital to buy speculative assets like Bitcoin you know like what you want is an environment where there's stimulus and easy money and Bitcoin goes up a lot when M1 money supply goes up a lot I don't think it goes up during like austerity that's what I'm saying um yeah I mean he's he's stated multiple times that you know he's focused on getting interest rates down yeah but I don't think like I think he means he wants rate Cuts in the front I don't think he's trying to like put an very different to say like I want rate Cuts because that just means it's easier to borrow and spend money for private Enterprise and private individuals like that's very different than what I'm saying about the tenure yield which is more a statement about like is Trump going to put America through a Greece 2012 style of sovereign austerity to like make our balance sheet better right to make our balance sheet less debtrid lower our interest payments and basically balance the budget through a painful process of like reduction in federal spending um like Doge Doge could do some of that but I don't think he's do you remember do you remember when we talked about the risks of the Trump presidency and one of the tail risks was uh he put He unemployment rate goes up subst amount because he actually does manage to cut a lot of federal workers and that causes short-term pain that's that's what I think is going to happen I think it's gonna be very short-term pain though happening and what I didn't like at all was his tweet over the weekend where he said Elon needs to be more aggressive I mean Elon seems to be very aggressive yeah he seems to be being very you know he's pretty he's pretty aggressive I mean I'm sure you've seen the tweets about sure you've seen the tweets about like screenshots from Zillow of the DC Metro area like real estate prices are tanking lots of new homes up for sale in the last 30 days definitely does somebody is somebody from the DC area uh I I did talk to a realtor because I was looking at buying a house down there and at least in in DC proper most of that is just because they turnover from the administration like you actually see a lot of this okay so it's like normal foure cycle like normal compared to 2020 and 2016 and 2012 it's like normal increase just what like a real estate agent Shilling you 2020 and 2016 because that was a turnover administrations not not 2012 are you sure you're not just getting shilled by the real estate agent they're like oh yeah this is normal this is fine buy a house Jai come on well why wait no because I mean they're like yeah maybe they want to get a deal done but also if if uh if if stuff was really coming onto the market then they would say that because they would say you're getting an amazing price oh yeah fair enough like like they didn't they didn't they didn't say that they're not like no there they they weren't saying there's a fire sale there's a fire sale but and there's also a there's also a family friend so it's trustworthy Intel yeah I didn't know what to make of that but it is um I I wouldn't be shocked I mean I grew I grew up in DC I grew up in the heart of the swamp you know my my dad was a government worker for for for for many for many years technically guess the IMF is technically government worker IMF is where he worked yeah my mom worked for the postal service for 35 years basically government worker as well yeah um I didn't know that I what was I where was where was I going with this uh the amount okay so after I graduated University the every single person I went to go work in DC for like six months all of my friends that ended up in DC they were working for like all you know like Centra deoy like all these places they were all working on these massively bloated government contracts that are very likely to get cut like yeah you know I I'm not going to say who but I I know somebody at who who interned for a certain agency whose job was to research uh the on online memes to find out like how right wiers were talking to each other in encoded meme form and this was like a multi-million dollar budget project and like stuff like that like I can't imagine continues under this Administration no it won't they were spending like a substantial amount of money just like tracking what types of memes people were creating weird why yeah why I mean put it this way back to my point about crypto that I was originally making like we TR for a second there no I mean I I love it I love it like we go to we got to entertain these tangents because this is the type of thinking that helps you avoid complacency in a sideways Market um basically my point was Trump was his kpi during his first Administration was the stock market that's what he was all about the big fear is that he takes the government into like super painful like recessionary austerity right that would be the other end of the the the same Spectrum I think we're going to land somewhere in the middle I think that Trump is gonna is looking back at the stock market's performance during Biden where there were tons of record highs you know huge huge like 20% up years in the S&P 500 20 plus percent. and that didn't really do Biden a solid right like it it kind of there there was a lot of inflation it pissed a lot of middle class people like like you know non-asset holders off uh it made housing unaffordable for vast sads of the American American population I think he's looking at that and he's probably like he's he's probably not going to take the country into austerity but he's probably not going to do everything he can to pump the stock market either and I think where we're going to land is like somewhere in the middle where he's like basically I I tweeted out this road map for his administration which I think is is kind of what's going to happen I want to hear your take on whether or not you agree with this I said first thing Doge fires a ton of government workers and pumps unemployment and labor market slack risk assets wobble like that's where we are now right we're just going to there's going to be a lot of people getting fired the trickle effects of this are going to happen everywhere like even my my next you know my mom's Nextdoor Neighbors in Berkeley they're you know the the guys a neuroscientist at UC Berkeley the NIH just cut funding for his project it's the first time in decades that's ever happened they're devastated right like you know they're probably going to have a lot of professors are GNA move on like you know their research is going to get cut just job loss everywhere and at the government level anything that the federal government touches you know and that's going to cause some risk asset wobbles because those people aren't buying homes anymore they're selling homes then I think next thing Trump negotiates a ceasefire in Ukraine I think commodity prices get nuked uh you know CPI goes down probably a pretty good time to buy Russian equities then if you think that's the case yeah and short oil um and short LNG basically short wheat uh you know yeah Russian equities that's a smart one I hadn't thought of that basic basically I think that that happens then you get lower inflation and then I think that paves the way for the FED to start cutting rates so risk assets start to stabilize as inflation goes down then rates get cut then we get a proper rip um so I think first we're in the pain phase what's up start to interrupt apparently ETFs that track indices on Russia are no longer tradeable and investable land of the free Land of the Free there any Russian tokens um Putin coin dollar sign dollar sign poot uh so yeah basically risk I think rates get cut crypto rips and equities grind higher then I think by then we're like six 12 months into the administration I think that's when the mass deregulation starts to happen I think that's when the pro business Happy Times start they're not going to be right now now we're in just painful uncertain you know realignment of things for business everybody's upset I think if you're trying to start or buy you know start a business or buy equities you want to do it before the mass deregulation and I think that's when it's just Moon Moon time for for equities and crypto um that's also I think you know one to two years out that's probably where AI productivity gains start to kick in in a big way um you know we were we were singing the Praises of deep research last week and I you know I do think that those productivity gains are going to you know cause continued deflation higher higher highs for equities in crypto and then against that super bullish backdrop we're not going to have Trump saying all right we need to make new highs that's the most important thing to me I think he'll say okay we can use this momentum to like really lean into like ramp deficits ramp tariffs again and uh and you know achieve things with the slack provided by you know constructive Capital Market uh you know wide openen Capital markets and I think that's when corporate bonds and treasury bonds just go to [ __ ] like I think that's like do not buy bonds I I think that's when Bitcoin starts to Moon because people start to lose faith in the dollar you know and that's kind of how I think it plays out I think we're just in the first phase of this very clear but difficult path for for Traders and investors let's go through Point by Point Doge fires a ton of government workers pumps unemployment labor market slack risk assets wble I think that's actually that's in the process of happening yeah like the the probability of that is like 85% that we get some sort of Market pullback because that happens Trump negotiating a ceasefire in Ukraine also seems reasonably likely like I kind of wonder what poly Market puts it out I don't know if you've you've checked I haven't great idea let's see SE ceasefire ceasefire Ukraine um 33% chance he ends it in the first 90 days that's quick Ukraine Ukraine election held in 2025 is 46% Chance which I think is a a good proxy for whether there's a ceasefire yeah um actually no interesting Russia Ukraine ceasefire in 2025 is 70% chance I was wrong about that being a good proxy like that that's kind of an interesting spread I mean yeah I mean I I guess hold an election is different from announced an election poly Market's just so anyway 70 what poly Market is just so ahead of the curve so yeah like 7% anyway so 70% I actually think is is pretty reasonable it might be higher rates get cut crypto rips equities grind higher I that's the part where I get nervous just because the inflation data hasn't been what we want it to be well no that's what I'm saying dude let's say that you agree with one and two a ton of government workers get fired unemployment is high higher and then like no more war in Ukraine commodity prices which are like the major input prices for CPI tank so you have you have like inflation is rear view mirror unemployment is higher the FED has like this giant green light to start cutting no it depends on how much I mean it depends on how much you think inflation is driven by this by by one commodity prices which we can which we can look at um and B like what I mean if it outside of Commodities is there is there anything else that labor cost of Labor okay so like CPI like the things you really need to like cost of energy and cost of Labor are two big ones um you know and so if oil is trading $45 a barrel like you could see OPAC go into a price War if the Ukraine war ends because their their Cuts aren't going to work anymore there's going to be too much oil sloshing around so um you know I think you have $50 $45 oil versus right now you know $75 oil I I think CPI eases meaningfully LNG too right um you know you won't have a problem okay Energy prices were significant contributor to the increase last CPI print yeah okay so rates get cut crypto rips equities grind higher I think in that scenario ities do RIP as well MH um in in this scenario that's I mean that's very good for alts actually think it's less good for Bitcoin like that like this like this particular scenario that you paint here is very bad for Bitcoin dominance my personal opinion because it's easing of geopolitical tensions while reallocating appetite to risk yeah gives you higher alt and I mean I think BTC is higher in this particular scenario but I I think the real winner might be Salon ethereum yeah which is by the way doing quite well which I want to talk about at some point uh Point number four Mass deregulation party time for equities and crypto I do agree that mass D regulation while happening right now is going to be the story and the drive after all of this stuff gets done yeah uh AI productivity gains kick in this this I actually think has already been happening it's quiet isn't it it's like maybe it's not number five on this list maybe it's just like constant backdrop to everything else con I mean okay so I'll tell you something funny so back in 2023 this guy named Hal press who's North Rock digital on uh Twitter came out uh to Puerto Rico and we spent some time together and we one of the things that we talked about was Ai and at that point in in May of 2023 AI wasn't really like people were talking about it but Chachi PTI was very new still at the time and you know it was kind of like the small circles that were talking about it and the one takeaway that we had was this is insanely good for the NASDAQ like this is like this is going to be a huge driver of NASDAQ and good call I think we were we we we were right and it was driven and and I think one reason I I I know that this was right is if you look at the S&P when you look at NASDAQ a a huge amount of the gains have been from the top tech stocks like everything else is kind of stagnating the companies that had the most value to gain from deploying AI gained the most I mean I I don't think these layoff I mean I would be shocked if these layoffs were feasible in a world without AI yeah yeah and since look let's see since since we talked in May of 23 I mean nasdaq's up like 90% so that was 70% that was a good call um anyway the the ne the next Point here well so I think we agree on on AI tariffs and continued deficits ramp causing problematic backdrop for this this is the part that I feel is kind of the huge logical leap I don't I don't know if if I mean do the continued deficits ramp like why right in in in a world where they do manage to cut to to cut to cut spending why why are you like where are you getting the continued deficit trm okay so here's where I'm getting it I think that if you know you've got cheap commodity prices fueling the economy you've got you know AI Le deflation and productivity gains bolstering not just tech companies but like you know even WD40 can hire fewer people to analyze how many squeaky hinges are out there because they can just ask deep research like pretty much any company in the Russell Russell index and S&P 500 can benefit from this um McKenzie does you don't need to pay McKenzie $10 million to figure something out for you you just pay Sam Alman 200 bucks um you know this is such a constructive setup that's when Trump can start doing things that are bad for the stock market like threatening his threatening our adversaries with tariffs um you know screwing with global trade and you know in terms of deficit deficits ramping you can you can feel comfortable about cutting taxes and continuing to spend money on what the government spends money on if the economy is on the highs whereas you wouldn't be able to do it if you were in a recession right so I I think doge is going to cut a lot of fat and a lot of jobs but as we know government most of the government spending goes into three things right it goes into um Social Security Medicare four things I guess social security Medicare the defense department just the the defense budget and now interest payments right and those are all really hard to cut so like what Doge can cut will probably be a lot of waste Fraud and Abuse a lot of garbage a lot of jobs a lot of like unnecessary real estate bills and US AIDS type NIH type things but like you're going to need like sweeping bipartisan legislation or maybe even like uh you know like a real real change of heart in America if you want to start cutting things like Social Security Medicare and or Medicaid whatever it is and um and the defense department budget enough to move the needle like this is we're going to be in deficit deficit world for a while um and I think the government will get comfortable with that if everything else is going super well that's why I wrote that okay I'm I'm gonna put a 50% on that one okay may may maybe lower I think I think I'm so so I I I think that the you can I I'm going out on a limb I'll admit it but here's here here here's basically here's basically my take I think that it's you know a lot of what you said contains truth but the underlying piece of this is that Trump has promised over and over and over and over again and has made it a court tenant of his campaign and the way that he's governing right now to reduce the deficit and to cut waste and to generate you know activity in in in the in the private world and I think that it's going to be very hard for him to reverse on that um just from like an ego perspective as well I I I don't see increased spending happening and I I I I think tax cuts I I see I see tax I yes ta tax cuts could could happen in in a way that is larger than uh the the spending cuts but I think my my my my point here is really the the the two levers that he has is he's saying I'm going to I'm going to cut a t a ton of spending and I'm going to I'm going to lower taxes and I'm gonna balance like I'm going to balance the budget like you know this is something that he's very concerned about is is running the American economy like a business um and so I think I think yeah I just think it's very hard for him to go back on that yeah if if I were to air on the side of like what he's probably going to do I would say say he's more likely to cut aggressively than he is to lobby for tax cuts aggressively H we I mean we have to be careful like if you're right and I in a way kind of as an American Patriot I hope you are but as a Bitcoin holder I hope you're not um if he slashes the budget enough to balance it oh my god dude we're it's gonna be a real recession like there's going to be the markets are going to crash um cuz like the deficit spending it's like 7% of GDP right now it's insane like you you take that away and bring it down to like two or zero the the way the way that I read the way way that I read your Tweet is not that we continue to have a deficit year-over-year the the way that I read it is that the deficit blows out oh I see so I I I think it's very unlikely that he manages to actually balance the budget what I'm saying I think it's very very unlikely for him to accelerate the deficit like yeah I don't think the budget's going to the deficit is going to blow out either if I wasn't clear what I was trying to articulate maybe inefficiently was I don't think that he's going to take any steps to drastically increase the problem of the deficit oh you're right if the deficit goes up from here like the Dollar's G I don't think that that's that's that's neither here nor there for BTC yeah it's like doesn't really matter no you're right you're right we're on the same page now we're on the same page I just kind of like poorly worded Tweet now I understand what you're saying in response to it um yeah so what we're left with I think is you know I wrote conclusion avoid bonds like the plague short Commodities long stocks long Bitcoin I think that's kind of how I want the portfolio to look here and I never thought about that being like good for alt but you brought up an extremely solid point which is if if most of this stuff happens like it's we're going to get a pretty amazing alt season in there especially when the deregulation happens yeah now what about about alt season you know you know what doing like interestingly well I don't want to say it the eth BTC and one thing you know I'm surprised we haven't talked about this I think we just kind of went down a bunch of rabbit holes today but we didn't talk about the bit hack at all and I mean that was like that was like the news of the week and what I thought was interesting about the viit hack is one how [ __ ] massive it was this thing was huge yard and a half yeah it's y yard yard and a half of eth how nonchalant B it was about it I mean they've clearly printed an insane amount of money and I think you know like despite the fact that it was a massive massive massive exchange hack nobody seems to have actually lost any money B it seems to be covering it for now um but the most interesting part was actually the reaction of eth BTC to me I mean I saw the headline uh within like 30 seconds of the thing coming out and I immediately shorted eth BTC like immediately that was my first reaction I was like okay I'm going to sell a bunch of this and then it sells off like from from from from where from from where I saw the headline and tried to short it it sells off like 2% or something like that like think is like two and a half percent um and then it just bounces and it just stays there and it doesn't go lower and I think the hack happened at you know 10: a.m is my time and by the end of day you know eth BTC was not at the lows it it had it's like it was like 1% higher than the lows like 1.5% higher than the lows I was like that's weird like as as a Trader you have to think that's weird that shouldn't happen yeah if if if $ 1.5 billion do of eth gets hacked and eth BTC has been trading so horrendously poorly and we literally got down I mean the bottom of the range it didn't even get to the bottom of the range which was another two and a half percent like it it couldn't tap the bottom of the range that it's in let alone go anywhere near its lows even though there's in theory a billion and a half dollars of eth to be sold on the market and I realized holy [ __ ] there's nobody left to sell eth except this North Korean guy who just stole it from byit yeah ex like B but basically except that guy like there's nobody else left like everyone is everyone's out e eth BTC has been in a downtrend since I just pulled up the chart I I like squeezed the x-axis on trading view as you were as you were talking about this it has been in a downtrend since the 9th of December 2021 that was the peak this is this asset has been spiraling into the abyss for more than three years now so you're right I think all the eth Maxis are just out right they're done like these people don't like there's no more eth to be sold and now every and everyone is too scared to go buy eth an eth BTC and so as any good analyst and Trader does what what what I what I went to go look for is have I overlooked anything happening on eth I read a report recently that details that 50 companies that are working uh you know 50 non crypto companies that are working working on eth and I went through the mall and there was literally nothing interesting that in there it was just mostly people just launching some like oneoff oneoff nfts like one interesting thing was that L apparently Lamborghini launched a an nft that is tied into a metaverse that is now launching on base not not not eth basay or anymore very 2021 of them to do that very 2021 of them but the interesting thing was the the one interesting thing was most of the rwa activity still takes place on eth HM and so rwa real world assets it's like the little brother of stable coins like the completely overlooked because it's a runt compared to its little BR compared to its big brother but it is the next logical step in terms of if the financial system is going to move into crypto in a meaningful way it goes stable coins rwa and then actual companies like issuing tokens and and you know in in forms of equity and like actual crypto protocols and so I I did find that interesting I mean and it makes me think that there's a there's a potential for a massive eth short squeeze at some point in the next year where this thing like you know outperforms BTC by 50% or something like that maybe maybe it goes back to you know 04 at some point I guess that' be a 40% move but like massive move from eth where it catches a narrative of the moment and just nobody owns it and it goes up I'm just that would be the the most hated rally that everybody's been all the eth Maxis were waiting for that never came I could totally see that and I think if it's going to happen it's going to happen in like the next month and the reason I think that is because uh of a old trading heris stic if a good news can't send the market higher it's not going higher and if bad news can't send the market lower it's not going lower let me just uh let me just poke try to poke two holes in that theory I I think you're probably right but I'm I'm you know while we're sitting here debating markets on on a call like I need to ask uh the first would be why a month like the stable coin bill is going to get passed in like two to two to five months or two to six months that's kind of what brings a lot of capital on chain onto e e and that's probably when I think you see the eth eth wallets getting refilled and then the other thing would be why would we get an eth pump if the dude who just stole a yard and a half happiest man in North Korea is just like waiting to sell it like he's got the eth he doesn't want eth he wants uh he wants a bulletproof Mercedes for his supreme leader he's got to liquidate that somehow you so there are two things here one speculated that part of the reason for this eth out performance is because bivet has to buy back to eth and that is true like that eth is gonna buy it's G to buy back the eth that's what jump did after Wormhole got hacked they went and lifted the eth in the open market that they lifted $400 Million worth of eth so that's what's happening but then obviously yeah because like bit's short eth now and North Korea is long so that bybit probably bought right away for solvency issues and um you know Kim Jong-un let me let me let me amend my statement it either it either happens in the next month or it happens from a lot lower yeah and the reason that I think that I'm like you know cautiously constructive on E BTC is one because there are actual real potential narratives that these and these things tend to get that people tend to get excited about these things before they actually happen and two we finally have sort of a reason for eth BTC to go up up which is that it didn't go lower and I know that sounds factious but it's like it's true I mean you just had it tells you about in the stock and flow equation it tells you about the stock it tells you there's just there's no more eth to get sold yes exactly and I think that you know the Traders like me and you will realize that now and maybe reallocate a little bit to eth just you know small amounts um and that and what I just the idea of buying e gives me the willies I don't know it's scary that's bullish that's actually quite a bullish signal to me so Shell Shocked I like it yeah yeah but but I'm actually getting more bullish on E by the day now just because you know it's it starts with people like us it starts with you know it starts with people like YOLO Sam Obi this could be fun I think I'm at YOLO SM I'm telling you this for the last year I've been using eth as a short leg on every single trade like every trade of every Al I just short like either the equivalent amount of eth or more eth because it just it like won't go up as much as any ads uh and it goes down more um I'm not gonna like I'm not doing that like there there's like basically zero chance that I'm shorting eth for the next at least month I'm just not doing it anymore and I think that that mentality like I'm not the you know most gigabrain person in the world I'm sure a lot of other Traders did this as well and I'm probably not going to be shorting e either at at these levels what's the new short leg AI fart coin you're shorting fart Sal for sure Sal until the unlocks pass it's got to be Salona when do they pass and then and then after that we might you know hopefully after the salana unlocked pass eths has its pump and I can go back to using it as a short leg because it'll be it'll be zero eventually but we're here to talk trading aren't we hello again old friend yeah that'll be a good feeling go coming back to a comfortable trade what what's uh when did the unlocks pass I forget mid-march is when they start Salon volume across OTC and all the exchanges it's got to be like a billion or two a day at least so you know the old rule of thumb says if you don't want to move the market you execute no more more than 10% of daily volume 10% participation so if a yard and a half of salana gets unlocked um maybe people are hanging on to some of it maybe like two billion dollars worth of soul is unlocking on March 1 yeah some some of that might be priced in though because unlike the ETFs or the Trump election where you just can't buy enough to price that price in that outcome you know the market can either sell or not buy plenty of salana ahead of that unlock so that you know let's say of the two billion 1 billion gets sold of the 1 billion that gets sold like 500 million gets sold sloppily at market like and of that of that 500 million maybe 250 is priced in like maybe there's $250 Million worth of soul that just that people want to buy but they're waiting till after the unlock so I don't think it's like I don't think it's the end of the world for salana but I agree it's it's definitely it's not the time to be buying lots of salana yeah not not not the end of the world for sure but I think it's good to use as a short like if you're going to be long in anything else agreed anyway we can leave we we can leave it at that yeah a good chat a good a good uh you know suggestion for a short leg this is good this is this was really fun this is one I love these this is productive I I came into this like what what the heck are we going to talk about like wasn't really that active a week okay byit got hacked but like once we get going like I actually this gets me thinking this is useful stuff for me thank you Obby I appreciate it yeah this is great Jonah I'll see you again next week see you again next week uh yeah talk to you soon buddy [Music]

you know why optos is up 15% today because of that reply guy that's hilarious it's so funny it's so funny it's so funny just some random dude commenting on every looking good here's looking good here it's actually going up this episode is brought to you by Kraken OTC get access to 247 trading services for high net worth individuals and institutional clients to execute orders over $100,000 you'll hear more about them later in the show [Music] all right we're live everybody got another episode of the THX podcast fired up here I'm Jonah van Borg here with your co-host uh AI Felman we got a lot to talk about sentiment in crypto is pretty terrible but before we before we get into the dire um the dire news out there just a quick update the Thousand X podcast has its own feed now it's pretty exciting we graduated from the Empire feed so uh if you want to make sure you you you know to catch all the latest episodes that we put out on time uh so that the news is relevant to you type a THX into your you know wherever you consume your podcast YouTube Spotify Apple uh and search for our feed or click on the link in the show notes so thanks again for listening AI let's dive into it here uh everything except Bitcoin feels like it's going to zero is this going to continue or is this a buying opportunity that great way to start off the Pod honestly I think you know what we've been talking about this for a while um basically all coins just got destroyed over the last two months really even even this month is when they got hit extremely hard relative to BTC because btc's kind of just gone sideways and altcoins have blood out but when I look at Bitcoin dominance and I see it at 61% it's actually come off a little bit from the highs of last week and I mean I look at eth BTC at 0.028 I look at every single alt down 90% And my takeaway is that this is actually a really good time to buy stuff that you think is you know has strong fundamental right when you look at the market of 3 months ago or four months ago you look at the charts I mean basically everything was up in a straight line every single alt was up 300 to 500% and you sort by top gainers on coin gecko over the last month and you're like holy crap like the lowest alt gain is like 100% here uh that's normally the wrong time to go buy but that's when everyone is talking about buying and now I'm seeing I'm seeing green shoots I mean forget forget BTC for a second but things like to are actually doing very well because they launch an interesting an interesting product that people are trying to use their pockets of outperformance right now in the alt World broadly they're still doing poorly but the stuff that's actually making progress is is doing well and so I'm I'm actually of the mindset that now is a good like a really good time to go through your list and start allocating I mean I I would be selling BTC to go buy alts here actually think that's probably a contrarian right now but uh right move is you know I'd be shorting PTC buying some alts huh that is a contrarian view I mean the way I usually like to look at it is never catch a falling knife in crypto especially on a shitcoin because even if something's sold off 80% it can still sell off another 80% from there you know none of these things or a lot of these things don't have any real fundamental value some of them do uh but most don't so you know if you're like wow fart coins uh down 90% maybe I should try to get involved here it could easily go down another 90% And you'd just be caught holding the bag so um I prefer you know I I lost a lot of money in my early crypto trading career trying to do that um trying to you know because that's sort of how you trade Commodities uh when prices get too low de you know Supply gets cut and demand increases so you know things tend to revert to the mean a lot more sensibly than you know maybe they would in crypto where there's less Supply curtailment at low prices like tokens still get minted with Reckless abandon whatever the price is and um you know demand doesn't necessarily pick up when prices are crashing in fact the opposite might be true in crypto because it's such a reflexive you know fear and greed driven asset with no you know it's not like you're putting it into factories to make cars um so I kind of had the wrong approach in the beginning and got burned and now what I like to do is wait for tokens to bottom out and start rallying uh before I I quote unquote dip by um but I think what you just said about Tao resonates because just looking at the chart here it's kind of stabilized and it seems like it's on the up and up again um so I guess what the only like caveat I would add to your to your take is you know if your projects that that are on your shopping list that you like you know obviously they're at better prices than they were a few weeks ago if you want to start accumulating make sure that the knife has stopped falling right like check to see if it's bottomed out uh and if it's if it's still falling like a stone you might it might pay to wait for a little while wait for it to bottom out and then wait for it to start picking up before you get involved um I don't know is that like what do what do you think of my Approach I think I think it can be dangerous I mean the the thing the thing is in this I mean in this particular state of the market a lot of these a a lot of these bounces are short-lived and because there's so many people that are trying to allocate to the good projects they they they tend to sort of remove themselves from the pack and so I'll give you an example um and may maybe this isn't directly contradictory to your to to your point but just something that I've noticed is like take take Litecoin as an example we've been we were talking about Litecoin as as an ETF trade for a while now and I know a lot of people were saying okay well the market doesn't look amazing right now so I'm not going to go buy Litecoin because Litecoin is correlated to the market and if I think the Market's going lower then I get to buy Litecoin lower and then what ends up happening is that okay Bitcoin trades down 3% and then Litecoin trades down 3% and then Bitcoin bounces one and Litecoin bounces 10 and then suddenly if you look at the chart over the last month like yes Bitcoin is down litecoin's up 30% right and so if you're waiting for you know the the market itself to start doing well again you're kind of actually missing the opportunity and by the time the market starts to do well again all of that like premium that that coin is supposed to have might might have already been baked into the price and I'm kind of seeing that across a couple of different uh you know a couple of different assets including including to I mean to's back like a ton of alts are just still at the lows and Tow is back to where it was uh you know a month a month ago with Bitcoin like 102k even though bit even though bitcoin's 96 so let me ask you this question then follow-up question to what you just said I totally hear you and I'm not necessarily convinced about my waiting for it to bottom out and then buying the rally Theory I'm kind of testing it out with you um are you know you said you like selling Bitcoin to buy alts ta toao is where it was a month ago Litecoin is on the the highs of the year or basically the high multi-year highs this episode is sponsored by Kraken OTC you can trade over chat or even access kraken's self-service automated trading feature to receive executable quotes in

their latest devices trust me you won't regret it are you do you like selling Bitcoin here to buy Litecoin on multi-year highs do you like selling it to buy to where trading where it was a month ago it's a good you know when when you Frame It That Way um I actually do think that the Litecoin trade is kind of played out at this point like I I wouldn't be a huge buyer of LTC I I just don't think I I think a lot of the premium in that trade has been jued so I'm not as confident in the in the LTC trade but like for example if you're thinking of okay I want to get an allocation to AI coins and I think AI coins are going to do are going to do well like how should I start to allocate well one way you can think of doing that is going and buying this the stuff that you like and shorting some BTC against it because I do think that at this point like that's actually a reasonable pair trade I know that sounds nuts yeah no it doesn't sound because because for for the last like six months it's been completely nuts to even think about doing that I actually think that a lot of these coins are beaten down so much at this point that it it might make sense um one thing that I will say is we were kind of right just to do do a little lap not that we could have made any money on this but remember when we talked about AI coins and we said the composition the market cap of AI coins might grow substantially but the composition is going to change dramatically well if you go look at just AI coins in general the the darling virtuals has done so like horrifically bad and now people don't even buy it for a bounce anymore like it hit it hit a dollar and then Bitcoin bounced 4% and then V virtuals didn't even move there there there are so many people selling it but you know it did move uh arc Arc had a 50% or sorry 40% move off the lows because that's where the Mind share is now because they're doing apparently a better job ACC according to the market of delivering of delivering the product that people want to use and by all accounts it actually is quite quite good but I think this is just you know a cautionary tale to people that get wetted to their bags in an upand cominging sector you always have to be willing to realize that whatever coin you've chosen in the moment can be disrupted in a week and that you need to move around yeah you got to be in and out of stuff or or or at least have like an index and just add like buy the new stuff and put it in your index because I guarantee you like whatever whatever you buy today in the AI world is probably going to be obsolete in like two months that's just way hard it's so hard to trade like that like people aren't wired to I mean churn running through different tokens and buying and selling stuff quickly is usually a recipe for retail traders to chop themselves up and and really end up in in a hole right you pay transaction costs all this trading is on chain these things are a liquid it's not necessarily clear how much bit offer you're paying at all times like it's it's dicey stuff to to trade actively and especially in like the illiquid alt space or an emerging pocket of the alt space like like AI coins are but you have to if you hold on to stuff you will just get carded out on a stretcher and you know like you and I got started with virtuals we realized pretty quickly building our agent that a no code agent platform sucks right like they yeah the content that a no code agent puts out is terrible it's spam like people block it it gets like two views per tweet it's terrible so then we switched the Alisa framework Eliza whatever to to build our own basically the Eliza framework is like a you know a repository in GitHub that allows you to do more custom stuff with your Bot we switch to that that has a token you know I bought that on the highs may aula we all we all screw some of these trades up um you know it was good at first but then that very quickly became Obsolete and we scrap that and now we have a completely custom stack and you know what I should have done over the course of that time is realized like okay I got to sell virtuals on any pop realizing that the no code framework is garbage and this is going to lose M share uh AI 16z ripped hard should have sold that when I realized that it too wasn't good enough I just held on too long and so I I think it's it's hard right it's hard to do that it's hard to move around like you said I mean if you if you buy something and okay well I'm I'm really confident on this AI theme I'm really confident that people are going to be using agents I'm super confident that this is a sector that's going to grow and then you allocate the virtuals because it was the leader not not even two months ago right I mean it was like clear leader yeah like the clear leader like two months ago if you did something like that in the traditional stock market like in in an analogous framework you you found an industry that you think is going to blow up you found the leader very rarely are you going to be disrupted in two months it's just not going to happen yeah and so you know I people just aren't yeah they're they're not they're not wired for this but you you kind of have to be in crypto because these tokens AR delivering consistently evaluate which is why it's so easy to lose money because the most dangerous thing that you can do as a Trader is to marry your bags and I think it's very easy to do that in crypto because they're twoo psychological phenomena that that that happened that you know one is you you buy something and it's the leader and and it does it does really well for you and then it goes against you and suddenly you're in a position where okay you've lost money on this thing but psychologically you don't want to give up on it because you've lost money and you want you want to you want to make back that money and you end up just holding in the hopes that it will it will go back up not admitting to yourself that it's been disrupted and we see this play out over and over and over again it's like the lack of ability to admit that your project is no longer The Good the good project I mean there something you just have to really fight against well it's true and one other thing that makes it even harder two things the first is uh crypto is a very tribal asset class so if you're like a virtuals holder your tribe on crypto Twitter like you're going to see their content everybody's going to be you know helping each other feel good about bag holding even when bag holding is a terrible idea uh so the tribalism that communal that communal sort that sense of community kind of keeps people in positions longer than they should be it psyches them out it creates like little kind of psychological bubbles of group think that screw up your trading process and then the second thing that happens is projects are aware when they're losing mind share they're aware that their token prices are going down they have stake holders and employees and devs who want the token who want the number to go up too so what they do is they they like they release on their road map like things that will make the token price rally news changes in tokenomics BuyBacks buy and burn all this stuff so they'll they'll they'll basically attempt to psych you out of selling when you should be selling um and that too is a bad idea because at the end of the day none of these projects are legally allowed to deliver you know earnings per share to their token holders right so unlike that stock market analogy that you just drew um it's really about it's not about sh when you mentioned like tokens or projects getting disrupted their core product isn't necessarily getting disrupted it's just the probability of future mind share increasing is getting disrupted by mind and M share is a much more more fluid uh transient evanescent thing than like actual underlying business viability so that's why these shifts happen so quickly and you know like me we could sit here all day and pretend to always be right about everything that would be dishonest like I've lost some money on AI coins I think it's good to just take some losses to just like you know obviously it's not a huge part of my portfolio I can Pat myself on the back for being mostly in Bitcoin but for the the little piece of it that I I try to like learn with and gamble on on crap like this you know I've definitely lost some money so I think it's time rather than just like clinging you know clinging to this idea marrying my bags as you would phrase it I think it's best to just like sell most of those positions and move on to the next thing and the next thing right now there are a lot of next things like there are a lot of tokens like toao that have been heavily beaten up that could rally also there are a lot of like you know it also pays to try and bet on things with more convexity where like you know the market cap is so low that uh you don't have to you don't have to risk a ton of money to reap a huge reward like you can bet on really early stage projects or um projects with a clear you know deep bottlenecking narrative like Litecoin even though you know you wouldn't recommend doing that so there there are all sorts of other opportunities if you're married to your bags the biggest the biggest diservice you do to yourself is not the money you lose but the you know the future like the forward opportunities that you sacrif by not having that Capital freed up to cap you know to capture new new opportunities I mean a big a big issue just going back to the core problem of things get disrupted too quickly it's that everything is open source right and so it's extremely easy if somebody makes a huge Innovative leap in crypto everyone else can see and immediately understand how they made that huge Innovative leap and then incorporate it and then compete with I mean the way to think about it is is like they're constantly the 4minute miles being broken in crypto in that sense right I mean for the longest time nobody ran uh a mile in under four minutes and then the moment one person does it in the next 10 years like hundreds of people did it because you know because it was just a psychological thing and so that a lot of these breakthroughs or or or things that you build in crypto or new products that you build forget breakthrough just you build a new product you build an AI agent platform and then everyone can see oh okay okay okay I understand this is this is useful product but I'm actually I can build it better faster and there's no mo because you you can see how it's built so I think that's I mean both really incredible because you get extremely fast iteration on products in crypto which is awesome uh but it makes the life of a team extremely hard and I do think that it's why all of the you know I'm trying to figure out the right way to say this but basically the the incentives are for a Founder to go build an L1 specifically because it's harder to disrupt an L1 uh that because what you're doing is you're basically accumulating a community of applications and regardless of what applications are built you win if you can convince people to build on your platform and then if you I mean if you bu application you're you're kind of stuck because it's just it's much more competitive so I think and also the valuations for l1s are are much higher so I mean I think that it's just like also disincentivizes is building applications but the people that do build applications um you know they they they get to they get to live in a very competitive and fun world yeah fun fun with big air quotes around it I mean that's a great transition into the like the topic of l1's you know salana is taking a lot of heat right now because the mem coin crime coin frenzy has you know hasn't necessarily been constructive for society's view of crypto uh but before we get to that been really bad have you have you talked to anyone about trumpcoin or any of these memes like anyone like not crypto in the real world like it's the it's horrendous people in the real world stopped talking to me about crypto when prices came off the highs for a while it was like what should I buy Jonah you're the crypto guy what do I do here with my bags um but yeah now that prices are nuking um and Bitcoin is off the highs like I've stopped having those conversations may maybe you've got a different friend group though tell me I mean it's like it pops up in politics now right that's what I'm trying to say is that I've I've had quite a few people talk to me and complain about this trumpcoin and how much of a massive grift it is and these are Republicans you know that that aren't that aren't in crypto they're like dude what is it like what is this scam that he that he's launched how did you know and and just Javier Malay thing has turned into a category five hurricane in his home country of Argentina I don't know if you've been paying attention to the news there but he he's he's getting LOM basted uh and it's it's really sad because I actually think that you know if world leaders had embraced crypto from a building perspective or from an incentives perspective that would have been really cool like imagine if imagine if Elon had said hey we're going to open- Source all of this government spending data uh and we're going to launch a coin that's going to get 1% of all of the dollars saved uh go buy this coin and then dig through the data and try to save us money and he's then he's created like a mass Army of people incentivized to dig through government data because they own this they own this coin I mean like even something way it doesn't have to be that big it could it could have been a lot smaller but something more interesting would have been awesome that is a brilliant idea I mean he I really like that like I hope I hope somebody who knows him hears that that suggestion I think it's brilliant um that's exactly the right way to incentivize people to help help uh you know help grow a project that's worthwhile like cutting waste um and you know he did suggest putting on all of crypto on chain or sorry all of Treasury spending on chain so that you know everybody could sleuth through it and and see see where the money goes which you know with the exception of maybe some confidential like military or defense projects is probably a worthwhile experiment um but yeah I agree like why I don't understand why these politicians fell for their fell for scam coining um it doesn't actually let's let's not call it scam coins meme coins are what they are right I think if you buy dog whff hat or popcat or MOG or bunk you're not and you're expecting the team to deliver real value to you like The Joke is on You these are just memes like don't think any deeper than that I I feel like it's sad that politicians have sunk to the level of of meming instead of actually like suggesting real policy or using blockchain for its actual merits which is you know creating trustless decentralized databases uh which are effectively more trustworthy and transparent than you know the sort of closed Source mon thic things that the and often more technologically up up to dat than the closed Source monolithic things the government uses like I I would call myself a Libertarian in that sense and I I think they could have embraced that so this is a sad turn of events but you know Trump and mle have done some interesting things some good things and they can always pivot back to that later I think like the the take that that's bothering me right now related to those tokens isn't that the world leaders who have engaged in that conduct have disgraced themselves because they'll bounce back it's more like what does it mean for crypto what does it mean for salana um because all this is taking place on salana there's a there's a you know an increasing increasingly consensus Viewpoint out there that it's bad for salana I I have the opposite take I think this is all it's not bad for salana I mean the the bad the bad part is just that it there they're clearly these people are surrounded by value extractors I mean at the end of the day there's nothing you can really do about that because these I mean Trump Malay Dave poroy all these guys they don't have any knowledge of crypto they don't have any ability to navigate crypto so they rely on quote unquote trusted advisers and in crypto it's just so easy if you have that kind of reach to make so much money it's like you need a you need like an extremely morally upstanding person to not take it advantage of that I guess that's a metaphor for broader government right like a lot of government never want to do that but um like uh but you know it's uh I I think you put n you put a 100 people in that situation 99 of them are taking some money for themselves and a lot of it right and so it it's kind of a you know like can't really hard to solve that problem to be completely honest um I think they what could have been done is they could have been pushed in a better Direction uh and these people I think if out of the hundred are actually like bottom 5% of humanity they're pretty pretty bad they're like pretty egregious scammers Obie what are you saying are you saying that people in government are you saying that people in government do things for their own personal gain no no no no definitely Trump not Trump would never do that no Trump trump no no he's different than all the other politicians don't worry in that sense I think this these meme coins have just exposed the broader grift going on in government like what's the difference between Trump's crypto advisor like uh pumping and dumping Melania tokens and Elizabeth Warren like taking money from fizer and then like you know lobbying for their vaccine I I I don't know it to me it just seems in some ways Jonah this activity it humanizes these politicians yeah like think about like if the president of the United States can do something that dumb and that grifty and that bad like he's no different than you or you you and I like none of these politicians are any different than than you and I and you know the way that our world acts around us you ever you ever see I mean like you ever you ever go to a a parking lot in New York that you know when when you park and then you give the guy your keys and he has to park the car for you because these parking lots are really really complicated and then you come back and you get your car and there three people in front of you so you go to the guy and you slip him at 20 and you say can you get my car first yeah that's how Society works that's just how Society works you know it's funny um and you know politicians are no different it used to be in New York that you could grease any Bouncer and get in pretty much wherever you wanted uh I don't know if it's still that way because I'm out of that game now and have been for a decade it's not it's not it's not untrue but in um in Europe they're much more uh principled about it like in you know in Paris if you try to pay the bouncer 500 EUR to get into like the nicest nightclub in Paris he'll just be like I don't care if it's your birthday I don't like your face you try this at Bergin you'll just get sent home right like the Europeans are much more principled about this stuff in America the whole it's just um the hardest Club to get into that I I mean I failed to get into was an empty Club in Belgrade Serbia I've been clubbing there which one the tube and it I mean B I looked at you could see inside there were like six people in there and there were these two massive like six eight serbians are huge by the way two two massive guys and we try to get in and they just go nope not today like why not today they're like nope not to I know why you didn't get in there because you're not a Serb and you weren't in a group with a Serb you got to go with serbs that's I went with serbs so I got everywhere yeah you know what I I I should have I should have gone with a Serb that that was my that was my huge mistake yeah crypto tip of the day if you want to get into a nightclub in Belgrade bring along a Serb if you want to get into a nightclub in New York or if you wanna make money bring bring $200 bring $200 if you want to get into a nightclub in Paris don't yeah just just stay away from Paris Al together you wait in line like the rest of them this episode is brought to you by Kraken

link in the description of today's episode to check out their latest wallets just bringing it back to crypto for a second I think that the fat protocol thesis is Alive and Well I think that like you said applications are not going to retain any value until like sweeping regulation allows revenues of applications to get passed through to token holders and then maybe the the fat protocol thesis gets turned upside down but but between now and then like all of the value is going to acur to l1s that matter and right now those l1s are Bitcoin and salana maybe eth has a play in the future but even if this mean coin frenzy uh dies down I think you know Builders who are trying to build High throughput applications are going to look at salana and be like wow salana survived the meme coin frenzy without getting bowled over even once and this is a far cry from the days when salana got bowled over by a walking app uh back in 2022 23 so like sana's really battle tested itself at this point for high throughput applications there's no like bridging between an L1 or an L2 it's just it's all there um I I think the story for salana looks good so I'm I'm dip buying I'm I'm I'm nibbling a little bit at you know I I nibbled in the 160s and I'm nibbling still at 170 um taking proceeds from my the biggest worry about salana is just purely the fact that there's what is it 1.6 billion coming uh in terms of unlock and I think a lot of it is not hedge and the price was around 60 bucks where people bought it so they're they're up a ton um but once that Supply is cleared I think that it's it's backed up only for for salana I mean they they've just been such such a clear winner and all of this all of this nonsense is going to blow over and when I say nonsense I mean all this worry about the these insiders I mean salana didn't do anything I mean it's not sana's fault that they were such an amazing chain that people decided to go build on it and all of the activity happened on it and then that activity happened to include grift I mean like if salana sucked then the grift would have just happened on a different chain right I mean I mean it's not like you know anaton and Raj were standing up there grifting themselves it just so happened that it was a great chain to do grift on because it's a great chain yeah exactly and uh and also just grift is a feature of any new technology right even PayPal you know uh gri grift was a big problem they had to solve for in the beginning Honestly though I I I don't think yeah yeah that's I mean you should read zero to one it's a great great like book in general but there's some chapters in there on early PayPal and how the fraudsters were just all over it I think that um honestly I don't I still don't think that Meme coins are gried I think people should go into these you know you can call them Investments but go into these trades with their eyes wide open how on Earth you know there's no SEC registration required to launch a shitcoin trump Libra like these things are all shitcoins why why would you ever feel grifted if you bought the highs on whiff and it just went straight down because the guys on Twitter who were saying it was going to be on this because I mean look that that was you know you were you were lied to you were told that the dog would go on the sphere and the dog did not go on the sphere you were lied to by anons on X you weren't lied to by like the CFO of a publicly traded company who has like actual fiduciary obligations to you you know what what am I missing it's it's not really griffed it's like you're at the casino you you double down on uh like like you're at the blackjack table you've got 19 you're supposed to stay you double down you go bust and then you complain that you got grifted by the dealer and the dealer probably is going to look at you like you're an extraterrestrial right that's sort of how these meme coins go like you're you're buying Trump tokens at70 billion hoping for what 700 billion do are you hoping for trumpcoin to subsume the global economy no right it's I mean I don't know man to me it just I don't I I think it's unfair to call these things grift it's just they're they are what they are you know yeah I I I I do I do think that mem coins are going to evolve over time I mean you can kind of right now obviously mcoins do nothing uh I think I think in the future people are going to try to tie some level of value to these meme coins um and one thing that I'm really excited for uh for us specifically is is kind of taking this THX token that we built and actually turning it into like our own personal Creator I think I think the the the term is like a Creator coin I like that too it becomes a way to track our careers and our success in addition to also being an awesome AI agent um you know you can start of bundle up all of these sources of values in in a coin and it's super valuable to us as well just because we have the community that's built around it that's engaged with us like that chat pop stuff uh that thex chat go check it out it's it's fil it's filled with like pretty pretty high quality people also our coin is trading at $3 million it's not trading at $70 billion so in terms just your risk reward equation is entirely different yeah that's true I we should probably stop Shilling our coin yeah another thing about our coin we've said a thousand times do not buy this thing with any expectation of profit this is a science experiment there's no there's no misconceptions here definitely don't buy this coin if you want to make money it it's not for you if that's if that's what you're all about stay away stay away if you want to make money yeah but but I think I think like the the broader point I mean whether you buy it or not it doesn't doesn't really matter um I apologize we we I apologize for that little sh Fest I was really really the point that I was trying to make is that I think more stuff like that is going to start coming out and we we had a little bit of it in 20 in 2021 but I don't think the tooling was there to really make it good and today it's so much easier to create a coin and and you know tie it to your activities and create a community around that coin I think that this that's that's kind of inevitable we had you know like we had the friend Tech we had the bitcloud I mean these things didn't didn't really work and I think it it was because it was too commoditized um and you you like you had to be on a specific platform in order for the value to be assigned to you and what's changed is that now because you can you can launch a coin kind of anywhere you you're not tied into providing value on a specific platform and you you don't need to create new Behavior right you you don't need to switch your uh you know habits in order to in order to have a coin have value I think that's that that's coming and that that's actually going to be a really interesting area and I'm trying to invest it right now that is a really interesting point you bring up about being locked into a certain platform or ecosystem in order to have a social token out there that's tradable and liquid and I never thought about it that way until you brought it up just now but it is kind of a great take that you know let's say let's take it to the extreme let's say that like meta um create allows they would never do this but let's say that meta announced they were going to allow anybody on any of their family of applications to launch a decentralized social token that's not locked into that application that can be bought and sold on binance or on chain transferred from any jurisdiction to any other jurisdiction and even if meta were to go bankrupt and WhatsApp Facebook and Instagram all die and go away that token is still live liquid and trading and you could Lo link that token to the number of likes that you get on your post posts the number of uh followers that you have on you know some particular platform like I think that would blow up I think people would love it I think you know there is there is a desire out there for you know fans and creators to be linked via tokens and it just hasn't it's been the process has been too clunky the user experience like many things in crypto has been too flawed so you know if you think of any good ways to invest in that maybe that's an area that we should be looking at where we can get some early stage bags uh rather than you know you know buying buying the the fastest horse in a leading category with a multi-billion dollar valuation and watching it trade down 90% on absolute Vapor so yeah maybe that's the the takeaway from this whole AI um Parabola that we just witnessed but to be fair I do expect AI to recover I still think AI Mania is coming it just the iteration will be possibly different than than the iteration that just traded up and down what's what's awesome have you used deep research yet yeah yeah I'm a subscriber I love it I'm using it to learn about a business I want to launch out here in California it's it's insanely good I mean like truly truly truly amazing I was trying to figure out how to invest most efficiently in the Chinese stock market and I mean obviously there there are like some pretty simple ETFs that you can allocate to but I wanted a broad view of the market like the driver is and it's like the top companies and the top the top industries and their you know collect their revenues and their balance sheets and put it all in one place and I asked chat gbt to do it and it did in eight minutes and it produced a comprehensive report that I would have like expected to get from a bank obviously McKenzie yeah like yeah or like McKenzie in in in eight minutes it was it was insane what what's so great about sorry go ahead I didn't mean to interrupt you I was going to say and this is coming to crypto one of the issues is data available ility and you know like where where is it going to be sourcing sourcing the data from but this is coming to crypto it's kind of what we're working on yeah we're basically building deep research light for crypto trading and hopefully other forms of trading too I I I am super by the way our Dev is about to ship a new update to our product which is going to be a little bit more basically allow the the bot to have more context on what comes in and out and decide what's most relevant and pick and choose and provide summaries of you know Market activity and podcast be a little bit better with correlations and consistency of Market views so I'm excited about that but back to deep research I think I think that the overall deep research meta is good for crypto Traders like you and me and like our listeners anybody listening out there this is good for you and I'll tell you exactly why um the pendulum is shifting from sort of like anal analy ERS to doers right when I was when I was sort of like you know 20 years ago when I was in college um the like the hottest careers were like working at McKenzie and Bane and BCG and like thinking for other people who would do because the doers were considered kind of like functionaries and the thinkers were you know the academicians were kind of like the the big brains the people that had the big vision and they were rare now um anybody can kind of develop a really elaborate well researched well-informed Vision with eight minutes of comp you know computation on open ai's platform and anybody who's out there in the trenches experimenting with stuff like crypto Traders by definition are right like you're you know if you're listening to this podcast you're a risk taker you're trying to you're trying to better yourself and your situation by taking risk and and doing your own thing rather than just like you know be becoming a a wage earner as your goal um this whole Trend benefits you this whole Trend commoditized the analysis paralysis that so many you know let's call them thought middlen have profited from for decades now and it just serves it up to you on a silver platter so you know whereas it used to be difficult for Traders like you and me to to get smart on fundamentals now it's extremely easy and so the role of the fundamental analyst is becoming commoditized across across all Industries not just trading and deep research isn't perfect uh it you know in in my experience as I'm doing research for my own personal investing and entrepreneurial activity it kind of like I noticed that it hallucinates sometimes uh in pretty significant ways so you do you can't just take it all at face value uh much like you can't take advice on a trading podcast at at face value none of this is financial advice but like um it does synthesize the fire hose of information out there much more efficiently than you know than anything that's been seen in human history before it I think the the the the hallucination part is just is a bit overblown not because it doesn't happen and absolutely does happen but because when when I mean in the past you just have to look at multiple sources and cross reference and double check anyway right I mean you could never take one source as as a as a as a Bible of Truth in the first place so obviously you should be double-checking numbers right and making making sure things are true the real benefit is having it all collected and put in one place so efficiently and so cleanly and so quickly with a reasonably high accuracy rate right it's not 100% but that that that that that's okay for now I'm I don't know I'm I'm I'm super excited to start I haven't really started using it in crypto yet I'm I'm pretty psyched to start because I mean look the this this world becomes more competitive every single day and you need you need to stay on top of these tools if you want to remain competitive yeah I mean you don't need to have deep research do anything for you if you just want to hold on for dear life and and have Bitcoin in your portfolio but I think if you want to understand the inner workings of these chains and which which you know try to like forecast which Tech might take off and why it it would help um yeah I you know I guess speaking of which going back to l1's I really no amount of research is going to convince me that we need more than a couple l1s at this point um I like I wanted to talk to you about this like I you know I know our our our friends at Empire Santiago just launched a basically an L1 for his private Equity Fund um I I know that other you know hyper liquid launched their own L1 instead of doing everything on salana which they probably could have do you think we're going to enter a world of app chains like what Cosmos forecasted way back when where every chain or every application has its own L1 or do you think we're going to end up in a world with like a couple of big l1s and and the rest is just useless I mean I mean the the option thing is nonsense J I feel like we've we've we've discussed this it just it nobody has solved the issue of seamless integration right there there is no seamless integration between op Chains No and for some reason nobody has solve that yet and maybe one day if it if it gets solved it can take off but I mean I think what okay one thing that you don't hear anything about these days you you just do not hear anything about it is decentralization in 2020 2021 I mean back in 2017 this is what all anybody could talk about every project had like what's so interesting actually now that I think about it is what people used to get mad about and what they get mad about today so people used to get mad about is when projects were not sufficiently decentralized what people get mad about today is whether or not the tokens are you know they're sufficiently given given to the community whe whether they're enough tokens given to the community right but nobody cares about decentralization anymore because at the end of the day is seamless this this is seamless Tech and it works and the ability to move value around is it's just so much easier with crypto regardless of whether it's decentralized or not nobody cares about decentralization anymore and the whole app chain thesis I think is built around decentralization because it's a way to scale effectively while still being plausibly decentralized when you have a a high throughput chain uh like salana the big attacks on it were that it wasn't officially decentralized those attacks are gone nobody attacks chains for not being sufficiently decentralized anymore I mean otherwise they would attack hyper liquid which does not decentralized at all in any meaningful way um Nobody Does that right and so I think that because we've lost that that as like a guiding star in crypto which I don't necessarily think is a bad thing I think that there was probably too much emphasis placed on decentralization back then relative to just the fact that the tech was better um because the back then crypto was staffed exclusively by Libertarians today it's not so I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing but it also destroys the app chain thesis and makes me super bullish on high throughput l1s all high throughput l1s or just like a couple of them because there are a bunch now yeah I mean High High throughput l1's relative to apin I mean like you can I see what you mean right like you can you can Cosmos is Cosmos is done I mean nobody talks about it polka Dot's done um like I think the l2s are done like I think arbitr and optimism are done personally like I would short a basket of those versus long a basket of high throughput l1s actually like even you know Aptos Aptos is up 15% today you see you know why optos is up 15% today because of that reply guy that's hilarious it's so funny it's so funny it's so funny just some random dude commenting on every looking good here looking good here it's actually going up I mean by the way having built a reply guy uh with with our bot it's pretty hard to do that like either this guy is just sitting there like like just taking Celsius to the face all day and all night never sleeping and just manually replying to everything or he's paying Twitter like a decent chunk of money like he's paying Twitter probably thousands of dollars a month to having have the bot reply to literally every single account every single post apto is looking good here but yeah I guess getting back to the main point um I think an app chain in of itself is not decentralized it's obviously run by the team that manages the application so each app chain isn't that decentralized a constallation of app chains is in theory decentralized but interoperability hasn't been solved like you said so I don't think we're going that route I think that people don't care anymore about decentralization because there haven't been any major chain rugs I think that once you know you start to put a lot of financial infrastructure and a lot of tvl onto a chain then decentralization matters because nobody nobody wants to trust a bunch of uh you know hundreds of billions of dollars worth of assets so when you're just [ __ ] around on hyper liquid in theory you don't you know you don't care if the hyper liquid team controls the chain but if you're like you know an Institutional player you're probably not going to stake you know LP capital in any kind of size on a chain that's centralized uh that that's my take yeah I mean it yeah I I think I think I think that's I think that's a re reasonable take I but I also do think that you know unless unless it's literally there's no plausible decentralization I mean you know like with with Hyper liquid you have you have a few you have a few validators right obviously they they they can collude um but you just kind of are betting that they won't and but that's plausible enough to get people comfortable with it right people will be comfortable with it until until they get rugged right so basically my my theory on decentralization is that no one will care for a while as you know more and more of the world moves onto you know on chain which I still think is going to happen so very bullish this space uh and then I think once a lot of the world is on chain and the rugs start to happen for you know as you discuss used the hundred people in the room how many of them would how many of them would do something scammy test uh earlier in the podcast like I'm sure as more value goes on chain that threshold will be reached where you know closed centralized ecosystems will face an increasing D cacophony of uh of voices in the room hollering to to rug the project and walk away with you know hundreds of millions of dollars in a nice Villa in AA like I think it's going to happen right so as more of the world moves on chain these rugs will occur on centralized ecosystems and then decentralization will become a topic but you know not until that point so let the buyer bew basically I I mean be kind of fun to have a to have one of these trains blow up yeah' be an interesting good trading opportunity I guess Rune kind of blew up Rune blew up we haven't had a good chain blow up since uh since Luna you know yeah we need I think we're overdue all right Jonah I think we we'll leave it at that I'll look forward to the to the next chain blow up and the next podcast with you yeah talk about it then until that point stay sane out there everybody none of this is financial advice uh hang hang tough The Vibes are bad but the future is bright good talking to you Obi adios [Music]

Transcript Text:
I guess if some alts have bottomed out or they're starting to Rally even now despite this like dire [ __ ] sentiment then we could see some pretty explosive price action there's no way the cycle is is going to be over if we're Bas if bitcoin's on the highs or basically close to the highs all-time highs and sentiment is this bad no Cycles end when you run out of buyers not when you have a bunch of like depressed uh people who are like on the sidelines no way going to keep running this episode is brought to you by Kraken OTC get access to 247 trading services for high net worth individuals and institutional clients to execute orders over $100,000 you'll hear more about them later in the [Music] show welcome back to another THX podcast we are coming live to you I guess not live because you're listening to this but Jan and I are live podcasting together talking about the markets what's kind of nuts Jonah is that until today so Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday if you turn on the candle sticks on bitcoin just pull up the chart we literally closed within a $100 band every day they're wicks for sure but it's kind of insane I mean like the the close was 96564 on Thursday 96537 Friday 96476 on Saturday and 96 475 on Sunday I mean Bitcoin literally did not move at all like it it did get up on Friday it got up to 100K and then came back down but like if you're just checking in once a day this thing didn't move uh what is bullish I'll say is that we're holding we're holding the 200 day moving average so that's nice um sorry the the 100 day moving average that so that that's good uh and there do seem to be a lot of bids stacked lower but they're also a bunch of asks stacked higher I mean we're kind of in no man's land right now so what what are you thinking Jonah yeah it's it's interesting you bring this up eight if you just set your your candlesticks to daily um yeah we've got eight candles that cross through the current price eight consecutive candles which is pretty nuts and uh if you go back to the first time we breached this price level which would have been November 21st of last year there are dozens more candles like we've been locked in this range for you know almost three months and what's weird is like I think you tweeted this Obby you said that rarely do markets like just sort of plat Tow and consolidate into an equilibrium range on the highs that's what's happening and I guess what crypto Twitter and everybody who cares about trading this asset is trying to figure out trying to ascertain is like should we despair is this it or are we going much much higher and the question is really consequential because I think if we trade back down uh like we've traded down in previous bull markets which would be like a 30 40 50% pullback or Worse um you know you're going to see a lot of people blow up you're going to see a lot of people lose everything even this move from 108 down to 92 took out billions of dollars worth of of value people got liquidated so to me like these are Big questions that we need to answer I air in the bull camp and I but I think we should spend some time debating the sentiment in the market and whether it's bullish or bearish at you know right back at shuve what like do you think that the current do you think that the current sort of like apathy and you know lack of enthusiasm to spare anger at the the overall meta in crypto being kind of like too casinoyoutube right before the next leg higher what do you think all very good questions and I want to start by Framing it a bit differently because I think for the longest time the way that we've talked about the market is we talk about it in terms of Upp or down and while we've said in the past that there's going to be a lot of dispersion and there has been like our framing kind of Remains the Same like are we going up or are we going down and I think we have to start talking about assets by asset whether it's going up or going down because the world I mean we're just in such we're in a very different place today where Bitcoin can be basically at the highs and everything else is trash except for a few assets here and there I mean just looking at the market it's like okay well Bitcoin is off like you know from from its highs 10 10ish percent you're average alt is down 50 to 90% from the highs I mean that that's also a huge range by itself and then you have random assets like LTC which are also only down 10% from the highs you know 15% from the highs and that's because they're catalysts for for LTC like the like the ETF you have things like optimism and arbitrum which are at their 2023 lows right now you have something like worldcoin which is basically making new lows uh and then you have something like a which has performed extremely well since the 23 lows up you know 45x yeah five 5x from the from the from the 23 lows but off you know 40% from the highs and so the world is just a very different place today where you can't just talk about up or down you have to talk about you know we should specify exactly what assets we're talking about when we say are we [ __ ] because when you say you know are we [ __ ] is sentiment bad it's like for Bitcoin holders I don't think sentiment is bad at all for people that hold eth I think they're ready to jump out the [ __ ] window does anyone still hold eth it's not trading like people are hanging on to their eth I'm even getting I'm getting calls from like old friends that I onboarded to crypto back in like 2019 like hey man are you still long eth what should I do with this crap you know it's it's crazy yeah I mean I think a lot of people are chipping out I I I think that there's still a lot of that hold over from uninformed Market participants that bought Bitcoin and ethereum a long time ago and they've seen their crypto portfolio do well and maybe they're not checking that close and they see eth maybe maybe they've made a little bit on eth but they don't realize like how poorly it's done in general uh I think a lot of those people are slowly getting out I mean you had that realization I think I bothered you so much about getting rid of all of your eth that you finally did it a while ago so I think you were one of the early guys to get out of that ratio I think you you I mean when you got out like since since the time I was I've been badgering you to get out which is like early last year it's down 50% against BTC yeah you you saved me a lot of money and it wasn't like we had some sort of back room conversation I got out and then we podcasted about it it was like you were convin you convinced me slowly over the course of like six podcasts last year that I should do it and then I just pitched out of it eventually like you literally sold me on on a public in a public forum so hopefully everybody listening listened to you too uh that was crazy so thank you for that so let me let me just reframe the question then given the you know your suggestion let's talk about Bitcoin and not Bitcoin let's start with Bitcoin sentiment is sentiment is bad for Bitcoin too right now like people are not bull posting Bitcoin people are like uh Cycle's over like I Highs are in you have some prominent accounts with like hundreds of thousands of followers saying like if you buy Bitcoin here you're going to regret it in two or three months um like what do you think then I'll tell you what I think I tweeted like you said I tweeted that it's very rare for for an asset to go for for Bitcoin specifically after a parabolic rise to go sideways for a long period of time and have that be bullish I don't I don't think I agree with what I said anymore I should probably issue a retraction uh to to that to that statement because Bitcoin has actually held up better than than I expected on the sell-offs I mean there there seems to be at least a substantial amount of demand for BTC even at this 95k level which has been tested like I thought that the next time we hit those levels we would we would go lower and we haven't I mean it's not like we're up a ton since then up like two and a half percent but you know bitcoin's been performing a lot better than I thought one of the biggest arguments that people make for Bitcoin having topped here is that there's no more good news coming out for Bitcoin and that Michael sailor is running out of ammo to buy to buy BTC and that's the only thing that's been keeping us up one interesting thing happened this morning which was that Michael sailor announced that he was buying that he bought Bitcoin at around these price levels and that he was allocating to the market and Bitcoin didn't sell off a ton normally what happens is that after sailor comes out with an announcement like that Bitcoin will sell off because people will go okay well I guess that's what was keeping us up so we should get out of Bitcoin that's clearly that that that didn't happen and so I think sailor impact on the market might be lessening over time as Bitcoin becomes bigger I mean we're still getting good ETF influence for BTC yes there's no immediate good news left for Bitcoin but I don't know if I should discount the fact that the president of the United States has void support so often for this thing that it's changed investor Behavior with respect to bitcoin where people are now allocating to it in the same way that they're allocating to the stock market right which is that every month they get a paycheck and some of that goes into their 401k and then they they buy the S&P and they buy the NASDAQ I mean some of that's now clearly happening with Bitcoin and so it's possible that you know when I said it's rare rare it basically never happens for something to go sideways for a long time at the highs and then continue higher it's possible that this time genu genuinely is different yeah I think so too I mean you know I'm I'm I'm of the mindset that now any buy Below 95k on BTC is probably a very good buy I I think so too this episode is sponsored by Kraken OTC you can trade over over chat or even access kraken's self-service automated trading feature to receive executable quotes in seconds with access

Ledger stacks and The Ledger Flex featuring the world's first secure touch screens take your security seriously hit the link in the show notes of today's episode to check out their latest devices trust me you won't regret it I don't buy the whole there's no good news coming thing so before we move on to non-bitcoin let me just give you my response and my two cents on on bitcoin and touch on what you just said so let's start with the Michael sailor holding up the market argument Michael sailor's not holding up the market what's holding up the market is those ETF flows that you you alluded to at the end and those are only going to accelerate over time yeah there may not be a headline that says like investors now put 2% of their portfolio in Bitcoin used to be zero right that's not going to like hit the front page of the New York Times and so the the Catalyst Hunters out there will probably be disappointed but this is just steady inflows so first let's talk about Michael sailor and then let's talk about the ETFs every Market that I've ever been in there's always been a whale that other participants refer to and assign uh assign responsibility to when there's a big move big inflow a big outflow and when you're on the outside when you're not working at that you know inside of that whale you don't know you don't know who the whale is right like so right now everybody thinks the whale is Michael sailor everybody's like all right it's sailor buying oh my God he's gonna stop the Market's gonna nuke I guarantee you that Michael sailor is not the one holding up Bitcoin and I bet Michael sailor is just sitting there watching all these people speculating about what he's doing and assigning every big move to him and probably kind of like chuckling a little bit and the reason why I think that is because I have worked inside of two giant whales when I was it Goldman we were the whales of the oil Market every time any massive trade went through the floor the entire Market was like oh it's Goldman buying oh Goldman selling this option and nine times out of 10 we weren't doing it and we'd be like laughing like oh wow the whole Market thinks it's us because yeah we were [ __ ] huge but we weren't we weren't even remotely as big as the market thought we were then when I worked at Vall it was the same thing there'd be like some massive you know physical trade that would take place between two sovereigns and there would be this you know shadowy trading house house intermediary or there would be like a huge like a deal that would go through into in you know gasoline or fuel oil that would be like way way way too big for anybody else people would assume it was us i' go over and ask the guys like nope not us you know sometimes you know you do you do a couple big deals and people think you're doing every big deal kind of like how people think uh you know everything that GCR says is right and he's probably you know laughing to himself about all the mistakes he's made too so these Larger than Life characters in the market are are in my experience much less relevant than you'd think and so I do I I I reject the fact that Bitcoin is being hoisted on Michael sailor's shoulders the way that Atlas lifted the globe in in you know Greek mythology it's just not [ __ ] happening no way SEC what is holding up the market is these ETF flows so if you go to the farside investors dashboard fars side. co.uk BTC and you look at the actual ETF flows you have a pretty decent breakdown of all the different issuers and where the flows are coming from what strikes me is the mo like what when I look at that page every day what what strikes me is the most interesting is that I bit black the black rock ETF which is definitely where like you know your random 26y old guy is putting 2% of his monthly paycheck right or 10% or whatever like the the you know the non dgen types who are just like attempting to keep a little bit of a a toe in the Bitcoin Pond right that's up like that's just inflows every single fraking day where the outflows have come from are it's it's Fidelity it's fbtc so to me that that ETF is kind of a niche ETF it's the second biggest and it's possible that somebody who bought a lot of fidelity like one big Institutional Investor who bought a lot of that ETF when it was first issued last year is taking some profits now but like that those are lumpy outflows there'll be like multiple days of zero and then like 177 million gets sold another few days of zero 287 million get sold so like to me the the picture being painted here is we're going to see steady inflows for a long time from ibit uh and the fbtc outflows can't continue it's it's just it's like one or two guys that are doing that in fbtc and every other ETF is kind of like a a nothing Burger so it's not about the news or the Catalyst it's about the flows you have less minor selling because of the having daily ibit inflows which seem to be accelerating and that's enough like I don't think that this cycle will be the same as previous Cycles where you have like a despair on the lows Euphoria on the highs it all fits neatly into a four-year window of time and then you kind of revert back to the middle of that and the upward Mega trend is intact I think this cycle is going to be different I think we're just sort of like two years into a 10-year uh upward upward grind for Bitcoin and you know what would scare me is if I started seeing daily outflows from ibit instead of daily inflows yeah I think that you're spot on and that Dynamic is really important especially on weeks like today where everyone's a bit nervous you know Shifting the discussion to the alt Market everybody's very nervous about alts and the reason is because they've underperformed I mean tremendously since Bitcoin sold off from from the highs now in this market environment over the last two weeks what we've seen is we've seen that headlines are driving a ridiculous amount of price action I mean basically every two days if not every day something comes out about something Trump is doing that is causing the markets to gyate and I think that's led to people assuming that we need some sort of positive headline in order for the market to start going up again because they're so used to the market gting on these on these headlines now what I the point I'm trying to make is that it's exactly as you said sometimes it's just about flows and it's not necessarily about news despite the fact that there's no good news quote unquote left for the market if everyone is done selling because everyone has been so thoroughly panicked out by these headlines then that means that the market can start to recover and go up again and that we've already exhausted all the selling I mean think about this okay we had a massive alt nuke in which a lot of people got liquidated a lot of people got washed out and then we had after that in the next four days a retracement where I think from the high to the low you know thing you know like something like a went down another like it it bounced and then it came down 20% so a lot of sellers on that and I think at this point you know Bitcoin goes sideways for a long time tariff news comes out we've got CPI coming up on Wednesday it seems to me that for the good assets that are fully unlocked that includes Bitcoin in this that the sellers are kind of done like they're they they might they might be out at least for now and and I think that assets tend to bottom not When Buyers show up assets tend to bottom when selling stops right and it's actually the opposite uh for for the upside assets tend to bottom when or assets T to top when there's just nobody left to buy right and so the question is like who is left to sell right like who is who is selling at these at these levels and my answer for some assets like okay let's let's look World coin and apos uh the answer is the team they're going to be selling a lot and they're constant Sellers and they seem to never run out of tokens and so maybe you don't want to go buy those things but for things that are fully unlocked and that have actually potential catalysts coming up so a has a fee switch and then I have my little favorite basket of LTC soul xrp and Doge so I call it my my ETF like my my high probability ETF basket it's like okay well I I don't know if there that many sellers left for these things given that we have potential ETF coming up so I mean th those are at least my high conviction trades right now um and the way that I'm thinking about it is who's left to sell at these prices after after they after they've come down at time that's a great way to to think about it so I mean I would have phrased it differently I would have said like oh the news is Priced Right like more bad news isn't setting the market lower but I think your phrasing is more elegant which is like have the sellers been exhausted for you know a given token yes or no and for many tokens I do think the selling the sellers have been exhausted they've either been liquidated or they just don't want to sell at current prices because the project is too promising um for others like here's another actionable uh item if if if you're looking at a meme coin or something that's kind of traded more onchain uh just go to deck screener for your you know pull up your token inex screener and look at the liquidity number also look at the you know fdv number so if there's like if the fdv is like a 100 million and there's like five grand for worth worth of liquidity in there you know that the next person who sells that thing is going to knock the price down a lot right because basically there's not a lot of of dough left in the pool to to to bid the asset um you know maybe maybe what I should do I've been a bit lazy about this maybe may I should like just try to figure out a way to automate an a liquidity to FTV ratio and then pull up a screener of like all the different crypto assets on Dex screener and just see like where is that ratio the the lowest right where is there like where's the least amount of liquidity relative to market cap and then you know those are probably good shorts right those those are tokens that could probably get absolutely annihilated in the next down move or even if nothing happens and people just slowly start to to throw in the towel on these tokens like um I continue to like being short whiff and suie um you know you talked me into a small sui short I talked myself into a large whiff short I think these tokens just continue to go down um because you know even though you can't see it quite as cleanly because these tokens are traded mostly offchain now um you kind of feel that there's a lot of selling left relative to the the the buying powder out there liquidity out there so I think there's I think there's a real opportunity to remain short vaporware projects or projects that are just valued you know I'm not calling sui a vaporware project I think whiff is a vaporware project it's probably got some crime fi uh Rumblings attached to it SOI still too expensive for the number of users it has and I think the theme of this this conversation is dispersion Obi like there there are good projects at good prices you should be long those there are good projects like suie at overvalued prices you should be short those Bitcoin is a good project at a good price Su is a good project at a bad price whiff is a bad project at a bad price like you have your spectrum there um like and don't invest in bad projects regardless of the price so uh that's maybe maybe you just sort of like put it into quadrants like that good project bad project good price bad price and the herur istic you attach for price is like liquidity to FTV ratio on Deck screener yeah that that's great that's great for onchain for onchain alts I mean just like going going down the list of of tokens it's like nothing is you know nothing nothing outside of AI and then the ETF flow tokens are particularly compelling to me uh I think that onchain re requires in order for onchain to come back I think we we require a little bit more Euphoria in the market I think that people need to feel safe safe to gamble again I mean that being said a a lot of what's going on right now are people chasing tweets so like this Dave pornoy thing going to two two 200 mil people are still aping when there when there's a reason to ape or when they can at least construct in their mind a reason to ape but outside of that think a lot of people are on the sidelines because they're they're very scared I mean just surveying you know my analysts and a lot of people that I talk to nobody really wants to touch altcoins right now which could actually be a pretty good opportunity for the ones that you know have Catalyst coming up and that are still good and don't have found Foundation sales uh yeah I mean I think now is a good time especially you know as as the Market's going sideways to just look through what is upcoming and then make bets on make bets on what's what's upcoming other than that I mean really CPI is the big is the big thing here because for alt to do well in a sustained manner like across the board like if you're looking for hey when do we get a big mean reversion across the entire alt space what people like to call alt season uh I I I think you need and you need the FED to be comfortable cutting because you need easy money to come back into the system and so I think for alt CPI is really important I genuinely think for Bitcoin it just doesn't matter like this thing is probably going to end up higher in two months regardless of what happens in the market just because of the change the change in in Dynamics and again that doesn't mean that we're going to get SS going up and I think a lot of people have degross a lot of the funds that I talk to a lot of the traders that I talk to they're just super super super super heavy in cash I'm sort of waiting for that moment that gives them the go-ahead to buy which makes me think the upside is a lot more asymmetric than the downside at

I cannot I've never had success trying to catch a falling knife in crypto I've tried too many times and I've always failed um usually what what what about a what about a sideways knife you know easier to easier to pick up a sideways knife you know the the the knife's already fallen it's just nobody's picked it back up yeah it's just lying on the table it's just yeah it's just it's just there knife just just sitting there yeah okay my I guess my point was like for some Al coins are just steadily spiraling to zero again like Whi or or you know with like charts and I I've never I've tried to buy many of those charts in my in my career as a crypto Trader and a retail Trader and I've just always failed it doesn't [ __ ] work I think that yeah sure if you're like all over the Catalyst maybe you can you can get ahead of one of them and and buy something that's going down right before it reverses and you pick the bottom but the odds of doing that are so bad that or so thin that maybe it's better to like wait till it Plateau or you know bottoms out and then you buy and usually what I do is I don't even buy it when it when it's bottomed out I try to buy it once it's starting to Rally like I try to have an itchier trigger finger than the hedge funds you refer to and get in ahead of them so like I try to I try to catch the U u-shaped recovery while it still looks like a like a j you know like before you get this the big up move and so I'm I'm not I hadn't really thought about buying the ones that have just bottomed out and are going sideways but I take your point on that I mean just to talk about alt for a second and then we'll get on to macro and CPI you know there's this guy on Twitter root Tui who wrote one thing I hate about this cycle is That No One Believes In anything I feel that even most Founders don't believe in their own tokens last cycle you had Founders in the Forefront incentivizing the community to buy hold and believe with uh a positive feedback loop basically I you know then this tweet goes on basically I kind kind of this is the meta right now everybody's just super disenchanted because Casino style meme coin gambling on farts is not what you know smart contracts were supposed to be about and so there's there's like really bad sentiment and pain and anguish out there about the alt market like I don't think that's bearish I think that what that means is that people are going to get complacent that crypto is just a shitcoin casino and they're going to sleep on the next big the next big up move in alss which I think won't necessarily like I think I think low inflation sets the stage for it but I think the stable coin bill that David saaks said will get you know pass in the next three months I think that will set the stage for the legitim legitimization of like let's call it smart contract crypto non non Casino crypto uh in a way that we haven't seen before I think it'll just like lay down foundations that can get where all sorts of exciting projects can build again on top of those found and so I think that yeah I guess if some alts have bottomed out or they're starting to Rally even now despite this like dire [ __ ] sentiment then then we we could see some pretty explosive price action and then just moving on to the macro uh backdrop I've been following some you know just the macro people that I talk to as well as some you know decently interesting uh accounts on Twitter that tend to get it right there is some talk that bessent is trying to convince Donald Trump to change his metric of success from what it currently is Which is higher stock market to lower 10-year yield basically saying like I want the US to be able to borrow more cheaply higher stock market like it soared under Biden but Americans still suffered you know Trump's a populous president he's trying to appeal to Main Street not Wall Street so monitor that one closely like if Trump shifts the goalposts from higher stock market to higher bond prices lower bond yields get out of everything like get out of the way of that great train you could get ironed out by that I think I'd put the odds that at like 15% um to me that's the most important thing to look at and like you said Bitcoin has kind of graduated it'll probably perform pretty well regardless of what happens but for altcoins oh man if the stock market is no longer his his Focus he used he used to tweet record high stock market the Trump bump know Trump if he stops caring about that and starts just like focusing on our borrowing costs and you know balancing the budget like oh my God it's going to be Carnage out there for for stocks and even worse for crypto do you still buy the argument that it net like Trump is good for risk yeah I can sum it up in a very short non rant way if you want and then pass the ball back to you um yeah go ahead Trump is good for risk for several reasons reason number one is deregulation that is bullish you know equities and crypto regulation stifled equities and crypto especially crypto under Biden um uh cutting out wasteful government spending if if the doge is actually successful at that uh that's going to be massive ly bullish for productivity right so that's that's also bullish for risk assets um number three I don't think any of the uh things that Trump is jawboning about which are bearish risk like you know huge like detrimental trade Wars like pain causing you know like basically basically the type of trade war that nukes economies I think it's posturing I I I think that he's just like coming in with a hard negotiating stance so that he can Leverage for something that's better for American companies which is bullish American companies and crypto is highly correlated with American technology companies um the fourth reason is uh his administration has taken a very uh Pro business stance on crypto and AI which like if you're trying to promote AI in America uh uh as and you're not trying to like over reggulator with crypto um you know don't need to get into the reasons why but like it's kind of obvious that if you just like shower Nvidia Google Facebook um Microsoft all these companies with uh with like a golden path to deploying AI at scale globally and no no roadblocks like that's bullish those companies and those companies are like 60% correlated with Bitcoin stock prices are so all of that I think is like I think all of that is is pretty damn bullish um yeah I don't I don't am I missing something no I think that the only argument against it is that he's so unpredictable and will continue to be unpredictable and the markets hate uncertainty and we don't like we just don't know what he's going to come up with I mean I'll give you an example of a scenario that could end up really bad uh Doge continues to fire people left and right and Sh does in fact shrink the size of the government substantially and those people don't enter back into the workforce and suddenly you're looking at rising Rising unemployment now you could make an argument okay well then the FED fed has to start cutting but I I don't think that the initial reaction to that would be okay wow this is great economy's doing well you know up up up we go I think Market Market would get a little bit nervous about that uh nervous about that fact yeah I don't know how I feel about that like if if the government just like Mass fires millions of people and they're all out on their asses and they can't get jobs um labor force participation tanks how is that bearish asset prices like the assets that I don't know like to me I guess they're they're just the yeah the the idea would be that that the these PE one consump have to spark a recession it would have to it would have to catalyze a recession like it would basically have to take a chunk that that red the reduction in consumer spending would have to take such a chunk out of the economy um as these people like retrace into their you know into a lower uh cost of life that the the economy goes into like a little mini recession and then I think rates go to zero and then I think it's Off to the Races again so like you said maybe that's a dip to buy yeah I think that I think that's fair I think it yes it would 100% have to catalyze a recession um which isn't out of the picture but I do like as as I'm making the argument with you I kind of buy it a little bit less yeah for crypto uh one thing that's kind of nice is that no nobody seems to be calling for alt season right now even though Al are bouncing which alts you looking at Obi which is um I kind yeah I kind of talked about him but Litecoin Solana xrp uh Doge what else y I like the AI coins AI 16z is up 15 16% today like that's a sneaky little Face Ripper Litecoin up 11% uh fart coin up 33% like some of the crap is really bouncing I'm like I'm like really debating whether I should be adding to virtuals here I think the answer has to be yes virtuals held in like that was a crazy like I they're I don't know I like virtuals yeah I I like I like the idea of oh TOA has catalysts coming up daow um daow I think hype remains solid and then Pendle is having a lot of upgrades soon so just I I I have them written down here boros tokenizing any form of yield starting out with funding rates so they're tokenizing funding rates uh they're launching permissionless yield pools they [Music] are non-m expansion to salonon and Hyper liquid and vaults for institutional access not bad you know what else is um just jackn knifing higher is Venice uh the hell yeah I wouldn't have expected that but like we're it's literally it's literally almost the low tick was 236 and now it's trading 853 like that's we're approaching a 4xr here um in the last weak so there's some there's some like some green shoots here it's it's a little sneaky um yeah back to the recession thing for a second here's my take the idea of like the government firing a bunch of people and that causing a recession with with interest rates currently at 4% that doesn't compute for me like that's so foreseeable and the FED has so many tools at its disposal to mitigate that that it's just not going to happen like to me the idea of like if you can think of something that would cause a recession that looks at all similar to any of the recessions that have been caused in the last 25 years or 50 years that recession is not going to happen the FED is aware of it they're monitoring it and the tools you know it's not like interest rates are at zero and qes at Max like the FED has plenty of tools left to to mitigate that particular type of very foreseeable recession it looks just like the one that the last one Co something happened a bunch of people lost their jobs and the FED like handled it like same thing would happen if you reduced a bunch of government jobs um to me a recession has to get caused by something out of left field that the government is just like totally unprepared for and I you know by definition I struggle to come up with those scenarios um but like maybe one potential example would be uh you know like a war in the Middle East metastasizes uh into a global energy crisis an oil crisis and the government hasn't bought back the spr that it sold during the Biden Administration you know to mitigate the Ukraine crisis like there you're you're missing slack in the system there so like if I'm just like really trying to think outside of the the realm of possibility you know that's something that could c a mini recession is an oil shock highly unlikely just you know again that's a you know use me using my imagination it would have to be something crazy so absent any of that if inflation continues to moderate and we get a decent CPI print maybe some of these AI coins will run maybe I should be looking at like a Venice token or a virtuals right now while while I'm sitting here since you bring it up maybe this is the like j-shaped recovery before the u-shaped recovery that I was alluding to maybe I should be aping here damn I think I I'm I'm starting to think we should be aping you know what's funny is I've gotten so much push back from so many people about being bullish uh you know just just I've been talking to people over the last call it three days about hey maybe now is the time to start being bullish I mean let's let's just think about this in terms of you know one one trick that I like to use to challenge my bias is I'm gonna think about a time that I was really long and what was I thinking then and how does it compare to today so like I was unfortunately pretty long in December um and then Bitcoin sort of you know I got I got long alts in beginning of December I think it was maybe mid December because Bitcoin went up to 1008 and I was like all right now's Now's the Time to get get long Al so I think that they're ready for a followup and then we just nuked straight down for like a week uh mean I obviously closed out of that but I if I was that long then how how can I not be that long now like either I made like a horrific mistake then which is possible and I mean obviously it was wrong but like was it a process mistake or am I making a huge mistake now right and I think the answer is if you know if you were bullish on your favorite assets at any point in the last month and now you're bearish on them I think you're probably making some sort of mistake because I don't think that much has changed you know I called a after the bounce I called for another flush on alt and we got it right like eth bounced from 2150 to almost 3K and that's I think I tweeted it around like 2900 eth I was like okay still still kind of bearish here that by the way that's when our agent started arguing with us or ar arguing with me the agent which is getting really good all of you guys should go check it out and we will be launching a terminal for it soon it started getting really good like good enough to argue with me over things and it was bullish and then from the time that me and the agent discussed our bullishness eth went down 133% so screw you agent it's still good because it's it's it's it's good it's good to have somebody that you can talk to that's smart but I was right a agent was wrong AI is not taken over anytime soon definitely not isn't it amazing how chat GPT just sucks for trading claw all of the perplexity like you can't talk to these chat Bots about trade um trading I think this is this is an opportunity for for our community I'm not talking about I'm not like trying to shill our token I'm just trying to say like if we could build a chatbot that acts as a debate partner for various trades I think it would be valuable I already use the agent for like a source of news but yeah once we get that terminal up in live shout out to our Dev who's fraking machine um actually it's dev's now so good so good um yeah I think we'll have a terminal shipped in a month or less like and then it's just going to we're going to plug in a bunch more sources like I want to be able to sit here trading is very lonely right trading crypto is very lonely you're not on a big trading floor where you can like go over and have lunch with people and do water cooler talk and hear noise when something's active oh the AI guys are screaming a lot let's let's talk to them about why there there's flow or you know volatility in their sector it's kind of lonely I guess you can just sit there refreshing Twitter all day but that's psychologically unhealthy might be nice to just like have more of a natural chat with Traders like a you and I are in tons of teleg Grom rooms chatting with each other and other people all the time about crypto anyway it' be nice to have like a bot with you know sort of like an 30,000 foot view of all the news and price action and sentiment and Technical indicators to talk to as well um and hopefully it'll be able to include some visuals in the responses as well uh like relevant charts so we're gonna have to do some Partnerships but I think I think there's something there I really do yeah yeah it's it's going to be let's put it's I think it's going to be a good month or so month or so here let's see let's see how it plays out I mean we can we can we can make that call now let's say we can check back we'll check back in next week I think BT BTC dominant is going to be down a lot of what people are nervous about I'm getting this message a lot is you know problem is we get one single Trump headline and boom we're down 20% but I think that's already baked into the positioning so if you look at the Tariff headline right they just they don't have the same impact anymore what matters as we've talked about on this pod is the second derivative of the news everyone fraking knows there's going to be tariffs everybody knows that the Tariff thing is happening like is basically we have to ask ourselves are the Tariff Wars going to escalate or deescalate from the current like perceived amount of tariff war and I don't think it's going to get worse from here I think it's going to get less bad which is probably and the market agrees which is why it's not nuking anymore on these headlines yeah that's fair but you know maybe you know maybe the argument is be patient because the market can be choppy right so like like be ready to step in on any small dips I mean this week specifically hopefully we get this out quick so that people can pay attention to this uh Trump signing executive orders today you listeners that's already happened by the time you hear this so won't really matter tariff updates at some point in the next coming days blah blah blah we know that that's probably not going to impact the market substantially that's been absorbed po Congressional testimony Tuesday Wednesday could cause involatility and then CPI Wednesday could cause involatility I think if there's a sell off with CPI I mean unless something is like really bad I mean no unless something is medium bad uh if it's really bad then that's good if it's medium bad then that's bad if it's good then that's bad or neutral probably um it's kind of just looking for that Medium bad scenario yeah I think uh like will will there be will there be a chance to buy you know a percent or two lower probably will there be a chance to buy 20% lower I don't know I don't know things are looking good the more that the more that I look at like I I progressively talked myself into being more bullish throughout this whole podcast it's kind of funny that's that's why I love that's why I love these things also it kind of looks like bar chain has bottomed oh by the way I an I'm an investor in bar chain everyone got very mad at me for not disclosing that despite the fact that I've talked about it hundreds of billions of times that I invested in Bear chain we had Smokey on the podcast we literally we we literally had Smokey on the podcast I've tweeted it I like I don't know how much more I can tell like do I have to every tweet that I mention I have to say I guess so like I mean that's what I'm going to do from now on like every tweet I'll just say by the way I hold positions in these assets I mean maybe I'm complain maybe I should just like maybe that should just be standard course like maybe I'm complaining for nothing but um yeah I thought that that reaction was really funny people got very upset with me over saying that hey bar chain actually like looks reasonable OB obvious templon you can't you can't [ __ ] on him he's having the he's feeling the pain with you guys I mean like I'm not gonna Pat myself on the back too much because it's all locked up but I could have sold staking I could have sold staking rewards I didn't you you could have sold perss I yeah could I could have sold perss I didn't I didn't yeah that's true fair yeah all good all good points Jonah all good points well thanks thanks thanks for backing me up here I I got you AI this has been a great podcast one thing I I I value about this is that it's like rare actual Market chat in a sea of just like online Twitter garbage I learn so maybe maybe I'm G to go and ape some stuff after we hang up the phone here this is I'm just sitting here ever since you talked about it I was like what alts are up I haven't even really noticed because I've just been too I've been too caught up in this uh Swoon on Twitter of of negativity and sadness you just there's no way the cycle is is going to be over if we're Bas if bitcoin's on the highs or basically close to the highs alltime highs and sentiment is this bad like no Cycles end when you run out of buyers not when you have a bunch of like depressed uh people who are like on the sidelines no way this thing's going to keep running yeah this was awesome Jonah thank you so much for spending your time with me let's get this one out immediately yeah for the boys we'll have the producers ship it quick and again as always none of this is financial advice we're just two guys we don't know what we're talking about all right see you man see you later [Music]

when the market refuses to go up on good news it's close to over if you remember there was news that the xrp and soul were getting CME Futures listed and they didn't go up that's like a very bad sign for the market it means that everyone's Max deployed and then the other uh point was after the you know Reserve came out Bitcoin didn't really go much higher like that when things like that happen you got to you got to say okay let me take a step back and reassess my portfolio and raise a little bit of cash because cash is more important right now than it was before this episode is brought to you by Kraken OTC get access to 247 trading services for high- net worth individuals and institutional clients to execute orders over $100,000 you'll hear more about them later in the [Music] show all right guys welcome back to another next podcast we are currently in the Situation Room reviewing the Carnage we have noticed that basically everything seems to have died except for Bitcoin literally I think this is the worst Carnage I've seen in the markets you know I mean since FTX when it comes to alts because Bitcoin is completely fine and then if you held anything besides Bitcoin you've retraced every candle since the election if not more like eth actually made a new low today versus like a new two-year low which is insane it traded 2100 with the last time I tra traded 2100 was August of 2024 it's pretty brutal out there Jonah what do you what do you say you got you got any good hopium for the guys yeah I mean just looking at my board here as you're talking Bitcoin is down three and a half% you know obviously if you've been living under a rock that's because Trump has just started a trade war with Canada and Mexico and people are wondering just how bad it can get S&P futures are down 2% you know they basically just opened um so that tells you how worried the actual Market of companies that build stuff is so I would I would call that not so worried bitcoin's kind of in line you know two and a half 2% S&P 3 and a half% Bitcoin H you know that that's the market kind of telling you all right it's going to be a little choppy for a while but Trump is not going to preside over the death of the American Equity Market to you know prove a point here he's going to use this as a negotiating tactic and walk it back this isn't the beginning of something new and super menacing but altcoins oh my God Obby like they're not just dying like left and right they're dying like super ugly disgusting deaths AI 16z down 22 and a half% eth down 12% salana down 2% that's pretty freaking impressive I think that tells you everything you you need to know like hold Bitcoin and salana um you know like for example AI 16z it it ripped from 25 cents a token to $2.25 you know in a couple of days maybe a week uh it was pretty quick I bought near the highs now you know like if if there are a lot of people out there like me who are just holding alts like that you're down you're down 90% like it's that that's why the timeline on Twitter looks so bearish but you know to the extent that you're not supposed to do that um you know like this is kind of a Told You So moment for people that have been over their skis and alts on the highs um I don't know I think like I'm feeling pretty happy about a whiff short that's going on right now that I've neutralized part of my portfolio with Obi have you shorted anything to protect yourself or yeah I I I didn't explicitly tweet that I was short whiff but I sent out a bunch of angry tweets about whiff because it was just so so insane to me that it look the moment that the fed and I talked about this on Twitter I think we talked about this a little bit on the last podcast but the moment the FED paused that was just bad for alts yeah like the hawkishness from the Fed was not bad for Bitcoin but it was really really really bad for alts and I think we both articulated that and what I was hoping for is I was hoping for some better strength from specific sub sectors that doesn't seem to be the case everything just got washed out and I think we can talk about eth for a second here eth has been the dog of the cycle we've beaten this horse to death but I think it you know we can we can do this one more time where we say capital previously Capital coming into crypto was good for all crypto that is no longer the case it will not be the case basically ever again that Capital going into Bitcoin is good for crypto at large Capital has to be going to specific projects that are doing good things that's it at the end of the day and eth has not done anything interesting for four years there's like since since it was a leader in D5 summer it literally has not done anything good so that's why everyone is using it as a short leg now I think that in times like these what everyone needs to hear is that don't worry there's still opportunity right I was short you know we talked about shorting soie once it broke the 50-day moving average I gave that entire spiel about how once it breaks the 50-day average it's basically done like once an asset breaks the trend that in this market an altcoin breaks the trend that it's been holding it's completely done and guess what sui broke the 50-day moving average at 450 and went down in a [ __ ] straight line 50% right I mean sometimes this stuff is as simple as you know you just stick to stick to the basics uh one thing that got me nervous is especially after the Trump tariff thing you just look at all of the charts of alt and they had all broken their Trends and when all charts look like they've broken their trends like the s chart you get wash outs because people just capitulate on everything and my take is that it's the weekend it's low liquidity I sent this in our group chat I nibbled a little bit on Saturday but my exact statement was I think you can nibble a little bit here but wait for Sunday because Sunday is when the crazy stuff happens and that I think is true which is why if you're you know hopefully we'll get this recording out ASAP but I think that this is the bottom like I'm I'm like fairly confident that this is at least a short-term bottom for the record we're recording this around 11 p.m. Eastern on Sunday night um yeah okay you had a really nice call on suie and how to short that one you know what's interesting AI um the market is handing Traders some layups it's not like crypto to be this easy and I think what's What's Happening Here the reason What specifically is easy I'm getting to it okay basically I think what people used to look at just from having been trained through a couple of the previous Cycles is that the easy trade is the alt season trade Bitcoin rallies and then you buy you know Al coins and they it's like a leverag Bitcoin trade but delayed by a few weeks or months and that's kind of your that's kind of what crypto does to shower wealth upon people who aren't necessarily like in the mid-frequency game of Pi picking you know picking bottoms on bitcoin like okay Bitcoin moves and then you get your alt move it was that was the previous easy trade that trade for reasons you just mentioned and several others is gone but now you have this inverse of that which is there are too many fraking coins out there not enough capital and capital that you know wealth that's being created in ibit the ETF is certainly not flowing into dog with hat because one's offchain and one's onchain so the easy trades are from the short side and I'll give you an example I'm I'm not really a big crypto shorter like I'm mostly in Bitcoin and have been for most of this cycle for reasons we've discussed but you know dog whff hat my least favorite coin um it was announced that it was going on the sphere uh token rallies from 150 to $2 in short order then it's announced that not only is the coin not going on the sphere or the Hat not going on the sphere but that everybody who's been pretending to put this hat on the sphere and collecting retail users money for you know however many months of this whiff is going on the sphere narrative like they've never they've just been collecting money they've never had any intention of putting it on the sphere it's all a big charade like basically a scam like kind of a crappier Meier FTX with way less you know ripple effect and consequences and the price was 150 which is right where it was before the whole you know it's going to be on the sphere merrygoround started again so like to me when the price when you have a bunch of like extremely bearish news like hey this thing is a basically a scam it's a it's it's crime fi uh and the price is the same as it was before the crime news came out there you have and also there are like tariff Rumblings and you know interest rate Rumblings and all sorts of bearish shaky stuff going on in the broader crypto drop that's like a nice clean way to neutralize some of your crypto exposure so this is probably the biggest short I've ever put on in crypto this whiff short and I didn't think of it as like I wouldn't have put it on as a standalone trade but since I'm sitting on so many you know you know so much notional worth of crypto it feels it feels like Risk reducing to put on a big whiff short because it's against other crypto kind of just like I'm still long I'm still losing money on this move but I'm losing less and there you know i' picked whiff because because you know new new scammy information should put the price lower than before scammy information comes out which hadn't happened but like you know you could have done this with suie you could have done this with Doge you could have done this with you know ai6 Z or any of these other coins that are down 20% you could have done it with Trump um and so I think the new basically like inverse alt season is the new alt season like anytime you're you're feeling worried about your Bitcoin just look at some oversupplied coin that shouldn't be trading at a multi-billion dollar FTB FTV and hasn't gone down enough and short it it's literally that simple I mean there there are plenty of ways to do that now on chain too if you if that's where your money is like you go on the hyper liquid and do it what do you think the branding of inverse alt season is so [ __ ] funny it's like that's so good Jonah I like I I you should tweet that if not I might I might tweet it I'm tweet it right now because that that's so good I mean it's it's true literally in inverse alt season is the way to make money now yeah I'm tweeting it inverse alt season is the new alt season just short stuff and I'm uh attaching a [ __ ] a boot and fine doot uh Canadian trade War meme it's so good I mean all I like it there are too many alt coins alt season is a myth but don't despair just short them and supplement your netk yeah that was my previous tweet I just put out a new one I like I mean I'm not trying to sit here and pretend I'm a genius I could have shorted more I'm obviously taking a bath on this on this crypto move less of you know AI 16z is my my biggest uh raspberry of the year that one that one sucked but you know it's not enough to matter because I'm mostly in Bitcoin and uh I've got some whiff shorts to feel feel good about so I think yeah I mean they probably not enough people who listen to this podcast to are about inverse alt season is the new alt season just just short stuff just look at what hasn't puked enough where's polka dot my second least favorite coin um has that has that one emulated itself

people out there that there's always opportunities and one of the biggest opportunities that I still personally see is that a lot of the coins that are getting ETF still got nuked really hard like xrp got nuked ridiculously hard LTC is below 100 soul is way off of its highs if you really wanted I genuinely believe that buying those alts against eth is a great is still a great trade uh you know and this is actually giving entries because for some reason they all went down more than eth I assume because there was a lot of already POS there was a lot of pre-positioning in those coins all of that positioning has just been liquidated and wiped out this is a great time to go back in and put on like put on those pair trades that do have real Catalyst I mean the ETF catalysts are the last remaining real Catalyst in this market outside of Bitcoin catalysts like would you put them on as pair trades because like with Bitcoin basically unch you it's the same trading the pair as just trading the coin versus the dollar you know almost like would you buy would you buy these alts versus like would you buy soul BTC or would you just buy soul USD I would buy soul USD it's it's a matter of your wrist hole and like I wouldn't short them I wouldn't buy them against BTC uh I would buy them against eth because I just think that's a better risk adjusted play yeah smart you know it just it's it's a better expression of alpha yeah in my personal opinion you know like do I feel comfortable holding Litecoin just just holding Litecoin not really because I think it it's not the best asset in the world but do I feel good holding it against anath short yeah I feel better about I mean I can hold BTC long term because I think that there are a lot of really good catalysts for it I do think that they're also very good Catalyst for agents y um you know and just general AI coins and so I'm pretty I'm like comfortable accumulating some of those at these levels like I think virtuals here is actually a pretty good buy just like hold on and not touch and but yeah like for for something like a xrp ETF no I'm I'm kind of just yeah yeah like that's smart basically there's kind of no reason to hold that outright personally you're kind of you're kind of looking to buy if if it's a little bit out the RIS curve and speculative you're looking to buy it versus eth but if it's something Battleship like salana you would buy it out right um speaking of Battleship like you know this this is a great time to test your conviction um if something's down 80% and you have you were thinking of buying it but you haven't yet and you know you're you're hesitating now it makes you wonder how convicted you were I think the only thing to buy like you said earlier on the podcast is projects with an actual road map that that are going to ship something great and tellingly the only things that are up versus the dollar right now on my board are hyper liquid and fcoin um so you know two two opposite ends of the spectrum uh you have your your favorite meme and your your favorite decks so yeah I think I might finally whenever I cover my whiff short try to buy some uh try to buy some hyper liquid I think that's I think I think you should be I think you should probably be covering your whiff short now I mean this is this is a great like this is where you shove this is this is where you buy yeah I mean just just kind of across the board we've had I think 2.1 7 billion liquidations billion dollars worth of liquidations over the last 24 hours that is massive this is nuts I cannot remember the last time that there were this many liquidations I mean that's who still levered long this Market on the highs like who's who's using leverage I I obviously used a little bit with a short but that's against Longs who's outright long with leverage I I don't know we advise against that on the THX pod I mean a lot of people man like this is this is the whole Market it's a casino what do you mean who's long with leverage not me that's for sure um maybe maybe I'm the idiot though but but the thing about whiff is I mean whiff is over whiff is done wh whiff is like whiff is zero now like so why should I cover it then why should I cover it why should you because because I think it's important to remember that when something go even if something is worth a zero if something goes down 70% in 3 days or let's see I it's down like 40% okay but it's down 70% in the last two weeks that is you're due for some level of meaner version and like news came out right things are different than two weeks ago it isn't just like a plus with nothing having changed the news there's there's also there's also beta to the markets right yeah and and to and to be completely fair I don't know with 100% certainty if the whiff thing was a scam like it's entirely possible and actually probable that the guys running whiff are just dumb and that they genuinely believed that they would get on the sphere and they genuinely thought that they would be able to figure out out how to do it and then it turns out that they couldn't but they couldn't turn around and go tell everyone that they couldn't so then they kind of just so then they kind of just got stuck I mean I've seen I've seen this sort of I've seen this sort of malicious incompetence happen a lot Jonah as a I'm sure you have as well it's like never it doesn't start off as scammy it doesn't start off as malicious but it it is it's like like we're gonna raise $700,000 and we're 100% like we are set we're going to use this money and going to put it put this thing on the sphere and then they call up the sphere and they're like hey uh can we put our dog with a hat on the on your Las Vegas sphere and then the guys are like who the [ __ ] are you how did you get this number please hang up yeah and then they hang up and they're like well we can't tell our audiences because we built up this whole blah blah blah so like let's just keep trying to get on the sphere you know I I I actually I actually bet that that's what happened as opposed to we're going to take this money just run with it this thing's going to zero Obby it's not low enough yeah it's just it's down 25% today like I'm I'm I've never been in the business of holding on to a short if it goes down 25% in a day I think that's like a general rule of mine is if something goes down 20% in a day I'm taking off it I'm if it goes if it goes up 20% or goes down 20% I just I take it off yeah I just you know in one day it's like you know they they just it's just not how cover the it's just not how I personally trade I think it's time to move on I just like dude looking at this eth chart is disgusting to me I mean the thing reverted everything after Trump everything gross it just remind you know like I don't think we can say this enough the people buying like alt season doesn't exist anymore because the people buying Bitcoin don't rotate it into alts because they're not gamblers and they don't seek higher rewards the people that are that drove Bitcoin up to $109,000 are in large part ETF buyers people buying on Fidelity people buying in brokerage institutional Guys these are not guys that are rotating Capital into your hat coins to send them send them higher and quality matters that's why hype is $22 yeah and it's up today that that's why hype didn't collapse in on itself because there's genuine real value there that's that's also why salana is only down 3% today yeah right the trade is to close your shorts and get long hyper liquid here if you if you're not already too that's a trade and you know maybe maybe buy some soul buy some xrp buy some LTC buy some things that will that will have positive flows going their way you know one coin that has been outperforming that nobody talks about by the way is uh Monero which is fascinating to me it's a privacy coin right from the mono yeah it's it's it's the biggest privacy coin it's doing extremely well clearly there's a demand for privacy I mean it is like like the The Narrative of it is Bitcoin but untraceable it is pretty like that's a pretty good narrative um for for for a heavy Bitcoin denominated Market it it has held up extremely well now the issue is you can't pair you can't trade it in a pair because it kind of just grinds up and so like it outperforms to the downside and to the upside so you have to weather a ton of all on whatever short leg you have because you know eth often will out pump it to the upside and then you're going to get all freaked out but you know it's probably you know the more that I'm thinking about Monero the more that I realize it's probably worthwhile to have in your portfolio because you know privacy combined with like a truly private currency I mean that's as Bitcoin gets adopted and so many people uh you know hold it in ETFs and whatnot and as it becomes more trackable you know there is this old idea that Bitcoin was a Swiss bank in your pocket yeah it's no longer true but Monero is Monero is literally a Swiss bank in your pocket I mean that's a really interesting take I mean allow me to humbly challenge your thesis here so the fdv of Monero is 3.7 billion MH um the fdv of zash is 500 million so 17th the size uh zcash is down 26% today Monero is down 11% but I agree with you it's definitely outperforming and it's been performing all year what is it about Monero that's better than mon monero's monero's actually used I mean this is kind of an old an old argument there's also um there's like a conspiracy theory that actually more Z cash was minted than we know of oh wow and that's why it performed so poorly H because there's actually a lot more of this Supply than than we think um because the initial ritual what do they call it the um you know the ritual to create a seed and then burn it to like fully encrypt it uh that that was compromised and I like I'm not I don't subscribe to conspiracy theories but it kind kind of makes sense when you consider just how poorly zcash performs consistently it's like who like where does all of this selling come from like why is it literally impossible for this thing to go up like it just doesn't go up that was my question I was gonna be like why would you why would you pick Monero over zcash but you know perhaps because because because Monero goes up and Monero is used yeah like the the bottom line is people use Monero I guess if we're entering a world so okay so this sort of transitions nicely into a conversation we should be having about two things first of all when's the market going to turn in the short term because it definitely will turn Trump's not going to like stubbornly ride this to zero uh this being risk assets and the the second question is like longterm like the fact that this happened changes the world a little bit and what does that mean for crypto one implication could be that in a world of trade Wars and uh you know increasing barriers to global trade like maybe privacy coins like Monero are more relevant which is long-term very bullish for a smaller cap asset like Monero um like for and kind of where I'm going with that is let's let's focus on the long term for a second a trade war is bearish risk assets and bearish crypto in the short run because it just means that prices are higher for people there's more economic turmoil companies uh you know their profit margin's thin because they can't pass on all of the increased tariff cost to Consumers etc etc right like all all the all the reasons that are getting priced in right now but longer term like if you erect barriers to trade and you're Donald Trump and you're in charge of the United States whose currency is the US dollar which is the you know preeminent Global Reserve currency of the day and you decide to start waging Wars trade Wars against people that weak the long-term viability of the dollar that makes it less exciting for Canada and Mexico to trade bilaterally with the United States and instead makes it more exciting ever so slightly for them to trade bilaterally with each other not in dollars right because obviously the dollar is being weaponized a little bit here so if in order for Canada and Mexico to trade with each other bilaterally in the example that I just mentioned they could do it with US Dollars and then the fed and you know Mr Trump would have access to pretty much any kind of punishment they want to lay down on those two countries for doing what they're doing or or they could just pick another currency they're not going to pick the peso because Canadians don't have a lot of use for pesos Mexicans don't have a lot of use for loonies which are getting you know both of those currencies are nuking by the way the Canadian dollar is having a day like uh like one of these AI coins it's puking right now um ultimately you need an alternative Reserve currency that's kind of like independent the Euro doesn't really qualify neither does the Yen Bitcoin just feels like that alternative Reserve currency that's just sitting there as a dark horse on Deck waiting to waiting to you know waiting for prime time and these sorts of actions intensify the long-term drum beat for Bitcoin adoption for reasons I just described I think they also intensifi the the drum beat of you know long-term adoption for privacy coins though I've always avoided those because frankly I think they tend to facilitate a lot of crime and terrorism and it's hard to really like get long something even if the use case is exciting that that's meant for that so I don't really have a view on Monero but I could see this scenario being very long-term bullish Bitcoin and very long-term bullish Monero shortterm though I actually don't think this is that big of a deal I think Trump's going to U-turn this pretty quickly and I think this opening Salvo is just meant to extract a little bit of pain in order to ultimately end up with a better deal then you know what do you think I think that's the that's the classic take that seems to be floating around it's also my take is that Trump is Trump is obviously using this as negotiation tactic blah blah blah blah blah um the issue is the response the initial response from Canada and Mexico has been for for Canada and Mexico to sort of join arms and sing Kumbaya and say we won't stand for this us attack on you know we like we won't stand for this and we're going to administer retal you know retaliatory tariffs that's not a good sign because it could mean that this gets dragged out I mean Trump has an ego at the end of the day and he needs to win like this needs to turn into win situation for the United States and the question is when like when does that happen I think it's very clear that it's way worse like tariffs are way way way worse for the country that has a higher percentage of their trade allocated to you know what whatever countri is AD administering the tariffs Canada exports basically everything to the United States it is way way way way worse for Canada to have the US put tariffs on Canadian goods and for Canada to put tariffs on the u u us it's just that that that's obviously true but it seems like there's some appetite from politicians in Canada to subject their population to this and what you don't want is you don't want that these tariffs to go up and be in place for three months before the Canadian citizenry revolts I mean like what forces these politicians to back down wasn't D to get booted out of office like I I thought he was supposed to be gone by now I mean that's a pretty easy one right like he just sort of he he fights Trump tooth and nail then he leaves a couple weeks later and then PV whatever the issue the issue is that Pierre is also in favor of ret retaliatory tariffs against the US like this is like a bipartisan issue in Canada that they're all angry at the US yeah I'm like scratching my head too how about this let me let me bring in an analogy from the oil market so during the Trump 1.0 Administration he was fighting against a similarly uh you know let's call it stubborn regime uh the Ayatollah keni in our Iran he wanted to starve them of cash he exited the jcpoa unilaterally um at a time when oil prices were threatening to rip into triple digits because fly was maxed out everywhere um and so by taking Iran offline uh you know the price was starting to get pretty dangerous for Trump After exiting that deal so basically he did a similar thing he was like [ __ ] Iran we're going to sanction the crap out of these people we're going to exit the deal we have with them the nuclear deal maximum pressure maximum pain then oil prices did something that were you know that was bad for Trump right the worst thing that can happen to as United States President as a as an energy crisis like what happened under Biden um then Libya went out my my my favorite warlord ibraim jathran uh started fighting Khalifa haftar and Libya lost like a million barrels a day of production then oil oil went ballistic and Trump was between Iraq and a hard place he wanted on the one hand he wanted to sanction Iran and you know stop out their regime on the other hand he didn't want to get basically riots on his watch in the United States and get voted out of office because of you know because he caused an energy crisis so he did a backdoor deal and wavered the sanctions for a little while to let Iran continue to export he acted like the waivers were you know because the waivers were fairly public like he did it he did it quietly but it was still public enough that people like wow Trump's backing down so he didn't waver the full amount that was sanctioned he wavered some of it and then he did another thing which was just let the rest of it out into Chinese bonded storage without telling anybody and you wouldn't have known that unless you were in the oil Market which I was at the time like in the physical oil Market basically Iran was selling oil to China well basically storing oil in China in Iranian oil tanks on Chinese soil and then it was just disappearing from those tanks into God knows where when you know people in the oil industry knew that China was taking oil out of the Iranian oil tanks that were that happened to be in China and using it in their refineries at a discounted price so basically it was like this super backdoor way for Iran to sell oil and Trump did that until the price of oil crashed back down to so what you're saying is that he might potentially look for back door ways out of this Fiasco that he has caused for himself yes so so like just to finish the thought very quickly sorry for rambling um I bet what happens is he does I bet he blueprints that I bet he does like a partial walk back that makes him still look tough and then if there's real trouble like a super super under the table thing that most people don't know about to get the rest of the the way back to square one here's here's a question can you articulate exactly why Trump imposed tariffs on can like can you articulate what he is trying to accomplish no but I haven't been paying close enough attention something something fenel something something they're not they're not securing the Border well enough we asked JD Vance put it nicely he said there's a lot of fentanyl coming in from Mexico and Canada we asked them to stop it they didn't and now we're on to the um you know instead of instead of just asking where you know we're playing tough phase yeah this is about border security in fenel yeah and so it's what is interesting to me is how in theory easy it is for Mexico and Canada to get these tariffs removed by just making public statements that they will attempt to clamp down on the things that Trump is talking about and yet the response was so aggressive and I think that if I'm going to dig deep here I think what's happening is that countries around the world are nervous and scared of the US right now they're scared that we're going to economically bludgeon them in order to get our way and that Trump is actually starting with the quote unquote easy stuff like forcing Colombia to take immigrants back which should be pretty darn of course you should let a plane of your own citizens land that's pretty like that's pretty standard stuff right you should probably let a plane of your own citizens land in your own country um instead of sending them back to the US and then this fenal stuff which kind of just requires public statements and minimal action yeah what's happening right now is a reflection of countries nervous that if they Bend here then it gets much worse this episode is brought to you by Kraken OTC one of crypto's longest running exchanges with over

to check out their latest wallets do you think it has anything to do with socialism versus capitalism because Mexico and Canada left okay I don't think so I think it I think it solely has to do with the idea that the US is moving away so there's great tweet that articulates what's happening right now looks dumb unless you put it under the lens of the New World Order which is for the longest time post 1945 America was the indispensable country America was the country that would go out there and it would build up other countries and it would give Aid to other countries and it was the world's policemen and it would dictate policy around the world and it would try to shape the world in a way in its image right it's like I want the world to look like this and we're going to we're going to work towards this and we're going to do this by using our wealth to flush other countries with our wealth right we're going to be so good to so many people that they're going to love us and that's really what we did I mean if you think about it the amount of money that flows out of the US to other countries specifically so that we can you know move forward on our foreign policy not not trade but like soft power like that that era is coming to an end and Trump and his you know a collection of people have decided that now America will stop pushing its image on the world it will stop trying to dictate what this world should look like in 15 20 years and 50 years it will stop with this soft power and what it will simply do is cut the best deals with individual countries for the economic grow grow of its own economy and its citizens like that's it like no more worrying about the rest of the world it is simply you're you're you're an ally sure you might you might be but that doesn't matter anymore what matters are are we getting a good deal of out of our relationship like the the whole idea of consensus building doesn't exist within the Trump Administration that's why he keeps threatening to pull out of like every agreed upon Accord like the the the the IDE idea that it's good for the world to have a group of Nations that act in a certain way and that the US will subsidize those Nations to get them to act in a certain way and to support the US that like that that's over and so so that I think is what people are fighting back against right so it's kind of like Global cooperationists versus like the hedge fund pod shop model of global geopolitics so let's say that and that's very very to bring it back round circle that is so good for Bitcoin you have no idea that was what I was about to ask you I was like let's say we enter a multi-polar world with no Global hedgemon how does that make you feel about the price of Bitcoin in 10 years or it makes me feel like this thing should be $50 million it's it's like in a in a world where there isn't one you know Team America World Police making sure everybody's you know running democracies and uh liberal democracies and whatever like it to me it's just like the dollar cannot cannot live in a multi-polar world the way that it is right now like it's going to be a very diminished asset and I think that currencies such as crude oil and liquefied natural gas and gold and Bitcoin are The Only Stores of value and means of exchange that will be relevant in a a world with like superpowers kind of like all threatening each other with nuclear weapons here's here's where I might disagree with you um the dollar can still go up a lot in this scenario because what's happening is that countries are actually getting there there's actually a subsidy right now for a lot of countries to interact with America and when you remove that you need to pay higher prices for the for American Goods yeah right and you can't rely on America as much so but you have so you have you have a few competing forces one is that the American economy will continue to grow and it will continue to produce the most Innovative and best products and therefore our products will be desired around the world and there will be a strong demand for dollars because this is the only place where you can have investment this is the this is the economy that will give you the best return on any bonds that you purchase basically America is the only place to go for Investments and that is bolstered under the Trump regime in the way that he's running the government in my personal opinion I see so basically you're saying finance and like just regulatory climate is an export that the United States has that it's an export that will strengthen the Dollar on the other hand you have this idea that you can't rely on the United States to act in your best interests and so your reserve of dollars and treasuries are going to be much lower yeah right for on a state level and so there are these two offsetting flows that I haven't spent enough time trying to figure out like what way that leans yeah but I'm not making the argument that it's that this is either really bad for the dollar or really good for the dollar because I actually see flows going in both directions because of this yeah I don't have a view on the dollar now now for Bitcoin specifically this is extremely good because you need a non-governmental currency that is a that is effectively apolitical in a multipolar world because you can't rely on a basket of your closest allies currencies you have to rely on gold or Bitcoin right if if you if you want reserves I mean you just you can't have us treasuries as reserves in this in this world anymore one day they might you might wake up and they're they're not an ally anymore yeah we not sorry right you thought those were your dollars they're actually my dollars [ __ ] you I agree so this is this is all like that's all very very very good for Bitcoin um you know thinking about this people always try to get around tariffs if they're if if economic Warfare increases you you maybe that is a Big Boon for both Bitcoin and Monero because payment you know you know you're going to need payments that exist outside the system to evade tariffs yeah um like like that that that's that's got to be a pretty big draw I also wonder if you're going to have a premium on like virgin Bitcoin that's been mined like directly from the minor as opposed to bitcoin that's been in circulation because let's say that you buy Bitcoin let's say that I let's say that I'm a sanctioned entity or an entity that the United States doesn't like and I want to buy something that the United States would prefer I not buy and I want to buy it with Bitcoin if I go on like coinbase and kyc myself and buy a bunch of Bitcoin and then send that Bitcoin to the seller of whatever I want to buy you know send it to Venezuela and buy a cargo of crude oil that's pretty traceable meanwhile if I wire Fiat to a Chinese Bitcoin miner and receive Virgin Bitcoin in exchange for that and then I send that Bitcoin off to Venezuela and buy my cargo of crude oil um that could take you know that's harder to trace right like that's just not basically if you buy Bitcoin direct from a minor and spend it um you could do it with a fresh wallet that's harder to you know that's not traceable and your gateway is some random offshore minor instead of uh instead of like a basically a heavily regulated entity where every transaction is is monitored so I wonder if if you're going to see a premium on like people buying Bitcoin directly from miners for the purposes of spending it on things like that um just that's just tin foil hat stuff but to me it seems like uh it's it's a way to make Bitcoin a privacy coin I don't know if there's enough liquidity for Monero maybe an ecosystem could develop but yeah to me yeah I I'm I'm I'm calling it now my favorite my favorite trades are Bitcoin Monero xrp LTC and soul call I'm calling it now short short e to zero the [ __ ] why xrp because because of the ETF Jonah yeah fair enough and it did just it did just dive like 30% and and I might I might have to pick up some Doge as well you know one thing one thing I will say is that through all of this absolute like horrific [ __ ] that's been going on in the market you know what's been uh you know what's been doing real well tell me ABI thousand xas I I love it should we it's it's it's actually like it's it's putting out some pretty freaking amazing content I mean we're going to launch a terminal for this thing at some point in the next three months and I think people are going to be blown away by like the level of insight that this thing is like like able able to generate I mean we it's it's starting to reply to people right now um it's like it's great right so I'll give you an example uh anom says if I want to get most up to speed on newest Soul clients in fire dancer where do I go helus blogs it it replied helus blogs might not give you the full picture check jump crypto technical docks they leading fire dancer development solds recent performance shows why client diversity matters I mean look that's not a perfect response but it's able it's like able to point you in the right direction go check jump cryptos technical docs and so in the future like this thing is basically going to be a chat GPT trained on crypto like no other agent no other AI is going to be trained on the data that this AI is trained on and so it's just going to be like the sidebar for everyone in crypto in my personal opinion that's that's an awesome Vis vision for this project and at the speed that we're shipping I think we can get there like I wouldn't be pumping this if I didn't use it myself because I think that would come off as dishonest but I literally like I have notifications on for this bot it if I'm not paying attention to my trading view all day because I'm out and about um it kind of keeps me up to date like I'm pretty aware of what's Happening throughout the day because of what this thing is is posting um and the best part about it is that it sounds just like you and me you know it's literally are it's it's uh you the way you do it is you build a character file and the character file has like message examples and lore and like biograph biographical information and so that you know we all we created from our podcast transcripts and I haven't updated it for the last couple podcasts but you know up and up until two podcasts ago it was I was like putting in fresh examples and lore and bio stuff from every single transcript so I guess we're going to have to automate that too there's this mountain of work but this is a fun project I think a terminal is kind of a you know I used a Bloomberg terminal for almost 20 years I don't I don't have one anymore um I Bloomberg is great because it has everything you could possibly want to search for but what chat GPT is so amazing for is that it kind of like opens your minds to to things that are sort of adjacent to what you're looking for it provides context and explanation chat GPT is garbage for trading it's so good for learning about many things but garbage for trading and I'm in building this agent I'm starting to understand why uh because piecing trading together is like it's it's it combines so much real time and not realtime context like we're literally updating we're literally updating add dictionaries worth of stuff on the back end to teach the bot like why certain features of the market are bullish or bearish Bitcoin eth Etc and how to how to interpret that and then it comes back and processes all of its information through that dictionary it's pretty super interesting doing it is basically making me a better Trader and then the output makes me more alert and Miss less so I like it you're on mute it's honestly great and it's already useful for me yeah glad to hear you're using it too of course I'm using it I mean it's it's it's a great it's a it's a great product I mean you know and and in the future people will be able to upload their own data and ask it for its interpretation of that data and it will be able to do so effectively um by using the Frameworks that it's already generated was pretty cool stuff like I'm I'm I'm very I'm very happy with with how things have with how things have been going me too obviously like a like like AI agents in general have been absolutely destroyed uh have you ever looked at have you looked at the zerro chart recently yeah it's almost at zero does this mean that we're building during the bear AI does this mean that we're chewing glass like all those analogies it's insane it was at it's it went to a $750 million market cap and now it's a $46 million Market market cap like that is insane uh there are a lot of projects that will go to zero there are also a lot of projects that are probably really phenomenal buys um all of the froth has just been washed out of the AI Market I mean my person xbt right here I love that one let's see it is down a substantial amount woo yeah that is that is down only oh my God and what I what I'll say just last Point here before I think we wrap it for the day is that this is this has been very painful um I think you needed to be very quick on your feet in order to avoid the worst of this because a lot of this came I mean kind of on the heels of uh tariffs but what I will say is that it's a high two two very highit rate things when the market refuses to go up on good news it's close to over if you remember there was news that the xrp and soul were getting CME Futures listed and they didn't go up that was very bad that's like that's like a very bad sign for the market it means that everyone's Max deployed like like people aren't able to speculate anymore because they're Max deployed and they're just holding on to what they already have um there's no cash on the sidelines to speculate and then the other uh point was after the you know Reserve came out Bitcoin didn't really go much higher like that when things like that happen you got to you got to say okay let me take a step back and reassess my portfolio and raise a little bit of cash because cash is more important right now than it was before so that that that that's what I'll leave you with right now I think is a really freaking good time to buy yeah like to buy the to to to to buy the good stuff right I think it's a really phenomenal time I agree with you one thing I would add to that very well articulated statement is if something's trading at Price X and then a bunch of terrible news comes out in a bare market and it's still trading at Price act the Market's handing you a gift you can get short especially uh if there are too many coins out there and inverse alt season is the new alt season so look out for look out for death nails for the toll of the bell for a project here or there and if the price hasn't nuked yet it's probably because people aren't paying attention there you know you are going to get Windows of opportunity to short stuff here uh before it really breaks down um yeah nothing we say is financial advice uh we don't we don't you know obviously do that please do your own research and don't take anything that we've said on this PO as a recommendation AI it is uh it is great talking to you um it is always a pleasure thank you Jonah this is H it's nice to be dialed in on a Sunday night with markets moving a lot feels like we're in the again at least we're getting some volatility here you know even if we've lost money or even if you've lost money like at least at least Market is moving it's exciting it's exciting and fun you can't you can't be too upset when you when you get this yeah just just because it gives you something to do um anyway Jonah it's a pleasure likewise see next week [Music]

Transcript Text:
I've been pounding the table pretty early since pretty early that there's going to be no alt season this time that there there will be sector-based seasons why there's just too many coins there's too many coins there's just not enough capital for an ALT season to happen this episode is brought to you by Kraken OTC get access to 24/7 trading services for high- net worth individuals and institutional clients to execute orders over $100,000 you'll hear more about them later in the show [Music] hey guys just a quick mention that the Thousand X podcast has launched its very own feed for

will go out exclusively over there the new feed gives you earliest access to the episode so make sure you click the link in the show notes or search 1000x on your podcast app to go follow the new feed and leave a rating all right let's get into the episode back to another THX podcast in the midst of Market meltdown Joan and I have come together to give you guys the take that everything's going to be okay that you shouldn't worry so much you should go outside touch some grass you know I I tweeted that there's a lot of dispersion in Market Opinion recently and that's unequivocally bullish on the market and then I followed up with I'm looking for entry points this weekend now what ended up happening is that Sunday night we imploded and what tends to happen is that if you get an implosion on a weekend or on a Sunday specifically a Sunday it comes to a climax on Monday because everyone's adjusting to the new information and they all get out I think that's what just happened uh Jonah do you agree with me are you unequivocally bullish on this Market yeah um I am I think it's notable that Bitcoin well first first we can go through like your Tweet your Tweet was brilliant I I couldn't have articulated it better myself I I tend to get scared when everybody's consensus bearish or bullish scared when people are consensus bullish greedy when people are consensus bearish I like the Warren Buffett quote about that and yeah there's not a lot of consensus right now you have some really prominent respectable people in in the crypto trading Community calling you know for cycle Peak having already happened and others like you and me saying you know there's much more to come there's a big debate about which inning we're in uh frankly who cares about Innings it's about price but you know some people are saying we're in the eighth or ninth inning of the ball game others are saying we're in the fourth to the fifth in terms of this bull market um so yeah yeah I think when everybody's just like all over the place and the fundamentals of our asset class are still really strong and you get we've talked about fundamental sell-offs and Technical sell-offs sort of a technical sell-off I think that's a really good entry point like we had we had a crazy technical selloff last year around like Midsummer I think it was August I forget why off the top of my head but that was a big technical sell-off related to some like rate hike or liquidity thing that was complet compl exogenous to crypto that was that was the buying opportunity of the year and uh I think you know I wouldn't call this a massive buying opportunity because it's already bounced back and rebounded most of what we you know lost overnight traded down to 97500 in Bitcoin now we're back up to 101 and a half so you know it's not a screaming buy I think you're just supposed to look at the chart and say the fact that Bitcoin is still right smack in the middle of the recent range um despite all this NASDAQ NASDAQ went down three and a half% Nvidia down 17 18% too yeah and the the Nvidia selloff to me was really funny because everyone's describing it to deep seek and I think that's right and what I spent today doing is trying to figure out if I was missing anything because to me deep seek doesn't seem like it should send the markets tumbling this reminds me of the age-old blockchain debate that we've actually had on this podcast the debate is well if blockchains reduce fees tremendously and they become extremely scalable then how could they ever have any real value because they're not going to generate any meaningful Revenue you know if fees come down then you need usage to go up and the argument is that it's like a highway you can widen the lanes of a highway but what you're really doing is is you're just allowing more people to drive on it like there's there's still latent demand for all this and this is how I feel about AI like even if you know and just to give everyone a background why are people freaking out about deep seek it's because they've proved that you could run these models on far less compute power than we originally believed they claim they haven't proven like they claim now the the why are people worried well if you can run models with less compute power then you need less chips if you assume that demand stays the same you need less data centers which you know meta has invested in a data center of the size of Manhattan everyone in their mother is building out data centers why because they think that there's going to be a massive increase in demand and I don't think that there's finite demand for AI if it if it's supply and demand if you take something like an orange and you cut the price in half more people are going to buy it if you take something like chat GPT and it becomes cheaper to run more people are going to sign up for it and so I don't think we've reached the point where we've increased scalability for AI so much that demand is not going to be able to get us back to where we were future if if anything this makes AI more attractive and more usable across a variety of different applications things that were cost prohibitive before are now economic and so they're they're going to come online right and so I think that this is a complete misunderstanding of what's actually happening and you can say well maybe what this means is that all of these companies that we thought had massive advantages in AI are not going to be able to compete but none of these companies other than open AI had a moot anyway because it's open source I mean Facebook's AI llama is open source uh deep seek is open source so really you just can integrate it if you want um you know hopefully there are no Chinese spy bugs in it but open source this is this is an overreaction and to me represents a great buying opportunity which is why why I bought today dip my feet you know I I used some cash that I had on the side to go to go buy uh equities specifically uh you know I'm I'm already sort of full full crypto exposure um but yeah I mean I just don't think that this is a real concern yeah I don't think so either I mean obviously there's the the bearish argument the economically bearish argument that stock market gurus are talking about right now is the fact that there's just been this you know Cent billion dollar gold rush spend on ai buildout ai infrastructure like you alluded to and maybe that's going to stop May or or slow down and yeah that's short-term bearish Invidia because if deep seek is real which I doubt it is by the way um side not what you mean you doubt it is people are the the CEO of scale AI came out and said that it was trained using you know cluster of Nvidia h100s that they didn't report right so it may be a little bit lighter than it maybe it may be a little bit heavier than their purporting uh it is but my point my main point is that let's assume that deep seekit I'm sorry let me just get this straight are you saying that a chinese-based company might have lied yes I mean I'm I'm not saying it I'm just quoting like a major player in the AI space scale AI is like a data there's never I don't think there have ever been any instances of fraud in the Chinese market or or in markets of of any kind um Market markets are fraud-free yeah I agree so it I it's like let's just assume that they're telling the truth which is already a stretch um maybe maybe it means a little bit less data center spend in the near term which is bad for NVIDIA and any any other provider of data centers Maybe like some private Equity uh group within Blackstone is like oh dang we're going to have less demand for data centers um but to me it's bullish for everything else in the S&P 500 like if you can just create 03 level AI at the edge with like a couple of Mac Studios stacked on top of one another um that opens up a whole bunch of new applications if AI becomes cheaper for uh for the masses there's going to be more demand like you said prices come down but volume goes up um ultimately like this should be massively bullish equities and as far as crypto is concerned Bitcoin is just correlated with the NASDAQ at the moment and it's kind of outperforming the NASDAQ right now it's only down uh 1% whereas the NASDAQ is down 3% like you said so you know Bitcoin is showing relative strength uh which tells you something and furthermore you know as far as like AI coin and some of the altcoin altcoins that tanked on this news I think that cheaper AI is good for crypto what's what's bad for what's bad for AI coins right now is that there's just too many coins including too many AI coins so there's a lot of dilution out there and investors don't know which one to which token to buy because there are too many choices but what's good for AI coins is the fact that the argument against you know the intersection of AI and crypto and its future is that crypto isn't a fast enough platform to have access to this like World beaing AI uh that that's done inside of these centralized companies and if deep seek is real then anyone can spin up a super powerful decentralized uh artificially intelligent application slap a token on it give it some utility and then before long um you know Off to the Races with what could potentially be a really useful product this episode is sponsored by Kraken OTC you

everyone Jason here there's a reason why Ledger is trusted to secure more than 20% of the world's crypto assets today check out their newest devices The Ledger stacks and The Ledger Flex featuring the world's first secure touch screens take your security seriously hit the link in the show notes of today's episode to check out their latest devices trust me you won't regret it I was thinking this earlier the market has so clearly become more efficient and smarter than it was even two years ago I mean even last year for the longest time if you ever had an announcement about a specific sector in the traditional world then the cryptocoins would kind of run for no reason so like I remember when open a like two years ago when open AI would launch a new model or a year ago when open AI would launch a model all the AI coins would would rally off this right like like render or or Nvidia would announce earnings I think that worked even six months ago and AI coins would rally and then you get this like insane in theory insane development and breakthrough in Ai and nothing happens um that's like that's the market has gotten smarter because the reality is that there was no reason for these things to Rally uh now there is one standout here which is that something called Alchemy pay went up like 90% because it's quote unquote Chinese coin um and this thing called conlux also went up 10% outperforming the market but I mean there was no broad-based reaction from AI coins which I think you know it brings me to my next Point here which is that the market is really genuinely rewarding research and it's there there's a tremendous amount of dispersion one of the biggest discussions on CT over the last month two months has been alt season it's like when does ALT season happen and first let's define alt season alt season is when alts across the board doesn't matter what they are or what they do they go up because people are trying to get more risk on and that happened for like a week this year but it didn't really happen in the way that people expected it to right like we kind of designed over the last few Cycles to expect alt season to be this period of a month where three weeks where everything 5x's alt season this time was more like things go up and outperform by 15 to 30% right like Litecoin going from $82 to $120 I mean 50% right but there was no it didn't go from 80 to 400 100 like it has in previous old cycles and so that you know it brings me to a question post here saying do you think that that will happen again or do you think that people just have to start actually buying the good stuff it's a great question um so I'm gonna I I've been pounding the table pretty early since pretty early that there's going to be no alt season this time that there there will be sector-based Seasons you know we did see a d no season like xrp and harar and some of these random like 2017 and 2013 coins went went ballistic um I I do fully expect an AI altcoin season I think that that Mania will hit crypto later this year I think the Catalyst will be agents crossing the chasm into mainstream usage and token related activities and games and gambling inside of these agents or terminal related to these agents that you access tokens so I think that tokenomics can definitely can definitely translate into an AI altcoin season um but you know I don't know if I get to take credit for this but I when I started posting about there not being an ALT season this year this time this cycle I think I was the only one so you know that seems to be consensus now and I feel like I was early to that idea um why there's just too many coins there's too many coins there are like we mentioned it earlier on the podcast it's it's bewildering how can everything go up when I think Brian Armstrong TW tweeted that coinbase's new whitelist policy for which tokens they put on their exchange is that it can't be a wh list anymore because there are a million tokens a week getting created so it's it's going to switch from wh list to Blacklist where they just like identify with AI things that violate their terms and terms of use and they're just going to block those and let everything else through the floodgates and so when when you're in that world there's just not enough capital for an ALT season to happen and we did kind of to your point have an ALT season for a little bit like right around the you know between the election outcome and uh the inauguration but it wasn't it wasn't an Al season in the sense that like altcoins outperformed Bitcoin like yes btcd went down but like vast swaths of alt altcoins rallied but they underperformed Bitcoin which I wouldn't really call an ALT season I would just call them like there there was a period December you know late November December where everything there there were a lot of rotations so like chain link for example went from $14 to $28 and then went straight back down like Litecoin Litecoin did that move um Ripple was sort of a standout there it's like kind of kind of the only one but again that like I wouldn't place that into an ALT season bucket because I think Ripple was actually a quinal good coin to buy like there there there was a period of time where those [ __ ] coins did rally but they're all backed down like pretty quickly with with bitco with Bitcoin at the highs what that tells you is like the cycling of capital is pretty insane right now yeah and it also tells you if you can tolerate the pain of being underwater on some positions they're probably some very compelling uh trades out there you know yeah you might not nail the exact top on something but for example I think a month ago when we talked about soie I said that you have to wait for it to break the 50-day moving average get a bounce and then short that and that's what's happening right now it did break that 50-day moving average and so that's probably a good short like if if you if you're not sure where the Market's going to go or you're just looking for an alpha trade it's like okay well let's look let's look at some trades or some assets that I think will do well maybe you're looking for a catalyst like daow you know T to's releasing uh TS releasing some stuff over the next few weeks um and that's underperformed for a while maybe that starts performing and then maybe you want to hedge out to Market Risk by go you want to short some SOI against that because soie looks particularly vulnerable the these types of Trades present themselves I mean maybe you're down 10 15% on the Su trade at some point but probably works over a month or over over six weeks and so th this is a lot of the type of trading that I'm looking at doing right now I mean you know another example of this was getting getting long xrp short eth I think that was a good trade I still think that's a good trade actually although I'm a little bit more nervous about being short eth now so I might have to move that over to something else um just based on how poorly eth has performed thank you for talking me out of eth last year by the way what a dud oh my God it's still a dud I would have thought by now it would be like I thought the regulatory moat that eth has built from just years of people caring about eth more than any other smart contract platform would protect it and that it would sort of start to perform even if its Tech is inferior but like I think it's pretty clear that it's too awkward we are we are very close to just being completely over for this asset yeah like you know I hate to I hate to say it I I really do hate to say it but I mean they're [ __ ] man and they're [ __ ] for so many reasons it's not just the technical it's they have no real leadership the etherum foundation's a joke vitalic is checked out as much as he claims he's not and the main thing that they had that I kept saying that they were going to be able to take advantage of was the ETF and they're going to lose that advantage in the next six to eight months I think that's very clear there's going to be an xrp ETF there's going to be a soul ETF there might even be a Litecoin ETF and like who buys eth in this scenario that's why like you know I think a great I mean I I don't love shorting eth on days like today when eth BTC is down a percent 2% but basically every every 10 days for the last six months eth has gone up 3% against Bitcoin in a day because of short covering and that's just been like the trade you just short it like every time it's up sell every pop yeah like sell every pop right um I mean you don't want to be one of those guys that shorts on a down day and then get squeezed into the up day you want to be one of those guys that shorts the shorts the up day and I mean even if eth ends up like if every single short on eth covers it probably goes to 0 45 you know that's a big move that's 50% move that would be the greatest short of a lifetime yeah um because I I think I think the trend the trend is down and you know it's it's funny crypto is such an interesting asset class because consistently you have people trying to find the contrarian take and the contrarian take for the last six months has been eth is going to outperform and I've said this myself and I've been wrong before um I and every time I'm like okay maybe it's time for E BTC to do well it does well it does like 10% 15% move and then it just immediately goes straight back down and I'm like okay [ __ ] maybe not um yeah like sometimes you know just a lesson to investors and Traders out there sometimes there's a reason that people are bearish like sometimes it's just like the collective has realized that this thing is [ __ ] and just because everyone realizes it doesn't mean that it can't go down more I mean yeah it's you bring up a good point like the contrarian take has been wrong for so long in this one that it's it's hard to get behind it it it kind of reminds me of how I felt about salana in like just post FTX salana was like breaking left and right I forget what the name of that app was that like where you would it was like a walking app where you had you know salana sneakers and the thing would like give you tokens for the amount of distance that you you walked with them um but like just that walking app like a few people using it like bowled over the network and I was basically like okay the monolithic L1 doesn't work salana is not charging enough it's too centralized it's basically like not fulfilling its promise and the core team Anatoli and Co shipped and fixed and did what they had to do they got past FTX and then it was like you know went from8 to you know $280 in a straight line one of the best trades in the history of crypto for a mature token um I'm wondering to myself out loud if we could see one of those moves in eth and I think what it would have to take in order for that to happen is base would have to become eth like they basically the core team vitalic they would have to just like ride off into the sunset and just hand over stewardship of the asset and the ecosystem to whoever is building base because Bas is great there's stuff going on on Bas but like it's just kind of a buzz kill you have to bridge assets from the main net to base either through coinbase or through like these you know random protocols that are kind of sketchy looking you know like why can't you just have bass be a monolithic L1 with an eth token and just move on from this I you know technically I'm sure that's difficult or impossible or somebody who's really in the weeds could probably tell me why why it's not not an option but like man what the eth main net is just outdated it's like using like telephones where you have to like swivel your finger around a circular you mean a rotary phone yeah exactly it's so have you tried trading on eth recently or doing anything it's just like no yeah I mean I mean no in the sense that not trading on eth yes in the sense that took me like 10 minutes to move all my money off of eth yeah was I was getting it g getting it over to base um you know it's it's it's sad eth was something that got me very excited about crypto but you know I I also feel like we flogged this horse the poor the poor eth horse a lot it could come back though like are you combing your hair right now yeah yeah I got a comb on my desk and I'm just styling you know why you're you're also combing the side of your hair it's not it's not even you're not even like poofing it no I'm not poofing it I got headphones on just the side is the side is what's risk you know low risk High reward yeah you know I wish I I wish I had hair it also feels good just to run a comb through your hair it's like a like a head like a little exactly have you ever used one of those things oh yeah those those things are great it's always better if somebody else uses one on you rather than do it's amazing how that works but what you know here a trick you can just sit on your hand till it doesn't feel like just give yourself a head massage heard of that one yeah but it's it's a it's a temporary fix like everything eth does to try to improve itself temporary fix you know I I think there's always a lot of inertia to this stuff it's never a fast death it's a slow death I mean in The Grand in the grand scheme of things right I think the the death will be fast like if you compare it to the death of blackberry or the death of Cisco I guess not Cisco but sorry seers um at least eth is valued like eth what's what's the fully diluted what's the FTV of eth right now let me look this up it is 380 billion dollars so even if it dies slowly you have a nice high sharp trade for a while just while it's slowly smoothly trickles lower this episode is brought to you by Kraken OTC one

really interesting that I haven't seen like not not many people have talked about this and we we certainly hadn't um I I subscribe to This research service called 13d I really like them they're really good this is not an ad I pay them they don't pay me I wish they paid me I pay them a lot of freaking money uh but they're really good and I want to read you something from their most recent report where they talked about the SBR and these are trafi guys but they really like BTC says the mere discussion of anbr in the US the mere fact that Trump has said that the us will not sell its current bitcoin Holdings not to mention the broader favorable pivot towards Bitcoin are sufficient to confirm some early adopter countries to front run the competition and to pursue their own version of an S spr regardless of what the US ultimately decides to do now I think that's 100% correct but I hadn't seen anything happen on this apparently uh on December 9th a deputy from the Russian Duma submitted a proposal to the Russian finance minister to create a strategic Bitcoin Reserve it's quoted by Russian media widely reported in Russia I ask you to consider creating a Bitcoin Reserve in Russia additionally uh Pierre po this Canadian guy I don't know how to pronounce his last name it sounds very French to me um he's he he loves Bitcoin um and so we could see a pretty drastic reversal in Bitcoin policy from Canada and we already you know see Canada being pushed around by the US a bit right now they might want to front run us um a a Brazilian Congressman also submitted a bill to create a strategic reserve of Bitcoin for the federal for the federal government uh unlikely that that happens but it's possible and earlier this week apparently a group of Chilean deputies are considering submitting to Congress a proposal for an spr there's a there's a lot happening yeah it's not just Nations like Texas Pennsylvania Ohio like Florida Oklahoma new hampsh North Dakota you know these these states are considering strategic Bitcoin reserves they they various phases right now that's that's actually also something I hadn't uh paid attention to it's very possible that US states lead the way and if US states lead the way like let's say that that Texas creates a strategic bit Bitcoin Reserve you can be damn sure that the Texas teachers retirement system which is like one of the largest passive investment vehicles unit States by the way yeah but like you can be sure they're going to be upping their their anti a little bit you know oh 100% And you know I don't know about the Florida teachers retirement Association if they have any Bitcoin but if Florida has an SBR maybe they'll dabble right it's it's kind of like Bitcoin is becoming regionally popular and accepted uh in a way that it hasn't been before it feels like a really recent shift so to me it's like if you're allocating your own portfolio if you're not mostly like in terms of what your core long crypto portfolio looks like your core Longs if you're not mostly in Bitcoin you'd better be really convicted uh in whatever alts you've chosen because your alts are getting diluted just every single day I mean the the only reason to not and this is candidly almost always been true uh the only reason to own alts is if you have a smaller portfolio and you're really just gunning for the the moon yeah um otherwise it just doesn't really make a ton of sense there hasn't been a single altcoin in the history of altcoins that is consistently outperformed Bitcoin salana I mean maybe one or two the point your point stands I kind of right you know obviously you can make a ton of money from trade from Trading alts but salana is below its 2021 highs yeah fair enough right I mean the TR they they the alts tend to have this chart they go up really [ __ ] hard against Bitcoin and really fast and then they bleed and the bleed doesn't mean that there aren't periods of time where Salon goes up 3x while Bitcoin is flat but what it means is that if you're holding this thing for five years you end up not making as much money if you just help you know you could just help Bitcoin kind of goes back to your point about um what VC's do in crypto their Edge is being early not being particularly Visionary like just just getting in on good deals at that sort of like pre preo price and that's kind of what you have to do with alts right like okay fine maybe you can't get in on certain deals but like if you subscribe to interesting services like our friends over at blockworks research or you know any number of other uh crypto Savvy kind of Publications maybe you can catch one of these alt moves in its early phases uh memein take that to the extreme obviously but maybe you can catch one of these altcoin projects in their in their early phases right before they Moon against Bitcoin and then you have to be diligent about getting out quickly and not just like sitting on your bags for five years uh and underperforming Bitcoin 100% which is why you know right now like that that's the be the best trade I see is just buying Bitcoin on liquidation runs and and trying to trying to trade that I mean right now bitcoin's in a bit of a precarious spot short term you know we could easily trade back down to the bottom of the range at 90 uh which at which point I think it's it's a buy again um but yeah I mean in that scenario altcoins just get absolutely obliterated great time to buy sort of the leaders in AI uh but know right now I'm sort of holding tight and the reason I'm holding tight is because while I am unambiguously bullish over the next two months we hit a l and we have fomc and it's very unlikely that news about the spr is going to come out in the next one to two weeks which allows selling to take place um so I think the way that I'd phrase it is that cash is very valuable right now because there's High uncertainty over the next two weeks and it would be great to be able to buy Bitcoin 10% lower uh you know and if news if news does come out okay get back in but at least for right now I think Bitcoin is is ranging like like like you said and it will eventually resolve this range much higher I think uh yeah I mean I think what sends it back up is Sovereign and governments buying you know like Nations and states that flow is coming it seems like it's not very far out so you know definitely wouldn't be shorting Bitcoin if it heads back to the high end of the range and I think that higher Bitcoin will bleed money into certain sectors certain certain leaders of certain sectors like you said like I I like the leaders in the AI space I think uh I think certain agents will perform this is probably it's scary time to buy that stff THX oh if only um maybe axt who knows uh I think there's a lot of innovation going on that people are sleeping on in that sector I just you know it's a bit scary to buy right now I I'm I'm pretty much maxed out on AI I got in you know decent levels on average below here but not nothing like amazing um I wonder if there are any other sectors Obi that are just going to explode uh when we get you know hopefully a broader crypto Market rally later this year people are talking about defi again um I don't I think meme coins are toast like old school meme coins like I maybe maybe you have Doge and Trump performing but like I think whiff is going to zero popcat Mei all this random crap that people got excited about for 10 minutes last summer when there was nothing else to do um what other sectors is there anything else we should be looking at it's a good question and I haven't run this exercise yet but I should there will be meme coins that do well and it depends on I mean it depends on their Community like how involved and outrageous is a community still there there have to be there have to be some like the whiff Community is pretty depressed and I don't think there's anyone that actually like the whiff memes are not hidden anymore they're not they're they're not they're not doing it for doesn't have staying power yeah like like that that doesn't have staying power but there there's probably a meme out there somewhere that does and it's my job to go find it if any of you listening to this have any ideas or are part of any communities that are still having a great time despite the depression in mem coins let me know I probably am going to allocate to you but like the way yeah I mean the way that you you got to think about this is go in the Discord are there Good Vibes like what what mecoin still have Good Vibes you know Trump maybe yeah um one other big thing that is coming up is that um bar chain is going going live soon the rumors are that could be a liquidity suck uh and would also make the suoi short really good because sui is kind of the only new sexy L1 that exists all the other new sexy L I mean I guess you can say hype but that's not it's not ready yet I think hype and the hyper evm is coming in q1 so we have two months you know because whenever a crypto project says q1 what they really mean is the first week of Q2 yeah Y what that's what I've learned or if it's eth and they say q1 it means q1 four years later yeah so I I do think that like uh you know the the short the short L1 trade know if you want to like sell anything that isn't salana because salana has uh some potential ETF Tailwinds bear chain could at least for a few days probably suck the wind out of the rim for these guys I would assume that t tvl tvl goes over there because people people are really excited about bear chain I mean including myself uh they they managed to Garner a substantial amount of tvl pretty quickly and the one thing through my discussions with the be chain team that I've always appreciated is that they were so focused on usable applications like they just refused to launch anything before they knew they could go live with actual applications that people would enjoy using and so I think we're going to see that and if in the F if if on the first day we don't you know then I'm just wrong about the thesis what is the like what is the what is the thesis for bar chain I know they have a couple of different tokens they have like their liquidity token they have their main token and they have some random thing that's hard to access but like I haven't done too much research on the bechain ecosystem it's not it's not an interesting trade to me because I the world just doesn't need another L1 in my opinion I think we're good with what we've got um for now yeah look I'm not saying that you you you buy bar chain and ride it 10x I'm saying that if they launch with usable applications on day one which is their intent then all the other l1s probably suffer a lot yeah I agree like I guess where should what valuation are they talking about in terms of fdv no idea I mean yeah it depends on if they come 1 billion to five billion to 10 billion to 20 billion I mean who literally who knows if it comes out below three I'll probably buy it on a on a yo um above that not touching it with 10 foot pole I think that's reasonable yeah um what other things are happening uh yeah we talked about the hyper evm we talked about be chain uh one thing that was kind of interesting is my one of my analysts brought up the in 3 days the jeto tip router goes live which is apparently going to route an additional 40 to 80 million to the jeto Dow treasury annually and you know jup Jupiter's done well recently with their with their announcements um there's currently no buyback or yield distribution of GTO da but what's kind of interesting is that number 40 to 80 million I actually didn't realize like how much money these things are generating in this new regulatory environment the things that actually generate real money they're going to figure out a way in the next four years to pass that back to users yeah to to pay some sort of dividend and I'm actually pretty bullish on that idea that you know things things like a things like Unis swap things that you know maybe even maker that generate reasonable fees are going to figure out how to use those fees properly because they're not going to be scared of the SE coming and shutting them down for being a security so that could be the next you know accumulate some things that are generating real Revenue could could be the next trade yeah I think it will be um it's it's a sleeper because people aren't really talking about it we've talked about it on the podcast for over a year now like that's going to be crypto's moment uh when you can just tokenize your project and pass through any gains to you know to users that's when crypto effectively disrupts traditional equity and Trad Equity is inefficient because it's you know heavily regulated difficult to access for a lot of people around the world and involves a lot of paperwork and in some cases you have to prove that you're an accredited investor just all sorts of things that make make investing in equity difficult are completely frictionless in crypto like for example our THX project um our THX agent you know if we want to get like people to help us with something we can distribute tokens pretty quickly uh you know if we want more people to buy tokens which you know we haven't really like gone for as a message yet uh we might though is you just give the token some utility and if you say hey this is a this this token is the equity for a business and if you hold tokens you get paid like that's the ultimate reason to go and buy a token but even without that utility like attracting a software developer and some branding people and you know just general help where we needed it was super super easy way easier than like going and trying to create an LLC and like Distributing shares in the LLC that would have taken like thousands or tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees and you know people in multiple random jurisdictions around the world probably couldn't have accessed it very easily so I don't know like token tokens are just so much easier to work with than what's out there for aligning incentives in these projects and that's one of the reasons why I got into crypto it just that seems so obvious to me I mean maybe I was a little bit early to that Trend but I think it's going to be kind of one of those like uh slowly than all at once type moves where we wake up maybe it's six months from now maybe it's a year from now and some Bill gets passed then there's that like kind of crickets moment and then everybody realizes like oh [ __ ] this means that you know millions of people are going to flock to buy these tokens uh because they generate yield like real real dollarized yield and not just like random crypto Deens like people at hedge funds uh people with any sort of financial Savvy and access to you know funds will go and buy stuff that offers a good you know legal investment return you know what I think I'm gonna start making that bet Jonah I'm gonna after this podcast what I'm gonna do is I'm GNA go to a token terminal I'm going to look for the highest revenue generating project I'm going to make a basket of them and then I'm just going to accumulate them and short l1s against them l1's like these these l1s are [ __ ] there are a lot of [ __ ] who the who the [ __ ] is buying optimis or optimism or arbitrum right now Tech the hell is buying Avalanche right now who the hell is buying Polkka dot buy AOS who's buying polka dot who's buying this [ __ ] who's buying say I I there's so many of these things I mean nobody needs them we need be chain we need salana you you need be chain yeah exactly I need I need be I mean you need bar CH I'd like be Chan yeah um I like Smokey he's a funny guy he's really articulate he is he is articulate I I do I do like how they manage to get all these the thing that I love about them is that it's the party chain [ __ ] dude their mascot's a bear smoking a bong and they somehow manag to get all these institutional alligators in like can you imagine sitting in front of I think they did they get sesah Hannah in they I mean I know they got brevan Howard in Imagine sitting in front of those guys and being you know just saying Hey listen so we're called bear chain uh we started because we launched a bunch of nfts of bears smoking a bong and take us seriously and then they did and got like hundreds of millions of dollars of investment I mean that that's got it's got to say something about their marketing ability they are excellent at marketing which is maybe all it takes uh to launch a successful chain because as we've realized it's not it's not just the tech that matters no Community it's definitely definitely not just the tech supposedly they threw the best party at token 2049 in Singapore it was just a big bar chain Rave um the idea of a a token being launched on like a an entire ecosystem with the token being launched on like Vibes humor and a dude in a bear suit wearing a Hawaiian shirt on top of it like it's it's one of those things that makes me like love crypto but also be kind of ashamed to be associated with it you know like I don't don't don't be don't be ashamed be you know be happy Trump Trump trump made me ashame you get to be part of an industry Trump trump definitely made me Trump made me ashamed yeah that the crypto crypto is about being ashamed occasionally like even it we're all blessed that we're in a bull market if that's why you have to be so careful when when you enter a proper bare Mark in crypto like once prices start trending down you take two steps back and look at some some of this [ __ ] or most of this [ __ ] and you're just like there is no value this is where zero right you have and and zero is where it can go from hundreds of billions which is why you need to be so careful around eth and be so attentive to the music and ensuring that still playing while you have money in this stuff Bitcoin the music's going to keep playing for a long time some of these other projects though like I think you were the one who brought this up Obi like the rotations are just you need to do it so much faster than you would have even two three years ago I mean I think it's inevitable that Trump that Trump goes to zero yeah like I I might tweet that just to see what the reaction is when I tweeted whiff is going to zero people are just like yeah F you man but yeah like the community is just t tired it's always be posting is always a great way to sus out how uh how engaged the community is and with whiff it's let's let's see yeah let's see how angry people get did you just tweet it just now yeah I just tweeted it right now cool it's it's literally inevitable like like it's it's gonna happen I mean you know whiff you know whiff whiff was really sad because so many people coalesced around it and like genuinely believed in this thing and at the end of the day it's a dog with a hat and People BET their like life on this thing like I know two people off the top of my head like H at least half their net worth in this thing and we somehow like collectively deluded ourselves well I didn't delude myself you didn't delude yourself but people were deluded into thinking that Meme coins were going to take over the world that like they were going to become the casinos of the new world but they're just a game that comes in and out of fashion I mean yeah maybe meme coins won't go anywhere but yeah I mean I think people were right that that that memecoins are the because you know the the new games that are going to take over the world I think what they've misunderstood is that one given meme coin is not the casino that generates the revenue the casino is called salana and the the meme coin dour is just a game within the casino right so don't buy the game buy the casino it's a weird weird world we live in that we have to think about this kind of stuff that you know that means that trumpcoin is gonna be a phenomenal short in like three years yeah if it's if it hasn't already unless unless Trump becomes God emperor of the United States which I the probability I put at 18% it's not zero definitely not zero you saw he was like talking about a third or a fourth term I know he's just trying to trigger people but it's is he I mean I thought that he was trying to trigger people by buying New Zealand or sorry uh Greenland Greenland Greenland yeah I thought so too but he seems pretty serious about that he's like he like actually took it seriously I mean it's one of those things where Trump will just say something see the reaction and and if he has like enough core support he'll just go for it you know that's actually not a bad strategy um I honestly I kind of respect it I think that there's this great saying in you know I think it's Jeff Bezos that came up with this great framework for decisionmaking in business and I guess it works for politics too he's like you kind of have to assess when you walk through a door whether you can walk back through the door uh and reverse your course or not and he's like if if you can can if you can exit doors that you enter then you should just enter those doors and see what's behind them you know it's like you have to be very careful when you make a basically a committal decision where you can't where you have to go through the door and you can never come back and I see a lot of you know that approach in Donald Trump he's definitely opening a lot of doors and trying a lot of random things and you know maybe the thing the thing with Trump is that he has a very unique ability to go through a door that you think he can't come back through and then just he just walks right back yeah like people just they there's like there's so much mental gymnastics involved with supporting Trump yeah that you just automatically assume that if he if he said something and then did it and then walked it back it was actually 8D chess play he was playing he's playing he he always meant to walk it back he only did that you know he got this out of it you know it's like it's crazy yeah he he knew that somebody that's like pretty right-wing and reasonably conservative um I still find him just like just not my cup of tea obviously you know is a as a president voted for him and whatnot but just wonder if he uh yeah it's like wonder if he knew in that trailer before the Access Hollywood uh appearance talking to Billy Bush about all sorts of disgusting uh stuff um I wonder if he knew that was going to go viral and that was like an at chess move he's he's the master of memes we all need to be a little bit more like like like him in terms of just being completely Teflon um I I let stuff get to me sometimes but I think in crypto we have to just uh gota be a little bit more like Teflon Don you you honestly the best way to make sure that stuff doesn't get to you is just to deny it like that that's what that's what he does you ever do anything wrong deny deny till you die no wasn't there didn't see that wasn't meag wasn't me yeah wasn't me anyway Joan it's a pleasure as always yep pleasure talking to you Obi nothing we say is financial advice it's just shooting the breeze never is never will be um yeah let's keep uh grinding on this thousand X agent and I'll see you next week oh wait before we go yeah have I showed you this before hold on so for those of you that for those of you that don't know um I went to Wu in St Louis and I was actually there when the 2016 presidential debate was happening and I volunteered for the Donald J Trump for president campaign wow you're early aren't you I was I was an early adopter I I should have gotten an aird drop for this thing you look you haven't changed at all by the way you look identical do I yeah same haircut same haircut same general look no no I got a few more wrinkles but other than that true crypto put a few years on you maybe I should take a picture of this and say I should have gotten an airdrop for this anyway yeah until next week till next week this was great Jonah thank you likewise see you soon

an undisclosed location in the Swiss Alps I'm still in France and major major congratulations are in order AI so happy for you so happy for you it was H it's amazing thing honestly amazing thing found an amazing the best girl that I could have ever possibly hoped for and I'm just you know I'm Overjoyed so thank you guys I'm thrilled for you guys massive congratulations and uh yeah en enjoy the uh the unfettered fun now because once the kids start showing up oh my God it gets pretty crazy and for for for for those of you that that saw the Tweet just know that's tongue and cheek because family is family is always the main quest family's number one the best Quest it's funny like hyper gambling with crypto becomes harder and harder as you have more and more people uh kind of like sharing your book with you when you're solo it's easier but uh yeah it's true I mean you can't but but it also it also instills a sense of you know what's kind of interesting is it like instills a sense of uh Pride to your work at least at least it has it has for me where like you actually want to work harder gives you some level of motivation to get in there and grind it out because you actually you have like a concrete reason for it other than yourself which is often a lot more uh how do I say like it's it's it's a it's a lot more motivating yeah I bet that's why I think uh most of the world's successful most successful business people are married um or have been married anyway massive congrats to you I'm so so thrilled for you and your your Leading Lady um next up on the docket uh before we get into the markets chat the the bankless guys wrote us an open letter Obi um I don't know if you saw it but apparently he said something last week that that upset them uh I I'll just quickly say my piece and then you can say yours I think um okay so basically to recap last week we we sort of had a discussion about the AIC token and how the Insiders sold a bunch of tokens on day one uh into the hands of retail investors as soon as they were able to buy the token crash and it was it just was a bad look um uh so let me just you know F first of all I liked the bankless podcast for a long time like I listened to it as I Was preparing for my professional career in crypto it helped me learn about the space they've definitely onboarded a lot of users which is good so Props to them I don't know you know I I met them briefly at permissionless they seem like really nice guys so there's no like personal animosity and I don't want any beef with them you and I just call call call it like it is and and read what we read online and do our research as best we can and say what we say what we feel about it that's our that's sort of what we do on this podcast where I think I was unfair to them in my representation of things is that I didn't represent their side of the story I just sort of uh represented the side of the story that is on the internet uh shortly after we recorded they published their side of the story um and they included it in their open letter uh unfortunately for them I don't think like we don't nobody knows what actually happened during this like nobody knows ground truth but if you just assume that their version of the story is ground truth and then everything else is wrong which you know I guess is a viable assumption for this conversation their version of the story doesn't like look any better than than what we were talking about like they sold $50,000 worth of tokens instead of $500,000 they say it wasn't their fault because uh it was bankless Ventures and they had no idea was happening so they sort of like passed the buck to their team or their junior guys or whoever they basically they're just sort of um I don't know it's very confusing and and also uh they're they're big boys they're the biggest podcast in the space they don't need to engage with minnow like us but I don't know I I'm I'm left scratching my head at the very least we should have given them uh their their side of the story a little air time at worst their side of the story makes them look worse than what we were talking about I I don't get it what do you think at the end at the end of the day you know you always have to consider you always have to consider both sides of the story I think when things are on chain um you know it's it's important to get the facts right we we did over State how much they uh they sold and ruined the reputation for they didn't ruin the reputation for 500k they they uh risked the reputation for 50 so that's on us um and yeah I mean look they just just go just go to the open letter read it they're you know it's very respectful well-written uh open letter and you know nothing but you know I think we could put this put this behind us but what I will say is that there are a lot of people in this space that are grifters and you know it's up to you to come to your own conclusions as to how people act and how they respond to things and the actions that they take uh you know you need to come to your conclusions I think one of the worst mistakes that you can make in this industry is assume that people with large accounts or large followings are on your side or trying to actually help you the reality is that's actually a very small percentage of people um and it's really mostly people that have already made it uh often times people that you know are not consistently posting or talking about small cap coins uh or put it posting trade setups uh those are those are sometimes the worst Defenders um I say sometimes not not not all the time but you know I think that it's it's really important also to understand that the crypto VC game I mean it's going to upset a lot of people but the crypto VC game uh is won by people that get into projects early and sell them when they're overpriced and that's that's like the game right it's you aims on something before it goes public at like a $5 million valuation the reason that somebody lets you in at that valuation is because they get your megaphone and your voice it comes out at a100 million valuation because you pumped it up and then your Edge is not the fact that it's actually worth anything or that it's actually going to be a good project in two years your Edge is the fact that it's going to come out at 100 Mil and that's what I don't like about this game that's why I don't really play it um as much you know I I I try to I try to keep my investments in in things that I'm willing to hold and not to sell and they want you you make a really interesting point about the relevance of knowing whether or not somebody's made it when you're trying to assess how helpful they will be in in partnering with you and it's it's funny in my Commodities trading career when I was you can't really do it at the junior levels at the junior levels when you're looking for a job you just you take what you can get once you have some experience and you become a desirable asset to a variety of firms um one of the best ways is to like to determine how well they're going to treat you and how generous they're going to be with your compensation uh I call it the the landglide test landglide is a site that Aggregates all property records in the United States of America uh into one clean user interface and so I I would look at whoever I was interviewing with or whoever I was going to report to when I was considering new jobs I would look on landglide to see what type of property they owned and what they paid for it um the reason why is if it's like some guy acting you know with a big title acting big but he lives in like a 1.1 million doll like Row House in a random part of Chicago hasn't made it right meanwhile if it's like some dude with three houses and you know $30 million worth of real estate that that person's made it and they're probably going to be less stingy about paying you and see it less as a zero sum game and more try to like make the pie bigger rather than slice you know look at it as just this small piie so I think the landglide test applies to crypto as well and you're right not to cor like followers follower count does not equal m itness you know there it's hard to know in crypto I guess but like yeah um I I also I also think like the the the relative seriousness at which people take posting is a good indication of how wealthy they are to be completely honest um like the you know I take I I take a little bit of pride in The Irregular irregular schedule of this podcast which basically tells you that we have other things that we should be doing but then we but then but then we get on this podcast and and you know we we try we try to make it work for you guys but like last year it was maybe this week maybe next week n maybe maybe there maybe Tuesday maybe Thursday you know and like the fact that you know regularly I won't post on Twitter for two weeks because I'll just be doing other stuff um dude you're making me look bad here right now I've never done Twitter before like recently and now like oh my God I love Twitter I post all the time making me look terrible yeah it's fine it's recent it's recent you know I was also like that in the beginning you know I was also poor in the beginning so's what's what's really going on over there I'm bored did you did you blow everything up did you try to short Trump coin oh yeah speaking of speaking of tokens that are questionable let's transition from aicc to dollar sign Trump oh my my God what the like I talked to a couple of hitters that went to the Trump uh inaugural crypto ball and apparently they didn't get the look like he just dropped it or his team just dropped this thing at like 900 PM Eastern on a Friday night obviously being in Europe and because Shabbat like I I was sleeping with my electronics turned off I missed it and woke up to a a really miss huge opportunity yeah you know you know what sucks is I I to bed at like 2: a.m. and I think it came out at 4:00 a.m. year uh Swiss time and that was really annoying because I woke up probably around nine and I'm going through all these messages and one of my analysts text me something really funny he goes he goes uh there's a huge liquidity suck because of this Trump thing uh once it blows over it might it it's absorbing all the liquidity this might be a buy opportunity for all once it stops tring liquidity we might get a bounce and I was like what do you mean because he goes once Trump stops trining liquidity I was like what do you mean once Trump stops trining liquidity like what what has Trump said or or what has Trump done and in the three minutes it took me from going to that message to like going on Twitter and figuring out what had actually happened not once did it cross my mind that this man had launched a meme coin I mean it's so crazy I that's that's a wild story so confused by that by that message I was like once Trump starts draining what what did he what happened I mean I think that first of all there there is no comprehending what this man was thinking launching this coin like I get it when he launches a perfume uh that's hilarious and kind of tongue and cheek this thing yeah so basically anybody with any shitcoin in their hot wallet sold it immediately to ape Trump and so everything that's been recently all the AI coins all the other meme coins like anything that people had in their Phantom wallet got sold instantly uh in a rush to buy this coin because you know you don't when something this huge launches you don't have a lot of time to like wait for a wire to clear into coinbase and then wait the eight days that it takes for a coinbase to release your funds to send it to Phantom like you just take whatever Capital you can on chain you get out at least that's that's how good trading works right like when there's when there's an amazing trade on the board and it's not going to last long you lift the offer you don't try to like get mids or get a better price like you just get you just trade you pay the you pay The Vig that's what people did so it really torched the alt space um sent Trump to 70 billion uh then Avi you're gonna learn this uh once you get married sometimes your wife will reign on on a really great parade right like sometimes she'll uh she'll be the party pooper uh not often but sometimes and then Melania showed up and and ended the fun and trumpcoin went from 70 billion down to 40 billion now uh unlike some other people who we discussed earlier in the podcast Trump hasn't dumped any coins on retail yet so technically that makes him less of a scammer than most uh I was expecting him to sell at least something at these crazy valuations what do you think yeah I mean the other thing that I think really it pissed a lot of people off is that it seems like a lot of people didn't get into it like when you know when when we woke up the thing was trading at 15 billion and it went to 70 like that was still a solid solid run that you could have captured they a 6X in there right there 5x whatever uh in there right there and I think it just really got under a lot of people's skins that they didn't ape into it at all because once it came out they're like ah 15 billion like that's crazy but like maybe it's going to reach parody with do um one thing that I'll say is that I think the launch of Melania and baron I mean I have no real information on it but it's possible that that launch was because they didn't extract enough they couldn't extract enough money from the first two from the first launch or because you know they it seemed like they were locked up what I will say is that there is a lot of sketchy behavior and there were a lot of wallets that got in very very very early and then held and made hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars and it's possible those are affiliated wallets and so so while it seems like he might not have sold it's very possible that he did and we just don't know or his affiliate sold and we and we just don't know um it this is a crazy precedent to set for a world leader to launch mcoin I mean I I know that this has been talked about ad nauseum on Twitter but this is like a insane precedent to set that you're effectively extracting value from your followers like is Trump coin going to exist in 10 years probably not it's this is nuts it's such a bad look for the space I mean like what we were expecting was a bunch of day one executive orders a pathway to regulatory framework and maybe a strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the first 100 days instead what we get is like an like an unannounced pre-inauguration scam coin launch that pissed off the crypto Community like the Builder community because obviously this is not what crypto is about uh if you're if you're trying to build decentralized payment rails and value transfer rails like that's that's not why like people take this industry seriously and and commit their careers and their livelihoods to it um equally uh you know you had I think one of the devs was like posting screenshots of his Phantom wallet with like eight figure gains in it you know kind of like flexing which I think is a bad look from the perspective Ive of just sort of insider trading um you know the cabal it's just it's a terrible look you're not supposed to do this when you're the leader of the Free World and you promis to to make the space like an integral part of the economy it just it it has like an ER of grift gritin now obviously the official wallet hasn't dumped anything yet but there's probably a whole lot of grifting going on around the edges like you said and finally like even the even the supposed iders the people who are part of this inner crypto Council Circle they weren't given the heads up either so it just leaves a bad taste in everybody's mouth now the one difference between you did mention the phrase value extraction the difference between this and other forms of value extraction like it could be considered a form of political donation right like what's the difference between donating a million dollars to the inaugural fund and yoloing you know five grand on trumpcoin you know it probably made some of his his base a whole lot wealthier as well so just maybe let's just think of it as like somewhere between a total scam which would be a disgrace for the United States of America and for crypto and like the next line of trump products this is the Trump Lottery right now one thing that I will say just to finish the thought he frakin legitimized salana right there like if you're a salana holder you can feel damp good about your bags for the next four years um the C Cino is called salana and Trump just created a massive game at the casino called you know Trump Melania and baron I view it I I I view the support for salana the same way that people would say that SBF supporting salana means that it goes up in a straight line right um it's basically as long as he's aligned with it that's great but he's also introduced a risk he's introduced a risk that if he ever at any point in the future decides to do anything not on salana salana is going to dump so hard you can't even imagine um with that being with that being said he's probably not going to launch anything anytime soon so I think we're probably out of the woods on that um but I don't view it as him giving his like stamp of approval to salana for the long term because I think what people always what you always have to remember that Trump is Trump is not a pro crypto pres president he's a prot trump president and so he'll just do whatever it takes to be good for himself like whatever whatever is going to be good for him is going to be what he supports um and if at some point crypto like you know if at some point he starts getting a huge amount of flack for this meme coin there's like a 30% chance he disavows it and goes and goes you know that was my team I like crypto I like Bitcoin but that was my team and I didn't I didn't really know what was going on and I would have put a stop to it if they had just asked me I don't know he he'll he'll find a he'll he'll find a way out of it if it starts looking bad for him let me let me say that he'll find a way out oh he will and also he's famous for not having a paper trail so there's no like wallet tracking that can be traced back to like Trump's individual trading decisions now so you make you bring up a very good point there what I will say is you know if Trump if we can assume as traders that our kind of like framework for assessing Trump's markets related uh decisions for the next four years should be like does this decision help Donald Trump get closer to being you know having his face put on Mount Rushmore or farther right like he's clearly optimizing to be put on Mount Rushmore he wants his legacy to be you know greatest president of all time he wants people to be worshiping uh worshiping statues of him so I think with that framework in mind you know we can also assume that he's acutely aware that becoming you know dabbling your toes into crypto is more dangerous than like creating TR you know like Trump branded bottles of wine right like SPF is sitting in prison right now for a big scam and Trump is no stranger to legal proceedings so I think he's GNA be I think he's got to be aware of that and I don't think that we can expect this to turn into like a huge debacle I think it's just like more somewhere between a national embarrassment and an eyebrow raising uh eyebrow raising moment where at least this this time unlike the Ico boom unlike nfts unlike the brief moment in 2021 when people thought crypto was going to go mainstream at least at least crypto is sort of coming of age in the sense that uh the gambling use case is really at the Forefront Trump owns casinos this is kind of to me I just I I think it's a game it's a trump branded game and I as sad as it is uh that's all there is to say earlier in today's episode I mentioned Ledger latest products the stacks and flex and I wanted to take a few seconds to tell you more about them these wallets feature the world's first secure touch screens which don't just simplify your digital transactions but also keep them extremely safe these wallets are virtually impenetrable to online attacks because they store your private key in a secure offline chip you can manage more than 5,500 tokens and install up to 100 apps choose the most trusted name in Hardware wallets and take control of your digital Security today at ledger.com or hit the link in the description of today's episode to check out their latest wallets I hope my comments didn't make you think that I was saying that this is a bad thing CU it's very much so not necessarily a bad thing it's just that all of the good things have been so thoroughly discussed everywhere else that I wanted to provide some level of temperance against where where it could go wrong I mean this is unambiguous ly as it stands right now a very good thing and the reason that it's a very very good thing is because it's drawing a tremendous amount of attention to crypto huge amounts of the dumbest people in the world have just become very wealthy uh a lot of that money is going to be recycled um you know when when people make these kinds of gains they tend to not hold on to them they tend to continue to gamble them they tend to not you know and that that money that money recyc itself very well one thing that really stood out to me was just how poor the entire rest of the market did and that has everything to do with what you said in the beginning which is you just you didn't have time to go wire money in you just had to sell whatever you held and get in to Trump some way and I think that is going to you know that liquidity suck we're slowly going to start to see money come back in to these other Arenas and I I do think that this makes it a huge buying opportunity for AI coins not necessarily for meme coins in general because I think that Meme coins are gonna they're they're going to be competed you know they're going to be outcompeted by Trump I think if you like you your your idea is okay I want to buy a leading meme coin you you have to allocate to Trump now um whereas AI agents like it's a real like real product real narrative real building um the only thing is that speculation has been drawn away right now I mean if you saw virtual revenue is down 99% from the hivs and a lot of that is due just you know the the hype cycle has passed and people have stopped talking about AI which tends to make it a really good time to actually go in and buy like once people have stopped talking about it that's when you should probably be allocating I completely agree uh I tweeted something to that effect yesterday I I think that that promising projects that could be the base layer for a variety of different agents that cross the chasm into the mainstream like in particular virtuals and AI 16z you know I think I think these levels are starting to get tasty now um I obviously bought virtuals below here and AI 16z above here but like you said you know I I don't think that this was a like frothy Peak Pico top moment for the if it were you would have seen fresh Capital allocating to Trump and all the other coins going up in sympathy with it instead what happened is people just rotated from their existing meme coins into Trump and so like I do think this is kind of a nail in the coffin for whiff for for goat for a lot of these random you know like no utility meme coins but over the long run like you said I think some of the more interesting projects that are actually building and shipping stuff that people will use like the Eliza framework uh just as an example or maybe hyper liquid too um this is a great entry point because you've just had it's like a it's a technical sell-off it's not a fundamental sell-off uh I know I know I probably look ridiculous talking about fundamentals and meme coins in the same sentence but like a technical sell-off is just when you have a bunch of capital exiting the space for exogenous reasons having nothing to do with the thesis itself and a fundamental sell-off would like all right new regulation has passed that renders this type of investment like less less worthy of your time or makes the risk reward way worse and it's really the former it's a technical sellout it was like a a big liquidity vacuum that that drove this thing so I do think it's a great investment opportunity for the other AI coins I also I also continue to expect that AI Mania is coming sometime this year I don't think we've seen anything close to what Mania looks like um and in ter when we get to like just as a barometer for Mania AI um any if you want to do an interesting thought experiment everybody follows a constellation of accounts on crypto Twitter rewind the clock to when Trump was trading 60 billion or 70 billion near the highs basically look at those hours and then cross reference them with the tweets that you got in your feed from various accounts Shilling that coin and saying saying it was going to go higher those are those accounts who are like telling you to buy it on the highs when it was obviously like turning into something unsustainably ridiculously expensive those are the Mania accounts right use those accounts as a barometer when they start Shilling something that's just 10x like then you know you're in Mania mode and it's time to reduce so that'll be like a good that'll be like when when the accounts that were Shilling Trump at 70 billion and telling it was going to 10x from there when they start telling you your AI coins are going to 10x after they've just 10 xed that's when you get out we're not even close to that right now nobody none of those accounts are even talking about AI why because it hasn't rallied in the last 24 hours you know 100% agree that's I mean I think the right the right way to look at it is there there are certain people that only bull post at the highs and there's certain people that get really really really damn excited when something is very obvious and the reason is because in order if you want to Bull poost when something's not so clearly obvious you actually need a little bit of guts to do it you need to say okay well you know I might be wrong like we're sitting here AI coins are down a ton might be wrong we might look like idiots for the next month or so uh but we're going to make the call that at some point in the next few weeks it's there going to be a pretty radical bottom if it hasn't already happen so you just going to start buying some now uh you know we're going to we're going to make that call and I think it's always better to shill on the way down than it's to shill on the way up yeah as they say uh wealth is made in bare markets yeah wealth is found in bare markets and then made in B markets right sorry got that wrong important important distinction there thank you for correcting me important well that's okay um yeah I mean I I think that I think that this can go for a bit I I do I am still bullish on drum you know funny enough why because I think that there's still a lot of people that aren't in it I think that if Trump's team isn't and this is maybe giving him a bit too much credit but if Trump's team isn't completely then they're going to figure out a way to add value to this meme like they're going to figure out how to do something yeah I mean I think it's a very low like let me let me talk first of all I don't want to touch this trumpcoin with a 10- foot pole I don't understand it my mem coin framework is if you're early ape as fast as you can sell your other shitcoins to buy buy the new thing um if you're if you're not early like tread with Extreme Caution and by the time I turned my phone back on on Saturday night I was clearly not early to this so I'm I'm sticking I'm I'm remaining disciplined and avoiding this thing like the plague but watching it interestingly as as you would watch you know the spread of a plague so let me let me attempt to construct a scenario where Trump gives Trump coin utility and the thing continues to Rally imagine you know I the ethics of this are questionable but that's just his modus operandi at this point let's say that he just announced that he was going to 80% of the proceeds from trumpcoin sales to the United States Treasury or to the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin Reserve or in some way basically said hey I'm gonna take the value creation that I've you know enjoyed from this launch and I'm going to give it to the American people right then I could easily see uh foreign governments Copans people currying you know seeking to Curry favor with him in you know offering to invest in this coin uh because that all all that sort of thing goes behind goes on behind the scenes all the time I know this for a fact because I saw how the sausage was made in Commodities like the sort of you know hey we'll buy your oil uh in exchange for you like not not enacting some policy that hurts us you know like WTI that Texas you know West Texas intermediate is shipped out of various ports in Texas to all sorts of adversaries and allies alike in exchange for all kinds of all kinds of favors and Deals and smoke filled back room related uh pcts so I could easily see Trump coin becoming like this commodity that's treated like that and if if you see hints that that's starting to happen then you know this thing could get pretty fraking big I I assumed that would happen with Bitcoin you know but not this I mean here's here's another question at post Trump launching this or any other world leaders going to do it too is this is this going to spread I think uh Cuba like is doing something with a shitcoin I know Maduro created the Petro back in the day but that obviously didn't go very far I I do think it's it sets a precedent though it basically it gives every other world leader permission to to start messing around with crypto I'm just looking here it looks like the Cuba coin was uh was fake looks like it was hacked oh so so they they did you you are right the official government did post about the cubic coin but it then they rescinded it and said sorry there was an issue with our account how Cuban of them yeah that was that was definitely their like poverty stricken analy marketing guy that was like oh wow I can make it um but not Cuba Cuba hasn't done anything but Mark cuin has oh my God he he tweeted that he he wants to have a meme coin that will fund the national debt it's pretty funny uh uh yeah I mean he says if meme coins are the way maybe I'll issue in issue one with a Twist same terms As Trump 20% float same release schedule one difference all the revenue from the sale of the coins goes to the US Treasury you know what's you know what's really funny like he doesn't I don't think he gets it he goes all the revenue from the sale of the coins goes to the US Treasury what what revenue from what sale of sale of coins because you just SE it so you have to sell in order to generate Revenue right this isn't like uh he's like think about like a stock issuance it's like I'm gonna issue these coins and you know blah blah blah but I I I think that he you know he's gonna have to sell yeah also that's just called paying your taxes if you want to give money to the treasury you pay your taxes also another thing like let's say you wanted to give a million but it's it's a it's a way it's a way to pay your taxes but make money while you do it which imagine imagine if like you had a scheme where all of the money that was you like used to give to the government you was a credit on your taxes so like all of the money that Mark cuin made from this thing was a credit on your taxes if you own a coin God I I I should I should I should pitch that ai ai Felman 2028 I can see it coming uh Obi for president I mean here's here's the interesting thing right back in 2021 they branded crypto as web 3 it was really an amazing it it was it was amazing PR for the space like it made sense it was it it legitimized some of the sketchier aspects of crypto me the word meme coins kind of does the same like at the end of the day this should just be called Ponzi Lottery coins right like can you get in faster than the herd for something that attracts some shiny object that attracts attention for 10 seconds or maybe 10 minutes or in the case of trump maybe years like these are all just Ponzi coins they're just Ponzi schemes and there's or pyramid schemes I I'm not really sure which maybe a bit of both it's it's so weird to me that this is what people are doing now to with crypto like fine I'll take it the broader macroeconomy produces trillions of dollars of value from legitimate activities like farming and services and you know trade and I guess some of that has to go into entertainment and some of the entertainment budget is gambling and this is gambling so that's great but like I would have expected crypto to take a slightly more legitimate turn under the Trump presidency and I think what one thing that I'm I'm looking for as a personal investor like Bitcoin is great that's great but for everything else in my book uh I'm just like trying to keep my finger on the pulse and monitor like will this space ever Veer back in outside of gambling into the slightly more legitimate seeming things like payments and global trade or or are we just like I don't know Avi I want to get your take on this I is this it have we reached like the iPhone moment for crypto and the the iPhone is just an online casino and that's as good as this is going to get like yes or no I mean I would kill myself if this was iPhone moment for crypto but in in some ways you're you're not wrong and specifically you're not wrong because we've been saying for a very long time that the whole point of crypto is gambling the whole point of crypto is for it to go up and for you to be able to make 10x 20x 30X your money this is the ultimate lottery ticket like the Trump coin is the ultimate lottery ticket it doesn't get bigger than this there's no way it's basically impossible for any single person on the planet to create a meme coin that generates as much wealth As Trump did like it's just not possible you know nobody nobody has that kind of reach nobody has that audience th this is this was the peak wealth generation event of a lifetime and you probably missed it and that's okay there will be others but this was the peak one and you know when I say Peak wealth generation of of a lifetime I mean the most amount of money made in the shortest period of time like I think I think there will obviously be things that can make you more money because they'll be worth more than 100 billion and they'll you know but I I I I don't necessarily think that there will be anything that will go up to 70 billion as quickly as this thing did ever again yeah I mean Trump is the most famous person Trump is the most famous person in the world by an order of magnitude like tribesmen in the subsaharan African plane know who Donald Trump is I'm trying to think of who is like better known than Trump maybe Jesus Christ or Michael Jackson so unless one of those two people comes back to life and launches a meme coin you are right Obby like it's this this was it this was this was the moment that generated the most amount of wealth in the shortest period of time and it's never happening again I I'm I'm still processing this like and I don't even know what it means for crypto I I still think it's it's bullish but like I'm kind of embarrassed at the moment you know yeah I mean it's it's it's to it's totally nuts I mean the the be the best thing that I can think about you know the the best move that I have right now is just buy by BTC and instead of the you remember the old BTC meme coin barbell that we used to talk about now it's a BTC AI coin barbell I like that um I like that a lot eth forget forget me coins I mean like seriously like like like forget eth forget meme coins like it might be hard and you might still hold them and you might be down but like who's who's buying them now like who's G to do that yeah I mean the I think the best I would make a slight modification to your trade idea I would say like let's say you had $100 to invest in crypto to me you know not Financial advice I would say $80 in Bitcoin 10 in salana 10 in AI coins and that's a very like lopsided barbell maybe your left arm is pressing a lot more weight than your right but like if you're expecting the AI coins to 10x in Mania mode sometime in the next 12 months your barbell will be pretty even by then maybe you know maybe salana will have 3x and the AI coins will have 10x and your Bitcoin will have 2X and you're feeling really smart about yourself or maybe all this shit's going to zero but like if if if it is all going to zero you'd certainly rather be in Bitcoin than some of these other tokens that literally in the last 72 hours went down anywhere from 30 to to 80% H scare like scary times man this is this is volatile no Trump didn't publish any executive orders on crypto in day one but he did say he's gonna free Ross alri I think he's just getting his like major mandate things out of the way and I I do think he will I do think he will reach crypto it's just not something that he's going to prioritize to the degree that he he's going to put it in his inauguration speech it's it's gonna it's gonna come we just have to give it give it some time I mean you know I think Alexander good had a good Alexander good had a good tweet he said for those of you that are incapable of basic analysis no he's not mention any crypto during his speech because he just launched a me a meme coin that went to 70 billion that everyone in the United States heard about like the the dude has not given up on crypto yeah and World Liberty financials like actively buying eth actively buying Tron actively buying I think a few other yeah uh Athena pretty insane it's like this is what happens when you put your genz uh NYU kid in charge of crypto policy oh my God this what it feels like we're living in a simulation this is all so insane I I mean yeah I would just say you know for anybody who's listening to this right now nothing we say is financial advice tread very carefully out there this is some of the wildest price action volatility and like unscripted unimaginable series of events that I've ever seen in any markets in my career this is this is fraking wild yeah it's insane it's totally insane I don't know what what else Jonah what else you got for me should we just wrap it there and let you get back to your um think so your your Dolce V I'm so happy for you AI I'm so happy for you I'll be back uh I'll be back in the state soon back back to the desk working uh but for now I'm going to enjoy these last few hours of uh do Vita they say ah bless love you man great talking to you congratulations and honestly so so so thrilled what a wonderful moment enjoy every second of it it goes fast take care Jah you to later [Music]

imagine selling Bitcoin at 92k because you're worried about a non-farm payrolls print 8 days before regime change in Washington and not not just any regime change this regime change right so to me

Ledger stacks and The Ledger Flex featuring the world's first secure touch screens take your security seriously hit the link in the show notes of today's episode to check out their latest devices trust me you won't regret [Music] it okay welcome back to another thousand X podcast we got a lot to talk about this week don't we Obi lot is going on we we do we do have a lot lot lots going on um Market has been very volatile up and down left and right and we got a lot of hate for our last podcast because we talked about how much we hate sooie we got attacked pretty pretty mercilessly by the by the suie community they remind me a lot of the xrp guys actually you know what's funny um I took another crack at trying to understand why sui matters after the vitri all and the hate and the best bull case I could come up with for suie after all the vitriol and the hate was the vitriol and the hate right like there was this moment in late 2023 when I put out this tweet I was like i' had a a bottle of wine I was in Rome sorry Venice having a good time and I put out a tweet with a little bit of free time about how salana is [ __ ] and I talked about you know like kind of well articulated but not that well researched reasons why salana is ultimately dubed to fail the token was trading like $20 at the time and it immediately got like 700,000 views everybody started hating on me that bald guy who's like the cheerleader for the community started freaking out and telling you know calling me names and insulting my parents and stuff and I thought okay wow this is like I guess this this ecosystem isn't dead in fact the opposite of it it's it's vibrant right like people really care they've invested their livelihoods in this thing and then we got toally on the podcast the next week and then you know I don't know about you but I I got bullish $10 token higher than than where I was Max bearish um so and obviously didn't buy enough but I bought some I think something similar is going on with suie here which is that if you bear post and you immediately have people coming out of the woodwork to tell you how you know stupid and ugly you are that's it's a sign that people care like you're people are really invested in this chain they're invested in working in it the community is there like trying to pump this thing and make it go up um it doesn't feel like a bunch of people who are just long on the highs un unsure why there is some clear technical advantages that sui has that was reflected also in the blockworks research survey where they asked a bunch of salana developers if you were working on another chain you weren't allowed to work on salana what would it be the vast majority picked Bas or suie um and those the two responses Bas and sui were were tied uh every nothing else even came close so to me the Rabid Community is the reason why we might see a self-reinforcing rally beyond that I kept trying to debate people on Twitter and ask what is the actual business case for this chain and people would say oh you're so stupid you don't understand the tech it's just better than everything else but I I would keep you know prodding and saying what's what's the business case like why what you know blockchains sell blocks space why would buyers of blocks space prefer this blockchain to any other is there any unique product or service that can only work on this chain that can't really work that well on the more established chains no one could answer my question with a straight face they could only insult me uh and tell me that I'm you know a non-technical idiot so I you know it to me it reminds me of previous block blockchains that have been technologically superior to the incumbent but that technological superiority hasn't necessarily translated into um upward price action sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't um I don't think there's enough like if you aren't if you aren't holding SOI bags from the lows and you know rolling in money right now I don't think there's a compelling reason to invest here yeah I mean I I I agree with all those points I think what's clear what what's what very clear to me is that suie has managed to build a pretty crazy Community but not just of retail investors there are like a lot of VC funds and hedge funds that have started to take it seriously and I think it stems from the fact that these guys you know they were they were building at Facebook they're building at meta like these these were a serious te it was suie it was sui and Aptos and Aptos kind of [ __ ] the bed uh nobody really talks about it anymore yeah what happened there they were the more uh vaunted product when they launched and then the founder just quit the hell's going on there I think so when we were when we were diligen in them way back in the day what was always said to us is that the suoi guys were better like actual better tech people but the Aptos guys were better marketing and Business Development people and I think what ended up happening with Aptos is that they just never really got the product to the place that they needed it to get to and the sooie guys learned how to Market their good Tech right they did they did build good Tech um as far as I as far as I can understand it like look I'm not a Dev it's not like I've uh Gone on and actually built something on sui and I can verify uh but I'm going off secondhand information of people that have built on it it's like okay yeah it's pretty good Dev developers seem seem to like it have not heard anything of that sort from Aptos so I do think that they they sort of took atos's niche away from them um you know Aptos wasn't able to capitalize on the initial hype that surrounded it they weren't able to turn that into real usership and I think what's happening right now is that sui's just cannibalized it completely now is it worth 52 billion no and I think it's kind of nuts to think that it will it'll stay up here but is it something that might actually stick around yeah um because I think what they to do is they've actually managed to get to a place like unlike a lot of these other chains um they managed to get to a place where people are taking them Ser like devs are taking them seriously right like nobody ever nobody really nobody ever really took near seriously despite their claims of having great developer tools and you know a better a better ecosystem for for building I mean they raised that $800 million ecosystem fund but people that was there was all fugazi right and the people that were building on near wen't actually building anything real they were just porting over copycats from from the rest of the world um I do think what it does say is that like if you go look at the top Assets Now um like sui has reached parody with Avalanche and Avalanche had such a huge head start on suie and I think what it tells you is that people don't want sub Nets people don't want l2s people want a fast Bas Slayer chain and that's kind of what you're seeing with the fracturing of of ethereum as well it's like people just don't want interoperability between all these different chains they want one good chain because otherwise it's too confusing and nobody has figured out the UI to make all of these subnets uh you know very easily usable that brings me back to my original question though salana serves that purpose right you know I understand I've I've been educated by the online community of anti- Jona people that suie can do things that salana can't it's faster it provides better you know I guess to use a non-technical term better tagging for asset ownership than salana perhaps maybe it's less buggy who knows though it hasn't been battle tested but let's just assume that it is still like that that alone isn't enough like I think SOI is the kind of product that you buy during the next bare market like it will go through a winter all of crypto will go through a winter all these tokens will shank sooi is probably one of those things that you're going to want to accumulate for the next cycle when everybody writes off all of these all l1s is dead but the sui Builder Community is still strong still grinding still trying to put apps together and and Achieve product Market fit and then some Smash Hit will come out during the bare Market that you can capitalize on in the next Bull I I don't think I don't think it's a good trade to be buying it here at 50 billion and that's nothing against suie that's just that's just markets and valuations you know um this it's it's overpriced relative to what it is right this second and it'll probably be a good dip by for the next run I I think that's an amazing framing I think that makes a ton of sense I mean it's one of those things that if it exists through a bare market and if it maintains its Community that's going to be like another 100 xer in a after the next buy I mean you can you you kind of could do this with salana right everybody thought salana died but they maintained their core Community they maintained uh their their developers people never fully gave up on it even post FTX and that led it from going you know went from $8 to 200 from from from the low from the low to the highs in the in the bull just just recently so I think the same thing could could happen with sui if if they manag to keep on to that hype um I mean but just like looking at like looking looking at the tvl on sui looking at the applications on sui they they don't really have like a killer app yeah in in any in any meaningful way like their biggest biggest protocol is a sui lend protocol that just looks like you like you go to the website it looks like any other borrow lend protocol that's ever existed but the one thing that I'll say is it's growing like Su sui is growing quickly yeah I mean also like the amount of hate that we got for suggesting God forbid that sui might not be a good you know value for your money at this particular point in time was not even close to the amount of hate that I got for suggesting that salana was torched right like when I suggested that there were literally 100x as many salana Die hards coming out of the woodwork to engage whereas this time yeah and and actually at that point salana was about was was actually lower in price yeah it wasn't on the highs it was close to the lows let me let me actually see where where was salana when so salana was right now is 92 billion in terms of in terms of market cap when and you decided to [ __ ] on it and call it stupid that was last that was like November 23 yeah that that was that was no no I think it was October October yeah yeah anyway o October of 23 and it was at about 15 mil 15 Bill sorry 15 bill in market cap so actually about a third of the size that suie is today and it had a larger Community more more more active community around it so I mean look I agree the the way the way to play this is kind of just to ignore it until you get to the bare market and then it's a freaking amazing amazing trade if you get into the bare market and it still has a good Community surrounding it so you know I definitely definitely keep an eye out um you know one one thing that we actually H haven't really talked about on this on the on this podcast um is hype and it plans to become an over arching L1 what's kind of cool is that very rarely do you see an like an application go backwards into an L1 because you know normally you have like the l1s they have a massive valuation premium so if you're going to launch any project uh you're you're GNA you're going to launch an L1 right and if you're launching an application you're probably launching it on on an on an L1 and you don't have any Ambitions to to become an L1 but now hype is sort of backed in backed into this which has massively raised their potential valuation and it's also cool because you now have an L1 that has a baked in killer app which is very rare like normally l1s are searching for their killer app instead of a you know the killer app becoming an L1 um so I'm uh you know we're off like 50% from the highs I think people have generally stopped talking about about it uh in the way that they were talking about it two weeks ago and the entire timeline was just like bull poting hyper liquid which is almost never a good time to buy like when the big when the biggest holders of this thing feel so good about themselves like they can end every tweet with Hyper liquid and they can like go after people kind of left and right mercilessly I think like so flood is I think the the biggest proponent of this guy or this uh this this product this guy was having way too much fun on Twitter when hyper liquid was like 30 bucks just like he was having way too much fun and I like hyper liquid um you know I'm I'm a fan I'm I'm an owner but when when somebody's having that much fun on Twitter with their with their number one bag at at the at the highs you know you should probably start chipping out a little bit at least easy to say I mean like we're all we're all having fun when crypto's ripping and uh it's hard to know when it stops because you're not in it for like a 10 or 20% rally you're in these you're in these tokens for a 5 to 10x at a bare minimum because at the end of the day that's the kind of risk that you're taking to the downside too so yeah I don't know about hyper liquid I feel like well first of all like just to call it spade a spade hyper liquid is built using the cosmos SDK right it's it's like it's I I mean I looked into this when I did my research a while ago on hyper liquid and ultimately concluded not to buy on the lows which was stupid in hindsight but it uses a um it uses tendermint it's part of the cosmos SDK it's part of their ecosystem so like if they become an L1 is that bullish Cosmos what else is going to get built on hyper liquid other than their Cosmos Cosmos is done Cosmos is now public infrastructure yeah they their token has no real use they did great stuff for the crypto Community by basically building a actually pretty good framework but the token itself is like done right like it's over like that's that's in in in the past I mean I don't think it's ever it's ever really coming back they they have no real leadership now that being said we are always going to be indeed to them for what they did for the industry which is build a really phenomenal framework and come up with new consensus mechanisms to drive the industry forward so we appreciate them for that but I mean I don't think buying the the Adam token makes any sense in any meaningful way yeah I agree how ironic would it be if the most successful Cosmos outcome is hyper liquid which is basically built with cosmos's technology and they benefit not at all from it I don't know I I think that with Hyper liquid okay so let's say they go backwards and become an L1 you already have a community of enriched bag holders sitting there they want to keep the train moving forward they're going to build all sorts of other interesting stuff on hyper liquid or uninteresting I I think that's the next move for hyper liquid you have to see like is this just an exchange or are they figuring out other unique applications for this latency sensitive platform beyond the same crap that's on every other chain including you know suie and tana and Bas and eth um if it's just if it's just a bunch of like Unis swap style dexes I mean forget that for forget forget about forget about anything Jonah for forget about anything these guys just based on being an exchange are undervalued and so if they figure out a way to even get a few applications other applications built on them as as an L1 they deserve to be valued higher that's my take I mean right now I think they're trading at like a 12 to 15 when it comes to you know their their Ford multiple so it's yeah that's yeah I agree earlier in today's episode I mentioned Ledger latest products the stacks and flex and I wanted to take a few seconds to tell you more about them these wallets feature the world's first secure touch screens which don't just simplify your digital transactions but also keep them extremely safe these wallets are virtually impenetrable to online attacks because they store your private key in a secure offline chip you can manage more than 5,500 tokens and install up to 100 apps choose the most trusted name in Hardware wallets and take control of your digital Security today at ledger.com or hit the link in the description of today's episode to check out their latest wallets I see a downward Trend channel in the midst of a market where the Benchmark Bitcoin is ranging sideways so like my take on this is that the market has shown its hand for what's going to perform during the next phase of this bull cycle and yes I do believe there will be a next phase there's a debate about whether we've peaked or not in this cycle I think I think we're I think we're going much much higher and I think when we do the market has shown its hand in terms of what's going to rip hyper liquid is clearly gonna rip right like those cards got shown a couple weeks ago maybe soie as much as I hate it will Rip um the AI coins like Ai 16z and virtuals will Rip but in the absence of sector wide momentum in the absence of a rising tide I think it's interesting that all those coins are just kind of spiral in lower and lower they're grinding they're not like tanking but they're grinding lower every day or every week and to me that's relevant because it shows you that that's hot money that's what that's where people are who feel rich are throwing their cash behind and it's hard to feel rich when your bitcoin's just like knocking around like a pinball machine between 92 and 98k right if we take a NE but if we take the next leg higher to 125 or 150 you know 150k Bitcoin the hot money is going to flow right back in and lift like power lift those those tokens so to me um I I don't think it's a like you know again I have a more medium to longterm trading style than you do but I wouldn't be buying hyper liquid for the sake of example here at $20 a token right now trying to catch that falling knife I would rather bu hyper liquid at whatever price it's at when Bitcoin breaks through the top of the range and keeps sending you know or I mean by the way let me let me just clarify one thing I'm like I'm not talking about how you accumulate your first position right like yes it would be good to have some hyper liquid here but it could go down another 50% before it starts to Rally so I think like I think your conviction buys maybe you scale in by for now with small size and then if you're going going to do a big slug on high conviction it's when the Market's rallying again and that goes for virtuals AI 16z and you know some of the other stuff that performed recently as well yeah I don't know if I I mean look I think the the thing the thing with Hyper liquid that is a little bit is just a little bit different to me is that there are so many people that miss this that what what I watch the most um when I look at a chart like hyper liquid is actually the flows of the token so are the big buyers buying or selling right now and basically since 30 what you started to see like once once I hit 30 a lot of the big wallets started moving and actually offloading and taking a ton of profit and a lot of them are actually just starting now to buy back below below 20 and 18 and so what I know is that there like there's actually like a significant amount of money that is coming back in to buy this thing below 20 and 18 and the longer that we hold above that a lot of the people that missed out on that first rally are going to come come back in and I just don't see that many large holders offloading anymore like they're just not really selling whereas with virtuals just just like just like talking about another chart that looks completely different uh virtuals from the time so when we first talked about it it was trading at like 225 or like when we when we launched our THX token it was trading at 225 goes all the way the way up to 520 and is now all the way back down to 270 and people are just hammering this thing they're absolutely hammering this thing and the reason that they're hammering this thing as far as I can tell is that there are a lot of competitors that have popped up that are better I mean look I love virtuals because it's where we launched our our token and they were very good to us in the beginning but we actually migrated off their framework yeah I mean to be Fair their no code framework is what we migrated off of we migrated to Elisa which is ai6 Z's framework which is a you write tons of code framework and the reason why we did that was because a no code framework just isn't good enough for most Bots however to be completely fair to virtuals they do have their own you write a bunch of code framework it's called game we just didn't we we didn't choose to go down that road because Ela was so popular on GitHub that it seemed like a no-brainer for us to explore that in the limited amount of time that we had well yeah I mean that that that's that's kind of what I'm saying is that there I talked about this a little bit on the steady Lads podcast that I went on on Friday and somebody pulled up a chart of AI market cap versus defi market cap and we're not even like we we weren't even halfway there right there's still so much more more for the AI crypto space to grow I've seen seen 15 billion estimates right can you just State the numbers that you saw on the chart for the listeners uh I think I saw 10 billion versus 50 okay what what what did you see I mean i' I've heard that AI is 15 billion right now it's probably 10 since since I saw that and that def in the peak of D5 summer D5 market cap was 150 billion I don't know I I haven't run these computations myself at any great I just wanted to get the numbers out there for the listeners please continue your thought there's there's a different I mean there's a huge difference the difference between a these AI things and defi is that defi inherently has Network effects built into it right the larger an exchange get like a Unis swap the more liquidity they have the better it is as a product the more liquidity a borrow line protocol has the better it is as a product and so inherently as winners get larger they become actually harder to displace not easier to displace whereas it's they're basically no switching costs relative uh in AI it's so much easier like we you don't lose anything by switching from one framework to another really in the same way I disagree with that moving off of I mean you're right in the sense that we could technically clone our agent on game or any other framework or just build one ourselves um and then when we get our bot to a sufficient level of of Competency uh we just turn off our Ela bot and migrate to the new bot but that would be a heroic pain in the ass what I will say is for a no code framework um like what virtuals promoted to get us on board it is very easy to switch you literally just copy paste a few um questionnaire boxes from one framework to another so for the no code stuff literally as seamless as you know switching from Uber to lift for a given ride for a full code framework like Elisa it would be pretty heroic for us to switch we'd have to do a lot of work let me let me reframe this the more people that use a framework that doesn't necessarily make it better yes right like obviously if you have better smarter people contributing to a framework in larger quantity and like improving the framework then it's better uh but just like the usage of the Frameworks don't make don't make it better and so I think that the network effects are a lot smaller and that end like what what I'm trying to get to at the end here is that in defi it was pretty reasonable to assume that once you hit like $20 billion in market cap and you think you're going to100 billion in market cap it's very reasonable to just buy the top 10 defi protocols and say if defi does well these top 10 D5 protocols will do well whereas in AI I think it's a lot harder to say I think AI is going to grow therefore I'm just going to buy the top 10 biggest AI projects because it's so much easier to disrupt them dude it's it's so interesting I like that take I hadn't thought about it that way before but we've seen this now with three different protocols right like we've seen first it was bit tensor tow go to the moon and then just kind of stall out like Plateau it was weird um okay maybe that's a unique ecosystem that's a little bit complicated hard for people to understand maybe the space is going a mimar Direction all right so then virtuals shows up virtuals to the Moon we're all feeling pretty dude you forgot you you forgot about goat yeah goat was cool B there's so many different Cycles already yeah these things though like I used to think that this is going to be like defi where it's like okay AI Mania is coming to crypto that's my conviction trade I'm just going to be long the top 10 call options that position me for that and that doesn't look like it's going to work like these things just rip and then they fizzle and to your point about Network effects and defi not not really like the analogy not working in AI like the more people that use the Elisa framework the worse it becomes almost because your Bot is going to sound like all the other Alisa Bots like the the more people use a certain framework the more commoditized it comes and the attention you're trying to farm with these Bots is like you're not trying to be a commodity to farm attention you want to you want to stand out you want to be unique to farm attention so I take your point there um I still think AI Mania is coming to crypto and I think still think that all of this stuff is going vertical but you've definitely made me more cautious and made me want to sell some uh you know I'm deeply in the money on virtuals deeply out of the money on AI 16z which I added on the highs and then I've got a constellation of other little coins that I'm experimenting with that don't really move the needle in my portfolio um I don't know I think you're right I think it's probably like you hold small percentages of those things just in case they come back but you don't Place big bets on them here virtual is an AI 16z yeah I that's a little bit of what I'm thinking I mean virtuals like if it really washes out I mean I'm probably rebid between $2 and $2.30 I think that's a reasonably good level to get back in but right now it's just full downward Trend and the conversation is it's being outpaced by every every other framework out there yeah and so therefore it doesn't really make sense to get in and buy it I don't know we should probably talk about our token podcasters launching tokens and where some of these agents can go in terms of like vision and the future because I I personally think agents are going to be the the the part of this AI sector that really sticks and achieves mainstream appeal in the next 12 months would you agree with that yeah yeah I think I think I think that's I think that's very reasonable I don't really know where El it's AI fits in to be completely honest fits into crypto like like where else other than yeah like where like where where does Ai and crypto fit in besides these these types of protocols maybe dpin decentralized compute but I don't think that's decentralized uh gpus or something but render render's been trying to do that near dip their toes it's not really getting traction to me an agent is really the only thing where you could cross the chasm from crypto nerds to the mainstream and you know we could talk about like what we want to do with our agent uh and how it could potentially cross that Chasm um at this particular juncture I don't know basically to me an agent like a bot that posts content and that is interactive and that is trained on some unique training set has Universal appeal it doesn't matter whether it's Tesla's full self-driving trained on their millions of hours of driving videos or a little Twitter bot that's trained on our podcast like agents have Universal appeal and can be understood by people outside of the crypto world I think I'm still trying to understand why these these projects need tokens but it is sort of a form of equity that people can use to monitor the progress and traction of an agent so it's useful in a certain sense tokens aside though our THX agent has begun tweeting you know interesting crypto updates synthesis and and takes on those updates it incorporates um you know momentum and technicals into its takes it tries to understand the backdrop for that news and synthesize a bullish or a bearish opinion with degrees of bullishness and bearishness it understands what's neutral it understands what's not we've built in a character file that references our podcast transcripts we've built in uh crypto Market Niche knowledge that you and I have accumulated over years years like we the bot understands how to think about certain types of developments in the crypto Market which by which by the way is is actually like a completely underrated portion of this is that in order to train an agent to be good at something you you need to be good at it like you can't just have like random devs building trading agents because they don't know how to trade and so they don't know how to like how to even teach the bot like what parameters do you put in like what data do you ingest what what do you look at how do you synthesize it a lot of that is manual that like we have to give it the parameters ourselves right like okay if open interest goes up like what does that mean means X in context a and Y in context B so you and I have literally had to input that into the bot and train it and like building that for crypto is something you and I could do building it for oil is something I could do building it for like distressed credit you and I might you and I might struggle right like we need to bring on but we can we can bring but I think one thing that's becoming very clear to me is how useful these things are going to be in a broad variety of contexts and how actually once you dive into it I mean Jonah you've spent a lot more time on prompt engineering than I have but there's some core tenants that hold true across like whatever whatever you're trying to like whatever Market you're trying to teach this thing on there's some there's some core tenants and so once you build one it becomes a lot easier to build the next one as you you you understand the process and so at the end of the day this thousand xbot it's going to start on crypto but it's gonna it's going to expand it's going to come like a trading personal assistant for whatever Market you want it to be a trading personal assistant for which I think is going to be pretty sick um it's just going to require a lot of like you know we're we're going to grit our teeth and and work through it but it's going to be it's going to be pretty Broad based and broad-reaching by the time that we're done with it and and it all started as a little it all started as like a little joke yeah it was a pet project like you launched it while I was sleeping then we like started jamming on it together it's so fun to work on this like basically the road map would be we're GNA make this bot excellent at its current Mission which is your crypto Market sidekick that keeps you up to date on everything that's going on and helps you understand whether or not it matters and if it matters why and how much right so we're going to make that as as good as we can for crypto then I think it's a pretty light lift to copy paste that into Commodities and we can just you know crowdsource the relevant Commodities Market context then we can put it in every other Market as well but even before we do any of that you know outside of crypto stuff we you know we have sponsors we have Partners we have people in our Network that run interesting crypto platforms where we could incorporate the Thousand xbot into their terminals their user experience um this thing could look at your positions and be your little sidekick that that you know voice in your ear that talks to you about what you're doing um in a way that you couldn't necessarily rely on chat GPT to do for you um so I think that there's utility there and then the big Vision once we've got this thing going for all markets is to replicate the process outside of trading and incorporate it into other businesses and have this bot be this agent be present uh in other like categories of marketing or areas where there's decision making and user engagement like if you're deciding what movie to go see maybe there's the Gladiator three agent reply guying to you know politicians uh as Maximus maybe there's um the shoebot uh Shilling Nike in replies to Adidas's tweets I don't know um I don't know where this is going but like this journey feels like it has legs it's one of those like good gut feelings that that's fun to work on yeah and it it's I mean it's a great learning experience for sure regard regardless of how you know things things actually end up um what's cool is like when you get to interface with technology that is genuinely doing something new it's pretty it's pretty good stuff um and I think it's it's only going to get I was going to say like yeah this feels good but like AIC CC some some other podcast launched a token and it all went to didly squat pretty quick like what did they like should we talk about I mean it's first of all it's still trading at 60 mil which is kind of nuts um that is nuts but I think it speaks to look it speaks a level of grift that exists within crypto I think that the actual founders of this AIC CC thing are not necessarily bad people I actually think that they're good people and they're that they were trying to do they were trying to build a good project um but you have to be very careful with the types of people that you allow in to your project I think what ended up happening is that they they just got too close with the bank list guys and the bank list guys kind of took advantage of them um ended up getting a pretty massive allocation and then immediately dumping but I think to take take a step back for a second I've been in this industry as a quote unquote k for like eight years now and I don't do a ton of Angel Investments um kind of for this reason is because the unspoken thing about all these Angel Investments and this is going to piss off a lot of people is that you get access to projects that you're guaranteed to make money on not because they're going to be good long term but because you get in at an unbelievably low price and a lot of people invest in projects like that I have tried to avoid this at all costs but a lot of people when they get these opportunities it's a home run it's free money because you're getting in at something at like a $1 million valuation you know it's going to go live at at least 15 or 20 or 40 but you also understand that your entire Edge is getting in at that low valuation so of course you're going to sell right away you don't believe in the project long term you don't want to hold this thing you think it's nonsense but you have to pretend like you believe in it long term because otherwise nobody's going to buy it but you know in your heart that this thing is making you money because you got in at a cheap price and that's what I [ __ ] hate about this industry and that's why there was no round for a THX there was no and a lot of people by the way a lot of people got upset with me over this like a lot of people were like how like I you didn't [ __ ] tell me that you launched like that you and Jonah were launch you didn't tell us what the hell I'm like why would I tell you you didn't even tell me might be a really good friend of mine yeah but I I mean to be fair that was like I was just [ __ ] around like I I genuinely had no intention of launching this thing as like a real project but like what even once you woke up and we talked and we were like okay maybe we should take this seriously I still didn't tell anybody because why like why would I right I mean then what it looks like is that it's just a pumpin dump and the real way I mean if like if you have an audience and you want to go launch a launch a project like I think that the best way to go about anything is organically let it be discovered organically because that creates a strong base creates creates trust between you and your community creates a strong base of holders that don't feel like they would take advantage of and it absolves you of accusations of grift you know AB this is this is this is this is very key you can't you can't even seem like right like there there are a lot of actions that you can take like for example if you raise around because you think that raising around will uh you know you'll be able to get in the right people they'll be able to help you the right way what I've found is that in 98% of cases unless you're working with somebody that has like a genuinely Stellar reputation uh most people that are kol's will put in their money and then disappear and then they won't they'll ghost you and they won't talk to you and they won't help you and they won't do anything and they're just like they they put in their money and then they're gone um but people just want names like people people just want name brands like well I want to stick my name on this I want to stick my name you know like I want I want that guy's brand let me let me go raise um it's not it's not necessarily the right it's I don't think it's the right way to do things no I agree I mean you really want you want what you really want is you want people that are and and that and that and that's at the end of the day our community so like the banket guys I mean I've never really had any respect for them in any meaningful way oh [ __ ] but you know I but you know I think that this is like a kind of like obvious outcome they produce good content they've been in crypto for a long time what I don't understand is why you would you would get yourself involved with a project to Pump It Up and then dump all of your tokens on launch day onto the the general public because they made money because the reality is these guys are probably the these guys are probably actually poor and I'll tell you why that they're they're poor because they and if you love and if you love ethereum you're probably poor I mean all I can say all I can say is torching your reputation for $2 million is the funniest thing I've ever seen in my whole life because if you've been in this like let me just if you've been in this industry for as long as they have and you've been running a podcast and you have been all these Angel Investments and you've done it done if you're not worth at least 10 15 bucks like something is like you you just you're you're not cut out for this you're not cut out for it maybe they're not even trading to me it's like two million bucks you split it between the two of them that's 1 million each they probably live in high tax jurisdictions and they're Americans your reputation for 500k are you kidk 500k like golf clap I don't know to me it makes no sense I I'm I'm I'm so shocked by this like we launched a token at the same time as bankless and they rugged their entire community at the same time as just ju just to clarify they did not launch the token sorry yes like on allocation but I I mean we and we launched it we launched our token at I think like a $100,000 market cap yes and and our community is freaking awesome we found our developer through the community we found our like branding guy through the community it's like it's completely different I think the way to build a community what crypto is great at is incentivizing groups of people who don't know each other all across the globe to help each other out without like gigantic reams of documents and startup equity and lawyers and and you know startup expenses so like if you do it that way you have to get your community involved at an attractive price you can't let them in on the highs and then hammer it all the way down in their face and expect a good outcome I wouldn't have pegged the bank list guys there until this though but now it's like they've torched their reputation nobody's gonna deal with them anymore that's [ __ ] crazy what they did to themselves that's epically stupid and it's just pure pure pure self imulation for not that much money if they' done it for like $500 million a piece I would have been like okay well you know hat tip but this this is this is like small potatoes um should we talk about NFP macro and Bitcoin like to me just very quickly I want to talk about it I feel like the whole Market got itself all worked up over an NFP print and it didn't matter and like I I've seen this a lot in young Traders I disagree with this maybe there are some interest rate guys out there that are like really good at trading around these economic events or FX Traders or macro Traders but like for the most part the only thing that's going to torch crypto Obi macro wise macroeconomic datawise is a screaming High CPI print like if inflation is just back with a vengeance then we can all get worried about crypto again like we were in 2022 but like CH like non-farm payrolls jobless claims like who who freaking cares this stuff like these prints come out regularly they don't matter the fed's not going to change its policy because the econom is going well we have like 90% of Washington is about to turn over in a week and and a day I think you also you also have to remember like a lot of these a lot of the talk that you see is such massive hindsight talk it's it's it's hindsight Capital I'll tell you there was an article in Bloomberg that came out after the NFP print that was like this is a huge shock you know rates rates are going to go through the roof now because of all of the uncertainty around Trump and inflation's going to come back and rates are going to go through the roof and it's a screaming buy and all I could think to myself was where were you when the 30 year went from four to five from December to now like if you look from December 1st to Jan 1st it went from four to 30y year went rate went from four to five that's a huge move it's a big move nobody was talking about it um people only talk about it when it like like really hits you in the face and by that point you know the move is priced like it's really hard to make a bet on that right like you can't you can't extrapolate like the right bet would have been to say okay well I think that there's going to be a rate move um before all of this goes down but like after you get a huge move to talk about it just screams of you know hindsight hindsight capital and so you know and and if yeah it it came in strong and it could be an indication that inflation is going to come back in a in in a big way but that's not a given and so the only thing that we have to watch now is is CPI what I will say is that Trump is likely to be an inflationary President right like the things that he wants to do and the things that Trump cares about are I think inherently inflationary like he wants a screaming hot economy he wants to pressure the FED to cut rates no more illegal uh laborers High tariffs no more illegal laborers exactly so I mean you know he is there is the argument that with Trump in charge inflation will come back and that means the FED will have to pause and we might go into a right hike cycle um If the Fed pauses Trump is gonna go ballistic on the FED yeah like you know I think what he wants is for the FED to cut rates while inflation goes up and uh pump the stock market and maybe Bitcoin this time too but he he can't really have that because the fed's independent all I'm saying is like imagine if you sold like I I think a lot of these people who pretend that they're good at crypto trading because they understand macro or know what NFP means I think they're kind of Lars A lot of them like imagine selling Bitcoin at 92k because you're worried about a non-farm payrolls print eight days before regime change in Washington and not not just any regime change this regime change right so to me like I think we're in waitand see mode I think the the one the one thing that I I would take away from a trump Administration macro Trend wise is I wouldn't touch bonds with a 10- foot pole on bearish bonds I think yields are going higher you do not want to be earning fixed income in Trump land uh that is that is crazy love you guys thank you guys for tuning in that was a great talk Jonah we'll catch him soon likewise see you soon [Music]

hold on to your cycle bags don't do anything stupid don't pay too much bid offer don't listen to us this is an investment advice that's that's basically the summary right it's true this episode is brought to you by definitive you'll hear more about them later in the [Music] show Happy New Year everybody welcome back to another THX podcast I'm calling in here from Florida the last day of my quote unquote vacation from the crypto markets it's been good it's been this kind of played out exactly the way that we discussed last episode which is we bought them you know I tweeted this out pick your spots buy your altcoins but just make sure to be done by the New Year and that has played out really nicely this year and last year where December 31st was basically the bottom on a ton of different coins and now we're back up I mean Bitcoin rallied rallied up 92 to 98 alts have posted anywhere from 15 to 40% um in aggregate the one standout has obviously been the AI coins which have done extremely well which I'll take credit for because ever since Joan and I launched a 10000x on virtuals it went from went from $2 to $4 and that has to be because of us I don't see any other reason why that would be yeah I mean it's uh it's clearly we're the only thing going on in crypto right now obious I it it feels quiet even though the Market's rallying like crazy every single daily candle this year has been green uh definitely feels like there's somebody t- whopping into crypto not sure who and you know I think both of us fully expect this to continue throughout q1 especially after inauguration day when you remove this massive drag on the space which is been adverse regulation Gary Gensler is expected to resign on January 20th inauguration day even if no Pro crypto bills get passed to me it feels like just the absence of that overhang is super bullish so I mean I think the setup looks great I think that in terms of like the the places where you gambl to in in sort of a degenerate way meme coins are out AI coins are the New Meme coins and I like it but I guess I'm struggling to understand why it is that some of these projects need a token I can kind of understand the rationale for linking a token to your your AI agent in some use cases like for example let's say you wanted to use it as a marketing tool and you commit some of your Revenue that from you know marketing activities to token BuyBacks that is a way to you know like organically create an incentivized Community around your marketing project um but you know I don't know I can't basically these AI coins I can't tell whether there's utility in the token or whether it's just a meme coin like whiff or popcat but slightly sparklier and I don't know it's just a meme coin but slightly sparklier I mean that's that that that that's my that's my take on it and in the future what people are going to do are they're going to figure out ways to link get to more value I mean like for example one of the ways that we've discussed potentially adding value to 1,000x is like what if we take some of the podcast revenue and we use it to buy THX right and that sort of the way that I think about this is these AI agents have a token attached to them are consistently being started by things or by people that don't already have a token attached to whatever project they're working on right they're making a new project out of this AI agent uh so obviously things that are existing already can launch AI agents to help with their marketing but they're already going to have a token that exists or they're already going to have Equity Equity that exists a lot of these agents that are popping up have the token explicitly associated with the agent because it's an entirely new thing right like what kind of kind of what we did we didn't have anything that people could interact with that was attached to the THX podcast other than listening to it and now we do because of this because of this agent and so what I think is you know these you can't really classify what these tokens are as like a as a as a whole the majority right now for sure are just are just Mimi but in the future I mean people are just going to launch these agents because they're good for their broader Brands I mean who knows maybe coinbase will have an it we'll have an agent that'll tweet out one day just because it gets it it gets engagement um and that's that that's the future I mean every single criticism of these AI agents doesn't take into account how fast things are in development right yes today they're not useful but in a year these things are going to be exceptionally useful they're some of them are already useful AI BT is like basically summarizing half of crypto Twitter and tweet it out every few minutes it's insane but yes I agree most of it's useless and in the future when people figure this out many of these things will be useful so hard to I guess that's why that's why the infrastructure layer of AI tokens has taken off and some of the agents themselves are Hit or Miss like by infrastructure ler I mean virtuals and AI 16z which are the two big platforms that allow you to launch agents um the tokenomics of virtual ual are pretty insane like in order for basically you pay for compute if you run a virtuals agent in virtuals so there's constant buying of that token to pay for compute um because every every time the agent tweets it has to like access an llm and think a little bit so yeah I mean to me it's like to me I think I think it's like when you buy ai6 Z or virtuals it's like buying an L1 and you know this take is is not original it's been well publicized on Twitter to me that seems like the safe place to go and I think that we're going to hit some point in this cycle probably in the next six months most likely in the next three where everything AI related just 10 to 100 X's for no fraking reason like I think that's where the next Mania is coming and as George Soros said when you see a a bubble try to try to catch on to it somehow so that's that's my personal bet I'm not going in like massive size on this bet but I definitely think like you know it's it's worth it's worth a a chunk your portfolio to try and bet on a 10x or in random AI infrastructure play I I wouldn't bet on the agents though I have no idea which ones are going to rally and which ones are going to go to zero to me that feels like meme coining without any conviction eight months ago hey everyone just wanted to tell you about today's sponsor definitive whether you're a retail Trader

in trading volume upgrade your onchain trading at blockworks definitive DFI or check out the link in the show notes what's really interesting is that even when the market was doing poorly these coins were doing well and I think what that tells you is that there's still tremendous appetite for novel products and novel you know any any anything that's push pushing the boundary a little bit people are there to people are there to go buy it and that's why I I do think that we don't necessarily get a massive broad-based alt season uh until you know I I think BTC needs to get to like 110 120 if it were to happen it would have kind of happened by now um and I think that it's going to be it's going to be a little bit more targeted my bets are still on the agents but also on ethereum you know I think I mentioned that I was very constructive on ethereum in heading heading into the new year and that that still that Still Remains the case uh for me I think that right now what we're going to what we're going to see is we're going to see a lot of new allocation into the space coming in after the new year I think you saw yesterday that we had one of the largest inflows into BTC ETFs $998 million and that's an indication of people that decided to buy but we're waiting to buy until the new year and realistically what's happening right now is that over the next first two weeks in January is when you're going to start to get a lot of a lot of new allocation into the market and we've been seeing consistent flows into the E ETFs and so that's going to be a Big Boon for eth is all of those new allocations I think are going to look similar to what we've seen before but in larger size and eth is going to benefit from this as well uh and so I think that we can we can see some some pretty explosive price action heading into the inauguration one of the things that I used to think and now no longer think because remember in trading you always have to incorporate new information and how the market looks when it heads into an event 3 months ago I predicted that we would would top near inauguration because I thought that we would have a face melting rally if Trump got elected all the way through up until inauguration that turned out to be wrong revised my opinion um you know on the on the direction of the market and now I actually think that we start to Rally into the inauguration and then we continue to Rally through the inauguration because we've actually already washed off a lot of the excess we went from 108,000 back down to 90 nuked oi on like every altcoin that you could possibly think of uh the market reset itself and now we're seeing new steady inflows or I think we're going to see new steady inflows and so I think through inauguration you're actually going to get a pre substantial move from the from the markets not only that equities are now very supportive again you know S&P and NASDAQ were up 1.2 1.6% and what this tells me is that the fears of the fed's uh you know hawkishness have washed out of the system it's been ingested which is why I I said this on the last podcast whenever you get a move like that in equities on a Fed announcement it's a complete and utter fade and the reason that it's a complete another fade is because that move is pricing in everything that you need to know unless it's a genuine Paradigm shifting moment right unless it's an inflection point going from we haven't cut rates in a in a really long time now we're going to start to cut rates or we haven't raised rates in a really long time now we're going to start to raise rates what they did is they just said we're going to slow down that's not a paradigm shift and so I think equities are you know in a in a very good spot right nowc because of this so basically in in in the statement you just made there's a lot to unpack you talked about inflows and you talked about the macro backdrop so let me just respond to each one inflows I think they're just going to continue I think that the the uh BTC ETF inflows that that you just mentioned are the tip of the iceberg I think we're going to see multiple days like that in q1 I don't really see outflows occurring either especially since uh given CME basis you know it isn't that high right now I doubt I doubt a lot of that is like against Futures I think it's literally just fresh Capital coming in because that's how allocations work the year starts and new allocations come in so I think you'll see ETF related inflows FTX dollars are going to hit the market sometime in q1 um I think all that's just going to go towards buying crypto I know some hedge funds had claims and they'll probably cash out but haven't checked the data I think it's even if it were just 50% of the 16 billion or whatever that they're going to pay out which is still in retail hands like I think you see at least a few billion of that come back into crypto um another form of inflow we could see this year poly Market is pricing a 75% chance of a salana ETF getting approved 2025 uh 50% chance it happens before July 31st I I think a salana ETF would launch a lot with a lot more strength than the eth ETF launched last year like I think I think there is a a group of people out there on in financial Industries and Retail that would like to buy a salana ETF that maybe can't uh buy salana right now because it's either illegal for them to do so or they're just not they're not on crypto exchanges they're normies they're no coiners Solana's got enough of a a brand that I think it could attract some new capital into crypto especially after the salana unlocks occur I think it could be part particularly bullish for that token um so I I think inflows are coming from every direction this year especially institutional and then to your point about the macro front I I'm I'm reading macro blogs I'm paying attention I'm just struggling to find a negative Catalyst and that worries me like the macro the macro backdrop just looks so so primed for Success so primed for another huge amazing year on every level like GDP growth Equity price appreciation you know home value appreciation I I think the economy's looking good I think a lot of the you know the Trump administration's advertised policies are bullish macro the fed's not going to do anything crazy there's no inflationary shock on the table I guess the only thing that's that's waiting in the wings is the proverbial Black Swan so I'm a little nervous like it it all looks a little too good but you know you maybe could have said that any year between 2010 and 2020 and held off on buying and you would have been wrong so I think it's time to just buy with both hands again you know macro looks so good it's kind of crazy it is and I'm just so I honestly I'm just thankful that we washed out people before before the inauguration because I really thought it what's funny about crypto is a lot of the Peaks and uh basically the Peaks in the bottoms of crypto are decided by emotion in a huge way and so if we had a a genuine sell the event like the inauguration that could have actually taken a long time to recover from because imagine instead of going from uh you know 70 to 108 back to 90 you went from 70 to 140 to 90 that's that's actually a lot worse oh yeah that would been right uh and that and and and a and a move like that tends to lead to people being very scared to come in this type of movements actually constructive because yes we had a dip sure you go down 15 20% but it didn't implode on itself and it actually held it held pretty nicely and so that type of price action actually tends to be psychologically affirming for people where it says yes remember this is a volatile asset but it's not over uh come back in the water the water the water is warm a lot of it has to do with psychology and then you have the inauguration now is instead of sell the event as I've been saying it's actually buy people are going to start buying for it um and then obviously as you pointed out there's so many things that are going to go crypto's way this year one of the trades that I was really pissed about missing Jonah because I got the first two and then I missed the third was you know I I nailed gbtc trade nailed the E Trade at at the discount there's a bitwise top 10 index that was like the last traded thing yeah that was traded at a discount I think prior to the inauguration it was trading at a 20 to 25% discount and now it's flat and up because everything in it up and I was just sitting there thinking to myself oh man should have uh should should have I should have remembered that one I should have loaded up on that one that would that would have been really nice that has some xrp in it which is why in 2020 to it was so cursed and I guess this year it performed yeah I hadn't really looked at the bitwise one yeah that that sucks because we we did we did a good job on those other ETFs that was we crushed it another one we missed was was sooie what the what the heck is going on with that one like it's in is it the top 12 is it in the top 12 now I I don't understand it's like there's so many trades that I'm missing left and right most of them don't bother me but yeah like a a bitwise top 10 is annoying because we literally did that same on two other ones successfully soie I can't tell whether it's the next salana or whether this is just one of those head fakes like whiff you know it doesn't really make any sense and you can't blame yourself too much for missing I genuinely have no freaking idea however what I will say is this is very good for my bear chain bags because it sets the ceiling it sets the ceiling on fake L1 so high I mean soie is an interesting case because the reality is that I believe it's not a good platform it's it's not really competing uh competing as an L1 in any meaningful way uh and what you have to remember is that sometimes l1s get Niche communities like cardano cardano became massive off the back of just having a strong Niche retail community and so fading things like this is very difficult I mean even if you faded cardano if you shorted cardano it was basically like shorting any other altcoin it wasn't you weren't eing out extra juice from shorting a cardano than you were from shorting basically anything when the market topped right um so I think a lot of people ping me and they go oh man suie has to be a short here like this this is like the most easy short I've ever seen in my entire life and the reality is no it's not um because the risk reward is still pretty bad I mean suie will continue to do well as as as the market does well or until something catastrophic happens like the team decides to sell everything all at once and if that's your Alpha then then then track then track the wallets but at this point it's captured I mean it's it's captured mind share in a pretty in a pretty significant way and the number one predictor of whether a coin will continue to do well well or whether it's reached its peak is has CT started to buy it everyone on crypto Twitter hates this like they hate this coin with a passion Jonah yeah and they talk about it all the time this like this doesn't make sense this is dumb this is stupid and then it keeps going up and so once those people capitulate maybe it's time that you know maybe maybe it's time to be over but until then kind of thinking you just you just leave it alone like I myself like I don't know how to trade this thing I I don't know how to buy it like I might trade like I might trade it technically right um it actually respects its levels really nicely right so you know it flips uh resistance to support very well um it breaks out very nicely it's actually a good trading asset I mean it's not something that I would hold uh but that actually tends to be true with these types of assets is that they tend to be very good trading assets because there's no fundamentals attached to it but it has so many people buying and selling it at the same time that are all completely uninformed that makes for a very good trading asset uh where you can like eek out five 10 you mean you mean technical trading asset right like there are no fundamentals for this thing literally just like it's it's just charts it's the stuff that trafi people consider Voodoo but I guess when there's a a zero fundamental asset like suie with just a bunch of just a bunch of psychology dude consider consider vo all you want like it works right um the thing is with with uh with sui it's actually better distributed than any than any meme coin yeah that is true it's like reason like reasonably distributed coins tend to be more concentrated I guess here's the thing like let's say let's say you like really hate this thing like you think that this thing is trash I'm going to tell you how to trade it I'll tell you how to short it this very simple in almost every crypto asset that you see when it goes up like this it has a moving average that for some reason it respects and this is voodoo and for suie that happens to be the 50-day moving average since September 1st it's broken above it's retested at 1 two 3 4 times and that has been the bottom this is this is this is its established Trend I'm pulling this up now what you want to do is you want to wait for sui to break below that moving average for two to three days and then you want to wait for a bounce like break below the moving average then you wait for a bounce and then you short the bounce dude this is and then I'm telling you I'm telling you this will work like like bookmark this we we'll come back in a year I'm going to I'm telling you now this is going to work then you wait for the bounce and then you short it because that bounce is a relief bounce but the trend has been broken and then the thing is going to go down 80% you can I will I'm telling you there's a there's a 85% chance that this happens like this is this is a this is a very high hit rate trade I would be shocked well okay never never mind let me let me start over I I think that this is a terrible Market to short anything we I think we're going into like white hot Mania phase sometime this year so I wouldn't want to be short anything especially not some random altcoin that goes up every single week for I don't know what reason however however you might like if you're right I will give you your flowers I will I will capit I'm not I didn't say short it now I said short it when it gets below the 50-day moving average and then it goes below for two to three days and then wait for the next bounce and then short that because at that point the thing's over I'll be watching and and the reason that the thing is over it's very simple people are buying this thing because it's going up and they don't know whether when it goes down is it a pullback or is it the end of the trend and so the way that Trends die is just purely purely purely technical it's purely technical the whole way down and so once it breaks below that moving average that has been support this whole time Trends in crypto to be to be clear Trends Trends in crypto the thing well things with no real fundamental value behind them yeah once it breaks below that people start to sell but they're always the the delusional hopeful that if it's down too much from the highs they're going to buy it that causes the bounce y but by that point point the trend is broken and all of the people that were it was too painful to sell the thing on the way down that know that the trend is broken because that's what that that's what they watch they start selling yeah I I buy that and like that that that's the that's the whole that's the whole psychology behind it basically what you're saying is like identify a way to like a a metric or a heuristic that tells you when the air is starting to come out of the balloon and then get short before the balloons deflated too much like I I totally Buy that and my my trafi brain struggles with technical analysis because in assets with fundamentals technical analysis is voodoo for the most part I mean it'll help you gauge sentiment and Trends are real I believe in Trends but um for the most part if you're trying to make money trading Trends and you ignore fundamentals in markets like equities or Commodities um you know you need to have your your head examined however here suie is one of those things it's like xrp too it's just these they they look like random number generators to people who aren't like deeply involved and there's so few people who are deeply involved that it makes the rest of us wonder what's going on with this thing so I I I agree with you this isn't like a doge or a Bitcoin where the community is just like where CT just loves the coin this this one will tank hard I I like your your idea I'm gonna I'm gon to keep an eye on that 50-day moving average and and watch I'm G to see because man it would be it would be a a collective sigh of relief from the crypto Community if if like vaporware l1's just disappear you know I mean not nothing against suie I'm sure they I'm sure they're good people working on it but like for the Traders out there who are trying to make sense of the market this is a this is a real asterisk something that just like kind of makes you question yourself in your process no yeah totally I mean look at the at the end of the day a lot of the a lot of these types of Trades just boil down to Pure Market psychology of the holders yeah and when does technical analysis work versus when it doesn't it's very it's very important to understand if there's an excess of uninformed Market participants then technical analysis works because technical analysis is simply psychology at the end of the day and it's not psychology in the sense that well a lot of people think the technical analysis works because other people are doing technical analysis that's not really why it works why it works is that when there's a mass of uninformed Market participants the concepts of support and resistance and Trends are ingrained in their mind uh sort of without even knowing any technical analysis and I'll give you I'll give you a very simple example of this um when something breaks out above a previous high after a retracement the psychology is that it in terms of technical analysis that it should keep going up and that's not because people are charting it and looking at the breakout that's because the people that sold it at the previous High watched it go down felt good about themselves probably didn't buy back in and then it got back up to their previous price and they start to panic and they go did I make a bad sale let me get back in yeah and so they're not really doing technical analysis but that's the fact you're you're sort of mapping their their sentiment onto existing technical indicators I mean that makes sense and so and so in order in order for that to work right so I mean another example of this is you know resistance right if something s you know like let's say a Bitcoin goes to $100,000 and then it sells off and you didn't sell then the next time it goes to $100,000 you're thinking to yourself well the last time I hit ,000 I felt like an idiot for not selling let me sell again here or let me sell this time right and so they're not drawing a line but in aggregate what they're doing is they're reinforcing the idea of support and resistance because of these missed opportunities and so in order for technical analysis to work really well you need a mass of uninformed Market participants which is why if you look it it doesn't work so well when you're in a bare Market it works really well when you're in a bull market and so you have to understand uh you know the different tools and and way certain technical analysis will work really well in a bare Market which is like CTA style Trend trading oh we're below the moving averages so be short like that that works well in a bare Market kind of it's it's very choppy that that's the thing with the bare market like bare markets are extremely choppy uh and I found that like yeah technical analysis tends to be disrespected a lot more like if you go look on a like if you go look on a 30 minute chart on a lot of coins technical analysis like works like magic in in a market like this in 2022 that wasn't true at all like they just you know I mean you know something would go up 10% then go back down 10% then go down 5% then go back up 10% and it was just very difficult to use technical analysis even to judge the the the relief rallies it was also because a lot of it was event driven right so for example uh when three arrows collapsed uh we we nuked down to $888 on eth and then rallied back up to 2,000 in the span of like two weeks or three weeks there's no technical analysis that could predict like technical doesn't predict that you can't use technis and also you know the biggest Fu rally in the 2022 bar Market was the March rally in Bitcoin up to 48k that that head faked literally most of the space into thinking that that the 2021 Bull Run was still going and that we were just going to hit hit fresh highs and then all it did from there was go straight spiraling into the abyss but yeah I take your point I mean I've always been skeptical of technical analysis because it just doesn't work for assets with fundamentals and I don't think it's going to work particularly well for for the AI coins that we we mentioned earlier in the podcast because those are those are less like technical trades than they are I think Catalyst trades like people are EXP developments for in in the AI space uh especially where it meets crypto people are expecting agents to do new interesting unexpected things Bitcoin is probably not a technical analysis asset as much as sui might be because people are expecting fundamental news to come out related to bitcoin suie I think you bring up a really good point that may be the perfect one for for uh for technical analysis because the participant base is extremely broad it's not like some random niche of guys on on Phantom wallets uh trading you know popcat or Bowden it's it's like it's pretty well distributed so there's a big participant base it's on all the major exchanges but no one's expecting like a major product to come out on sui no one's expecting sui to solve payments and like I guess in terms of differentiating between Catalyst assets technical assets and then just like random Niche little meme coins one interesting uh one interesting anecdote back in 2013 you know I was good friends with a lot of the Ripple people and one of the ways that they kept their token pumping back then when it was worth less than one cent you know they would talk about it and pump it up and you know keep people buying it is they would they even though it was just kind of like a meme coin before people knew what a meme coin was they tried to make it into a catalyst asset by like oh we're announcing a partnership with American Express or oh we're we're like launching this remittance corter with Santander and we're going to make a bunch of marketing materials and send them out to the world so that people think that legitimate things are happening on Ripple like that's how obviously it was all vaporware and and no one actually used xrp for anything but like they they basically made their tokens seem like something that retail could invest in with an expectation of future adoption on the basis of these like announcements BISD Partnerships you know whatever I I'm sure that sui is going to try to do stuff like that but I don't think anybody believes it I think like the Market's too mature for that to work in 2025 so I I think you're right maybe this is literally just like um it's like cardano it's just something you you trade with charts and Trend channels and support and resistance I hadn't thought of it like that but you know these podcast me new things yeah that's fair enough what else should we talk about I mean the market like we expect it to go up we're we're still ranging even though we've just pumped from the bottom of the range we talked about SOI which is a big question mark we talked about these these AI agents how's the weather in Florida right now what's what's temperature weather weather in Florida is good it actually got kind of cold it's it's a little bit cold here in France 53 degrees in the south of France right now yeah that that is cool but for Florida I I think it it hit 55 yesterday at night is nuts yeah in did I think I think if we've if we've devolved to talking about weather that means that the Market's pretty tame yeah hold on to your cycle bags don't do anything stupid don't pay too much bid offer don't listen to us this is an investment advice that's that's basically the summary right it's true and thank you for thank you for tuning in I appreciate it Good Times uh until next week AI adios [Music]

I mean I think that this recent move washed out all of the end of your sellers and people are going to Reby come the first of Jan like I'm not I'm not bearish the cycle is not over and you know I'm not in the habit of making bold predictions like that all the time but I mean this is like a in my opinion no-brainer point to get in the market and just ride it write it up this episode is brought to you by definitive you'll hear more about them later in the show [Music] all right welcome back to another THX podcast this is going to be a fun one a lot of stuff has happened in the markets since we both said that we were bullish as [ __ ] um clearly clearly the market didn't really agree with us I mean uh one thing that I'll I'll point out is that you know it's very clear now this is obviously hindsight talking but it's very clear now that a substantial portion of the move above 100K was driven by sailor just jamming it in I mean he got a average price of $106,000 and that's insane considering the fact that we traded above $106,000 for like 30 seconds I mean I think it was I think it was 24 hours that we traded above that price so kind of insane clearly just you know jammed it jammed it super hard near the highs and then once his bid went away Market structure deteriorated a bit and now we're stuck in a kind of interesting Zone where BC is holding that 90 you know I'd say that the the bottom of the range is 90k to 935 and we're sort of hovering at that level right now but alt are doing really well so like today for example e PTC up almost 4% off the low that structure looks really good to me everything else has started to look good and the thing that we've been calling for for a while is at some point probably near towards the end of the year you're going to start to see alts pickup just seasonality tends to be very very good for altcoins uh post mid December and I think we're going to see that play out because what's happened is that everyone crowded into the Bitcoin trade because Michael saor was backing it and now there are a lot of reasons to suspect that he might not be backing it for at least a month courtesy of the blackout period and that's going to lead people to go bit alt and it's going to lead to relative outperformance by eth um one thing that has been really bad for eth is that obviously the main buyers have been buying Bitcoin and now that the main buyer's out of the market for a bit that EBT ratio can sort of readjust itself and the flows will start to average out more and I think that means we probably see e PGC above Z 0.04 in the next few weeks and I think that's a really good trade along with a lot of the strong alts that you see that you see today um but the next move from BTC I'm not I'm not really too confident in right now Jenna I mean what what are you thinking about the markets here well this selloff was not in my bingo card I was you know buying all the way up still buying on the highs uh not much as as far as like my portfolio is concerned but just sort of like nibbling away at the market now what is sort of expected is that the idea that you know you when bull markets start to get white hot they get super volatile and this isn't like the craziest pullback in the history of pullbacks this is like 10% 15% at worst for some of the majors um so like and what triggered it it was it was really like a Fed type event so basically you know I don't think that this is anything out of the ordinary I think that one thing I would note about December as a a general trading month in anything not just Bitcoin or not just crypto it's an a liquid month like institutions generally have closed up shop for the year Traders aren't taking a lot of risk trying to like gamble their entire year in the middle of the last week of the year so most participants with the big bucks are sort of on the sidelines or protecting p&l and then you're left with like usually you know like in commodity markets it's ctas those are the sort of algorithmic shops that trade no matter what time of the year it is or what hour of the day it is and they're they're big right so usually you get these like bigger momentum type exacerbated moves so to me it's like not that surprising that you have this Michael sailor character who's the whale in the market everybody else is pretty much taking it easy and when he stops buying you get a big pullback um I hadn't really noticed what you were saying about alts until just now which I you know I think is actually a really intelligent comment perhaps because it's not all alts that are performing right now like Doge telegram coin like some alts are yeah I think there select there select alts that are outperforming what you just said just kind of clicked a puzzle piece in my head I think a lot of the the exacerbation of alt move I mean when BTC was trending down alts were nuking like BTC was down like 3% one day and alts were down 15 to 20 I think a reasonable percentage of that a lot of the selling was probably because of people were protecting their p&l I mean a lot of people have made a lot of money this year and they didn't want to get that washed out and they didn't know where BTC was going to go but it was looking weak and so they just basically full stack sold all of their alts all at the same time and there was Zero liquidity in the market to to take to take the other side cuz people aren't gambling into year end as you said and these alss just got completely washed out of sellers in my personal opinion I just don't see where the selling comes from for a lot of these things at this point if anything that this this is where the buying starts and this is you know I tweeted something I said I'm bullish on ult heading into the new year just be patient pick your spots and make sure your buying is done by the end of the year I still I'm still 100% on board with that I think that you probably should be buying alts right now uh basically anything that's been strong you want to start either legging into or just at this point kind of pushing your pushing your chips in because I think q1's going to be really good yeah even relative to BTC so if you want what you can do is you can say okay maybe I'm not don't know where the Market's going but I'm bullish on alts maybe you want to short some Bitcoin to H your to hge your alt exposure if you really care uh but I mean I think that this recent move washed out all of the end ofe Sellers and people are going to Reby come the 1 of Jan like I'm not I'm not bearish the cycle is not over and you know I'm not in the habit of making bold predictions like that all the time but I mean this is like a in my opinion no-brainer point to get in the market and just ride it ride it up because if you really think about why why it sold off right it's kind of few reasons um one is obviously sellers sto buying in the blackout period that people have been talking about two is the Fed uh the FED coming off a lot more hawkish than people expected and I think both of those things have now been completely digested by the market anyone that would have sold because of those two things they're all out now and so the FED being hawkish on the general markets and saying okay well you know we shouldn't be cutting that fast now the any downside in the equity markets that it'll it'll just reflect an actual slowdown in the economy um it'll it'll reflect that you know at this point where we're at equilibrium so it will reflect bad things that are happening and right now no bad things are happening in fact I think Jan 20th is going to be a great day CU a lot of regulations are going to get repealed and the Market's going to go back to humming the way that we expected it to this was a as close to a clear bull market wash out event that I've seen in a long time I mean this is just so yeah it's just so clearly to me a bull market wash out you also have a lot of people that are okay that was it pack it up like it's over uh we're not we're not going back up I mean people I think a lot of people capitulated on this and now is not the right time to capitulate it's my two cents on the matter yeah Obby I think that's a great take I I agree with pretty much everything you said in fact I'm probably going to go and buy some more crypto after we hang up the phone here I I I think this is about as like what what you described is sort of just a bull market wash out I agree this it it literally looked like the textbook says it's supposed to look you run up on Euphoria nothing really that relevant changed but you just got one little negative piece of news and anybody without a lot of conviction probably hit the sell button because there are a lot of unrealized profits out there now I and people want to protect that into your end to my point about risk aversion nobody wants to nobody wants to ride this thing down to 40K before the end of the year and H and just have a terrible 2024 when they could have had an amazing 2024 um to you know let's talk about the FED for a second they just came out jaw boning More hawkish Than People expected than the FED Watchers expected and the interest rate markets expected this wasn't like the announcement of a new hike cycle this is more like hey you know we're going to you know we're not just going to be cutting with Reckless abandon next year we don't really have inflation under control the way we'd like to uh so we're just going to be mindful of that like I I read the the FED minutes you know the side by-side minutes in this awesome piece that I follow called The Daily shot which is just like I love it too by the way I follow the daily shot day it's just sometimes sometimes it's just daily shots awesome yeah no I mean you you can scroll through the part about like you know South Korean um you know electricity prices but you know to the like the FED stuff like it digest it pretty well for for people like me so to me it didn't seem like a massive Paradigm Shift the way that 2022 was like 2022 we went from zero interest rate policy zerp to okay I guess that era is over the 35 year long Bull Run in bonds is is over right and that was a big you know seismic shift for all markets and there was sort of an ongoing question mark around what the Fed was going to do with rates because no like Powell didn't really Telegraph that clearly whether he was just gonna hike to some crazy level or whether he was whether the hiking was over you know markets were scared Bitcoin took a big hit as a result of that this time like it's abundantly clear they're not going to go into another hike cycle and send short-term interest rates up to eight n per. like that's just not happening it's more like okay we're not going to cut it down to zero but but markets are already pricing that so to me it like anybody who went and sold anybody who was like bullish crypto for all the reasons that we talk about on this podcast and then went and sold because the FED said something hawkish or so they heard on X um I think that you know anybody who's doing that is kind of Lett us handing a pretty important opportunity in crypto markets like I think this you know this is a pretty decent chance to get long ahead of what I perceive to be uh you know a Rip Roar in 2025 yeah I think I think you hit the nail on the head it's important to contextualize why the market did what it did a lot of times the market will make decisions on a short-term time frame based on what the FED says very rarely does the FED impact the trend of the market it only happens when there's a paradigm shift in the approach of the FED to the market Based on data that they ingest right so in 2021 November 2021 they said finally inflation is not transitory we better start taking this seriously this requires a rethink of our entire strategy towards how we manage the markets and how we manage our economy we need to raise rates and that was something that had just never really happened before in the last like 15 years right when when they when they made that decision so what we see today exactly as you said it's not a paradigm shift it's not them saying anything is different about the market it's actually just adjusting their approach and you can make an argument okay well maybe the market was rallying exclusively because they thought the Fed was going to be extremely doish for the foreseeable future and therefore the market was just rallying and now that they're not just giga doubs the Market's going to reverse but I don't think the market was rallying because the Fed was dovish the market was rallying yes it got a it got a boost from that and yes this is a slight amount of breaks applied to the upwards Trend the market was rallying because the economy is doing well and that hasn't changed we are going up because people are making more money because wages are going up because companies are making more profits and because we're heading into now a new regime under Trump that's going to be even more bus business friendly none of that has changed the only thing that's changed is that the one piece of the puzzle how you know how much gas the FED is willing to pour on the fire has changed and what's clear is that the market has digested that and said okay so what you get in those types of scenarios is you get a reset right you got you got a pretty big reset uh I mean you know NASDAQ went down 5% actually more I think almost 10% from from high from high to low and now you just resume the upward trend from a lower base and that is like that that difference and that time period in difference is what's priced in now so okay yeah we're we're we're we're right now 5% lower than the highs because of what the FED did but it doesn't mean that the Market's going lower because everything else that was driving it higher Remains the Same and so you have to you know think about the components hey everyone just wanted to

you obviously have one additional component which is it's rallied a ton well two additional components it's rallied a ton because Michael sailor is buying a ton of Bitcoin and that's out of the market for some period of time and so you have to say Okay adjust adjust your upward trajectory for at least the next month or so and then you have Bitcoin was going up because of the Strategic Bitcoin reserve and because of the Trump trade now at this point I think that the people that were looking to sell closer to the January 20th inauguration they're probably out of the market right like if you if you had that trade on from the election expecting to sell into January 20th well this reset like this week Ness was probably your time to sell unless you know we we rip higher again into into gen 20th like if we're trading back at 110 into gen 20th maybe take it off but I don't think at 90k because that like the selling in that area has been has been absorbed and then there's this strategic bookin Reserve uh where I think Nick Carter came out and said it's very unlikely that it happens I think who who is Nick Carter does he matter like I saw yeah's he's he's pretty he's pretty clued in he's a really smart guy he's clued in he's got a large audience he's a smart guy he's close with a lot of people on the inside he's influenced crypto policy not substantially but enough to say that I think he matters and I respect his opinion and I like him as a guy um now what his take is I mean it basically just why the U the US government doesn't buy stocks the you know the US government just buys buys their own instruments and Bitcoin is not an instrument of the US government and so the hurdle rate to actually go buy this thing is pretty damn High uh and the political that they would get sorry go ahead I didn't mean to interrupt you is is pretty is pretty damn high and that's kind of similar to the argument that I used to make against you Jonah but I I still think that they the the G the game theory I mean it what it starts with is it starts with Trump just not selling any Bitcoin that the US government accumulates and then over time it changes and the nice part about it is there's no moment during the first 90 days of the administration where it gets thrown out the window so the Hope Remains the The Hope remains until Trump comes out or the government come you know someone in the government comes out and says this is not happening yeah and I actually think it's very unlikely for that to be the case um you know there'll be indications that it may or may not happen but I think it's very unlikely for a government official to come out and say sorry this is now completely off the table we are not doing this you know you know might have some offis yeah you know we're thinking about it where you know it's not ready right now in its current form doesn't make sense right now which would obviously send the market lower but it's not you know it's not going to be decided so it's not going to be a hard no which leads to back to the point of okay well that's great that's just a an additional bullet point everyone in Bitcoin it always needs something right Bitcoin very rarely rallies without something that gives people hope for why it would go higher and whether that hope is real or not what matters is that it exists and the fact that I don't think that it goes away makes me very bullish kind of regardless of what happens does that make sense yeah it makes total sense as they say in in the game of chess the threat is more powerful than the action right like correct uh and I think that's what's going on with this strategic Bitcoin Reserve now I disagree with Nick Carter I think they will create one um even if it's just appropriating the Bitcoin currently held like the Silk Road Bitcoin currently held by the US Marshals and putting it on you know the US Treasures balance sheet but if Nick's argument against a strategic Bitcoin Reserve is that the government doesn't buy non-us government issued Securities and Bitcoin does not count as a US government issued security I think that's kind of a stupid argument because the government buys non us governmen issued currencies and commodities all the [ __ ] time right they hold gold they hold Euros they buy oil um we import billions and billions and billions of dollars worth of Commodities from all around the world and stick them on the government's balance sheet uh for various Reserve purposes um and government programs uh the government is a huge consumer of Steel of copper like it's it's it's endless amounts of of Money Getting spent on currencies and commodities and whether you think Bitcoin is a currency or a commodity is relevant to this conversation because reserves exist for both currencies and commodities government reserves so I think that if something's as geopolitically relevant is Bitcoin there will eventually be a pool of it sitting around on on Uncle Sam's balance sheet somewhere now how does it happen maybe Trump doesn't like get up on stage take his pants off and scream we're making a fraking strategic Bitcoin Reserve everybody yeah send this thing to the moon like it probably doesn't go down that way but you know if the threat is more powerful than the action if that if the idea that the US may have to accumulate hundreds of thousand thousands of Bitcoins somewhere like that's a big threat for every other country that's thinking like hey my currency might not be as interesting as Bitcoin or hey you know I might need some of this Bitcoin for global trade or hey um I'm holding a bunch of gold I'd rather hold Bitcoin because there's a gener generational shift going on and the US government is threatening to establish anbr in the near future if I act after they act I'm getting probably oneir or one 15th or oneth as much BTC for my unit of Fiat as if I act before they do right like so I think that just the threat being on the table probably uh yields some Sovereign buying and you know you we've seen random unsubstantiated possibly real possibly fake news on X about how the uae's accumulated tens of billions of dollars worth of bitcoin already um maybe this stuff doesn't happen out in the open sovereigns uh have a varying track record in terms of their reporting of how much gold they purchase how much oil they purchase um you know it's it's not the most transparent process these reserves But ultimately I I do think they will be created and I I I think that you know even if they aren't that threat is going to put a floor under the crypto space in 2025 much like the deregulatory I I think that that point is where I landed on this is it's it's the threat as you keep saying that buoys this thing and at some point what what happens is it gets it gets to a price where yeah it's not going to go higher than that unless it actually happens so it requires you know a tremendous tremendous amount of buying but $90,000 is not that point I mean one way to think about this is without any indication that the president of the United States likes Bitcoin that we might have a strategic Bitcoin Reserve that other countries might be accumulating tens of billions of dollars of this that it's become very clear that the administration is extremely Pro crypto extremely open to good regulation about this without any of that ever happening Bitcoin got to $75,000 in 2021 and right now bitcoin's 990,000 and so you're telling me given all of that amazing stuff that's happened Bitcoin should be $90,000 relative to where it was in the past and by the way that's the only thing the only way that you can really value this thing is relative to where it's been uh yeah that that doesn't make sense like that's not that is not the equilibrium price that's it's just not um you know there there's sort of there's sort of No Way Around that obviously I think the equilibrium price is more than 20% higher than than that I mean yes that was a period of Peak Mania even then okay uh this year we range between 50,000 and 74,000 per per BTC again without without any of that and so I think that what's clear to me is at least in in in in a bad world for Bitcoin which it was about six months ago prior to the Trump election fair value for BTC is somewhere between 50,000 to 70,000 so now in an amazing world for Bitcoin I don't think fair value is 990,000 I think that's at least twice at least in my opinion twice that so maybe the new range is 100 to 140 if you want to think about it that way um but that's how at least I'm approaching it when I think about quote unquote cycle top and so when you think about it from that perspective I don't think Euphoria is over and so yes with all of this new with all of this new development if if if I believe that the base price of BTC should drift towards 100 to 140,000 based on where it was previously during periods of euphoria why can't it go to 200 250 and then come back down to that level um yes you know probably I I'd probably sell everything that I owned at $200,000 per Bitcoin because I think that would be Euphoria without an actual spr but I think that we get there in the next year in Period of euphoria and and then it sells off and then it settles at a much higher price than it was settling in the summer of this year because candidly the fundamentals are better and so no I mean like it's just crazy maybe I'm delusional but it's crazy for me to think about the fact that we could have all of this amazing uh you know like all of these inflows it's amazing thing things that have happened for BTC for just to go back back down to 70 I don't think so I don't think so like if that if that happens then like I'm gonna switch careers get me out of get me out of this thing hope you keep because because I because I clearly just don't understand it no I mean look like okay so first there's so much to talk about in what you just said um the f i i if anybody's not delusional it's you like I have a tendency to get delusional I get I'm a momentum Trader you're more of a range Trader at times I mean I know you you know how to ride a momentum trade very well but you know you also like to get in and out of stuff and you like to buy dips and sell pops and so I don't think you're delusional here I think you're being extremely rational it's part of your process to to evaluate the market this way um AI I think that with sailor not buying and the FED doing what they did if this it happened in March or February instead of trading from 108 to 93 or 94 we'd be trading we down from 108 to like 103 or 104 I think it's just we're in a very a liquid time of year and there are very few people out there willing to plant the flag in the week between you know like Christmas and New Year's who are going to come in and just like just drink all of this up and buy all the Bitcoin that that just got sold by the people who are waiting for I don't know what so basically consider this uh holiday gift out there if you're still bullish merry Christmas happy Hanukkah this is um I think this is a good time to get long and then I guess the the follow-up question is what do you get long do you get long meme coins do you get long Bitcoin do you get long eth do you get long salana do you get long some other part of the long tale of altcoins out there you get along the stuff that's been doing well yeah that's my take I mean look the way that here's one way that I judge uh Trend in this market so just pull up uh there's actually a great Trend indicator that I use called the ehma it's exponential hell moving average uh set it to 180 and put that on your chart and that actually tends to be very well respected um by things in crypto addition Ally I have found that the 20-day moving average is very good for short-term for short-term trades um and then you obviously have the 100 sorry the 50-day that I think I think is good as well and so the way that I would figure out what to buy if I'm a Trader is I would look at stuff that's still above those moving averages and I would try to buy it when it hits those moving averages or gets into into into that zone it's not always clean it might go minus 5% plus 5 percent but as long as you don't get two daily closes below it um you know i' I'd buy that so look for alts that are still in Trend mode so like a is a great example of an ALT that's still in Trend mode Ando is a great example of an ALT that's still in Trend mode even LTC uh is is a great example of an ALT that's still in Trend mode holding that eh Ma on the on the one day and then think about also like what sectors will do well um so basically I'm betting again that eth is going to do very well in q1 so my bucket looks like eth plus all of the strong alts that are in the eth bucket like a Moro link um that kind of stuff with some with some eth beta and then I think about all right well I think I like AI coins so what's strong in the AI coin World um look at the moving averages that I just mentioned to to to figure to figure that out and then I like Dino coins because I think retail comes back in So what's strong Dino coins though like all yeah the exactly the strong the strong Dino coins I mean like Litecoin for example has potential ETF coming that's pretty good I like that a lot um I'm still not 100% you know fully allocated to my positions cuz I want to chip away like if we get any you know low liquidity like if we get anything El liquid um happening over the next call it you know we or so in in the holidays and I like to I like to buy that but you know I mean things like I mean virtuals for example like I had a bid out I had a bid out for that it got it got to two bucks that was an amazing that was an amazing buy now it's up for like 40% since the 30 35% since then I mean you know there's still there's still a lot of ways to make money in this market just don't be don't be afraid yeah I mean I think that I don't really like in Bitcoin at least I don't like to buy dips and as in I don't like to buy sell-offs I don't like to catch the falling knife because the asset is so reflexive that you know everything I could have said about how this is a screaming dip to buy uh could have applied at 100K or at 93k like and so I would I could have bought 100 and had it slice all the way down to 93 you know you you bottom ticking virtuals is you know maybe you've got some sort of like magic secret sauce it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't a bottom tick I mean it was like I think it didn't trade far below two did it I mean that was I I didn't no I didn't I I didn't I didn't buy two I bought about 220 okay because I'm looking at the candles here it like 2 220 to 230 was the area that I still an insane I mean and that was like just pure charting and and um like I mean that bid actually and this is something that you guys should just do you never know if they're going to get hit obious viously but just chart out some levels on the stuff that you really like and then just be patient and often times it will get bit especially during like crazy moves over the last week I mean virtuals for example I think it yeah it Trade It traded down it traded down to two um I I think I I I mean I got I got nuked on the buys initially uh because I had set it for like that 233 area down to the 224 4 area just looking at it right now like that's the area that I was looking to bid and then it got nuked and now it's at 278 but I held on because I'm bullish on virtuals like I think that it's a good product um you know and a good way to try to trade these things is uh I mean actually on virtuals just to take a step back for a second it it was pretty new it's just kind of like hard to get the right moving averages on it but at least in terms of like order order blocks and horizontal support and resistance it's like okay well like where where are you buying this thing eyes closed and just saying okay I want to own it uh you can use horizontal support levels to Fig to figure that out and then just leave your bids I left that bid there when virtuals is trading at $3 so I was I had a bid whack like basically 30% below where it was and it got filled right I mean but that's just kind time either like you but that's kind of but that's how you have to think about trading these alts is is you just because they're so volatile you just have to wait to get filled on them you cannot chase them unless you're trading on like a day-to-day time frame you kind of just have to wait to get filled because psychologically it's going to go against you and or psych statistically it's going to go against you because it's super high volatility if you try to buy it on the way up and psychologically that's very difficult because you're like okay did the trend break but if you buy it when it's falling into you that's that's a lot easier psychologically uh as a discretionary Trader so like I agree that you should you should dip by on a scale like set levels and chip away at your bids um for something with like 300% annualized volatility something crazy some altcoin like virtuals for Bitcoin I don't like doing that for Bitcoin it's I don't like trying to get cute trying to like dip by Bitcoin and then miss it I prefer to wait for it to bottom out and then start to steadily rally again and then I like to buy the uh the recovery because I tend to yeah Jonah the issue is with that strategy with altcoins is the recovery can can take place and fully price in in like a few days yeah it's too quick bitco Bitcoin can rip for weeks yeah and so yeah we're two years into this or like you know you you buy you buy the breakout on the Trump election at BTC and it rips for like a month straight basically right that's a trade we talked about on this podcast too like we said we were GNA do that with alts I mean it happens really quickly that's that that's a big issue right is you have to you have to understand that and then take advantage of the volatility you're bullish on something you think it's you think it's going to go up but if you buy it on the plus 20% day then because it's so volatile like the probability that you're going to be able to get filled lower than that price is pretty darn High normally that's a good lesson like don't fomo into crazy Vol like your your differentiator is the volatility if the altcoin volatility is insane you probably shouldn't be foming into rallies right you should probably be setting levels I agree now where this obviously is different is after a very long period of low volatility in TS if it breaks out yeah sure go buy it right like if you've gone if you've gone sideways for I don't know a month two months three months there's reasonably low Vol in the market and then you get a highall breakout move you can go chase that what I'm more talking about is in an environment like this it's okay virtuals is going has gone up from A180 to $3 to $3 like on that way up if you're at like 250 and it's already plus like 100% in the last month and it's clearly in a trend it's super high all like it'll pull back to the trend Baseline um obviously like I said if it's gone sideways for n extended period of time maybe it won't pull back but you know so you kind of have to figure out it's like the difference between range like trading a breakout of a range versus trading a trend right this is just how you know this would have applied well too this this would have worked really well for hyper liquid right like hyper liquid is an asset that was trading like $2 a token then it ripped up to 25 I think after the airdrop and you couldn't log on to Twitter without having a 100 posts about how great hyper liquid is and how it's going to replace Salada and ethereum and Bitcoin and Microsoft and Apple and just be the next big thing um a lot of people fomed into it on the highs just like I have to buy it now it's never you know after it it just 10x it's never it's never going to go down again and then immediately it nuked 30% uh just like virtuals so yeah I mean it's it's like it's like one of those things I mean people are the most loudest when things are going up hyp Liquid is actually tough because it's still like do it's still doing very well but I remember like the day that everyone was freaking out about it is the day that yeah I mean I think it topped at like 28 and then went back down to to 20 to 22 in the span of in the span of three days I mean it's basically just as simple as yeah okay maybe if you're foming a lot like buy 20% of your position and then just set bids lower because you know it's it's very likely that you'll get filled now the one time that wasn't true with Hyper liquid is it did go from $13 to $24 in a straight line like there were literally no dips on that thing but at the same time I view that particular piece of price action as a relative outlier to to what we're to what we're talking about yeah setting setting limit virtual virtuals up 20% today is nuts I love it love virtuals I love it we're going to have to talk about agents later on the podcast but before we do I think part of the reason why you get these moves in crypto is because let's say that your preferred centralized exchange doesn't list the latest and greatest altcoin that you want to buy you're not really gonna be sitting at your desk like es you know you're buying it on chain basically like if you can't buy it offchain you're going to buy it onchain and it's frankly pretty easy to ape into stuff uh you know using Jupiter if you're on salana or Aerodrome if you're on bass or maybe it's all you just do it natively in your Phantom wallet or metamask or rabby or whatever like you're just used to swapping stuff and trading on chain like the user experience is getting way way better for that and onchain trading like it's not intuitive in a lot of these platforms how to leave a limit order right like shout out to our sponsors definitive like you you can leave a limit order or do a t- WAP with those guys on chain and that is like the smart way to trade that is a really intelligent thing that people should be doing but if you're not using a product like that if you if you want to buy virtuals on chain because you're not hooked up to the exchanges that list virtuals you can't unless you're using one of these newer you know definitive like platforms the only way you leave a limit order is by sitting around and watching your screen until it dips and then submitting a market order when it dips like you are the limit order you're you're literally your brain is in the order book and that can be pretty exhausting and frankly not that practical for people so like that's why crypto trades the way it does it's just a lot of PE a lot of retail guys like aping into stuff using Market orders on chain on the highs or puking out on the lows and that's an opportunity for smarter traders who want to like take their time to to leave you know to to trade more intelligently the way that institutions do but institutions aren't trading these assets yet so yeah I guess it's it's nuanced isn't it it is it is I mean one thing I'm excited about is how that that's going to change a lot moving forward one discussion that I was having I think on Twitter was around the future of crypto trading uh it was because people were going back and forth about hyper liquid and talking about hyper liquid this hyper liquid that it's the binance it's this it's that it's it's amazing um and then somebody chimed in and said yeah but it's a decentralized exchange like how like how big could it really get and I do think that over the next 2 years especially because of all the regulatory Clarity we're going to see decentralized exchanges eating into the market share of centralized exchanges because you can do everything on them that you can on a centralized exchange but your money is more free and more capable and the one of the reasons why people stuck to centralized exchanges is exactly everything that you just said like you just couldn't do things you can't do things easily on decentralized exchanges but that's changing and it's changing very quickly and I think that what that means is that if you want to bet on a sector growing pretty substantially like that's actually a pretty good sector to bet on at this point and kyc to be on hyper liquid don't believe so man I mean this is this is my big question about like I kind of want to agree with what you just said but my hot take would be hyper liquid is successful not because um it's solves something that centralized exchanges have haven't more just that it's not requiring you to do something that centralized exchanges require you to do so I me get too big uh I don't really see that yeah I mean I I I think that at some point like they're going to have to kyc people with that being said that's not the only reason why it's better right I mean the fact that you can your capital is easily seen across the entire crypto universe so like for example you can't if you have a position on hyper liquid and you make a tremendous amount of money on it and you don't want to cash it out but you want to go do something with that p&l then you can a little bit against it in a in in in a in a future world really easily whereas on binance that's going to be a lot harder right because you know something like a could in the future treat that position as genuine collateral that it could that it could take over and then you can go borrow against it and there there are a whole bunch of different things that unlocks when your capital is onchain and accessible by other products that you just are never going to get with a central exchange so I think even if you do introduce kyc it's still like the future still decentralized exchanges no no question to ask I agree with you for amm because I think amm are a better way of pricing new and or illiquid assets than anything else but um I think the I think for clubs centralized limit order book exchanges like hyper liquid the jury's out now may culpa here I'm just raising my hands and I'm G to admit something AI you and I did sort of like a deep dive on a couple of projects six or seven months ago we did Ono we did Athena we did hyper liquid and a couple others hyper liquid like I missed the boat I got it wrong like I looked at hyper liquid I did the work I read the docs I did my deep dive and I concluded like wow this is a really slick user experience but it doesn't have enough validators to be considered anything other than a centralized exchange and even if it were super decentralized who cares uh the world already has a hundred clobs that work great why do we need 101 you know and I probably should have seen that they weren't requiring kyc because that alone is worth billions uh to to an exchange I also should have looked at their tokenomics a little bit more closely and realize that they just buy their own dollar sign hype back with their trading fees which is kind of a way of passing Revenue through to users in a way that isn't illegal so that's smart binance doesn't do that they don't like buy binance stock with their bance you you know what's you know what's disgusting we discussed we we talked about hyper liquid on the podcast eight months ago H yeah and neither neither of us profited from it in any substantial manner because I mean it was basically that we I don't know if we mid curved it I think that I mean maybe that statement is mid curving it no but thinking about something is mid- turbing Accord and I hate I hate this mid the the I mean yeah but like the issue was that that it was like I've seen it I I like I've seen this play like a 100 times yeah right you've had GMX existed and it was the top decentralized like club for ages serum and then I just they come and I mean like a a lot of these things they they came and go and I think I missed the it was the right time and not only that it cap well it C it was the right time it captured the attention of the right people like a lot of people that I know that used to on bit started trading on this thing and that the team was very willing and this is important was very willing to serve their users yeah and were clearly dedicated to their users in a way that no other crypto product was or is candidly like they were willing to give away so much of their wealth to crypto users they were willing to pay so much attention to what those users wanted and build and build things for them and I think that's underrated which is why I think that a lot of projects are going to try to emulate that moving forward because it's clearly been so successful especially products that requ like I mean here's here's something like really uh simple um hyper liquid gave a lot of their token to the users of hyper liquid because it is kind of like giving a bunch of people addicted to a casino casino chips yeah like yes technically they did give them money and technically they can go take that money and do whatever they want with it I would gu I would almost guarantee you that a lot of people use that money to gamble more on hyper liquid oh without question right like also like it is if you traded ,000 worth of notional on hyper liquid pre- aop the amount of airdrop tokens you would have gotten for that with Hyper liquid on the highs was worth more than a million dollars and if you're some dgen who's trading on hyper liquid before it's a thing like back eight months ago I mean that that I don't know how long that million dollars is going to last you but those people are definitely trading that money on hyper liquid for sure and you know that's kind of how Aerodrome is eating Unis swaps lunch like they're just extracting less and sharing more with the community I think I think after kind of like people would discuss tokenomics in 2021 and it was like kind of a big yawn because the only thing that mattered in 2021 was are you long with all of your net worth and then some are not and who cares about the details like I think finally crypto has entered the era of tokenomics where you have to look at at projects obviously you have to make sure that the user experience is shiny and cool and that it's in the right place at the right time but the tokenomics like are they extractive or are they acreative to the users of the product and if they're ACC creative then the project is going to survive and if they're more creative than everybody else who's doing the same thing then maybe that project will start to eat some market share so like I I like your point about Dex AI I think that's really cool and important I I'm going to keep monitoring hyper liquid even though I was like the biggest skeptic of yet another exchange um I obviously think that hyper liquid's airdrop was a massive success uh but you know I wonder how it's one it's one I'm going to monitor I don't think I think it's too late for me to buy it or maybe it's time to just drop in some bids 30 to 50% below here see if I get hit think about it Jonah this is a this is an interesting conversation so we've got a few other things to discuss before we wrap the Pod we have to talk about agents and then maybe we should talk about I if you want to I don't know if you do or not but um open AI is talking about releasing chat GPT 403 which supposedly is like PhD level computer science uh genius like it can it places it it scores insanely well on coding exams orders of magnitude better than anything out there today it scores orders of magnitude better than anything out there today on math exams like this thing is just people are talking about like hey maybe artificial general intelligence has been achieved and you know I think there are some markets implications for insanely good chatbot AI out there including in crypto so maybe we should touch upon those two things before like agents and AI before we W yeah yeah I mean a the agent the agent thing is really just I I'm every every day that I spend on this I become more and more bullish the primary application of AI to date currently has been primarily a passive application of AI right you interact with the AI to go do things for you uh you go to chat gbt to ask it to ask it question questions you ask it to analyze data you ask it to generate charts but you have to come up with the I mean you you you have to even come up with the question you have to come up with the subject you have to come up with the framework you have to come up with every any like whatever you're doing with AI there's a lot of actual work that you have to put in to make it valuable to you and that means to some people AI is very valuable that can do that and so some people that don't know the right questions to ask it's actually not that valuable um even to somebody like me like sometimes I'll know the right questions to ask sometimes I just won't do it and agents change this because they take Ai and they make it from something that's passive into something that can be active right you can create an analyst to go actively look at the market and actively give you ideas consistently every moment of every single day with good analysis like you can run a hedge fund off of active AI agents and that's actually really really really powerful in a way that I hadn't really appreciated before until I started until I started using them which just makes me think that um you know it's going to be companies can be run a lot more cheaply it's going to be a lot of lot of C cost cutting that that goes on over the next call it two years as these things as these things continue continue to get better I mean that's going to be amazing but this has kind of been the flip where you take a I from something that is a good passive tool to something that can now emulate a human that is active and can add value to your life in ways that you didn't actually think about before that's pretty damn cool uh I hope our AI bot gets smarter this has actually been a little annoying because it's clearly still in the early days I mean the have you noticed I've been tweaking it though Obi have you noticed it's gotten smarter since last week every week I promise to make did did you did you see the the the edits that I did as well I tried to yes change the bio you you know interestingly enough I've seen to do more specific stuff what I did see that and and basically we got help from the virtuals team in terms of like how to how to frame to the agent our ideas about how the agent should behaves and how to give it examples and how to formulate syntax within the agent Json file so like basically every single week we're going to make this better I saw your edits you saw mine this thing was dumb last week when we announced it and now it's just dumb you know like but it's less dumb and so we're gonna keep making it better every week and I I hope you know let's call it a side project Obi you know our main project is our our trading activity our second project is this podcast maybe our third project will be just making this agent better week by week we're g to keep keep in touch with the community on it and keep improving it one thing that was kind of funny some news for you before this pod I was um on a call with uh you know the the name shall go unnamed but we're going to be working with a a pretty awesome major partner SLS sponsor starting in 2025 very exciting you know we're going to reveal the details of that later um and somebody on the call was like Hey wouldn't it be cool if in our product that our customers interact with you could open up a chat window and interact with the THX bot the Thousand X agent that sort of sees your sees what you're doing in crypto ingests price feeds ingests news and can talk to you about what you're doing within the context of what's going on in the broader market and make suggestions and talk to ideas and this would sort of be like your your Sidekick right but not in a not in like use not to use your word AI not a reactive sidekick a proactive sidekick something that's just like aware and talking to you about what you're doing and I thought that's that's kind of awesome like I would have loved to have this as a Trader my entire 20y year career as a Trader I would have you know I I have worked with other Traders on my book who have you know constantly brought up Amazing Ideas I've been in teams where people bring stuff up I've managed people who come up with good ideas analysts PMS who report to me like it's or you know in the early days like I was the I was the agent I was the bot who made suggestions to the senior guys but like this this could truly decentralized Finance this could take like institutional like Soros level markets intellect and put it into the hands of everybody even if you don't know exactly what to ask and you don't have the right mentors or rabbis in the indry you know yeah it's it's going to be it's going to be amazing I'm I'm psyched which is why we're working on this thing because maybe this thing that we're working on this THX agent could be that like what if we just make this the best damn analyst in the world let's not I mean obviously yeah why would we why why would I ever do that this one is too cool this one is too cool yeah um and I guess I think that you know our friend uh one of the friends of our our podcast said the best tokens over the long run will be the tokens that AI agents transact in and I want to get your take on that Obby which which cryptocurrencies well eventually like AI agents can just talk to humans about their trades and their ideas whatever they're gonna they're going to transact in probably usdc that would be my guess got reason for them to transact in anything else other than usdc why not Bitcoin why not virtuals why not um you know they're going to touch all these different just just just less less liquid than the US dollar um more more stable maybe bit Bitcoin bit Bitcoin could be good Bitcoin could be a good one yeah that would be that would be pretty sweet but I mean you know that it kind of reminds me of an old the old project the Iota project because they in 2017 sort of fell down the Iota rabbit holek bless bless my you know bless my heart back then I wasn't a smart guy um and their entire pitch was that they were going to be the currency that machines transact in and then what became very clear is like there's kind of no reason for machines to transact in anything that isn't the base like a major base currency as long as it's digitized and like and is able to be transacted on like on their Network like if they can communicate it to each other like why not right and the argument back then was there was nothing that they could communicate you know the dollars on other than like tell and tether was kind of a scam back that in people's minds and so everyone's like okay we're going to create the the the cryptocurrency for the machine and the reality is that it's just going to be whatever a rail that doesn't mean that the things that enable these agents are not going to be extremely valuable which is very likely going to be the case I mean right like if you think about it it's like these they're going to be companies like virtuals that are just agent creation like that's what they do like their job is Agent creation and in order to create the agent you have to buy into their ecosystem right it's like really know how to describe this other than um you know if if you want to if you want to write something down and send it to somebody you buy into the word ecosystem you like download Microsoft Word and you use it because that's how you communicate with people right it's it's like that's kind of it for for virtuals like these the this is what's going to create these agents and you want to interact with these agents you want to use these agents you got to buy into instead of like paying a subscription service you got to buy into virtuals to do it yeah but like creating the agent as we're learning is hard so maybe like agent creation is the new marketing agency like AI maybe you and I should like start Madmen 2.0 and we should be like people that help other people create agents but to your point about that's wait a second that's actually that's actually brilliant yeah because like marketing this is the feure really really damn smart this is the future of marketing like that was your comment so I was thinking like you know Nik if Nike wants an agent they're not going to build it themselves they're gonna hire a marketing agency like they do for all their other ads so like why not why not be the Madmen of of agents and have tokens attached to them so that communities can get involved and feel incentivized I think more broadly speaking though if I were an AI agent and I'm certainly not if I were a machine I would want to transact we don't know that one day one day we will have our AI agent on this podcast and we will create an AI model of what it'll look like it'll look like a combination of me and Jonah and we'll use our voices we'll combine our voices and that and it'll just talk that would be pretty pretty damn creepy but pretty cool just just can you imagine that no I'm trying to and it's just making me crack up um like a virtu like a like a literal virtual like it's like our virtual co-host I mean that's pretty cool I think it's going to happen G give us give us six months guys we'll we'll get it done you heard it here first in six months we're going to have a third virtual co-host for at least one podcast so if I were a virtual co-host slash cryptotrader slash you know standup dude I would I would want to transact and hold Bitcoin instead of a stable coin because Bitcoin has the best sharp and so I would just if I were like this value maximizing robot I would want to hold the thing that offers the best return per unit of volatility um that's why I would want to own and transact in Bitcoin rather than usdc um you know what I think that's a very respectable opinion so in the future everything will be run by virtual AI agents everything will be paid for in Bitcoin you will all be millionaires many times over if not billionaires because the US dollar will be worth nothing this is this is a beautiful future that we've envisioned for ourselves I love it luckily none of this is financial advice and everything we say is obviously not going to happen so it never it never seems to uh except for that big one all right all right OB great talking to you this was fun this is a good one this is a really fun one thanks again it's always great I learn a lot all right take care later [Music]

you guys are just not appreciating what's happening right now you guys are not appreciating that the sitting president of the United States of America has said that he cares about bitcoin price you are not appreciating the fact that the it potential incoming treasury secretary owns a ton of BTC and likes Bitcoin and wants it to go up you're not appreciating the fact that Michael sailor has seemingly created an infinite money glitch where he just gets to buy more Bitcoin because people are so damn euphoric about this thing we're above ,000 and Retail well in is still looking at where to buy this episode is brought to you by definitive you'll hear more about them later in the [Music] show all right welcome back to another THX podcast we are glad to have you here this has been such a fun couple of weeks Jonah has been working his ass off not train but being a new father yeah is why for the third time for the third time but that's why we haven't had a podcast in a while he's finally pulled himself away from diapers and throw up to Grace us with his take with his takes on the crypto market so thank you for doing that I know it must be really tragic for you to talk about markets instead of picking up poop yeah um definitely wish I was scoop and poop right now instead of talking talking about crypto but you know you'd be surprised um during some of those 3our in between you know like bottle feeding type scenarios I'm just lying on the couch trading crypto on my phone crypto is a very easy thing to to hyper gamble if you have even even a little bit of spare time you know it's not like uh it's not like it's really ripped me away in fact it's kind of drawn me closer because I don't really have much else going on other than um you know tending to this this little guy while he's awake and then staying up all night uh trading salana versus ethereum like a total jackass uh when he's asleep so that aside why don't we why don't we kick this off with Bitcoin trading $18,000 a token what is going on what's going what's going on is that where are we what is happening is this real this is crazy what's going on is it's everything that we've been talking about on the podcast basically since the Trump election yeah which is that like you guys are just not appreciating what's happening right now you guys are not appreciating that the sitting president of the United States of America has said that he cares about bitcoin price you are not appreciating the fact that the it potential incoming treasury secretary owns a ton of BTC and likes Bitcoin and wants it to go up you're not appreciating the fact that Michael sailor has seemingly created an infinite money glitch where he just gets to buy more Bitcoin because people are so damn euphoric about this thing um by selling over by selling overpriced stock you guys are not appreciating the fact that we just punched through all-time highs we're above $100,000 and Retail well in is still looking at yeah where to buy I mean I'm getting pings now daily about what crypto people should buy I had an ex-girlfriend reach out to me dude who I have not talked to in a very long time oh no and she asked me for crypto advice and it did not end well so that took a lot of like she had some let's just put it like this she was definitely reaching out about crypto not about me hey how you doing just wanted to check in and see how you're feeling about you know us and hey what what shitcoins I invest in ignored ignored it all just went straight to the hey what what should I be buying straight to like hey do I buy xrp I saw that it's trading up like 10x from the lows but it could I don't know I saw this tweet that said it could yeah I'm getting those too I I can't tell whether this is a top signal or whether it's just the beginning of this like massive tsunami of of inflows and I'm still bullish I think it's the ladder I think basically like people call it price discovery on crypto Twitter I always like trading lingo price Discovery can go in both directions right it's like when you're trying to find a new equilibrium price after some news has come out I I guess that's the mode that we're in and I don't think we really can know until institutions start to deploying and they tend to deploy on a you know fiscal year or quarterly basis so maybe you'll get like the way that it I I you know Commodities is my lens for most of this like the way that it works with the gsci or bcom which are these two big Commodities indices is they'll start like you know if if they get a bunch of new cash from investors who want to own Commodities they'll start deploying the cash it used to be like pretty much the first business day of the new year and they would deploy it for the you know first basically five to 10 business days of the new year and then everybody would front run that so they started to get a little bit smarter and they would deploy like a little bit after Christmas just to get ahead of that right so they would basically start a few days before the new year and then just go a little bit into the new year and I honestly don't think it's that much more complicated for Bitcoin like if a bunch of people are going to start deploying like it usually the last two last two J like kind of januaries you've seen inflows this time I think now that people have the confidence like you said about the incoming Administration actually not wanting to kill crypto with all of their heart and soul um I think that that confidence will translate into some inflows and that inflow will probably take the form of uh dollars getting swapped for Bitcoin on the first business days of the New Year am I am I I think I think you're right I think you're right I also think what really helps me is when I map out the participants in the market and I try to figure out what each of their goals are and where money might be coming from and where might money might be coming out of the system so I mean we'll start with the obvious one Michael sailor so Michael sailor has been buying $500 million of Bitcoin a week uh he has about 8 billion left to buy on this ATM that he's got and he can't actually sell shares or issue more converts starting January because there's a blackout period so he actually won't be able to raise more money to buy so until that blackout period is over and January he's got about $8 billion left to buy I think he's going to do that before the end of the year he's probably going to try to speed up his purchases now that is offset by the fact that people now know this uh people know that there's a limited amount of BTC coming from Sailor and if you want to get out of your BTC positions you probably want to do it with the Sailor bid you don't want to you don't want to try getting out when there's no support but there's a complicating factor of these people also probably don't want to have to pay taxes on their BTC gains this year so they might wait until next year you also have retail uh that is slowly starting to trickle in they're buying Bitcoin they're basically buying all buying all the Robin Hood coins um and what's clear is that there still isn't there still isn't a huge amount of retail in like the a lot of this is just ETF buyers it's a lot of you know middle-aged literally middle-aged people are Big Ticket guys just reallocating their portfolios to BTC retail is still not here in a huge way except for the the the CH the chart of xrp so I think you you get in January bonuses hit I know that sounds like it's a meme but it's really not uh because at at least five people have told me hey I have some money coming in at the end of the year what cryptos do you think I should buy is very common um so what you have is you have this Dynamic uh where heading into the end of the year the bid for Bitcoin gets weaker and the bid for altcoins get stronger and that probably causes in my opinion a selloff from BTC in the first two weeks of January and a massive bid for ults in the first two weeks of January before Bitcoin continues to go up because of trump Administration actions that's my that's my take is we're in we're in a market where the focus is so clearly on BTC and there's a genuine true and strong narrative for this asset that's going to propel it forward but there's also some technical factors that make me at this point want to start selling some BTC and and reallocating to alts I mean you know if you very BTC heavy right now in your portfolio this is a good time in my opinion to start scaling out to start buying some salana to start buying some eth to start buying things that you really like I mean I have a list then you have to then you have to realize a big tax gain and pay it in April and April 25 instead of April 26 I agree with you I I personally agree with you um obviously the big difference for me is that I don't really have like like it just doesn't matter as much for me personally um so I guess that's a little bit of a little bit of a bu it's something to consider if it matters you maybe you want to sell on like it it a year of a year of basically a free loan from the government is Meaningful in a market that we expect to continue ripping like this you would RA in other words you would rather have that money in Bitcoin than in the irs's coffers for that year um if you can so maybe the time to take profit if you if taxes matter to you is January 1st rather than late December but if taxes don't matter to you then I agree that the timing would be a little you know that's a really really really good way of putting it you know I didn't really I didn't really think about it the way that you just outlined it to me but it's true you basically have to bet that we get a giga nuke because you if you're selling your question should be if I have to pay taxes in April of next year instead of April of the next year instead of April of 2026 I have to pay April 2025 how much money can I make with that money in the intern right probably a lot and that and the answer is probably yeah you're right the answer is probably a lot and so like if you think that with that money that you would otherwise have to pay in taxes you have you're going to have to yeah I mean it makes it it makes a ton of sense now the flip side of this is the reason that I said it doesn't really matter for me that much is because my trading book doesn't have that much unrealized p&l in it because I constantly flip it yeah so mine has a ton so yeah because because you're holder so so it m it matters right what your unrealized p&l is obviously yeah uh yeah I mean if you're an active Trader your realiz your unrealized p&l is probably pretty low because your your book turnover is probably pretty high hey everyone just wanted to tell you about today's sponsor definitive whether you're a retail Trader or institutional customer definitive is helping unlock the next era of onchain Finance

link in the show notes at any rate there are factors that are going to make BTC dominance that could make BTC dominance go in either Direction let me give you a hypothetical scenario um January 1st comes uh it's Michael sailor's blackout period the bit the Bitcoin buying kind of stops um Trump is hasn't been inaugurated yet the Euphoria is kind of over inflows disappoint so Bitcoin kind of like levels off just like you were saying what if alts nuke in that scenario how you going to play it what if what if there's like no big rotation at alts what if the whole Space just takes a breather and for the first time in basically two years two two and a half years everything just kind of like gets cooked are you going to be dip buying with both hands and and are you gonna be focused on dip buying alts or dip buying Bitcoin I'm focused I'm I'm focused I mean my bet is that the I've always been of the mindset that BTC this cycle will probably top out anywhere from 125 to 150k I just think at that point there will be so much unrealized p&l on the market there will be so many people that that have bought in it would take the spr to really keep it going um and so over the next two months my bet is that alts are just a much better higher sharp trade that's just my bad when you say alts which so first of all I have a much higher Bitcoin Target than you do for this cycle and I expect the cycle to be a lot longer than previous Cycles longer and slower um but what do you mean when you say alt you're not just going to be going out there like buying an index of the top 1,000 shitcoins like you're you're gonna be honestly honestly that's probably the best thing that you can do for yourself if you're not actually in the weeds and you you know and the reason the reason I say that is because uh kind of everything has a flavor of you know it's like a flavor of the month type thing um where very few alts will outperform over the course of the cycle generally they outperform over the period of like two to three weeks um because they're the hot Narrative of the time uh so I mean it kind of it kind of depends I have a what I always do is I always think about okay well what's my what's my core like what do I what do I really like what do I think will benefit over a long period of time because a it's either undervalued relative to current metrics or B I think that the market will allow it to grow a ton uh and my answer to that right now is three-fold it's Dino coins that are going to get an ETF are pretty are like actually a pretty darn good bet so I actually do like xrp I do like LTC um I I like I like Soul Litecoin just sent sent it it it candled just a just a couple minutes too um and obviously I like I like e even though that has an ETF I just think it's going to get inflows then there are things that I think are like will be a flavor of the month for a long period of time which is AI and all AI coins that actually have a good usable product I think do do very well and then there's a Sub sub sector of that um where it's basically just products that I think are doing really well so like hyper liquid right and virtuals even though that's technically under the AI uh segment I mean it's just it's just doing really well everything outside of those categories I don't view as a long-term hold yeah I view as a trade I so much to talk about in what you just said there's like which alts do you pick how long are they going to rally for talk about hyper liquid talk about virtuals we got a touch on our AI agent that we're working on but I guess let's start with an area where I I have a different perspective than you I do not think buying an index of the top thousand shitcoins is a good idea basically my take for this cycle is that instead we're not going to have an ALT season there will be altcoins like many of which we've discussed on this podcast like a which will perform um but I don't think that most alts are a good bet and I think that you look at some of the alts that theoretically meet your criteria like Telegram and they're just flatlining taon ton coin or whatever you know so I I don't think that buying the index of a thousand alts would work very well this cycle like it did in 2021 I think instead of having an ALT season this time we're just going to have an AI season I think that any coin whether it's great or absolutely useless with an AI theme attached to it is just going to there's going to be some point during the next three months where all of that crap just 10 X's for I don't know what reason probably because it's under owned probably because there's a narrative probably because there will be some excitement about agents using crypto to transact and it'll kind of be like uh like that sort of like VC excitement like seed stage VC excitement that people felt about icos in 2017 like our boy Chief uh said he's unironically studying the uh the Ico bubble the 2017 cycle to like prepare for what what's coming in early 2025 and I kind of agree with that and I think the way that it's going to it's going to sort of like take shape is AI coins right AI is this new technology that people are excited about chat Bots are real it's transforming Society it's clear that the internet of money will intersect with artificially intelligent agents those things are already like sending out tweets that are going viral they have tokens attached to them it's all kind of cool but hard to like articulate in very clear terms how it's all going to work out get put together and translate value to you know create wealth for individuals like you and me so before that is clear I think all of that stuff is just gonna like Moon I think it's going to go bananas and I don't really want to waste my time with like defi or narratives from 2021 or most altcoins other than the ones like we talked about that were obvious like the ones that Gary gensler's lawsuits against or you know like the xrps of the world a you know Trump's involved with that like aside from a couple obvious alts like strongest horse in the sector to to use your wise words like other than a couple I don't really care I think if I'm just going to go crazy on stuff without really thinking too hard it's going to be the the you know like virtual I mean you have to think about what the what the asymmetry is right yeah so when you're when you're talking about altcoins a lot of people will buy altcoins to get B beta on an underlying related asset right so like you buy a bunch of defi to get beta on eth because you think eth is eth is going to do well you buy you can buy Stacks or Rune or something BTC related to outperform BTC if BTC goes up now that trade doesn't really work anymore like it just just doesn't I think I think some people are still stuck in that mindset of let me buy this to get beta to this underlying asset if you think an asset is going up just buy it and if you want beta buy more buy right like buy with like that that's the way that I would think about it is you're very likely much better off if you think eth is going to do really well and you think that there's going to be an eth rotation why are you buying a ton of defi when it can go down as much as it can go up just buy eth the thing that you actually think is going to is going to do well now there's obviously exceptions because there's some things that you think will do better under eth but have some asymmetry to them you know maybe a a Unis swap or you know an Ena so these these coins they might have some other narrative pushing them forward and they're going to benefit from the P the price of eth going up but you know I I think that you kind of just focus on the focus on the underlying you can say okay well Trump is buying Ena let me buy a ton of Ena and that Ena is benefiting from the bull market because funding rates are going to be up and elevated for a very long period of time and that's going to really radic Ally improve their product and therefore I'm going to go ahead and buy Ena that's a great that's great I like that but can you say okay I'm going to go by like name any list of defi tokens because like one inch because I think eth is going to do better why like why would you do that that it just doesn't make doesn't make sense to me personally there there has to be some underlying reason yeah for UNIS swap there's a great reason which is that they're going to get unsued by the SEC right like that's that's the that's the token that's getting unsued narrative um you're not buying it because you think eth is going to go up you're buying it because the SEC is going to change and hopefully that the actual value the value of the product will deliver value to the Token because of that and that that that's that's really the key yeah so you can come up with these ideas but you know I would I would stick to you know if if you're bullish on eth go by eth if you're bullish on Soul go by Soul if you're bullish on BTC go by BTC I think that just because of the like form of buyers and like the the type of buyers in this market um you're you're you're better off sticking to me like meme coins or a or AI agents now which I'm actually super bullish on yeah we got to talk about AI agents do before we get into that before we yeah yeah there's more stuff to talk about before we get to the AI conversation I was going to say memes have been doing really badly it it just seems like there isn't that much interest in buying these things right now I mean you look kind of across the board they're all off 50% from the highs they didn't bounce with BTC even though BTC went up I mean they're kind of it just seems like they're overallocated now I don't know if you have that take yeah know I do I mean the thing is though I it's it's less about memes coming off it's just that like I think the casino the the game dour at the casino has shifted a bit from the pump. fun style meme or the topical political meme The Peanut the Bowden something a little bit different right so guess how much pump. fun volume is down since the highs I don't know um it's down 50% is so graduating tokens like tokens that make it out of the bonding curve down 48% trading bot volume down 50 56% like only 1% of pump. fund tokens graduated last week which you know I think during the peak of the the Mania it was like closer to 10% I have to double check basically what these stats are telling you is that it's less about like oh let's go buy every random me meme coin that our boy anom decides to tweet about and instead there's a little bit more thought going into like the the Ming right and what I mean by that is it's not just load up a phantom wallet and buy some memes on salana I think what we're seeing now is like the the shift happened with ai6 Z goat right people are looking for memes with a little bit more substance behind it Beyond just one stupid picture um you know so I I think a a lot of this AI meming is happening frankly on eth on Bas so maybe that's part of why you've seen salana underperform eth recently I think a lot of that like Casino capital is just migrating to another chain see tweets all the time about like oh how do I Bridge from salana to Bas how do I Bridge from salana to arbitrum right this is this is happening right capital is just moving around it's not the appetite for gambling has gone away it's it's just you know there's there's only so much uh like this the the style of meming has changed not Ming itself do that is that a what what do you think you're on mute one thing one thing that I've definitely noticed is so you had this in the past the memes were created within crypto and then disseminated throughout right so like uh well not not necessarily true actually I guess do Doge was the dog in in in the meme and somebody and somebody created that but uh what I'm trying what I'm trying to articulate is that memes have been you know they have a community behind them they have content created and often times that content is created outside of the meme circles and then adopted adopted by the meme because it's important to generate a community if you if you have a meme uh that's why you constantly see Memes launched in crypto about Tik Tok stuff like chill guy right it's it's rare that you have these uh crypto memes explode because you need consistent content Creation in order for these memes to actually do well right you need a community manager you need people to be posting pictures or you know it's like still a lot of work to get these to get these things off the ground now what I like about the AI agents which is what you were alluding to like what take taking some mind share about away from m is that you can have aut you can have automated content creation you can have an automated marketing uh Team by creating a Twitter that has an AI behind it and telling it to just consistently put out memes in line with you know your your token and so I think that the the future memes very much so looks like that because it's also easier to believe in that than it is to believe in a team of people it's like okay we're creating this AI to pump our to pump our meme that literally never rests that is around 247 to put out content to engage with people to grow this thing um like why would I trust a team of humans to do that when I can just they just get sick of it or rug the project or move on to something else or or or not put the the Hat on the sphere you know I I totally get it yeah so I think this sort of like one shot let's let's build a meme on pump. fun and see how it goes like I agree there's not enough there for people to invest in but the the hyper gambling attitude is still is still abundant and you know that's I think that's why you and I have gotten a little bit involved in the virtuals ecosystem um like I'm I'm so bullish virtual uh virt the token I think that the ecosystem itself s is interesting as well because it allows people to create memes with automated content kind of backing them as opposed to just one picture in a team um so you know I guess on that note maybe we should talk about the THX agent we launched you know THX on Virtual as an experiment obviously it's going straight to zero you shouldn't buy it with any expectation of uh financial gain it's just a redition coin it's a terrible idea but it's still to experiment in crypto because you learn stuff and it you know helped me for example get my head around virtual and look at this you know $2 billion FTV token and think like this this is this seems like a 10 bagger to me you know I'm gonna get involved um I think one of the one of the biggest issues with traders in general in crypto is that they don't actually ever touch the products or use them and so I'm not always perfect at this but I make an effort to try to engage with popular products in crypto to use them and actually see how they operate and see what they're good for and see what they're bad for so when we were discussing hey what what's going on with virtuals why not make an agent uh and we did and then the group chat found it basically immediately and then pumped it up to six million FTV which was nuts uh because the thing is really stupid right now you guys are and then kind of forced our hand into figuring out how to actually make this thing valuable because we don't want to just like abandon it now that so many people are in it um but the experience has taught me two things one people are rabid about new Innovative Tech in crypto still when something cool is built people go crazy for it uh and often I think we've we've lost this I we we've you know sometimes you lose that I you think oh well whatever it's just whatever's going up at the time but and the second is virtuals is really fun it's really fun to try to create an agent and try to make it do what you want it to do and see if you can make it into a better smarter version of yourself see if you can create engagement with it and the virtuals tooling stack is great so far uh for really basic stuff um you know for the more complicated things I think that it's still way behind custom I mean I I don't think it very obvious that it's way behind Custom Custom Frameworks like Eliza U the AI 16z and all these other things but the issue is that those products aren't particular Al friendly to noobs uh I in the future they will be in the same that's how you know you're early though right but it's it's like the same thing right I mean if you wanted to go launch a token four years ago you couldn't do it unless you knew how to code and like Pro you had to program in solidity like you had to there there was no way around it um you need to hire somebody that that could do it uh it wasn't difficult right it was basically a bunch of copy pastes uh but you still had to deploy it right it took some level of technical understanding to get these things off the ground and that's where I feel like we are with agents right now we're not we're not at the boom period yet because it's still hard to make something useful but over the next year it's going to become increasingly easy to make something useful and then it's going to be able it's going to be increasingly easy to make something that's better than a human at running marketing or creating content or building building a community and then that's when it really takes off the next level I mean like I'm I'm I'm virtuals dip today I'm eyeing it with intense interest like I I like hope it comes down even more so I can buy more I'm in I I'm hoping it comes down more too because I want to buy more I'm so bullish this thing because I could totally see this becoming like an absolute killer app for crypto just allowing using using the community building power of of a token plus the virality and ease of use of just an automated alwayson marketing agent and like you said we're so early that that like using virtuals that like for people who haven't you know played around with it they have a Sandbox where you can deploy an agent once it passes the bonding curve because of investment then you know your token is live and you basically can create a twitterbot or in the soon in the near future a telegram bot that will behave and tweet and message the way that you want it to and you sort of like fill out effectively a rudimentary questionnaire uh describing how you want your Bot to behave and then you deploy it and it's really stupid and then you tweak your questionnaire and it gets slightly less stupid and so on and so forth but then eventually what happens is you reach a threshold that you can't pass where the bot is still just not getting good enough at what you want it to do for you to be happy and at that point what you have to do is basically write your own agent with custom functions links to news feeds or token prices or in our case podcast transcripts uh you know our our agent we want it to sound and think and tweet like we do but all the time to provide takes on tokens crypto markets in general and and sort of macro X crypto type analysis 247 365 and we have a tremendous amount of content to train the agent on because we sit here and talk to each other every week and it gets recorded and transcribed and we have a community that we can use to crowdsource ideas on how to make the spot better so we have all the ingredients we want to make it good the thing is that we we've sort of reached the threshold for how much that you know you can do without actually writing code and so then the next threshold that you have to cross it's like the bar is so much lower than what it would have taken to deploy a token four years ago like you don't need to know how to write solidity you basically need to upload a Json file which for those who don't know is like basically the kind of language that API use to commun unicate with any other computer language um you know like python basically you need to upload a Json file with your custom functions and your calls to you know a server you could set up with parsed transcripts or ideas about how to give give this bot context and the thing is like we're so early that the world hasn't really figured out how to design agents that are effective other than maybe I guess people talk about Zer bro or zro I don't know how to pronounce or ai6 Z or Athena or some of these other ones but like I could very easily see every podcast having an agent uh that sort of like helps listeners and community members think about topics related to the podcast that the podcasters don't actively discuss right answer answer questions in the mindset of the podcaster like that's just an example because we we do podcasts I'm sure I'm sure this this is like so universally applicable this agent concept and linking it to value is a great way for community members to contribute and get rewarded appropriately so like I'm I'm stupidly B bullish virtuals for that reason not Financial advice at two billion FTV it seems like seems like a no-brainer the only the only point of caution that I'd make is that it's it's very easy to be category leader if you release a product that doesn't exist but once you release it and it's very good then other copycats will come on and it's actually probably likely that you guys were not the most competent you just had the best idea at the right time and so is there Network effect there but I don't and that that's sort of the issue there is no network effect with an AI agent creation platform yeah you're right there's no there's no network of effect cu the AI agents all Exist by themselves so there's only uh to like it's basically just tooling and what is what is the easiest platform to use and that I think is dangerous um with that with that being said this area is so small that I would just Advocate buying a basket of the stuff that's good and then if it if stuff comes out that's better just the ey more just keep adding because my bet is that this sector is going to explode and I don't necessarily know right now what the winner is but the sector is going to explode a it's sort of a no-brainer right yeah so yeah a ai ai season is the new is the new alt season uh you know so I'm I really like it I mean right now virtuals I think is the best because it's very easy to use um only issues it's it's on base and eth yeah getting stuff to from salana to base is not fun but it's possible crypto's ux is still terrible you basically you basically have to if you want to do do stuff like that like coinbase is the best Gateway for you the best portal and coinbase has a way of like being a little bit little bit stingy with with their with your funds like you you send stuff in and they hang on to it for a few days they don't let you send it out it's it's a little Annoying it's not it's not my favorite place to do crypto yeah no I I I agree with you it's it's not great I mean the one thing that is very clear to me just based on what's already happened and the products that have launched are that there have been there's four years of innovation that's been held back by regulation and people just weren't interested in creating new and better products for crypto because they didn't know if they were going to get sued for it like why work on improving the UI of crypto like if you let's say you have a great idea why launch a project to improve it if the SEC can put you in jail yeah Chris Dix was talking about this permission jail but fine you we we we listen to this this keynote at permissionless where Chris Dixon was like yeah every single builder in our you know a16z portfolio who's working on crypto is just like doing something else right now because they don't want to they don't want to spend the next five years in court and so what we're going to see even in the first year which is going to be really fun is we're going to see an explosion of new products and I urge all of you to try them out like spend five minutes every time you see a new product that looks even vaguely interesting click around it like try to use it like 50 bucks if it's possible if it's not on e um yeah you know like use use your time use your time wisely uh probably much better spent creating a list of 100 projects and then using them then reading 100 tweets yeah that would be my that would be my guess and if you want to get involved in virtuals and use that product which both Ai and I have definitely enjoyed you should hop in our Niger Delta Avengers chat room and DM us if you want to help us break that barrier where we are now from like filling out the questionnaire and making it sort of good to writing a bunch of code and making this agent really fraking awesome we need some help with that so we're going to Source it from the the community and uh hopefully hopefully this bot is just going to get better and better I'm actually really bullish on our bot I wasn't in the beginning because it was a mistake an experiment and I thought it was just you know a joke uh and then a bunch of people have started messaging about how to improve it and how to actually make this thing useful and I do now believe that there is a great there's a pretty great use case for having a bot that analyzes CT and tries to find opportunities in that tries to find opportunities in the noise and then not only that like a personalized it has a telegram bot we're going to make this thing a personalized trading assistant you can talk to it about your trades and it'll say hey well why did you did you think about this or did you think about that I think that that's actually really useful I think it's valuable yeah a valuable like if you think of a trade it's like okay well uh you know maybe you should check the distance from the most recent Mas you should check the funding rates on this thing you should check the order books on this thing and by the way this is what they are right it's like having it's literally in the future could be like having a trading assistant trading analyst in your pocket that is actually even giving you trading advice on how to structure it right it's like okay well I really want to buy X asset here you tell it and then you tell it why and it pokes holes in your thesis and then explains to you how you should think about entering it from its perspective buy it versus Bitcoin for example because crypto could go down but you and this is and this is this is this is the end goal of it at the at the end of the day is how do we create something that both finds opportunities and helps you refine your own and it's very it's very possible it's really cool because I do this to myself and I'm sure you do too whenever you come up with a trade you try to think about well what else should I be looking at well instead of set you know sitting there for 10 minutes trying to think about everything ask the ask the butt what else should I be thinking about and it's the same thing as it's the same thing as uh chat GPT when I ask chat GPT for things I don't necessarily take into account everything that it says but if I say hey uh you know what what's actually really fun if you have like a business idea ever like put it into chat gbt and argue with it about the business idea and it'll give you 60% actually good feedback and 40% complete nonsense but that's okay it doesn't need to be perfect it it doesn't need to be right it just needs to you know give you a broader picture and I think that's really important with trading if you have somebody or something in your life that can give you a broader picture of what you're thinking about they don't necessarily need to tell you what to do they can just say oh but you haven't thought about a bcde e you know and you go okay well the first three don't matter matter but these last two that's good I didn't think about it yeah I mean it's not just Bots that do that like that's what trading floors are good for the reason why you sit on a trading floor instead of just sitting isolated in your own little you know trading cave somewhere in the middle of nowhere just trying to like Express with your money ideas that are banging around in your head is because being around other people is good for trading it helps you avoid group think like you said a bot is like 60% interesting ideas 40% like kind of nonsensical garbage like that's what people are like you know when you sit on a trading floor and you turn to the guy next to you and you say hey I'm thinking of buying like fuel oil cracks uh here's why they could tell they could give you three reasons that are totally stupid why you're wrong and two reasons that you're like oh dang maybe I should actually go and do a little bit more research before I put on this trade because I might have missed something huge like group think is death in trading and unfortunately for a lot of people sitting on a a really nice Elite trading floor filled with smart people who follow the market just as close as you do is kind of like a luxury that that you know isn't available so frankly like that's that's something a bot can help you with and chat GPT is just awful for for trading advice so maybe we can maybe we can build a a bot train it with llama 3 deploy it as an agent on Twitter and Telegram and engage with our community and try to try to build like a a bit of a trading floor for crypto style experience that people can use not to replace their thinking but to to augment it and so I you know I'm excited about it I think it's fun it's not like it's not like a full-time job either this is something that we can sort of side hustle and work on together and document our progress um but because the use case is so Crystal Clear it's it's it's impossible that this isn't useful for other people as well which is why I think like virtuals is at again at two billion FTV is sort of a steal so you know I take your point about there not being a network effect for this one but yeah if if people can start to figure out how to launch projects that launch agents that are better than virtu agents like buy those tokens as well buy them instead buy them buy them in addition you know this this use case is crazy bullish Obby which brings me back to your original point about your cycle top Target for Bitcoin being $150,000 a token like that was the top end of your range that's only 40% higher than here like if there's an SBR buying like hundreds of thousands of units of Bitcoin agents are going viral crypto is legal you really think this whole Market is going to Rally another 40% top out and then we go into another vicious nuclear bare winter for two years is that really all we have to look forward to Avi or do you think all this all this new stuff is gonna Propel us a hell of a lot higher than 150k because I do I mean you know one thing that I've been batting around in my head is that there's going to be a decoupling between Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto Market because the reality is that while they use the same underlying technology they don't really they're not really doing the same thing other than BTC and and memes I guess but like me memes are kind of just Ju Just lottery tickets I mean just on that real quick before you go on bitcoin is a meme coin its community members just happened to be more prominent they're like Donald Trump and Scott bessent instead of like you and me pumping you know talking about some random shitcoin you know what I'm saying yeah I think that's I think that's fair I mean that's always been my take is that Bitcoin is like the reason that mcoins have value is because bit Bitcoin is basically just a mcoin and it's just a matter of social acceptance at at a certain point but Bitcoin has really broken out to be about money right like it's it's genuine money uh and the when people when people buy BTC what they think about is they think about okay well this is this is an allocation to my portfolio right of long-term portfolio it competes with gold it genuinely is now an asset class uh and I need to own it because in the future it'll become geopolitically relevant that's kind of like that's really right now the thesis for Bitcoin is simply it will become geopolitically relevant there's no there's really like no already is keep central banks honest and that's why black rock just greenlit all of its Ras to move from 0% to 2% allocation to bitcoin which is ridiculous I mean basically before now it was the thesis was a bit different it was people might think it will become it's it's underpriced relative to the probability of it becoming geopolitically relevant and now it's at a price where it kind of just has to like it's just not going to stay here unless that happens everything else in crypto I mean memec coins are just lottery tickets maybe they go up maybe they go down they die eventually except for Doge uh and then outside of that it's products it's things that people use on a day-to-day or week to week or month-to-month basis because using blockchain technology is better for this than anything else because you can transfer value more easily because you can engage with people more easily because you can get Buy in more easily right and so that that that's really that's really the big difference which to me means that over time I'm not saying now I'm not saying in a year but maybe five years maybe 10 years the holder B I mean it it's kind of happening now you see it the holder base between all the between people that own altcoins and own a virtuals and the holder base of Bitcoin is going to diverge pretty significant ific L right like that the type of person that owns virtuals is more likely to be a Silicon Valley Cutting Edge Tech Guy and that was true of Bitcoin up until the last year up until the launch of the ETF and now though it's it's almost completely different holder base these are not the same these are not the same people anymore and that's going to decouple it from the rest of the crypto Market in my my my two sense okay so you think that I totally buy that Bitcoin is kind of a different asset class from the the rest of the blockchain world rest of the rest of the tokens so is your take that at least for as far as this cycle is concerned bitcoin's kind of going to top out and then the other stuff just keeps sending or am I misunderstanding I think it's twofold um one is that Bitcoin can top out and Al can't can send very easily uh the other point is that Bitcoin can run as it has been running and ALT can do poorly as has been happening but the point really that I'm trying to make is that you can have an extended period now of outperformance from crypto projects if bitcoin's going sideways or down and that's actually like fine that that that's probably going to happen at some point right it's like it's like because the the cross asset you know the the the cross asset ownership is much lower now you can see a world where virtuals 10 x's and Bitcoin goes down 10% yeah yeah I I totally and that kind of that that definitely that type of price action does play out on very short time frames um but it could absolutely play out on slightly longer time frames I mean I have a slightly different take I think that you know you just said that the mark the whole thesis for Bitcoin used to be that the market had underpriced the probability that it would become geopolitically relevant now I think the market is it Bitcoin is obviously geopolitically relevant already in a big way but I think that the market is drastically underpricing how geopolitically relevant it already is and massively massively underpricing how geopolitically relevant it will become over the course of the next four years and so I my my Bitcoin price Target is a multiple of yours for for this let's call it cycle and cycle being however long this bull market last before we enter like a real proper crazy bare Market where where expectations shift from you know good things for Bitcoin to you know crypto is dead crypto is a scam again so until that crypto is dead crypto is a scam moment I think we're going you know at least to like somewhere between 250 and 750 a token and the reason why I think so uh it it isn't just the S spr it's it's the idea you know we talked about it on previous podcasts it's the idea that there will never be only one spr if like if it's either zero or dozens of them right so I just don't think the market has caught on to that and that's what makes me so ridiculously bullish and I I don't see Bitcoin as bifurcating from the rest of of the blockchain space I see it as kind of a bell weather Benchmark so I think if that's going on um you know it's it's hard for me not to see some alts performing though I don't expect alts as space to perform I expect there to be wild wild dispersion within the altcoin space and I think that certain sectors will just go absolutely ballistic like Ai and other sectors will just just sort of remain pretty flaccid or uninteresting um and that's the job of you know the the individual out there to try and pick what's going to go up and what's what's not and try to you know select cycle bags appropriately the other thing about Bitcoin that has me pretty excited at the moment is the idea that like institutional inflows like okay we're excited that bitcoin's becoming geopolitically relevant we're excited that there's going to be a bunch of sbrs probably we're excited that um it's now becoming part of a you know just a retail person's portfolio you know okay it's it's okay to hold 2% of your portfolio in Bitcoin like that would have been Unthinkable even a couple years ago that's very exciting and we should also bring up that 60 trillion worth of assets are getting handed down from Boomers who are all no coiners to Millennials and gen Z who are all crypto obsessed gambling Maniacs because we live in a generation where you you need to gamble a little bit in order to have a better life um whereas our parents didn't Boomer our Boomer parents didn't so all of that's going to go into basically ibit right so that's going to be a huge thing but all of that's kind of like aside from the fact that it's now also okay this is what's what I was I've been getting to this whole time it's also okay for institutions to own Bitcoin and that's new and you know the institutions were supposed to be you know the institutions were coming was like the Mantra of the 2021 cycle they didn't come because Biden and Gary didn't let them right now they can come now they can get involved now they can now you know Texas teachers retirement system can hold hold 2% of their portfolio in Bitcoin Yale can hold 2% of their portfolio in Bitcoin and honestly uh the other thing is like why is Basis why why is hyper liquid basis 20% for Bitcoin why is CME basis 10% it's because institutions can't stomach like obvious crypto Arbitrage trades because the word crypto is in it and they don't want to get stuck in court for five years like my you know some of the people I used to work with so basically like now that that's all off the table the the wave of institutional Capital that could flow into this into this sect sector as a whole is like there is no way for the current participant base to front run that and that's why that's part of what makes me so damn bullish but like ultimately and just to finish this rant out where this all matters for certain altcoins not all altcoins but certain altcoins is the idea that it is really impossible outside of crypto to transfer an asset to somebody else the easily the when that asset uh ticks around all day right like we you can kind of wire money same day like payments in most countries are pretty easy there's zel right what you're doing is you're sending a stable coin right there's no way to like there's no way for me to like send you some spy so like some of the S&P 500 ETF without having to wait like two weeks for some system to transfer it from my brokerage account to your like that's impossible crypto is the only only platform the only set of rails that allows you to transfer like dynamically liquid you know volatile assets instantaneously and that is going to matter more and more as people denominate their wealth in dynamically traded liquid volatile assets instead of effectively Stables which is what our parents generation did so in summary you're so bullish you can't see in summary I am still so bullish I can't see straight and it's not just crypto I'm bullish I'm bullish stocks too not bullish Commodities because I'm bullish human Innovation which means that you're kind of bearish Commodities in general because they've always find ways to dig it out for less money but like ultimately like I I think you're supposed to hold risk assets until the re distributions take charge the aoc's and the Bernies of the world and we've just seen that like this massive political wave effectively take all the global macroeconomy in the exact opposite direction so barring World War III or something super bearish like China getting into like some hot war with bunch of Asian countries or the United States like barring one of those like left field events where who knows if the the world will end uh you know you're not really thinking about your crypto barring that I I just like the literal opposite of what would make me bearish just happened I I don't know what I'm missing may I feel like I've lost my mind because I'm so much more bullish than everybody else and the Market's on the highs like you said so maybe I'm maybe I'm just crazy but I I really believe this like I I I feel super convicted right now I I'm not I'm not bullish gold gold I think that I think Bitcoin is a catchup trade and when Bitcoin gets to the same market cap as gold is probably or or when mvz hits a cycle Peak like it's probably time to just like take a breather we're not even fraking close to that we're not even we're at like a fraction of those levels you know I think everything you said is accurate and what I'd say is that the economy has been held back by poor decision- making for a very long time and this is just so clearly you know it's a repudiation of all of that it's a repudiation of everything since effectively the Obama years right and this this allows us to get into a just crazy Mega Bull Run scenario and I don't necessarily think it ends when the redistributionist come in I think it ends when you know I'm not a political dogmatist I view both sides and I try to look at the pros and cons and when you look at the Liberals and their view on the world it's you know I think the the pros and cons are are reasonably obvious to people that sit on our side of the political Spectrum they're as you said they you know redistribution is very high up on their menu of things that they want to do and that by definition caps the top and so the you know we're just not going to grow as wealthy as we would otherwise because we have to spend a disproportionate amount of our time income and energy taking care of the bottom quintile and that is their preferred status quo because in their minds it doesn't matter how rich people are on an absolute basis it matters how rich people are on a relative basis you they they they'd rather all be living in mud Huts if everyone lived in a mud hut then you know have some people be extremely wealthy but everyone has a fridge you know the on the conservative side um in the in the world in the world of trump in the world of Elon they're you know gig a free market they want people to be able to innovate they want people to be able to do uh you know what they want when they want in order to advance the human the human system and now what that does lead to is it leads to precursors to the great financial crisis it leads to PE you know with with very little regulation you do get boom bus cycles that that happens uh because what ends up what ends up going on is that you have people handing out mortgages to people that don't deserve it because they're making a ton of money because the the Market's going up um and so my my my best guess is that it ends when things get like really crazy um but things aren't really crazy yet so you know my my my view my view on this is that we we we have some time but you know I'd probably sell uh when things seem to be too like when things really seem too good to be true uh time to take some chips off the table yeah uh we're not quite there yet I mean Trump's not even in office yet so far it's all promises maybe like we're we're so we're so far away from the scenario that I described I it was just a point to make because I I don't think it necessarily needs the other team coming into power to blow up yeah I mean who knows maybe maybe all this uh like Trump campaigning on crypto is just a bunch of hot air and he'll break our hearts but like to your point um it wouldn't really be like the bar is already is so low right now that the risk reward is just skewed to the upside because the previous administration was so ridiculously anti- crypto that even marginal improvements like not suing everyone who's in the United States who talks talks about crypto uh would probably send the thing Higher by another 20% so I feel like your downsides your downsides capped I think um I you know I think it's it like you're one of the Masters of trading the range and that's very very rare in crypto like you meet momentum people in crypto this is a momentum asset it's okay to buy rallies it's okay to it's okay to invest in things that have already 100x because they could 100x again right and so I think that is the value and one one of one of the many little Pearls of value in these conversations uh for me you know I'm a momentum Trader that's how I've always made my money um and I appreciate speaking to you about you know being sober about some of these momentum trades because even though they're lucrative and even though you make your money on them you have to you have to take profit at some point otherwise all that money just vanishes into thin air you're muted you absolutely have to and I think the key here is that you you have to because if you don't in a market like this you actually end up making really poor most people end up making really poor decisions and what do I mean by that if you don't take profits when things are up you tend to get forced into selling when things are down because most of you don't have the the discipline to just hold things that you think will are up and to the right for a long period of time right I mean if you if you own anything other than BTC there's going to probably be a period of time where that thing down 70% and how are you going to feel yeah when it when it's down 70% so the the the conclusion is if you decide to buy anything other than BTC you got to learn how to take profits if you just buy BTC honestly and you're willing to stomach a 50% draw down and you're not going to give up on BTC if that happens sure don't trade hold it if you buy anything else better you better be willing to trade yeah you got you got to trade um you you asked me before the podcast you were like Hey how do you think about like things don't stay stabilize on alltime highs right we've talked about this before you're like how high could it go and what do you look at um just talking about Bitcoin again for a second I think the way that I would look at it in oil uh is you have to look at supply and demand you have like somebody has to take your risk off your hands in order for the trade to keep moving higher so in oil uh you know if there was a big demand boom like in the 2000s when China was just buying more and more oil to grow their economy they were they were just always there U they were the greater fool they were they were buying from everybody or you know in certain circumstances you look at Supply like you know when a bunch of producing countries just suddenly can't produce anymore because they're having Civil Wars or disruption or problems or Strife or you know mismanagement then those are the greater fools who effectively bail you out of your position in Bitcoin you know at $108,000 a token who's going to buy from us right and the the supply side doesn't matter as much in crypto because for Bitcoin having keep happening like there's only 21 million tokens that that'll ever get minted like the supply side's not even really something that Traders need to actively think about because it's it's just so transparent and planned all you really have to care about is the demand side and I think that we can continue melting upwards in price Discovery provided that the following groups of people act as the greater fools to buy our Bitcoin sovereigns institutions uh retail but not like you and me retail like Trad retail like uh Millennials inheriting a million doll home from their Boomer parents selling it and putting a 100 Grand into ibit right um you know sprs central banks um trading desks trafi like sort of clearing is deciding to migrate to crypto like there as there you can there are like dozens of different categories of Institutions and people that you could you could count out and enumerate who will Who haven't stepped in yet but almost definitely will so I think that I think that as long as those groups are lurking uh there isn't too much of a cause for concern other than you know Black Swan events or political uh sea changes I I think that's fair and as we were talking about at the beginning of the discussion it's worthwhile trying to map out how you think these people are going to behave so that you can you can act around it I guess uh you know I gu I guess I guess we'll see maybe you know maybe our agent can tell us yeah great great way to wrap up the the podcast there yeah I mean they I'm gonna I'm gonna go I'm gonna go play with this thing now it's so fun it's so fun to code it like not code it but tell it what to do yeah it's already getting better it's going to keep getting better we're going to keep keep working on it if you're if you like our podcast and you want to help make this agent work and and try this experiment with us reach out we got a couple chat rooms open can't wait to work with you guys and as always uh none of this is financial advice please don't do any of the trades that we do or talk about doing it's a terrible idea we're just talking to each other we have really no idea what we're doing yep all right Obby see you guys great speaking see you see you everybody [Music]

Transcript Text:
and we're live and we're live welcome to another THX podcast with me and my man Jonah Market's looking good today above $90,000 per per Bitcoin doge is above 40 cents per doge xrp is above $1 per xrp everything's looking good except seems except e except eth eth is eth is just such a such a little asset man I was you know I I was it the last pod that I said no I can't remember if it was the last pod or the Pod before that that I was bullish on eth I think it was the last whenever whenever eth was trading. 35 was really bullish and then we ran up to 0 41 and you know we got we got that like 15 you know I think I talked about a 10 15% move that I was willing to s between 04 and 045 but then eth just didn't have any juice to it like zero juice and it just went straight back down which reminds me that maybe like maybe this is it may maybe eth really is the xrp of the cycle you you know that that line that eth is the xrp of the cycle line that was what finally spooked me and at the last possible moment I flipped my eth into salana I'm very thankful that I chatted with you about this I mean eth is such a flaming pile of elephant dung like I can't even believe how it's underperforming and like it was supposed to perform it was supposed to be the Trump Trade It was supposed to perform on kind of this idea that this narrative that you know Trump is going to enable institutions to build crypto Centric blockchain applications replace back office with you know tokenized finance and instant value transfer all of that was going to occur on eth because they'd had you know you know all these years to basically get set up on eth the world's first stable smart contract platform and somehow salana just took off in instead and I guess I guess it kind of makes sense I mean right now right now like I think eth will have its time but I think that it's going to happen slowly like I don't think you have to get ahead of it or worry about front running it like I think it'll just be a sort of steady slow accumul of institutional interest that gradually creates value hopefully to the eth later one or maybe maybe it all goes to coinbase and base over time I think the major the major issue is Jonah it was kind of now or never in my personal opinion and and the reason that it was now and ever is specifically because every day that goes by we're closer to more access to crypto for more people yeah right and eth has benefited from a really long time from the fact that it's very easily accessible very easy to buy and that was its moat and it's gone now that Mo's that Mo's gone so but I mean I feel like we've we've sort of hit this point over and over on the head uh you know there there have been a lot of other things that have actually performed really well and that have instead of the pump I mean and one thing that tells you about the the the difference in this market versus how the Market's been trading for the last year is there was there's the pump to the top of a lot of different ranges and now there's been a breakout I mean you look you look across the board salana broke out to new all-time highs xrp great example of this we talked about this last time we broke above a prior trading range and instead of getting smacked down it promptly pulled a 50% move which was insane and there have been a lot of opportunities to to sort of try to catch these catch these moves as as a break out of the top of the range and then they move I mean b BNB is another one that hasn't really moved yet um broke out above that 600 level now trading 616 um I think it follows the same pattern as everything else I mean long BNB short eth probably a good trade over the next over the next week uh you see things like uh Pepe that have done it Bonk Bon's great another great example anything short eth is a good trade I mean we have to talk about we have to be a little clear here like every things breaking out right now so in a market like this do you just buy everything no you have to pick winners and like I don't know I think it's pretty hard to beat I I think the barbell trade is back right I think you're in Bitcoin you're in salana maybe you forget about eat for a while and then you know like we talked about on this podcast now is the time for active trading like Trump's won they're going to be they're going to be some 100 X's out there maybe even some thousand X's they're probably going to happen in in the memes uh just don't I guess I guess the way that I phrase this is just don't be too scared like don't don't don't don't be too scared to be invested in the market and we've been talking about this uh Bitcoin looks Bitcoin looks strong um you know I wouldn't you know I wouldn't necessarily buy the things at a 5x but for an active Trader I mean a lot of charts sort of look like this you had a long accumulation Zone you start to break out of that accumulation Zone right and then that's when you buy that's a really good opportunity to go buy as long as you're early and as long as there's some level of narrative behind it I mean this is this is a time to be staring at Twitter staring at charts like literally just looking at what levels are being broken and you just boom you're just in bu breakouts bu breakouts and buy new memes um I think that's you have some some dry powder loaded up in your Phantom wallet uh you've got you've got some tokens on Exchange you're not just like sitting on all of it on in a cold wallet with no dry powder ready to ready to trade you can probably feel okay about mild leverage if you're trading if you're buying Bitcoin I don't know about any of these other tokens though I certainly wouldn't mess with alts with leverage that's that seems crazy also the funding rates are kind of out of control again I mean alt alt themselves are just leverage right like that that that is leverage um so I mean this is this is this is a great time to just fire up you know go go go to coin gecko go asset by asset check chart by chart look look for breakouts look for narratives and then just bet and once once it hits once you get that 30 40% then you can rotate into something into something else you know take take that profit uh put it not fat though not stable coins not not not Fiat you know roll it back into BTC I mean this is a great this is a great TR environment um is that why you have the um is that why you look like you're in prison is this like a locked in Avi to monk mode you're gonna Jonah what are you gonna do oh look at that look at that hair Jonah look at your hair you wake up it's like oh oh I have to brush it oh I have to wash it oh like no just cut it all off stop focusing on your hair you don't need hair in this new world in this new paradigm it's unnecessary to have hair you know it's funny um ever since my hair transplant I've been so thankful for hair it's just I've got tons of it now before I didn't have enough and now now that I've got it I want to flaunt it and yeah you I got to wash it I don't know how much showering you're doing lately it sounds like not very much but um you know I guess that you know everybody everybody's got their own style TR better with more hair maybe you trade better with less hair you know I think I think it's just about minimizing distractions yep fair enough right you like oh man my hair is like in my face today like oh I got to go oh oh I'm going I'm going to dinner I I got to look good you don't make my hair look good for dinner shut up shave it off shave it off like what are you doing sit in your basement and trade crypto excommunicate friends relatives this is it's about it's about the coins right now I mean this is this is purely about the coins when do we sell anything else I don't know do with Doge doge is radioactive it's too it's just ripped too much to buy and if you're holding it you don't know whether you're in the third inning or the eighth inning of some kind of insane rally yeah I mean I'm I'm still a doge bull personally I think that I just think that memes have have a have a way to go I also think white Doge I don't think you understand like doge is about to enter into a 4year or 2year until I think Trump said that there's a 2-year period that he's giving Elon and Vive 2026 do July 4th 2026 we're entering a two-year period where there's just going to be a ton of media attention on Doge constantly and if you think that Elon Musk is going to literally set up a government agency called Doge and then never do anything for the next two years to talk about pumping the price of do is your delusional about it every day I agree with this do meme culture is is mainstream now do and doge is the meme it is I feel so stupid talking about this because my trafi background tells me that this is like not valid analysis or not a valid way to think about it but honestly all of that like this is we we have entered a world where the world's most important person and the president of the United States are going to be talking about Doge all the time there like it's hard to put a value on that the only thing that I would say is like for people just who who are on the sidelines with respect to Doge and I would I would largely consider myself to be one of those people I don't know if you rip a sizable amount of Fiat into Doge at current prices I think that a rally this parabolic should come with some volatility I think you should probably like we will probably have a chance to to buy lower Doge I think you did it's it's up 10% today I mean you know I I don't necessarily believe right now I'm in the I'm in the mindset of until I see a crazy blowoff there's no reason to just not there's no reason to not beong things and what that means is that there's going to be Tailwinds to Doge right because yeah as long as big as long as BTC remains above 90k there's ample cash in the system to pump the market if we trade below trade below 85 then you probably see a huge unwind but no I I think I think right now I mean this is just this is just like we've been talking about reasonably bullish we'll look we'll watch for the blowoff and then you know sort of bet on what happens there I mean my view is that this Market what will probably happen is you get some sort of blowoff on BTC then you range on BTC for a while that's distribution that's you know that that's you know the last ditch people will come in start buying you'll get and then you'll get the people selling into it and so what this probably looks like is it looks similar to a 2021 where it's not necessarily an instatop it's a blowoff come down go back up to the highs trade a little bit and then come come back down and let's talk about 21 like that's that's what I'm talking about I mean I'm not necessarily worried about it but it's hard to ignore that the last white hot PCO bull market in the middle of it BTC had I guess may it may it hit 69 or 70 69k Bitcoin and then it traded down to what 40 45 I don't know yeah it traed down it traded down to 30 and that in large part was due to Tesla selling Chinese the the China Market Banning Miners and all that stuff and all that all that but I mean the issue is that right now the only major head you know headwind to risk is firmly geopolitical and basically just Russia and it's R it's Russia's fight with Ukraine you know spooked the markets a little bit overnight we're in future sold off but then then we then we recovered there aren't that many I mean you know what I what I would say right now is you know think think of the thing of the thing of the market is like this herbivore in the savannah all the all the Predators are asleep right and and the only one with it you know one eye open is is Russia and I don't necessarily believe that there's going to be a bad outcome in that War I mean we basically have two months three months until Trump comes in and I think he does a good job shutting it down the Predator that we had before the talk of recession quote unquote you know all the economists we're calling for calling for a recession the economy is strong and what's going to happen in this Administration is it's going to continuously make the economy Stronger by cutting regulations by increasing investment uh the and by Dollar Dev and by Dollar debasement the only thing in my you know opinion that could lead to potentially some drawback in the market is that if Elon and vivac and Trump are overly aggressive about cutting government spending then you get you know then then then you're actually pulling money out of the system yeah a bunch of unemployment in the DC area that like the government employs a lot of people if they go crazy it' be bad I mean honestly though like the Tesla selling Bitcoin in 2021 and the China Banning mining thing like that wasn't in anybody's bingo card so yes they're you know they're predators that we know about and they all seem like they're sleeping nothing seems too risky I'm not worried about Russia either by the way I think I I don't think they're going to start World War III uh during Biden's lame duck period um ultimately I'm more worried about just random Stu like when when you're thinking about like pumping more Fiat into crypto into tokens that are up four five 700% like you have to worry about the Predators that you've never thought about or heard of before like that animal on your shirt right that thing could maybe bite your balls off um you know so basically my point here is look I'm I'm as bullish as you are I'm so I'm so freaking bullish I'm just trying to brainstorm here on the podcast you know for for everybody out there trying to brainstorm like like trying to brainstorm ideas for why we might not be in the second or third inning of this current Bull Run and why we might be in you know more of like a May 2021 or April 2021 where there's about to be a huge pullback and you'd be pretty annoyed if you didn't buy there you know on the pullback as opposed to on the highs I I I can't really think of anything um I I don't nothing identifiable is going to Nuke this Market uh it's if it were to be something it would be absolutely out of left field but that's already happened so you know one of the guys in the chat just put up uh or or ladies we don't know um put up a very good question do you guys expect up only for the next year like 2017 or more like 21 with big correction that's the big that is the question right we don't know and so I think um you know yeah we're at the phase where pretty much everybody and and their mother is calling me and you asking like Hey how do I get into crypto or hey you know my coinbase account that's been dormant for four years I'm like trying to wire money in and it's getting bounced like what other exchanges should I use like you're getting those kinds of questions right now so I think that's sort of like a third or a second inning type question I I do think that people are in the in the process of investing I think that that's like both at the retail level and at the institutional level so I think this thing is going to run for another like year or two I just uh I've seen too many bull markets get volatile to the upside everything from like NASDAQ 1999 to like crude oil 2022 to you know just like name your bull market in anything like it it's never a straight line so I I guess the way I'm looking at something like Doge where I feel personally kind of stupid for not being involved even though I could have seen it coming a mile away and I was in active trading mode um I'm just wondering like do I put in the whole do I blow my whole wad now or do I wait like maybe maybe put in 25% here you know and then wait a little bit yeah I mean look it's it's it's all about it's all about your con your conviction level here right you have to assign some level of probability to your success and in you know and and the two questions are in six okay in 6 months where do you think do is going to be and in that in that time frame you know will you get a large enough pullback that'll make you you know that that you'll that you'll come in and you'll buy right Y and the way that I tend to think about these things is how do you feel when that price comes back down to your price point if you get a massive correction in Doge at this point is that even a buy right like are you going to are you going to feel like that's a Buy in that scenario or are you going to say okay doge is just down 50% that was a blowoff top I'm not buying this thing right and so there there's there's this weird dynamic that goes through a lot of Traders heads where they go well I'm going to wait for the pullback I'm going to wait for the right way to go buy this to to to go to go buy this uh asset and then when the asset actually comes down to that price okay never mind I don't want it anymore and I think that's what happens with those so you know at most you're going to get these 10 20% dips but I think it's pre pre-ordained to a dollar yeah I think it's I think it's going to a buck too I'm just wondering like do I buy it I I probably buy some now but I think at this point like yeah you you bring up a really good point I think it's going to a buck too so it may as well just get long and OB viously I'm talking about money that I promised myself I wouldn't put into crypto but I'm probably going to do it anyway because I'm so fraking bullish my convictions the other thing is like do look I love I like Doge because you can put a lot of size into it the thing that I'll say that probably actually has a higher hit rate in terms of alpha is we are now in the world where exchanges can basically list anything at any moment and they're not going to be afraid of the SEC so what I would do do if I were an active Trader is build a basket and I would look at all of the highest volume coins on chain the things that trade the most that aren't listed on exchanges and then create a basket of those assets and then watch as those assets 2x 3x into coinbase listings into binance listings into blah blah blah whatnot right peut got time like it took whiff forever I guess we're in exchanges are in Balden now Point yeah I I think I think basically anything to do I mean we've talked about this but anything to do with regulation is just such a good trade um we called xrp on the show yeah that was a good trade yeah we I mean we called a lot of it the one the one area that's been really disappointing has been Defi and I think that's just a hold over of eth yeah I mean it's I think what's weird about defi is that def during defi summer um defi was the meme it was like okay this is the narrative that gets people excited about crypto in the future now the meme is Peanut the squirrel it's uh some AI crap uh you know I'm I'm starting to lose track of all these AI coins but that's taken the wind out of the sales of even some of the legit systems like bit tensor so memes are sort of sucking up all the energy and creating value to salana dii you know I think it's it's a slower burn it will go up but it's not going to get you rich in the short term so yeah I mean to me I think doge is the meme the rest of the memes on salana are also interesting memes that's kind of where I'm going to be focusing my active trading for the next you know month or so I I I don't yeah and some of the regulatory trades I like your I like your idea of buying coins that are about to get listed and also in pretty easy thought real quick like I'd feel happy buying Bitcoin on a pull pullback up until this point I would never have felt comfortable buying a meme coin on a pullback because memes are just momentum trades and they're backed by nothing and they have no fundamentals but now Doge oddly enough I think it's crossed the chasm and you can feel comfortable buying it on a dip maybe for the first time sorry what were we gonna say um yeah I mean it it depends on I think I think again it depends on like how large of a dip because big dips really scare people small dips encourage people to get in um right like if I close if you close your eyes and you wake up in 3 weeks and do is down 70 60% are you buying it there 50% are you buying it back there I I don't know probably buy the next big green uh like weekly candle though from that down 60% but I mean it's just it's you know we are in a very good time to make a lot of money and this extends to equities equities as well I mean I think we're in for a pretty a pretty good four years now I do think that we're going to get an opportunity to buy a lot of things a lot cheaper post Trump inauguration because generally that's what tends to happen is you get excitement baked in early and then reality hits later and then then you actually get to experience the benefits of reality right so it overprices then dumps and underprices and then comes back to it comes back to a good price but I mean the these these next these next four years are going to be good I think you know the way that I I think it's very important to approach this Market with a level ahead and to have a plan and to be tracking I think this is one of the environments that really stand out to me is the easiest to get distracted by the new shiny object and have that ruin your ability to actually make money and get spre to get spread tooo thin I was talking on an earlier podcast about how you should have a list of every coin every asset that you're in and a plan entry exit all of that and that it's actually very easy to lose track of things especially if you have like 10 15 wallets and I think back then people were like what do you mean is how is it easy to lose track of things and we talk about a new coin every day now and that's how you lose track of things and so if you don't if you aren't maintaining a spreadsheet or at least have some ability to track where you're putting your money and you're not and you're not doing it diligently like you can really yourself and that you you really you really have to you really got to avoid that uh so you know just to fire up fire up with Google Sheets and and start tracking things and shave your head yeah no I agree I mean like the I get clowned on on Twitter for all the time for recommending that people consolidate line items they say I sound like a broken record and that you know that's my only advice but you know it's true when you when you have a big messy portfolio you feel smart on the way up and then when things start coming off um you're that's that's where you really get tagged um but I I kind of take your point about how we're going to probably rally really quickly and then it gets volatile after that and it sort of dovetails nicely with what our friend JT wrote in the chat he wrote what do you guys think about the Market impact to ibit starting options trading today both over short and long time frames are you planning to trade them I think this is a great question because it I think that ibit options trading is going to increase that volatility to the upside that you just spoke of AI and you know I don't know if many of our listeners are familiar with the phenomenon of gamma but basically what happens like ibit options trading is huge for crypto because up until now if you want to trade crypto options you have to go on an exchange like derit or you have to be kind of an Institutional player trading options on Futures on the CME neither of those are particularly liquid or interesting for most people and there's not a lot of like institutional size going through those two platforms but like ibit trading on the New York Stock Exchange that's legit like that could attract massive massive amounts of capital and usually the way this works is as follows when you have an exciting new asset that everybody's focused on like in this case I or Bitcoin retail will buy massive amounts of call options in Bull markets because everybody's getting that sort of animal spirit bull of frenzy in their head so they buy call options it's called naked or unhedged they they just buy the option hoping that the market trades through their strike meanwhile the dealers that sell those options the market makers that sell those options to these retail players they're not just going to be naked short a bunch of Bitcoin call options preying to their you know whatever their deity is that that Bitcoin doesn't breach the strike they're going to Delta hedge so they're going to buy some Bitcoin against it and basically these dealers when they short options they're short it's called being short gamma where they have to buy more Delta on the way when Bitcoin goes up and sell more Delta when Bitcoin goes down so they're basically buying high and selling low and in exchange for that they they collect the premium of the option they've sold so basically um I expect I fully expect uh market makers to be massively short Bitcoin gamma to the upside over the coming days and weeks and I also expect Bitcoin to Rally through a lot of these strikes that's going to create some insane insane price volatility uh that sort of dealer negative gamma hedging to the upside and I think it's going to get pretty pretty wild yeah um I I I do think that the look a lot of people buy Bitcoin through brokerages now courtes courtesy of iate we're see we're seeing the infos ourselves this is going to energize the Wall Street bets crowd because you know one of the one of the big dings on bitcoin is that you can't 5x your money on bitcoin anymore like if you're an average person right it's like people don't think about it that way they think it's too big you buy short dated options you get 30X your money um not advocating for that I think basically everyone loses money buying short-dated short-dated stuff but uh you know I it's it's one of those things that's really going to energize the betting crowd and that's how you get things like the gme like the Bed Bath and Beyond of the world you get people buying like crazy options on them it's going to increase volumes it's going to increase spot volumes future volumes everything and what I what I'll say is that it's fuel on the fire and if this had if if this had happened at 50k per Bitcoin I don't think it would have mattered much but the fact that it's happened like specifically because you know or at a time where Bitcoin is going up a lot that's really good that that's when it really adds fuel to the fire which is why I'm still I'm still bullish on BTC I think he'll five I think you could 5x your money on bitcoin I don't think that's unreasonable I mean it won't happen in the next few months or maybe even the next year or two but I I think you know before the end of the decade I like if I were okay but I mean five 5x 5x in your over the course of a decade this Jonah this is about your shortterm gamblers that are going to reallocate that are going to be able to reallocate and help out bitcoin price because they're coming in and they're just spamming spamming options I mean at some point and this is actually a really good thing that you should watch out for whenever you get those gamma squeezes which do happen you have to look at V and if V bikes above a 100 that's almost always an amazing sell like selling BTC V above 100 is like a a minus cell selling it above 130 is like a A+ cell historically and that's I mean if if you a more sophisticated Trader uh you know and and this this doesn't mean outright sell this means like sell like get Negative Vega on your portfolio it doesn't mean in the Shell calls cuz you can it can still go up but fall tends to go down so th right like you just sell straddles th those are genuinely really good like really good trades yeah danger we're all we're talking about like interesting leveraged bets but I think I think what's so exciting about this Obi is the idea that you know let's say that I'm right let's say that Bitcoin is going to FX between now and 2030 or even between now in 2028 when the Trump Administration is wrapping up right that's a nice Baseline for some good volatility trades which are ultimately Le like kind of leveraged ways to express your ideas in crypto and it's so much more fun to trade options in a market that is trending even if it's even if the trend is super volatile it's way more fun to trade options in a market that's trending than to trade options in a market that's just chopping up and down doing little you know little to nothing so I think I think we're going to see like basically this reminds me of how when when Tesla stock got really popular um and people start in the options Market it was like one of the most active stocks stock option markets like I think I think the capital inflows into ibit are going to be insane I have to figure out a way to track it um because it's basically a new form of Leverage and we're going to have to like see see what the strikes are and what what retail is buying I I would be willing to bet that um retail comes out buying size amounts of uh $100,000 calls and that volatility and that spikes volatility and that will also translate into you know Bitcoin volatility Bitcoin option volatility that you see on darab bit because ultimately the two are interrelated markets and you'll have options Market making desks that Arbitrage ibit options versus Bitcoin options it's it's a really exciting development for the space and you know it's not like so I I personally would you know I'm G to I'm going to have to start tracking that like you know options trading is something that I I like to do in oil as well I'm going to start monitoring all of that and finding interesting ways to sell sell calls against my Bitcoin length if it gets too overheated which can happen sometimes um still though like how long before we get Tana options before all this stuff's mainstream we have a guy in the chat asking if you were to deploy 100K at this stage this is like the this is like the kind of calls I'm getting from my friends who have been basically sidelined for three to four years if you were to deploy 100K at this stage how would you allocate uh you know across presumably Bitcoin salana soie Doge goat any others Avi if you were if like what advice would you give to somebody who's just getting into crypto right now well I probably wouldn't buy I probably I probably wouldn't buy any sooie but I would buy I would buy soul Doge go I mean basically the way that I would do it is i' for somebody to just set and forget I'd still all allocate 50% to BTC and then 50 probably 25% to Doge and then the rest of it is just like goat peanut like memes that I think have staying power bnk whiff MOG you didn't mention salana popat are you are you salana yeah I I just don't think that salana needs to be there I mean if salana if salana 2 X's all of these memes are 100 Xing yeah right so I just don't right it just doesn't make sense and if salana goes down 80% the memes go down 85 there's no protection right salana down 50 memes down 70 I don't think Sal is going down 85% I think that if Sal goes down 30% the memes are down 90% actually that's not true if salana goes down some of them some of them some of them outperformed some of some of them actually outperformed when when salana went went down right because they have a much smaller holder base that hilariously is longer term than yeah you're right I think I'm going to rotate I've had a good run on salana recently maybe it's time to start rotating that into Doge and adding to my little meme portfolio which is probably too small almost definitely too small I mean you have to you always have to think of things in terms of risk reward right um you know with salana 500 five 500 you know $500 is pretty massive move that's a 2X from here it could easily go down you know in a world where Salon goes down 50% then let's say memes go down 75 versus Salon is at 500 the memes 5x right there's more you you have to always look for asymmetry like where is the optimal asymmetry in this crypto in in this crypto world but what will allow me to stay alive if we do get those drawbacks right and that's why having a little bit of you know H have having a little bit of BTC is is always is useful because BTC sneezes down 10 15% that's when things in this particular environment tend to collapse and you can take some of your Bitcoin and buy the rest of it if you're still if you're still bullish on the market at that point right so it's about it's it's it's really it's really about that and then it's about once once you do that are you able to capture those 30 40 50% bounces right and that and then you rotate that back into BTC and then you do that a few times and you radically outperform um meme trading requires to to the point you just made it requires such an insane level of attention and focus like it it's pretty much a full-time job like you have to be you have to be locked in you can't just be sitting on your memes set it and forget it and hope for the best um so that's kind of like because I I just my happy zone is slightly less active trading that's why I tend to be in more of the the Pix and shovels plays like BTC and salana rather than like actively flip my way around the meme space which is just this the most awesome Casino SL Minefield of all time um yeah I think I think it's I think it's time to be locked in though like you said I should probably just shave my head and I mean like the thing is myself to this like why not BR it's just completely it's just completely and utterly nuts because like every every second there's a new meme coin of the week meme coin of like okay uh Bongo is the most recent one people are talking about Bongo is the you know successor to I don't know any of this thing but you know B Bongo is a successor to pop cat same origin story as as popat uh and you know is exactly podcasting about this dude dude it seems it seems like a lot of the big guys are are in this thing I still haven't bought if if you guys buy that that's on you um but it's it's crazy right and it's up 35% I think it's a a 100 Mil market cap people are saying all right run it run it run it to 500 mil now maybe it does I got pinged about something called and these are all from like like pretty reasonable and respectable people right the these are not like nonsense humans um somebody messaged me I mean this is like a text that I got today Zing the one-armed monkey probably a buy what yeah a lot of the respectable chats that I'm in are all over these memes and some of them you know some of the telegram rooms that I've been have called some of these memes pretty early but I have not I have not again I have not bought any of this um yeah I mean I I've got only one that I really took a swing at was peanut and obviously I didn't do enough of it I like the political memes but never gotten the dog memes but I'm ready for Doge because it's become a political and it's cross that Chasm the thing is though like I just I'm too I'm too old and I'm too trafi educated to to really get behind a lot of this crap and I can't tell whether the fact that like hasn't the drum beat of this just gone crazy like when when did Pepe launch it was like it was last year wasn't it and then there was like six months of nothing and then a couple of like like the the whiffs and the Bowens and the salana meme coin show started and then you know that then it was kind of Silent for a while while and now it feels like the drum beat has just exp you know exponentially accelerated and I don't know whether this is something to like really lean into or whether it's like you know frankly a little bit too much and maybe a sign to like take take it easy for a while and just stick stick with Doge and peanut and a couple of the other main ones I like I'm mean I'm in unfamiliar territory that's not to say I'm I'm unexposed I'm freaking exposed and I don't know how to feel about it I'm just kind of like having this debate with you out loud because I've never been through one of these one of these Cycles where a lot of the stuff that's in my portfolio I don't have a ton of conviction in other than that I I feel it's just a right place right time kind of trade I don't know how long the time is going to last I guess just play just sit sit on it till the Music Stops and then be be disciplined about getting out when it starts to go down what what is your tell me what does your daily routine look like when it comes to assessing crypto like how how how do you look at this like where do you get your information from how do you track your portfolio maybe that'll be helpful for these people yeah sure I mean the way that I like I I I watch crypto prices and monitor crypto news and all market news all day every single day um a little bit less on weekends but basically the way that I track my crypto prices and portfolio I just have it all pulled into a Google spreadsheet so that I can see my Dynamic portfolio allocation p&l um you know I basically have it sliced I I published a tweet Thread about this and just sort of like how you're supposed to allocate globally uh you know however much money you have how you're supposed to allocate between asset classes how you're supposed to allocate within asset classes within crypto I break down my my risk into basically like Bitcoin other majors alts and memes and those are my four categories and I I sort of have portfolio targets and then I watch I I have like a thing on the side that tells me what trades to do as as my portfolio evolves and I end up sort of like drifting away from my targets um in terms of memes uh I'm overallocated versus my sort of like the the Target that I set for myself before this insane meme runup um and the way that I digest news and learn about new memes learn about new crypto uh sort of applications and tokens and launches I learn a lot from this podcast just talking to you I learn a lot from our Niger Delta Avengers telegram room I learn a lot you know people post interesting ideas in there it's not really like shills it's more just uh what people talking about what they're looking at um I have a bunch of other telegram rooms with you know people that I've met in the industry uh who are putting interesting stuff out there you know obviously one-on-one conversations with people um I'm not I'm not ADHD enough or focused enough to be in Discord and you may be um I know our friend Chief spends a lot of time on on Discord that's that's real Alpha in there that's like basically the where the nutrients in the soil enter the roots of the tree is Discord and then like I'm kind of like somewhere in the middle of the trunk um where I get my info uh basically that's kind of my process along with just dialogues with people in the market of which this particular podcast is my favorite dialogue and I I'm I'm super disciplined about reallocating within my portfolio when I get way away from my target um but now you know as you can tell like from just this conversation I've got a little bit of hesitation about whether I should be dialing up memes and in particular and you know these are the types of conversations that people probably have all the time in their minds but you know maybe it's helpful to have this one out loud uh because you know no I'm not Max confident all the time in what I'm doing even when even when things are ostensibly going well and I'm making a bunch of money on crypto yeah that's uh I mean look for for somebody that's part-time the reason I asked you is because you're also part-time right yeah like relative I mean I I do that I do this as my day job yeah I think most people don't do it as don't do it as their day job so I think balancing that is is really is really important and so I just wanted just wanted to hear that out um somebody said where should people go to get the best info well I think you you have to curate your Twitter lists really effectively um I really like the block Works daily newsletter I think that's great I actually think that news like newsletters are actually like pretty solid uh for getting for getting information especially for the more casual for the more casual person that just can't spend all of their time on X and what I then what I like to do is I just like to look at deck screener and look at the top movers under under certain market cap levels and then just look them up see see what see what people see what people are saying about them and then see if I can find find anything interesting um I have noticed like this uh you know this particular environment things react to news and narratives really really really well and so if you can find that news or narrative and then bet on it and then just wait until it until it percolates that has tended to be really good I mean the xrp trade great example of this yeah I agree um that was a good call I'm I'm proud of that one that was yet another call on the thousand X podcast that turned out to be preent um I think I think at this phase like you know obviously I'm I'm a part-time crypto to Trader I'm not full-time like you um but I I am a full-time markets guy so you know crypto is just part of my daily markets digest if I were like let's say I were like a software developer or working some job that required like a lot of focus and time that you can't look at markets in the middle of the day which isn't something I'm familiar with I would say probably the best way to do it like you don't need to trade all the time to make money and the active trading that we're talking about even you Obi you're not like just clicking maniacally all day every day like you take breaks too I think the best way to do it is just to main maintain some discipline around your portfolio allocation and then pick a rebalancing Cadence it can be like whenever you get X percent away from your targets you just trade and you look at it once a day um you know I think that's probably enough you don't need to be like all over it over trading over trading is still a risk you you pay a lot of bit offer to trade some of these crazy memes on Jupiter or whatever it's not it's not free to trade can't just do it all the time yeah I think that's fair uh well let's see let's see what happens Jonah um I think next next pod we'll do again on Tuesday and let's uh let's come let's come with some ideas for the for the guys out there we're going to come with some trade ideas maybe I'll come back to Twitter and start tweeting more yeah that' be nice everyone wants you back on Twitter I'm going to go buy some buy some more Doge that'd be a good idea don't have enough of that well sounds good to me all right none of this is investment advice always pleasure talking to you for everybody listening uh we're just a couple of guys talking about coins named after dogs and squirrels please don't take this as investment advice please um till next time all right

and we're live and we're live welcome back to another thousand X live stream where Jonah do you have your wine I I decided to skip the wine this time I got a bottle of uh of water cold water refrigerated water I mean I literally I literally got a bottle of wine just because you did last time oh I mean I I'll go get one this is awesome and you're telling and you're telling me that now I have to be the sober one or I have to be the drunk one you get to be the sober one you're shitfaced already dude this is I haven't even I haven't I haven't had a single sip I'm shitfaced off of price action I'm shitfaced off of Doge 2 Xing in two weeks I'm [ __ ] faced off of xrp going up 14% uh and I'm so shitfaced off of all this euphoria that I'm starting to get a little bit nervous about price action I think we're GNA trade 90k on air like live this is this is crazy Obby this is it feels like vindication after a very long period of uh waiting for this I mean why are you worried I I'm I'm feeling more euphoric than ever I'm not going to sell at pennies worth of crypto until after inauguration day I'm nervous because we've come very far very fast very far very fast who's gonna sell into this though what what I'm thinking I mean basically what happens at any at any moment that Bitcoin goes up so far so fast is you have people three months ago who bought Bitcoin at 50k and they're looking at at 2x in three months and I think historically how this is generally played out I mean just go to the chart and I've said I've said this before and I'll say it again go to the chart and look at once Bitcoin starts a rally how long does this L rally last and how much higher does it go up and the answer is normally like 3 to four weeks and then there's at least there's at least a pause with some with some pullbacks I mean you can make an argument that the 23 rally started in October and then it lasts to November and then you get a period of consolidation and then you get a rally from the end of January to the beginning of March so I guess you know one month maybe five weeks and then it's down from there right so the way that I'm thinking about this is you know I think people are getting really really really excited but Bitcoin is a pretty [ __ ] massive asset Jonah like it it's huge and so that time period I think shortens a bit and so while I think we could see 100K you know in the next month if we do see 100K I'm probably thinking okay maybe it's time to start selling and really what's the difference between 100K and 90k and I think a lot of people are starting to think like that so my best guess as to what happens is what we get is we get a selloff before we hit 100K and then 100K doesn't act as resistance now I mean you you you obviously have a different time Horizon than I do if you were to guess like where like where do you start selling like as a as a long-term investor where do you say okay this is nuts let me sell even if it's just to buy other assets so great question I'm I'm actually getting a little bit more short term for the first time in a while because I I want to add more Fiat into crypto because I think that this I want to momentum trade this I think this rally has legs and so if we do get one of those sort of pullbacks that you just described I'm going to be waiting to buy that dip if it happens um and I think a lot of people are frankly so to to your point about where do you sell um like in terms of where I would call the cycle top and start to really sell significant amounts of my portfolio I'm waiting for you know I put this on Twitter mvrv to hit six I think that's a a good way to say hey how how in the money is the space how how in the money are Bitcoin holders on their positions if they're like way in the money you're going to see profit taking and we're probably near the top right now mvrv is like two and a half and like cycle bottoms are marked by like one or less 1.0 or less so I'm not really G to be selling until like it's less of a price Target okay like obviously if we hit 200k or 250k in some insane parabolic bull rally I'll sell sell a bunch but like if it even before that like it's less about the price level and more about what's going on in the news like let's say that we're steadily rallying past I'm just hypothetical scenario we're steadily rallying past 130k it's choppy and it's volatile and it's like April of next year and all these Pro crypto candidates that just got elected to congress are starting to like sit down and draft legislation about a strategic Bitcoin res ve and it's like looking like it might get passed um you know I I don't think I would sell into that meanwhile if if we're just like gassing past 160k on pure froth in December like maybe maybe like you try to lighten up and Reby on a dip you know what do you does that kind of answer your question what do you what do you think yeah I mean I I personally think that that I mean it makes makes sense just given the way that you tend to allocate your portfolio and and you tend to trade obviously you have to react to What act is happening Trump actually gets inaugurated because [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] okay let's see if this is any better okay I can see you again okay I think I think we're good but basically what I was what I was trying to trying to articulate is that heading into the inauguration we're going to need to see some actual movement from Trump about crypto and we're going to need to see some movement from the broader you know political sphere of crypto because I mean think about like think about what this actual rally is this rally is two things one General market going up because people are enthusiastic about Trump and his cutting of regulations and his ability to juice the economy and his very likely to inject a ton of money into the system and cause inflation and two because Trump is very bullish on crypto or at least on the campaign Trail he was very bullish on crypto if time goes by and he doesn't actually fulfill any of those promises then this rally stopped short of what it could be right basically he needs to actually say something about crypto or politicians need to actually do something about crypto or a bill needs to get genuinely you know in introduced and and taken seriously I think for Bitcoin to hit 200k I think the stock market the stock market just ripping probably can take us to like 120 but in order for Bitcoin to like break the Stratosphere in order for it to actually reach the next level of geopolitical it it needs to be taken seriously on a geopolitical level and we don't know we don't have any strict evidence that that's going to happen yet just yet yeah I mean so Trump doesn't need to do anything before he gets inaugurated so between now and J 20 I think I think it's just there's a lot of uh well there's no friction really like he he can't Implement policy he's already talked his book He's said what he's going to do the action doesn't really start until next spring at the earliest yeah I but but I think I think what happens is you you always get two phases of this and if you're trading you have to understand that and not get shaken out the first phase is the excitement and the second phase is the reality and because there's there there's almost always a gap in crypto because what happens is that the excitement far outpaces what the reality is currently and then you get a nasty Snapback right like a a move to 100K and then a rejection and let's say we trade back down to 80 a 20% move lower let's say we trade back down to 70 let's say we trade back down to the breakout how do you react in that situation right like how does like how does the world react in that situation how do the owners of BTC react in the situation I'll tell you how you probably should react which is to buy buy yeah but if you're fully allocated there if you're fully allocated at 100 and then that's when reality sets in and Trump hasn't done anything and we trade back down to 7 580 then you can't buy you're fully allocated but that's probably going to be a pretty pH like alt are probably going to be down 70% and then that's when you get your next 5x right and so it's like let's figure out what the what the right way to allocate your portfolio is here so that in this particular environment where you know that there're going to be draw like significant draw Downs that you can step in and buy because basically this this rally isn't over unless th this rally ends with something like a ruling out of the Strategic Reserve that's when this rally ends yeah uh it ends it ends with that hope uh not materializing it ends if the new SCC goes after a crypto project right oh I mean then then we're then we're in these are the types of things that that like really really end the rally um I mean the way the way that I'm kind of looking at it is like you know just zooming way out if we get a strategic Bitcoin reserve price Target is 500,000 to a million dollars a token because then a bunch of other countries will follow the US is talking about buying a million units of BTC that's that's insane that's an insane amount of Bitcoin to buy and if why would you establish a strategic Bitcoin Reserve you would do so to because just for the same reason you would stash gold just to hold an alternative Reserve currency in case you know uh [ __ ] hits the fan right and so if the United States does it then you can bet your boots that every other country will too and like then then like it will be the mother of all parabolic rallies legitimizing the space let's say that a strategic Bitcoin Reserve isn't in the cards but this is like almost as good a scenario so strategic Bitcoin Reserve isn't it's not like imminent you know it seems like it's being discussed but it probably won't pass or get enacted anytime soon it's kind of in limbo but you know Gensler gets fired on day one Ross ALB gets released from prison on day one the crypto like the noises in Congress and in the White House are all friendly to crypto and it seems like that gives confidence to investors to buy I think you could still easily trigger $250,000 a token in Bitcoin why because like your Morgan Stanley wealth management uh your JP Morgan wealth managements of the world right they control you know trillions upon trillions of dollars worth of assets if suddenly like the regulatory landscape shifts and crypto gets a framework or it's about to get a framework you know and all these lawsuits are getting dropped left and right and crypto suddenly like legal um those Ras are going to basically tell their their High net worth clients like it's okay for you to allocate one to two% to Bitcoin now and from what I hear like I have my ear to the ground on this stuff I talked to some major asset managers in the crypto space apparently those phone calls have already begun right so that is a tsunami of buying even if you don't have the Sovereign buying you can still have that and then worst case scenario is like uh you know Trump doesn't say anything about Bitcoin gets into office Ross alri is still sitting in prison and he's just kind of like gotcha you know put another like crypto hater in the SEC and then I think we go straight back down to 60k so it's like the risk reward is so skewed to the upside right now I still I I think this is like the Bitcoin ETF when it came out we were we were debating this on the show we were like is it priced in or not can is there enough Capital to front run this I think this is another ETF like event where there just literally isn't enough crypto native capital in the world right now to front run that tsunami of flow yeah look just to just to frame this discussion I don't think anyone since basically the emergency episode of trump getting LED and even before before that Joan and I have been pretty damn bullish yeah uh originally I wanted to fade Trump decided last podcast that didn't really make a t didn't really make a ton of sense voice that to you guys and what we're doing right now is we're talking about hey what are the warning signs like when when when do you figure out when to sell because the the worst thing that you can do as an investor in this type of Market is lose sight of that because that's how you end up writing things down uh I think I think it's fine to say hey look there are zero warning signs right now let's just ride this casino up up to up to the moon but at the back of your head you should always have a list of metrics and list of things that you're looking at it's like okay well why did I like why is it going up like what what what are the what are the indications you know indicators that I can look at that say what made it go up is no longer true therefore maybe I should start taking some profit off the table because you're an investor you're a Trader at some point you have to sell this isn't a up only market for the rest of your life this is an up only market for now uh so I think I think you know it's it's important it's important to talk about these things and you know list out well okay when do you w to like what what are you looking for like that's why I love podcasting with you because we're talking through this in real time like I haven't thought other than mvrv 6 or above which is like and the great thing about that metric is that the RV stands for realized value right so if sovereigns start lifting hundreds of thousands of units of Bitcoin at current prices that RV will go up right like the the transaction price the average transaction price of Bitcoin as a whole ecosystem will go up as sovereigns like get their prints at these new super high levels but even if they don't um you know mvrv is still a good way to get out like it's a dynamic indicator that will adjust the price your exit price higher if there's like sizable buying and if there isn't your exit price will be lower so it's like really really good in that way but like mvrv aside that's like a cycle top indicator I think what you're referring to Avi is like how do you how do you you know I think most of us who listen to this podcast are basically Allin and I keep telling myself I'm Allin but I keep putting more in because I'm not disciplined enough as and not as disciplined as I should be I think what you're referring to Obby is like where do you peel off like 10 to 20% of your length with a view to like you know have some dry powder so that you can reload on a dip how do you trade this oscillation I mean and you know it's a like as as a short-term Trader one of a one one of the you know if if you're going to try to catch these things one one of the better ways to do it is okay let's say Bitcoin sideways are down over three days four days and then altcoins have started really rallying and so this is you know we've talked about alt season and I've talked about how alt season tends to last last two to three weeks but I've never actually like explained what I mean by an ALT season and what I mean by an ALT season is not alts go up what I mean is alts go up and Bitcoin doesn't do anything it's like alts have like euphoric Mania and Bitcoin is doing nothing and that's that's all season that that's what lasts like two to three weeks and that is sort of the warning sign in my opinion to start getting out because it's people divesting from Bitcoin buying [ __ ] that's going down the risk curve and yes this stuff will like 5X but you know it's it's it's a matter of uh it's a m it's a matter of looking and making sure that okay well once that starts happening Clip Clips and profits right Bitcoin yeah that hasn't happened yet Bitcoin dominance like mean by by all metrics like [ __ ] looks good we keep we keep dipping people keep coming in people keep buying people keep slurping dips um you know Ma Majors majors are trading or are trading well I think you know the the on on this latest move the lack of movement from eth and salana are indicative that people are just still plowing money into BTC right like that's like the the core driver of this Market is still just everyone wants a piece of this thing yeah people are foming in like it half of it's probably ibit those inflows are massive Obi are you getting the phone calls are you getting like uh norie friends calling you like hey man it's looking should I buy like because I'm definitely getting that again like the real Skeptics um the people who you know you know what's what's funny is I'm getting a lot of hey must be a good week for you must be a great day for you uh how's that Bitcoin thing doing um people haven't asked me what to buy yet and I don't know why you know I think a little bit of it is that uh you know a lot of these PE I mean a lot of people in my circles like I've been talking about Bitcoin since 2017 to them uh and you know they they they've just been out of it and they just haven't they just haven't been in it so maybe a little bit of it is just embarrassment um but I yeah like I I haven't had okay what what what should I buy what should I buy which I did get a lot in 2021 like I got a lot a lot of that in 2021 uh you know what what what meme coin should I buy that's gonna 100x what and and that seems to be less this year uh than and that that's a really that to me that's a really good sign yeah what it what what it means is that they're still they're still there right they're they're they're going to come in but they're a little they're a little scared right now they're a little hesitant they're like a [ __ ] I remember what happened in 21 uh you know maybe maybe that same thing's GNA happen again this year so you know I I I'll I'll look out for that you know maybe I'll just live stream my IM messages you kind of do when it's from your mom I mean I I talk to a different crew than you do I guess like the the the people you talk to are probably in their late 20s right and they probably don't want to take they're probably Building Wealth at this point and they probably don't want to take a bunch of it and gamble it on stuff that has no product Market fit yet even if it's about to be legal it's like the 2022 hangover is just too extreme for me like I'm pushing 40 right I'm still on the right side of it but not not far away and my community is kind of like mid-career people uh some of whom have done like extraordinarily well in trading and they have a lot of savings but they're not like they're not allocated to bitcoin and they you know there's nothing in Commodities right now that's just going to go bananas or even the stock market they're probably overallocated so they're like hey is is is it too late to buy Bitcoin like that's kind of is it I I've only got a couple hundred grand worth and it's not moving the needle for me and should I like really really lay into this thing or or have I missed the rally like one guy asked me like is this like buying oil at $120 a barrel and you know for those of you who aren't paying attention like the the recent top was about 138 140 a barrel so I I think you know given my view that like even without a strategic Bitcoin reserve the cycle top is going to be about 250k I can't think of a better investment personally um not Financial advice of course so like my my I I tell people my my price Target I tell them that I'm crazy uh and not to listen to me but I do think that I I just I just don't see how I I think what what the market is finally starting to realize and by the market I don't mean you and me OB I mean like the like like people with money are starting to realize is just how bad this this Biden Administration has been for Global crypto prices and just just getting rid of it for any like even even if Trump weren't bullish at all even if he were neutral that alone is probably worth six Bitcoin prices you're on mute this B this Biden admin wasn't just bad for crypto it's just bad bad for markets I think in general like I think we you know the reintroduction of a lot of uh regulation just not good for markets not good for markets General relative to what a trump admin would have been or a republican Administration would have been and we're we're getting this at a really good time and what do I mean by that this is like a perfectly timed injection of Hope into investors all around the world where you're not staring down the face of a recession you're looking at strong growth the market seems pretty stable and the economy seems reasonably strong and this is all coming off of coming off of covid right coming off of the FED uh cutting uh cutting cutting rates managing that at Landing effectively and at this moment in time when everything looks okay you get a turbo boost right from a from a trump uh oh you know com coming in and actually and actually getting elected and that that to me is really beautiful because it actually came at at just such a good time even from a cycle standpoint it's also really funny to me how it's like clockwork November October November December of every having year is just so bullish the having we forgot about this yeah like clockwork it's just like it's Clockwork every time and this this is I think why people get you know superstitious about BTC like people will say things like it's pre-ordained it's the it's the product of a simulation it's alien technology that been that has been delivered to us that is you know 100% going to go to $1 million Bitcoin it was created by God I mean people like say all this crazy stuff what they do who are you talking to you've never been down the crazy I you have to understand I started off in the crazy circles right like back back in like back in 2017 like the 2013 OG people were a lot more prevalent than they are than they were today and a lot of these people just had this unbelievable conviction in BTC like Bitcoin will work and Bitcoin will work because the world is designed for Bitcoin to work and that things will happen that will seem serendipitous but are actually just predetermined and it's stuff like this that makes me question myself it's like I mean like everything everything that's happened like all of these crazy events that have happened are are really good for Bitcoin you know it's funny like the the whole digitization of the world you're absolutely right about it but like it's like perfectly designed to make Bitcoin go up like Co was perfectly designed to make Bitcoin go up it it's insane isn't it I mean like I I was involved in Bitcoin back in 2011 12 13 I wasn't like I held I held a bunch of coins and then I sold them all in disgust uh at $300 a token I think that was 2013 or maybe 14 I forget which um but back then the people I knew who were buying it there were some who are like maniacally accumulating it like going on Craigslist scanning QR codes like doing all that sort of stuff to buy Bitcoin but most of the people I knew who were doing it were were just like using it to buy mushrooms on Silk Road and then just like eating them and wandering around the cat skills in Upstate New York like it wasn't it wasn't like this you know Bitcoin came from God and it's pre-ordained to go up kind of community so maybe you you hung out with a different slice of the bit the Bitcoin pie but for me like I think what's so interesting about bitcoin's narrative right now is it seems inevitable given that how the US is withdrawing from the world that the that Bitcoin is going to become a global Reserve currency like ju since our last podcast tether put out a blog post saying that a an oil super major bought a cargo of crude oil from a major oil crude oil trading house denominated in tether and whole transaction was financed by tether and it probably settled like two weeks faster than it would have otherwise and this is that's that sort of transaction is only the beginning of this like yeah a lot of it will be stable coin flow and some of that value will acre to eth or you know Tron or whatever Network it's occurring on but like a lot of it's going to happen in Bitcoin too especially with uh with the sanctioned complex world that we live in uh and how banking lines are getting kind of ripped up and reorganized I I really I think I think it does seem to use your word word Avi ordained that Bitcoin was going on this trajectory in the wake of the financial crisis but to be a little bit Fair there's like a little there's reflexivity to it as well like as Bitcoin goes up crypto people get richer Rich crypto people invest their money to try and make crypto more uh pervasive in society right so people like you and me are sitting here like pumping our bags uh metaphorically of course and so so are others on a much bigger scale yeah I you know Ju Just to be clear I don't actually believe that Bitcoin was created by aliens but I do I do think that you know it it was created by somebody that saw where the world was heading and that made an asset that fits into that future very very neatly and that's a beautiful thing and I also have noticed that normally when you talk about how beautiful and amazing bit point is you're close to the top but maybe maybe not this time I you know I I do I do think I I do think that right now if you pay attention to the markets there actually is still a non-tribal amount of dispersion here there are certain things that are doing extremely well and there are certain things that aren't doing particularly well so you know for example your hated sector of deepin is not doing well right like de dein's not doing well me memes are what are doing well Doge doge is too Xing did you see the goat even yeah like even even l1's right l1s are doing okay right salana is doing okay I mean salana is not up that much more than BTC right I mean it's it's like okay well you would expect from you know you know uh like these these leaders that people would be allocating to them and and they're not what are what are doing well are the new coins you know like say suie or sorry suie is doing is doing doing really well um and what's also doing well are for some odd reason uh some some of the old some of the older coins like cardono is doing extremely well well we know why that's happening um it's because the Trump Administration appears to be Consulting with Charles hoskinson crypto policy which is just one of those inexplicable decisions I hope somebody corrects that but like yeah I'll give you I'll give you a little insight into this they're talking to a lot of people uh there there there there are a lot of people that were actually talking to the Trump Administration I mean I personally know a few of them and they cast it they cast a wide net so I I do believe that that's probably over reported uh like car is not going to be setting crypto policy anytime soon this is my you know I'll I'll put egg on my face if uh if it does turn out to be true I mean better him than Gensler but yeah yeah not the best choice I agree but I mean that you know and like Nero's doing Nero's doing very well uh some some of the other like bitco Bitcoin adjacent names which you would have thought might do well have not so for example like or has not done well and stacks has has has not has not done well and this is pretty different I guess in 2021 we actually had less like options I guess is a way is a way to phrase it there there were just less coins to buy it and so it was easy it was a lot easier for everything to go up in a straight line and now it seems like you you you really have to you know be paying attention to like where the money flow is going and some of it seems like reasonably random and and what do I mean by reasonably random well Bonk is up 27% today and whiff is down a percent and normally those things move re you know they they they sort of they sort of move together um you know and so I I do think that you have to be there is opportunity to make a lot of money here if you're you know Pi picking your spots yeah I mean speaking of picking your spots like I was recommending that people put 40 to 80% of their crypto portfolio into Bitcoin coin and reserve the rest for just like active trading basically alt coining but to your point like just personally I'm going to put it out there right now I only have 20% like I I did the 80% Bitcoin like I I've only got 20% of my portfolio as an active trading book because I lack confidence in what to buy like we're not in a market where everything just goes up in a straight line and it's just a question of how much beta and risk you want to take like near one of my favorite tokens from the previous cycle like that thing has barely moved um but like salana has ripped but it's still like $50 off the highs this just you know goat uh just got listed by binance first pump. fund uh token to hit a billion dollars like do you buy that like what whiff and Doge have decorrelated even though they're both dog coins Bon I thought was dead now it's alive like I I don't feel like I have a good understand of this so I don't want to like invest cycles and pay bid ask and fees and like rotate things in and out when I when I lack the confidence like I'm just not seeing the ball clearly outside of Bitcoin and salana for for salana and eth I have a pretty good plan but you're on mute yeah there there I think I think there are there are like some good trades that you can take out there I mean for example you know if you have after after the Trump Victory and you're like okay well what do I like what do I buy um I think me memes memes were Doge sorry Doge was reasonably obvious I don't know if memes are reasonably obvious but at least Doge doge is reasonably obvious and if you actually wanted to just put on a huge position against BTC you still made really good money doing that uh and that was a reasonably risk adjusted position I feel so dumb I fumbled that one uh I I I fumbled it in the sense that I didn't have a massive position uh but I had I had a good I had a good good enough Siz position I guess good for you not be upset to like to like not because because we we had talked about that and I had a big enough position to not kill myself um but it was nowhere near as big enough I think as the conviction that I I had expressed earlier yeah uh you know so so that was obviously a little little bit sad another is you have the you have these Nvidia earnings coming up and I think AI tends to do well into those earnings and this is the type of environment when you have really obvious trades work out and yes there's some there's some stuff that has gone up a ton already like render is is has almost has almost 2x uh but you know you have arweave you have you have near to like all these things I check back in two days before Nvidia earnings on the 20th and I think that they're going to be outperformers what one one thing that's kind of interesting to me is that now now you have you know xrp performing really well and that was actually in a you know like that to me was a delayed reaction like xrp was one of the things I was really bullish on out of the gate because of all the stuff that we had talked about hey anything related to the SEC is going to be bit up really hard and xrp is like the asset that has been burdened by the SEC the most I mean getting delist off of exchanges and getting getting restricted across across the board and then only today does it out does it outperform so that that was a bit of a weird one but that one's kind of been like that that's like the that's like one of the assets that I you know I I would think to buy right after Trump victory yeah there's no Rhyme or Reason to this it just feels like a bunch of people randomly have ideas and then the price moves when it moves um it's not it's not like uh equities or FX or Commodities where you know comp of related assets like all move in a relatively logical sensible way versus each other I think why this is which is why this environment is when you see all the threaders come out why because it's so easy to create narratives now yeah people have money people are willing to buy things you put out you put out a 15 tweet Thread about a specific asset and you tell everyone why it's going to go up and you buy right before you put out that that thing and then you sell into it I mean you're people actually do that oh dude basically every thread that you see I you'll open up a little every thread that you see somebody is probably selling into that and the threaders that that that's because of like I mean I mean if you look at my feed that's why I don't do that right I don't do it because it's not I write threads but it's more about process because I like to write out of 15 this is why Tron is going to absolutely go to the moon and then it goes up 25% and somebody put on like a 10x LIC position before and then they sell out of it right um you know I'm not saying that every thread and every person that writes like this is doing that but I'm saying that it's a lot more common than you might think uh and that's why if you look at my feed you're not going to see that ever because it's just not not how I roll um you know even you know the what what I what I say is even the appearance of impropriety is not necessarily a good thing so even if I don't sell into it right it's it's it's like not like I I don't I don't want people coming after me because I might have yeah I just don't do it no it's true like you can't torture your reputation the timeline is getting weird though like PE there okay I'm now that you mention it I do see a lot of like pump pump your bags threads I see like an odd number of paid shills going on like people people who should have way too much money to be getting paid for tweets are doing paid tweets for random projects which means that this is the beginning of the bull cyc the the alt bull cycle where like tokens BISD people at various projects like their their marketing budgets are full of you know their pockets are full and they start paying people to do stuff right so you're starting to see the paid shills um I think it you know then there are people like us getting all excited like talking about how happy we are that crypto's finally rallying all of the fomo and shame and regret of the crypto haters out there is is kind of filtering through I think this is like this feels like inning two or three of like a real Bull Run I I think when you you know you're in inning eight when you start to see the scams when like one out of every three tweets is somebody getting their wallet [ __ ] emptied you know like that was that was a Hallmark of late November 2021 um I recommend everybody read Jason yanowitz is the uh like thesis on the four stages of the bull market we're we're in stage three right now which is the fun one not the the blowoff top I so I feel I feel like we're safe I just unlike you AI I don't feel comfortable selling any crypto into Fiat for a while I don't want to miss the next rally I don't want to be there on this I don't want to be sidelined when there's one of these like ludicrous candles um like what we just saw in Bitcoin you're on mute I said that that actually reminds me uh did you buy any peanut a little bit yeah that was great that was a great trade yeah that that one resonated with me I I mean never enough right never enough but basically the reason why I didn't buy more and this is a mistake that everybody can learn from ahead of the election I moved a lot of crypto to uh centralized exchanges so that I could be nimble and do what I wanted to do and momentum trade it and yeah I made some money by like doing that and then I had some Capital that I could use to trade with leverage blah blah it was all fun and games it it I kind of ignored my Phantom wallet when um when Trump was getting elected right I I I wasn't really i' I'd moved a lot of value out of there so I wasn't in I wasn't in like meme coining mode in during the election I was in like benchmarking mode you know what were you doing I think I think I mean that's I guess that's fair Jonah but come on man P was P peo was a [ __ ] home run that was that was a great one that that was I mean political cute squirrel har that's why I bought it I understand the political means it's just I mean it's just amazing like can't don't fight the peanut man Peanut's a meme he it's a perfect meme like okay bowden's dead now we got a new one we got peanut the squirrel for um government over reach I think Peanut's probably going to Nuke back down like I don't think squirrel coins I don't think there's enough I think it's going to trade like Bowden did where people are gonna be calling for it to go to 50 billion and then it's like he's dead the squirrel's dead like no one's going to remember Peanut the squirrel in a couple years ah look I I don't I don't know about that look the the thing the thing about it is uh what is sometimes after death things get actually they get better I think there's gonna be one when Biden dies Bowden might pump you know this is this is the way that the crypto Market Works Jonah I I can't I'm not going to justify it to you I'm not going to explain it to you you just have to understand this that when Biden passes away bowden's probably gonna pump this is how it works and you know I yeah people talking about a dead squirrel as Alpha yes putting that up on the board I mean in in any other Market this would be like the Pico top where you sell everything and run for the hills and like bury cash in your backyard but in crypto we're not we're not done yet we're not done yet we're not done I I don't know I don't know how much stronger I can be about that point but we're not done yet we might have a pullback might want to trade it which I will but we're not done we're not even to being getting started most people don't have this asset wait until at like like like just just you'll see December is going to be a great month December December is going to be a great month and this is the you know this is what happens when you don't even have real retail Mania or fomo yet right yeah this is what happens is is you're you're gonna see just some of the most absurd stuff you're going to see something hit a billion dollars in like three days of being long launch and you're going to see that happen multiple times and that's that's when you're going to know okay may maybe something you know you're your like weird cousin is GNA start a meme coin and that that's when you're G to know actually one of the uh actually it was squirrels uh funny enough like a like a family friends boyfriend or something started an nft project that had to do with squirrels and I think the guy had a job and I just remember that was like that was like the Pico top and I I remember you know telling because because I actually heard it I I Heard it Through The Grape Vine from my mom she calls me one day she's like hey uh this this person's uh significant other wants to connect about uh crypto it's like what does he do it's like oh he's starting some nft with squirrels I was like okay all right it's time but this time this time when the squirrel when the squirrel meme starts we're just getting started right yeah like peanut peanut is not a top signal also half of the miners out there have like pivoted to AI I wonder if that means less selling it probably doesn't but um well miners miners are a better business now I think that's been pointed out to us before it's pointed out to us by will uh miners are a better business and they they sell they sell forward a lot of their BTC um and so it's not like like minor selling how it used to work in you know 2017 mean even up until like 2021 is these guys were were kind of just yolow degenerate gamblers yeah and so what they would do is they would either sell like everything at the lows or everything at the high like just like dump like a bunch of stuff whenever they were either panicking or they were like all right this is crazy like let me sell um and so I I think minor movements were more predictive previously than than they are today like I just don't think that there's a ton of Supply coming coming from these guys to to to hit to hit the markets um like a double having right because there was the having so that Hales the amount of selling from Miners and then another having because the miners found another business line so they can hold on hold on for dear life for longer right they all want to be long Bitcoin they don't want to be selling to fund operations but now their GPU uh their gpus pay pay more of the bills they don't have to sell as much Bitcoin to me this is like this setup is crazy I I think people have been saying we've been in a bull market for two years like the recover it was basically recovery like now we're in a bull market we're breaking new highs and there's so many different factors uh that are proving to the market that Bitcoin and the rest of crypto have real fundamentals and those real fundamentals can lead this thing into another price uh kind of like ballpark um I'm so bullish I'm so bullish I can't see straight Obby love when you say that I feel that way like I I can't sleep right now I'll I'll drink to that oh right out of the bottle what are you drinking there uh I don't know it's not good doesn't have to be it's just about AR argen Argentinian red wine it's like fine uh my my girlfriend's using it to cook short ribs right now and that's that's why there's not much left in the bottle I didn't drink all that most of that was used for short ribs nothing like steak and a glass of red when the the thing that you bet everything on is suddenly just like yeah just like just like going up I mean how many how many times a day are you opening Zillow if the answer is over three then that I'm gonna add that to my list of top signals I'm not I think I'm good on real estate I gotta stop um yeah I I think for me it's more just like I I kind of it when you when you get to my age it's like other stuff it's like um what you put inside of your house unless just like like the idea of moving makes me sick you know yeah are you Zill it's fair no I'm not Zillo I'm I'm I'm stuffed on I'm stuffed on real estate I've got I've got enough on that thank God two two houses in Puerto Rico apartment in New York I'm good enough you don't need anymore um don't yeah don't don't need anymore and then I have a hotel investment actually invested a lot in like a hotel that they're redeveloping here I think Puerto Rico Puerto Rico real estate is is an underrated asset class because there's actually a floor people have been saying that for like 20 years and then uh and it's straight up Jonah it's straight up are you in um the Mighty Ducks guy are you investing in the same hotel as the the Mighty Ducks guy Brock Pierce yeah I think so Normandy I I don't know anything about anyway I don't I don't know if he's investing in that hotel but I bought my first house here for 1.2 mil in 2021 and I could sell it now for 2. 2.2 to 2.5 is that just a crypto trade or is that a pandemic trade or is it's a pandemic and crypto trade it's a it's a market go up everyone starts to look at Puerto Rico real estate because there's a small okay so what a lot of people don't know not that this is a Puerto Rico show you know not podcast but there's like $2.5 billion doar of development into Puerto Rico to redo the whole thing in the West in the north kind of everywhere a lot of big hedge fund managers are moving in and buying up real estate because what's happening is that Puerto Rico until 2035 is the only place in the entire world where an American citizen can pay zero taxes zero like not zero and then you also pay your federal taxes zero you just pay zero cap you don't pay income taxes there done like you pay well you pay 4% income taxes if you ride it through a business 4% okay so what ends up happening is obviously whenever the market goes up and people are expecting a good year a lot of people move down to Puerto Rico to establish residency and so what's happening right now is a lot of people are coming in and looking at Puerto Rico because Trump is Trump is one and they're saying okay well if the markets are going to 2x in the next three years I'm going to save 50% right it's called act 60 and so Puerto Rican real estate uh uh specifically housing houses have somewhat of a floor because building takes a long time in Puerto Rico and in order to get the benefit of act 60 you have to own your primary residence so anyone that's moving down here to save millions of dollars has to buy their primary residence and they're only a small subset of houses that are kind of livable for somebody if you make millions of dollars so it's like that's why right I me okay it's basically it's basically like crypto beta these so like somebody will somebody will make 10 million bucks in crypto they'll be like yeah this house might be worth 1.5 but I'll pay 2.5 because I'm Gonna Save five yeah watch Trump watch Trump rug whatever that is act 60 watch him just like actually I don't care I'm not even on you don't live in Puerto Rico anymore no that's interesting they're all these weird little derivative uh crypto trades I think um it is it is a trade and every time uh every time crypto rips my favorite place the Hollywood Hills rips that's the first thing that every crypto rich person does is gowood Hills man just like try to do the selling Sunset thing coin or BTC miners is a good one as a question can I can I throw in Hood as well yes as a as a stock that I'd like to own I really like Hood okay good stock I think coins coin's getting close to the all-time highs uh it's trading $320 a share it's pretty crazy I think a lot of these crypto businesses are going to have a Euphoria cycle but then they're they're equities right like you can't you can't expect the same kind of asymmetric returns from coinbase or Robin Hood that you could from Dogecoin or even Bitcoin they're not going to Triple you know maybe coinbase could over over like 2 to three years but it just seems so unlikely I think like I think that these are the like if I were going to put big leverage on anything I would put it on crypto equities because it's going to be a smooth ride I think so too because it's you I think es Hood especially um what I don't think people necessarily realize is that as markets go up people are going to start using it a lot more it's actually a like a really good platform for buying and selling crypto like I I I use it and I enjoy it and so what I do still charge 35 bips yes they still charge 35 bips but it's I mean it's still cheaper than coinbase and it's baked into the spread a bit yeah um so like when I was when I I I bought some eth on there a while back and I think in aggregate I was looked at it and I'm like okay well mid here is like 40 bips yeah I I used to quote Robin Hood in my old job and basically you would earn one to two basis points of Edge on bitcoin and eth two to four basis points of Edge on like Doge or shib uh on top of the 35 bips so Robin Hood would take 35 and then you basically you would quote like for Bitcoin you would quote 36 bips away from mid Robin Hood would take 35 and you would keep one and you would have all that sounds about for what IID but anyway I interrupted you I'm sorry about that so you were saying you know what I'm doing on Robin Hood right now uh maybe I should like drop my ref link no I'm not going to do that but uh they actually uh they actually offer a 1% bonus uh paid out over uh uh two years for any cash that you deposit in right now which is kind of nice wow right so like you deposit like five million bucks you get paid $50,000 for just depositing your five million bucks and you're earning full 4.5% on cash and you get to invest it like okay that that is pretty that is that Robin Hood gold yeah it's like but you pay $5 a month for that I mean it's like seems pretty seems like as long as Rob Hood doesn't go under which I don't think it will go under uh yeah I mean if it didn't go under it last year it's probably not going to go under this year um they're not exactly too big to fail but I think they're pretty foolproof at this point that's my that's my take so yeah I like that coin Hood .5 million FDIC insured so if you're like really scared then met put in 2.5 um but I actually think Robin Hood's going to do extremely well over the next uh little bit um another my board I haven't been paying any attention to it like another ticker well the two other tickers that I've been paying attention to that aren't necessarily uh directly crypto related um but Netgear is doing really well and so basically the the the thesis there is that and don't quote me on this because I'm not like the most technical person in the world but what is underappreciated about neckar is their ability to install uh communication systems in AI data centers and like and basically uh maintain maintain uptime so apparently they're getting they're getting installed pretty heavily and then also uh goo is obviously doing very well which I've talked about before my favorite stock my favorite single name stock that has nothing to do with crypto is meta I just I think you never bet against the Zuck and also um I think they're super well positioned for AI just because they're building all these amazing models they have all the best training data they basically have everybody's information can train their models on it and ultimately that's going to provide value in terms of like personal assistance and agents and all all sorts of other crap that's kind of on the horizon they execute better than anybody and their market cap is way lower than you know your Nvidia or apples or microsofts of the world so I think that that's like the the my favorite mag s single name stock and my favorite stock that has nothing to do with crypto but back to crypto for a second um am I crazy for continuing to put in more dough into crypto like I just am I buying the should I be waiting for a pullback given given how much of your net worth you told me you were allocated to crypto no yeah but I probably wouldn't go over a 100 you like buy over 100k uh like buy over 100% of your net worth oh yeah no I wouldn't do that either yeah like that seems like a person like personally that seems like a recipe for disaster but I mean you know yeah no no I wouldn't do that I'm not I'm not crazy like I'm just I'm older than you so it's funny how it works like when you're young and you have your entire portfolio is just like funny money you can kind of you can kind of gamble it and do what you want with it and the if you lose 20 30 50% like not much changes for you you're still kind of in like wealth accumulation mode especially if you're a Trader it when you get to my age like the the prospect of like getting a trade wrong and then having to explain to your family why everybody's moving into a smaller house that just feels like stupid so I'm inherently like I guess when I talk on crypto Twitter about portfolio allocation I inherently come off as like way more risk averse than you know young Thundercats who are like 150% long crypto I just I can't do that anymore life changes you know you're on mute I know Jonah un I think we need a new Thundercat because I'm no longer a Thundercat I mean we had a Thundercat on the show yeah I I think I think the issue the issue is I realized in this bull run is that and this is in the most humble way possible I've got too much to lose right like it's just like I just don't have the balls to be 100% long my net worth anymore like I can be 50% long and that's okay uh 60% maybe uh but like a 100 like literally 100% of my net worth it's like I don't I don't love the idea of of of bet of betting that just because if I'm wrong then you know I'm wrong every now and then when the opportunity presents itself when there's a slam like a home run like I am super confident in this I'm like 90% yeah okay I'll bet I'll bet huge but like how I used to operate was literally I would have a 100% of my net worth in crypto Forever Until it got to a point where I thought it nuts and then I would like sell out of it right and like take some cash but I was always going to buy back in right so from from 2017 to the peak in 2021 I basically never dipped below 100% net like net long crypto for more than a week like I would short to try to things out yeah like balance things out but like I I just didn't you know that's that's a good lesson [ __ ] that's a good lesson for all the people in their early to mid 20s out there just getting started with crypto like if you want to be like Avi in terms of crypto trading becoming a a path to you know freedom for yourself like you have to you have to play with big conviction when you're really convicted and you also have to be early and you also have to not fomo into that level of uh investment at the top of anything um so yeah like that's what that's just what you have to do um when you get more into like preserving what you have mode uh the entire calculus of trading changes well I mean look I'm still play I'm still playing to win don't give me wrug I'm still playing to make up make a absolute crazy amount of money but I can do that with 50% of my network if I 10x if I 10x % my net worth like I I'm going to be buying a lot of cards also we're getting drisk right now I Love Drunk Obby by the way keep drinking that wine I feel like the um that like we're getting drisk a little bit like as time goes on the odds like let's say that you had 50% of your net worth in Bitcoin is Bitcoin really going to zero ever like no it may go to like what's a worst case scenario for Bitcoin what what what what price it goes down 70% yeah so if you have 50% of your your net worth in Bitcoin I'm not talking about like random [ __ ] alts but like Bitcoin and it goes down 70% like you've lost a 30e net worth you're fine right so is that issue the issue Jonah is um how do I put this when you're a Trader Bitcoin can go up 100% And you can lose money and Bitcoin can go down 50% and you can make money yeah and so what happens to a lot of people that I've unfortunately seen in action is Bitcoin will be down 70% and they might have only touched Bitcoin but they're down 90 and that's not great yeah that sucks you know and I I do I do think that that is also uh why as a Trader just being cognizant of that is important and then you just end up playing with smaller numbers because you can win more to the upside but you can also lose more to the downside um you know it's like a it's like you know if I if I'm confident in something and I'm setting it and forgetting it and I think that this thing is going to is going to go up right let's say 50% of my net worth is allocated to crypto maybe I have 35% in stuff that I just don't touch confident four years the stuff's going up and then 15% trading but I'm not trading to 50% no no I mean that that's why we were talking about this on Twitter like you cannot trade a 100 % of your crypto portfolio it's just too much like you're more dialed in than 99% of the Traders out there and you're not trading 100% of your crypto portfolio My Philosophy has always been from the beginning the best way to make money in crypto if you're a good Trader is to take 50% of your portfolio and just stick it in stuff that you're gonna like hold forever and you're never going to touch and then trade with 50% and then every time you make a certain amount of profit just buy the stuff that you're going to hold forever yeah you risk it into Bitcoin or eth or whatever whatever and then you just don't and then you just don't touch it again it's crazy that salana is now in in the category of forever bags yeah it's crazy wow anyway j i I got a I got a roll well the the audience says guys please sleep so now it's good timing I guys I I this is pigmentation I don't know how many times I need to explain this to you I sleep like seven to eight hours a day now it was pre-ordained to use the word from Ear Pod this is purely pigmentation there's nothing I can do about that it's your it's it's your it's your War face you just born with I I am a raccoon I am I am 2% raccoon and that is just I'm sorry guys this like see there's nothing I don't have the pigmentation but I'm actually tired because I stay up all night looking at Bitcoin and then my daughter starts a a rave at 4:45 a.m. sometimes so yeah feeling the squeeze dude great talking can't believe I can't I can't believe I just gave like a long lecture about how I'm basically just a raccoon and that this is pigmentation it's not going away and the first comment is AI never sleeps 100% confirmed brother AI is a cute panda that's what somebody else said well it's it's nicer than raccoon I'll take it thanks guys um inverse Panda great great talking to you man how about this how about this rather than just one of us drinking um if we breach 100K let's just both drink on the podcast okay we haven't had one of those yet yeah let's do it all right 100K we're breaking out the breaking out something let's do it drink uh you know what 100K I'll uh you I'll deliveroo a bottle to you and you can door Dash a bottle to me okay perfect of our favorite stuff love it done you're done all right aios great seeing you AI not Financial advice everybody please don't listen to us don't buy Puerto Rican hotels AB do anything um yeah all right good talking see

hey all right we're live where's the comments here we go we're live we're live bitcoin's [ __ ] ripping and we're going up and we're all gonna we're all gonna [ __ ] make it we're going to Val remember when I said when I when I finally capitulated on being bearish I said you just got to be Max long you know that was kind of timely timely capitulation right at the end of a eight Monon long range found um like boredom Fest you you were like all right that's it I'm long and then boom basically God God candle and now now I'm just gonna stay along and close my eyes I mean you know if if you've been long for a while and you've made a ton of money maybe you should just clip some profits but honestly the next the next four years of our life it's going to be pretty pretty [ __ ] fun Jonah I mean you can just see the moment in the chart where crypto got legalized across the board yeah that just just let me let me pause let me pause you right there let me pause you right there and then you continue crypto is legal now that's all I have to say don't overthink it crypto is legal now yeah so as a side you know as like a side thing I got this uh I got this tablet those people it's it's called it's called remarkable it's like a you write on it and it's kind of like paper I no I know what it is um my tenant who stole from me left one in my house and then I sold it on eBay because I thought it was stupid to have to pay for something that's like paper which is yeah but it's like useful because you get to keep all of your notes in one place so you know what I what I get to do now is I get to go click around and I get to go back to the notes that I took on the podcast where we discussed the Trump election which is like all of them and the number one thing that I kept saying which by the way I did not do but the number one thing I kept saying was that you should buy all the SEC coins like the moment that you think that Trump would be elected you just buy all the SEC coins and that was I had uni a uh and Lio and they're all up infinite right now so that was great if you listen to my advice and you did that you made a lot of money uh because basically right after you know as like the odds went up there was actually a delay look look at Unis swap it's up like 30 35% just like boom like straight up Obby can we Victory lap for a second remember all those people who kept telling us on Twitter that the election didn't matter that much or that this was a fade um this this wasn't a fade this was as real as as we said it was going to be so I do think we should Pat ourselves on the back for that now I think the real ballsy call was Trump winning right like normally you're not supposed to bet on a coin flip like this with serious amounts of your Capital but I think for me what made this a little bit more of a comfortable situation was the idea that pollsters cannot adjust for people who don't respond to their polls uh like that that sort of there's there's sample bias in the people that won't respond to a poll in that Trump voters are less likely to respond than non-trump voters so if you're a PO there's no way to adjust for that without committing malpractice right like you could say oh in 2016 I was you know my trump estimate was too low by 7 points in 2020 my trump estimate was too low by Four Points so this time I'll just do my poll and then adjust it up by like four to seven points like you can't do that that's malpractice so to me it was just like given that there's literally no way for people to adjust for Trump polls uh for for Trump's outperformance on polls uh I'm just going to do it myself I'm going to commit the the sort of pollster non-practice malpractice that they can't commit and that's what got me comfortable with being long crypto but like I don't know there was a surprising amount of fud out there on Twitter about how even if Trump won it like wouldn't matter for crypto and now like you can see the space is only beginning to Rally like this is this is the beginning of I think a a pretty solid Trend what do you think I I agree with you I think that we're gonna be trending for I mean look obviously they're always going to be ups and downs but if you ask me where we are in three months are you drinking wine right now I should crack open a beer yeah dude come on like I didn't have any champagne so I just picked this bottle of wine go get one go get one I I'll monologue or something I'm I'm I'm in Puerto Rico right now the only beer I have is like this [ __ ] tier beer called madah do you think it's like it's like Bud Light but slightly better um Go Get It Go Get It seriously I'm gonna I'm gonna drink my Aquafina I'm gonna be healthy so I can laser focus and make some [ __ ] money in this market this is this is a great day Jonah this I mean like acoss across the board this is just so this is the most fun that I've had in a while I I basically just like checked out up until the election and now I can check back in and look at things I've been pretty checked I mean okay I'll tell you I'll tell you one thing that I wish I had done but I didn't do I did a little bit but in bigger size is is the Doge trade was so obvious it was like so obvious to go long Doge versus e you could have put that on in huge size I actually still think that there's a really good trade for Doge I mean it came off it kind it hasn't really gone that far like eth is up 11% on the last 24 hours since the election up 16 yeah weak we yeah like like here's here here's you know I I wasn't like you I didn't position aggressively before the election betting on a trump wi because to me yeah I didn't I didn't I was okay I was I was positioned aggressively not because I thought 100% Trump was going to win not because I looked at the data and I'm like oh I think Trump is gonna win I just thought that there would be a there's like a very easy trade right like if Trump wins and everything just Giga gigar rockets and at the time that we had spoken we had already come off a little bit from the highs so I thought that even if and so that was pricing in a little bit of a Camala win so I thought even if Kamala win won then I could get out of my trains right so for me it wasn't like a I'm gonna go gig along because I'm confident that Trump's GNA win it was I'm gonna go super long because there's good asymmetry and what that means is that the concept that I had of like gigal long wasn't probably long enough but what what happened on that night is when when the Florida results came in and Trump performed in Miami Dade and just crushed it I was like all right it's in my mind it was over at that point that's that's what did it for you so that's when you bought where was Bitcoin trading at that point uh it was just broke I think it was just above 70ish I bought I mean I like double I'll tell you I doubled down on a at 144 and I doubled down on Doge at 18 cents th those were the those were the levels that I cared about um and I think that what ended up what ended up happening I mean basic we called that we called a on the pot like we've talked about this mult multiple times multiple times yeah and here's the thing this is really good not just because Trump won but because a lot of very Pro crypto candidates won like across the board the crypto candidates did well and what we're looking at right now now is we're looking at the Embrace of crypto Yeah by our political system we're looking at a non-zero chance that a bit a strategic reserve of Bitcoin is created over the next four years I Peg it by the way let me just put it out there if a strategic Bitcoin Reserve is created million dollars a token like every country is going to create one uh like it's going to be like Lemmings following America into that sort of uh mental it's going to replace gold basically on Central bank's balance sheets million dolls it's going to be unbelievable yeah we're we're gonna win so bigly like you won't even know what to do with yourself I mean Brian Armstrong tweeted this even if that doesn't happen Brian Armstrong tweeted welcome to the new members of America's most Pro crypto Congress ever 219 Pro crypto candidates and Counting have now been elected to the House and Senate like AI dude we have been in an industry that has like okay fine you know we've made some money in it and that's great but like people have vilified us for being in this like it's it's considered a disgusting gambling habit not even a a hobby it's a habit but now it's becoming legitimate because this is economic freedom for people this is like the internet of value this this is obviously better technology than existing payment rails all of all of the disruptions that this technology has created bya bitcoin are now being embraced bya the mainstream and sure there's no like application for that yet because these things take time but markets price the future so like I don't think it's too early to get excited about this like I I really think you need to start buying now I'm getting I'm starting to get uh friends reaching out to me like hey I bought my first Bitcoin what do you think like I want to accumulate a stash even my even my hardcore comma supporter friends are like yo I think Trump's gonna like maybe turn America into you know 1930s Third Reich Germany like if I wanted to get all my money into Bitcoin to move it out of here like even those kinds of conversations are happening so I think most people have been blackpilled on bitcoin and it's it's kind of important to I agree to price the I 100% agree with you Bitcoin is obviously a huge winner but everything is going to be a huge winner and this isn't getting priced in fast enough yeah and so are you saying are you calling for alt season Obi like are you calling old season I mean we're we're going to be in a in a dynamic over the next and and ALT Seasons I do is Ethan alt is Ethan alt so so so there are two things I want to say here one is I like Ethan Al for for for for for a short for a short period of time I think eth eth can do well and the M the main reason is that I think that what you're seeing right now is there's going to be no hesitation of people coming into very little hesitation when it comes to allocators right now people are going to just start allocating and people are going to buy eth because it because it exists and it exists in the form of an ETF and it's easy to buy and so they're going to be people that can't buy anything that doesn't trade on the on the stock market and then they're going to buy the ETF it's trading at a premium today for the first time in a very long time so and eth beta coins I think is true Lio I a these things are going to do well because now they can operate in a regulatory friendly environment so now you're not worried about the overhang right and it's it's invigorating right there's there's a sense of momentum now that PE people are going to work harder on building good products people are going to be more interested in using in using crypto and using in using defi somebody said Ena as well yeah I like basically the the the issue the issue is guys no matter what you you type in that chat the answer is probably it's going up at this point like you can you can you can type basically anything there you know you can say Ena Lio Anan a doge whatever it is because of the capital flows that are about the that are about to come in and so don't churn too much yeah there you even usdt is gonna go up guys USD is going to hit $2 right like you I I think my target for usdc is 10 it's it's going somebody's because some idiot's going to come in and buy wait are you joking or are you are you talking yeah okay for a second I was like hang on hang on I'm the one drinking here like winners win winners winners average winners look guys what you have to understand is that we are a small group of people we are a small little circle in the world we can all agree with each other and still be right that's what happened in 2021 [ __ ] just went up in a straight line and everyone was bullish for an extended period of time because there was new money coming and I think new money is about to come now remember this now please remember this all seasons only last like three weeks I'm Ser I'm dead serious so so treat it like treat it like a meme coin basically like like all seasons only last like three to five weeks because what ends up happening is is that they just go up so unfathomably high that they just overprice themselves immediately and so if Dogecoin trades 65 cents in the next three weeks that doesn't mean it's going to A180 that probably means you want to sell now you know that that's that's just my take they they just tend to not last I mean even Bitcoin right like you you look at bitcoin price appreciation it all happens really fast I think I think we're in like this second inning of one of those parabolic moves one one of those but like it all it all happens really fast and then everyone revises their price targets higher like Bitcoin will go to 120 and then everyone will call for 250 and then 120 will be the top right like that's that's just like how it works almost every time um yeah maybe maybe that's like the the Thousand X podcast heuristic it's like when the Market's just rallied a lot and the average pundit on Twitter is calling for a two to five Xing from from there you're supposed to you're supposed to take some off yeah so like but the market hasn't rallied a lot yet it went from 70 to 70 basically what I'm saying is right now on a massive Paradigm Shift yeah people keep saying I don't sleep now I I I just I just want to like set you know put this put this to bed guys I sleep like a solid solid five six hours a night like this is come on like that's fine I I I sleep the the rest of the time who knows what I'm doing but I do I do sleep but thank you guys for for caring do I have any concerns about an fomc putting a Hal to this run no no no we're we're not we're not talking about the FED right now we're still talking about the political we'll get to the fomc let's talk about the political implications of this like let's let's let's let's talk about how to make money yeah I've got a few ideas I think this is a key now I mean not not to like give out specific items but I do think that like Soul meme coins are just going to continue to rip really hard I do think that there's going to be a pretty tremendous amount of capital allocation to these to these things and I also think that what we're looking at right now is we're looking at a Revival of the stuff that was kind of hated for a bit right like if you look at defi like I yeah like like a lot a lot a lot of the um a lot of the things that were like heavily shorted I think are gonna are going to rip because basically nobody wants to be short in this environment and that brings me to why I think e BTC is going to do well I think that everyone uses everyone uses eth as a hedge and so a 20% eth BTC move is not off the table in fact I think it's probably likely that in the next three weeks e BGC moves up 15 to 20% that would be sorry sorry if I'm wrong but this this is my take crypto stocks can can I can I pause before we get to crypto stocks and just comment on what you just said I agree with everything I think eth BTC might pop but I I think we should be looking at Sal BTC I don't think there's anything on eth that you want to do with your eth right now whereas on salana there's all as a crypto native as a degenerate Gambler there is all kinds of opportunity inside of salana so unless you think that there is going to be a major Catalyst that drops for eth in the next two months where like Black Rock just straight up announces that they're going to be deploying some insane that they're migrating their back Office Solution Aladdin to ethereum and all of wall Street's going to be using it to settle index traes like that seems unlikely to me um I don't I wouldn't want to bet on eth going up even if they did say that uh I I think that salana is sa eth is going to outperform which means that everything you just said about eth BTC is true but you will make more money if instead of buying eth BTC you buy Sal BTC and also you will have salana bags to go and mess around with meme coins when you want to whereas there's absolutely not like like you you're not going to go buy an nft right now are you there's too much opportunity to lock your dough up like that I'm telling you right now I think that Soul eth has topped oh okay for the next three weeks for the next three weeks honestly Saul eth was like I was a big salana hater I started you you convinced me to start rotating some Ethan to salana and then I tweeted something out like I think it was a month or two ago where I that was basically the end of my my rotation where I was just like most of my what used to be eth is now in salana uh less a crypto Punk of course and I'm very happy with that trade and I I was expecting to I'm kind of hoping to ride this for at least 6 to 12 months uh so your bearish you think it tops in you think it's topped for three weeks but what do you think on a longer time frame because salana to me is like the alt of this this what I perceive to be the next big parabolic run I still think over you know the next year sure um you're probably gonna look you're proba going to see salana outperform yeah with that being with that being said I'm bullish eth because as you get new out really it's it's three it's three three pieces one is that everyone used eth as a short leg and nobody wants to be short crypto right now so that's gonna that's all gonna unlock the second is I think that this brings in new all like new allocation into crypto especially from trafi people who are going to either one allocate to eth as part part of a portfolio and or two what they're going because the reason that you didn't see a ton of that in my personal opinion prior in the ETFs is because a lot of the ETF flow was coming from people that were betting on the election like it was Traders and they were using DTC TR I think what we're going to see over the next few weeks is we're actually going to see long-term allocations coming as people make a lot like a a strong bet on the future of crypto and that's going to include eth as part of the portfolio I see what you mean and then the the third the third is that it's a it's it's a momentum thing at I'll paint it like this you PC is the lowest it's been in years three years I think and and it's it's not like flatlining here it's it's trending lower like it's you're talking about catching a falling knife and so and so if you get a if you get a strong reversal in a bullish market like this people are going to hop on that momentum and it's going to lead to that it's like it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy until people again realize that eth is not probably going to be used a ton and then it comes back in but that's good I mean 25% move which is what I'd be looking for you know if we can get above 04 you know maybe 045 on each BTC like I'm I'm out I see what you mean so basically you're you're in for like a like a short covering trade I think that's a really good idea now here's I I kind of have a new framework for evaluating Alt l1s um I guess you could call Ethan salana l1s at this point um so my framework for evaluating l1s I've been spending a lot of time on this I used to just think like okay fat protocol thesis like eth plus l2s are an ecosystem salana is an ecosystem where's the dough going to go if it goes to polygon or base it doesn't matter that's all value accured to eth what I'm realizing is that what's what really drives token pricing is H like how big of a wallet are you going to maintain in the ecosystem in order to facilitate what you want to do and to me the reason why salana has pumped so much and outperformed E so much is because in order to have fun with salana and use salana for what salana is good for right now requires you having you know thousands or tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars of you know salana on that chain so that you can like quickly rotated into and out of meme coins which are ultimately like kind of trades right they're not Investments um for eth you kind of during 2021 you had that like big money rationale when people were buying fidenza and rocks and crypto punks and stuff but like if the whole like eth is back office eth is the global settlement layer thesis is true yes that's bullish eth but what does it mean like realistically it means that institutions will probably just need to have gas fees available to settle stuff on well let's let's call it Spade to Spade like they got to settle stuff on base right so maybe is there like like are people going to be settling massive microtransaction massive amounts of microtransactions on the main net no so if you're just trying to like hold some bags to pay for gas base is pretty cheap like I think it might even be cheaper per transaction than salana so you don't need to hold a big wallet I don't think I don't think there's like high value I I don't think there's anything going on inside of eth that's going to require new people to come into the ecosystem and acquire tons of eth in order to do what they want to do on eth whereas with for salana uh because I think this meme coin thing is just the beginning of like basically disrupting the total addressable Market of the global Lottery system like I think among other applications I I think honestly like salana is probably the better play for an L1 uh over the course of the next again longer term medium to long term yeah I mean look I don't think we disagree I think this is just a question of a a question of time frames I was just pontificating I agree with you on the short term and like not to debate like l1's because I think that both I mean both both are going to go up it's just a matter of this this is is the type of Market where it's about maximizing right and also not getting not getting shaken out is kind of what I was saying earlier like you can probably like if I go to my list of things that I look at and I ask what's going to be up in the next I don't know two three weeks I think the answer is basically everything and so the question and so the question is like what is going to be up the most and that really that's really what we're trying to what we're trying to figure out right now I'm I've started messing with leverage for the first time in my like kind of pa um like I'm using mild leverage on bitcoin just because I think that Bitcoin is gonna have the best sharp in crypto so I feel comfortable Levering up a little bit yeah I've been I've been breaking my rule I thought I was Max long like six times already and I just keep getting longer because the price go goes up and I keep getting longer because I add more Fiat into this and get more convicted and then I get longer because I decide to use some leverage like I'm just getting increasingly degenerate with this because I at this point I really do think we are going to take off and I've thought that since before the election because of my view about how polling is done so I don't really see why this would this rally would stop I I don't they really they really there really only two reasons uh one I mean the first reason why the rally stops is people get people get over their skis right so you see funding rates roof for a week you see people chasing random [ __ ] uh multiple days of having altcoins and memes trade more in volume than their market cap probably a good sign to start taking profit off the table and also very likely what you're going to what you're going to see in close to the top is you're GNA see you're you're you're going to see people you're going to see things like go 100x like new launches are going to start coming out people are going to start creating coins again and these things are going to go 100x really quickly and then you probably want to say okay let let me let me get some let me let me get some off the table now nashy brings up a good point if the missiles start flying we could that could be an unexpected retracement and I don't know I think we should probably do an oil Corner at some point in this podcast as euphoric as we are because this election means big stuff for geopolitics and macro and it could cause some turbulence for our sector in Bitcoin so we should talk about that too but dude I I genuinely I mean I don't think Iran's going to do [ __ ] now now that now that Trump's in they're they're going to be they're going to be way too scared to get hit back really hard yeah but that that but Israel is empowered right so if BB takes out car island or a couple of refineries or something oil's gonna oil's gonna do something and I think that could that could create a little bit of like I I wouldn't fade I like I I would I wouldn't I wouldn't anticipate a riskof move by selling my Bitcoin or selling my stocks here but I'm just saying like you don't want to get too levered because there's going to be yeah volatility to the upside have you I maybe I think I mean like look like you know oil better than most if Iran's oil gets taken out tomorrow and price spikes there there's a ton of excess production available like people can you know it's it's not like we're we're running up against a limit to the amount of oil that could be produced Saudi can just start pumping more that's right yeah Iran's entire production could get plugged in by Saudi however if their entire production gets taken out they could shut the Straits of horuse and 30% of the world's oil flows through that straight and they would they like if if if their entire production was taken out and they were an animal backed into a corner they you know they produce they export 1.6 they produce more because they consume it domestically um they export 1.6 Saudi plus the others have like two to three million barrels of spare capacity so Iran's production is not an issue but if Iran prevents everybody else including Iraq uh Qatar like Saudi Arabia from exporting oil and suddenly the world is short 30 million barrels a day of oil instead of 1.6 million then the entire economy collapses right so that's probably not going to happen but if there's even a 5% chance of it happening which is kind of on the table if Israel takes out car Island which they like stated they kind of are interested in doing then um you're you're going to see volatility and so Le don't get too levered is my point like the last thing you want if you're a crypto Trader and just like hear me out the last thing you want is to be like five to 10 times levered there's some like geopolitical volatility that leads to bitcoin volatility you get liquidated and then the market just go like like [ __ ] melts upwards and five x's and you can't participate because you've lost all your money so don't do that right so like mild Leverage is appropriate I think yeah look I I'm not as concerned about these geopolitical shocks as you are right I'm in terms of what's going to stop this rally I'm 95% sure that it's going to be people getting ahead of themselves and like really like really adding on a ton a ton of Leverage right and then that what what ends up happening there is that people see that they go okay time to cut my positions Market gets flooded with Supply you get a ton of liquidations and that kind of crushes the momentum not a lot of Leverage yet per Vell data our favorite nothing um I I actually I love this comment is a on Aderall or Coke or both I'm on Green candle P oh my God I dude how good how good does today feel like I I love I love the fact that bring p&l and a good day can make it seem like you're on stimulant I I didn't even have coffee today really no I've been I've been up since like four in the morning following this um and yes I'm I'm feeling very good I had a coffee though yeah I mean look my my view right now is it's nothing nothing is ever going to go up in a straight line and so the reason I don't like Leverage is because who knows if we trade 72 thou if we trade 72k from here I want to be able to add I don't want to be I don't want to be nursing my wounds right because I know that the leverage the issue with leverage in my personal opinion is that it makes trading too path dependent right you can be right on a one month time Horizon but if you're levered and you're wrong for three days and it goes down a lot you might Panic you might cut your positions you might be taking too much of a hit and so then you actually take yourself out of the game right and so that's why I don't love using leverage in these particular types of scenarios where I I tend to only use leverage when I think things have really collapsed like I use leverage in an FTX type scenario I use I use leverage when there there's a tremendous amount of liquidations and I'm using leverage for a very short time period right and I because I I want to use leverage to catch him me ver anyway long long story long story short I forgot my train of thought um this this is a great Market environment not just for crypto for everything and why because what a lot of people don't recognize is that one of the reasons that the economy did so well being 2016 to 2020 is because Trump when he comes in one of the first things that he does is he cuts a ton of regulations and he allows businesses to make more money Cuts taxes for business too like that makes I think I think regulations are actually even more important than than tax cuts and regulations have been a killer for crypto in particular like obviously it hits oil it hits banking it it'ss everything but like for crypto you know we were at permissionless the the people there they can't even build like what they want to build because they're GNA be stuck in court for five years the whole industry is like on pods and that is in my personal opinion the single worst thing about regulations is that it stifles Innovation why because if you're building something in crypto you don't know if what what you're building is going to land you in jail like you said so you just end up not building anything you just go okay I don't wanna I don't want to touch too much you know we kind of have this product right now I'm not going to be too you know Innovative I'm not going to do anything too crazy because what if I do this crazy cool thing and the SEC comes after me or the government comes after me or you know I I don't I don't want to deal with it and so what it does is it cyles Innovation because people you're not even in the mind frame to think about it right you have it's not just building it's trading too like we're not allowed to trade perss in America you're you're not allowed to create a crypto Trading company in America part of the reason why these massive basis arbs exist is because most legitimate Trad fi companies can't just like buy Spot and sell Futures uh because they're worried they're G to get taken out by the SEC all of that's over like gensler's gonna get fired on day one it's over like it's literally this is a paradigm shift the the Donald Trump ran on a hashtag pump your bags platform and you know he at least last time he kind of followed through on some of his promises it it would be weird if he suddenly just decided to go anti- crypto at this point like we basically have to bet so I I'm a little different than you I it's it's good on you to pick bottoms with leverage that's a very dangerous game for me I pick I like I this is kind of my first time using decent leverage in crypto usually I use it in Commodities but when when I use leverage it's to it's to express a view when I think that the underlying asset is going to perform very smoothly with a high sharp and low volatility and I think that Bitcoin fits that description right now like I think that sure you can probably get higher absolute returns investing in Doge or investing in something else being very active paying short-term capital gains tax but if you just want to sit on your hands and hold something for a year the absolute best like p&l per unit of volatility return your best sharp ratio is going to be in Bitcoin um I don't think they're going to be very big draw Downs at this point and so I think it's okay to lever up a little bit now like I think we I think we should all feel some like feel like we have permission to expect the market to Rally gradually or even rapidly and steadily primarily because um this new regulatory Paradigm in this new set of you know Congressional members is is kind of going to attempt to create for crypto which is hasn't existed and there's so much potential under the surface Obi like there's so much there's so much value to be unlocked here also like it you know I remember you said something very powerful that resonated with me when we first started doing our podcast you said you know I've been in crypto since I think it was 2017 or 16 you said that you said like I've been told that I that crypto is a scam every single year except 2021 and then in 2022 you were told it was a scam again I've experienced the same I've either been in crypto and been told that I'm working on a scam or been kind of on the outside looking in thinking it's a scam for every single year except 2021 and for the very first time uh since 2021 it feels like crypto is not a scam anymore it it feels like crypto will be accepted by the broader Community as something legitimate because the United States will kind of bless it right and I think that more than anything is a a big deal yeah I couldn't said it better myself this is this is probably the first time that crypto is going to be considered not a scam and it's not going to Mark like the crazy A crazy top yeah because it's really like we've reached the point now where the sitting president of the United States of America has hinted at creating a strategic Bitcoin Reserve has spoken at Bitcoin conferences went to a Bitcoin bar has made a transaction with Bitcoin launched a defi project launched launched a defi project I mean guys this is unbelievable in 2017 I remember seeing Bitcoin on the front page of the Wall Street Journal and thinking to myself oh my God we've made it because it was on the front page of the Wall Street Journal in in 2035 you're right Sky Jones maybe we do have a strategic moodang Reserve maybe we do it's possible it's not improbable even it's very improbable but you know but that was fun to say uh look yeah I mean let let's talk let's talk for a second about what a strategic Bitcoin Reserve would mean just like let me quickly explain this again I I love Commodities Bitcoin is a commodity a stre strategic reserve for an asset is important because it serves more than just a monetary purpose it's not just meant to pump the price it's meant in case of emergency and if if Donald Trump follows through on this promise to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve it basically lends Credence to the idea that Bitcoin is non-sovereign global Reserve currency grade money of the same caliber as gold and that in an emergency where God forbid the dollar is degraded or God forbid um our trading partners no longer want to use the dollar we as a nation do not lose our our sort of potency we don't lose our International clout we have something that we can fall back upon similar to you know a military scenario where God forbid like uh the Middle East doesn't want to ship us any oil anymore we have this ocean of oil sitting in caverns and storage tanks that we can use to fuel our planes and tanks and missiles so like it basically if this happens it says that it says that Bitcoin should eat market share from the dollar the Euro the pound um the Yen the onean and at that point like you know if we're talking about thing like the things you can count on one hand that send Bitcoin to a million dollars a token immediately it's like Bitcoin becomes a global Reserve currency like hydrocarbons get transacted in Bitcoin like million dollars a token overnight and so on sentiment alone it should go there that's why I think it's so important and it's like it went from like a five Delta to a or or like a one Delta to a 50 Delta in the last eight months six months it's it's genuinely it's genuinely unbelievable and man this is this is just so much so much fun I'm not GNA lie like this is just so much fun to imagine a scenario where that happens I mean look Bitcoin we all know what the benefits of this thing are right this is what it was destined to be if it was going to work this is this is kind of how it had to go right yeah and so when I look at what's actually been accomplished it kind of feels like a simulation sometimes because everything just worked out kind of perfectly for Bitcoin and what think is very likely to happen over the next four years is if there's even a hint that we're taking this strategic Reserve seriously if there's even a hint other countries are going to move on it it's not just going to be you know you know the United States is actually in my opinion if it if it does get established if the Strategic Reserve actually gets established the United States is unlikely to be the first because what's going to happen is that other countries are going to see that the United States is doing it they can move move more quickly and then they will do it yeah right and so the way that I view this is by the time the United States announces it it's like a continuation of a trend and that's going to be that that's just going to be next level incredible and so yeah the the G the game theory exactly it's it's so it's so favorable towards towards BTC like you kind of you know there's very little downside to starting it for a smaller country if you have like a 25% chance in your mind that that the US is gonna that the us is going to start it because also you it's like you adopting it and your friends adopting it it's gonna make it more likely for the US to adopt it right it's like oh yeah right it's like it's it's literally one big Ponzi that's gonna last yeah it's the ultimate meme coin so like maybe maybe what you do is you have like 50 to 80% of your portfolio in Bitcoin until it hits 100K and then the uh you scale out as it gets there and then what you do with the proceeds is like you have some in salana some in ethereum some in meme coins and then um I really like your thesis about how these SEC lawsuit coins are going to pump like they've already pumped a lot but they're coming off with some pretty abysmal lows imagine if Trump shows up on day one pardons Ross alri then suddenly just like installs a new SEC chairman within the first six months the new SEC chairman immediately ends the lawsuits against Unis swap coinbase Cumberland like name your company that they've just gone and sued like all these lawsuits are just a complete waste of taxpayer money hundreds of millions of dollars are getting paid out to lawyers in Washington DC for absolutely no reason like as soon as the market catches on to the fact that that's literally about to happen I think all of these coins are going up another 300% right um xrp even like I I don't it it does definitely feel like we could be in for one of those those like nonsensical crypto rallies and some of these coins that like that are being that have been beaten down for SEC reasons now obviously you're going to like to your to your point You're Gonna Want to get out uh like you're not going to want to sit in those things when they have like you know $50 billion dollar valuations but um for a trade those might be great pumps to ride yeah yeah I mean this is this is going to be a time where you just kind of need to stare at your screens stare at deck screener taking all the right information be in the right group chats discuss with people just kind of sit in front of your computer and do nothing other than stare at the markets because you can make millions and millions of dollars how much of your trading capital is on Chain versus on a centralized exchange this is something that I'm not really good at yet like I I have most of it on a centralized exchange right now because I'm not M coining yeah it's kind of like I I I just have like a slightly different situation where most of my capital is is on exchanges like yeah trading it um but I have like a non-trivial portion of that capital on chain as well at probably about 15% because the way that the way that I have you know on chain and that actually grew from that that actually grew substantially because of Geo so i i i aped i aped a lot of Geo and that that's done nicely um and I also yeah anyway so that so that was good I aped Geo and then sold it for a 20% loss because I was like I don't this one doesn't resonate with me good job holding on to it yeah I mean that that was that was I still think that's like a billion dollar coin but you know I'm I'm I'm also kind of delusional you're also Asian right it's just something you can relate to more than me kind of not really not I'm not that I'm not that kind of asan but anyway it's uh you know it's there're the way that I view the way that I view onchain for me is that I use it just to ape like really small cat meme coins and then just hold them and forget about them for a long period of time and then hopefully they do really well that's my onchain strategy which is very different from a lot of people's onchain strategy where like people will actively trade on Hy you know on things like hyper liquid d DX like people will have like a substantial portion of the trading stack on you know like on chain uh and people will also be running different types of strategies on chain you know they might even buy you know they might even trade e on chain you know for example like a like a thing like Nero that has done very well today a lot of people might have bought that might have bought that on chain so but my my wallets are almost exclusively uh for just things under like 50 million market cap okay so basically you're you're in it to like invest in it's like a it's like a perverse VC style investing uh Casino thing that you have going on you're basically just buying low market cap coins and then recycling gains into new low market cap coins on chain and then on centralized exchanges you're doing what I'm doing which is basically like okay the opportunity is here invest all right uh things looking toppy move into something with higher opportunity and if I can't think of anything like rotate it all back into Bitcoin because literally like do not have $1 doll in Fiat right now of your your crypto allocation this is just too good well one one thing that I'll say is that I think it's it's like really easy to lose money when your money is everywhere and that's why I don't love onchain um in terms of just repeat that everybody needs to hear what you just said that is so true I'm GNA take it is really easy it's really easy to lose money when your money is everywhere because there's just like a lot there's just like a lot of mental friction like for example if you use Robin Hood and Fidelity and coinbase and like you have 13 wallets and some is on salana and like some some is on this chain and that chain like you just end up forgetting about things and you end up not managing all of your trades effectively and like everyone but the few most disciplined people on the planet that like go check everything every day and like monitor everything every day you just end up forgetting about things and missing opportunities and losing money that's what I do I check everything every day and I maintain a Google spreadsheet and update the parts of it manually that I can't update automatically and that's like I read every single email and telegram message that I get like I'm one of those people I'm I'm OCD basically I'm OCD yeah but like most people like most people don't do that and like even even like the highly disciplined people like I will forget like I I did it last uh last cycle because I probably owned like 350 coins and it was like really hard to keep up on things so you know it's like you know Focus right keep keep thing just keep keep things focused and during and during bull markets it's very easy to feel like you're keeping things focused and then after like two weeks you kind of just you know because your friend message you this so you buy that thing and then you read about this and then you go buy that thing and then you have to go this chain you have to go to that chain so you know just you know be focused right try try to try not to spread yourself out too much um or if you do spread yourself out like just remember that unless you're very diligent you're going to end up losing money there's no point of spreading yourself out unless literally you're running a portfolio of um like VC style bets like if you're just like holding a bunch of call options or throwing spaghetti at the wall or pick your analogy then it's okay to have a bunch of different tokens but I think once you're once you're past 100 to 200 million market cap you should not have more than 10 coins yeah I I would agree with you um I don't know is there anything uh anything that the crowd wants to ask us like what else is going on talk about peanut dude I do oh that's a good one I love peanut I I I think I think I think peanut I think peanut is like the perfect combination of political meme animal meme I love peanut like everything like I think it's just I think it's just perfect um I don't I actually do not own any I need to me neither I just I think it's a great meme I I feel a little too like peanut and goat are my two favorites right now I think I can I can totally resonate with them goat goat just ripped again um yeah this is why you want to have capital on chain like if if I had a bunch of geeko which I don't I would be selling some to buy peanut and goat here here's what I like you know honestly I'm a lifelong Democrat who obviously got a little bit red pilled through the crypto World um one thing that I love about this Trump win and since we're talking about peanut I feel like I can bring this up if you're in crypto if you're a crypto Trader doesn't it feel like you've been a little bit gas lit for the last four years like you're participating in some underground uh ter terrorist economy of grifters and and crime like that's what everybody's sort of branded our industry as and now that it's not that anymore I think just that alone that alone will bring in investment and I think that um some of the memes like peanut are kind of an outlet for that I don't know that angst that you know I the the image behind me is from the Sha Shank Redemption the guy obviously gets his has his moment at the end of the the difficult period in his life and I I honestly think that Us in the crypto space we've been through a rough few years you know if you'd invested at the Pico top of 2021 and held on which many people didn't you at at best broken even right so now is kind of the time where people are starting to feel a bit Vindicated and I think that like the peanut meme kind of kind of encapsulates that Zeitgeist you know that's why I like it yeah yeah I mean I like it because it's a squirrel but like you like it I mean that that yeah that makes sense bro but like it's also just like a squirrel that got murdered by the Democrats so I mean that's just kind of a yeah but when the squirrel gets murdered like by the Democrats you what's going through your mind when you click by is what I just articulated even though he's you know at on the surface of it it's a cute squirrel I think we're we're talking about two different layers of the very same onion ABI that's my point I I I agree I'm trying to find the address for this thing so I can just go e some peanut I feel like it's big enough that I can talk you know what this is a live stream we don't have to be super structur I'm going to buy some [ __ ] peanut right here yeah I'm going to buy some peanut give me that give me that peanut no give me no you you [ __ ] give me that peanut peanut that's that's what I'm talking about I I gotta go I gotta go to dinner in like five minutes I forgot about that dinner meaning you have to you have to move more funds on chain to buy more peanut okay well have a nice dinner wherever you are I know what you're gonna be doing I I'm I'm in Puerto Rico because I own well anyway I have I have property here and it's like really difficult to manage if you're not here every once in a while so like for example my like the I'm trying to rent this place out and the showers don't have hot water so I'm trying to figure figure that out so that when I rent it to somebody they don't call me in three weeks and tell me that there's no hot water anyway not crypto not and not your problem but sounds like you need to sell some of that geeko and get get a guy like you need a guy if you have real EST estate I like I do I do that that's the issue oh like you're getting taken okay fair enough no no no no no like I I I wish I I wish you experienced what I'll give you um like I the issue the issue with Puerto Rico is I I'll end with a story for you so like three years ago because I used to live here I don't live here anymore I was getting a generator installed for the house and so I call up the generator company and I say hey I need this specification of generator can you install it in the in the house and can you install it here I picked that an Nara for you so it's all good like they come over they look they're like yep we have it give me six weeks I'll install it no problem done so five weeks later I decide because it's like a it's like a week before so I call them up and I say hey so you guys ready in a week you're GNA go install that generator and they go oh oh that generator that gener that you already paid for that is supposed to be installed there yeah we don't have that anymore because we installed it somewhere else and that was our last one and I'm like wait I'm like wait wait a second the generator that I paid for that you said that you were going to install that you said like you SED me for it's no longer there and you don't have any other generators on the entire Island and the guy goes yeah sorry that supplier is out and so I asked a very simple question I said do you have any suppliers and the guy goes oh yeah I do hangs up calls me back in 15 minutes and says oh we found a generator from other other suppliers oh okay well thank you for suggesting it um listen why did I have to suggest to him to call another supplier it makes you feel any better AI I've the I've experienced the exact same story as you for my place in La except replace the word generator with fence or you know Iron Gate or metal aluminum steel gate whatever it is uh and the end of my story is sad because the guy didn't uh end up finding another source of metal he just disappeared Into The Ether so may I humbly suggest paying half half now half later the next time you uh yeah yeah that's better um well as Traders we're so transactional like we're used to stuff happening quick right like we don't like to we we don't want to like haggle with with people but most that's how the world Works outside of FYI for for anyone I think people are talking about this that there's no cap gains tax in Puerto Rico blah blah blah this good tax benefits I lived here for three and a half year almost four years I loved Puerto Rico I loved being a citizen um obviously saved saved a ton of money but I ultimately had to make a hard choice to move back to New York just because I My Philosophy is just make more money make make more money like like just make more money like if if you're if you're moving somewhere to save on taxes don't just make more money I'm all I'm all about a tax tax move for short period like small periods of your life but just like permanently relocating yourself to a Haven if you don't want to be there seems weird I think I think that's that that's a better way of saying it is like yeah yeah just you know there's no reason to move somewhere unless you like really have a strong view that the next year two three four years of your life you're going to make like a ridiculous amount of money otherwise just you know live live where it makes you happy yeah where where makes you happy Ali it's a good question uh honestly I I do I do love PR not I'm not going to lie um now more more than I did before because I got like into water sports and whatnot and started like off-roading which is really fun what's your like an ATV or do you just use your like a four-wheeler like I have a Bronco super fun that's awesome I love the Bronco what's this hold on one second dude peanut Peanut's ripping ever since we mentioned are we do we count as micro influencers none of this is financial advice we don't know what we're talking about we're talking about a freaking peanut coin don't listen I don't know if I don't know if I can sell Geo for this Geo looks like it's about to rip but don't I'm not g I'm not gonna buy that one I'm not gonna buy that come back in come it's a good it's a good cat it's a very good cat it's asky art it's like little text Art but it's a it's like like the Hello Kitty you been to Japan have you been to the the one of the maid cafes kind of reminds me of that anyway okay anyway I gotta roll love you Jonah love you buddy uh congrats on Surviving this not not Financial advice uh stay stay safe you all and do your own research good talking to you Obby bye later [Music]

Transcript Text:
all right we're live everybody welcome back to another episode of a THX uh the usuals are back myself and Obi Felman here uh and we are joined by Will Clemente uh co-founder of reflexivity research and a very big name on crypto Twitter we are thrilled to have you will um thank you very much for joining thanks for having me guys I listened to the show every single week so it's great to be on I apologize I can't show my beautiful face to the listeners but unfortunately my my WiFi is equivalent to a potato right now I'm running on that helium Wi-Fi so we uh we'll see if maybe I can get the camera on at some point but it it seems to be like a disease that this podcast inflicts upon guests and hosts alike just terrible Wi-Fi and internet problems Jonah would wouldn't you think given this is a crypto podcast if bitcoin's above 70k everybody can afford a good internet connection can afford a good camera I don't know I don't know what it is but I'm gonna take what I can get because like frankly it's nice that will Clemente is Will Clemente and not an a non like what I as a non an non like what what is so Mis what do you need to hide about your crypto trading habit it's not that dark like Anyway will thank you for being you and and uh and showing up here you do you want to tell us a little bit about how you got into crypto and how you ended up becoming like the Michael Jackson of crypto Twitter I I don't know if uh I I would say all that but yeah I could I could give a little high high level background um I and we we can get to the the uh doxing part and and kind of the pros and and cons to that because i' I've kind of found it that you know goes goes both ways um originally got into the space at the beginning of 2020 so if if I guess we take a little bit of a further step back at the end of 2019 you know I was in college um I needed some like beer money in between semesters I was working an overnight stocking job at uh the arts and craft store called called Michaels some people like the east coast of of the US may be familiar with this store I come in at like two or three in the morning um you know brutal shift there's like three other people there tend to get some interesting people that you aren't you know having the greatest of conversations with because it's like the night shift at Michael's um and so I was losing my mind you know it's like eight eight or nine hours overnight and I'm coming in at 3: in the morning leaving at like 10:00 you know unload the truck all you know whatever and and stock everything so I started listening to podcast um at the beginning you just like brain rot like Joe Rogan conspiracy theory stuff and I was you know maybe I try to learn a few things U maybe I make a couple dollars I started listening to just like generic investing stuff so you know started with all the Warren Buffett you know value investing um shout out to this guy named Preston pitch he runs this podcast called we study billionaires so I literally just started at the first podcast listened all the way up to episode like 100 150 or something um kind of fell down you know fell in love with how how a lot of people do with a lot of the traditional value investing stuff you know Phil Fischer Ben Graham all those guys I've got this big fat security analysis book behind me on my shelf which is just a paper weight now um you know try to do many discount cash flow bottles you know at my desk in college um you know never never went anywhere and then very shortly after covid hit so you know obviously you know big draw down and all and all asset prices um during covid and then quite a quick recovery after and at the time I was very Bamboozled by you know why are asset prices going up but the economy seems to not be in such great shape kind of figured out okay all this stuff is just driven by you know liquidity and and the amount of monetary units in the system and then kind of came to the conclusion that the thing that you want to own in that environment is Bitcoin so you know the very small amount of money that I had at the time I just started putting everything into Bitcoin I then had transition from working at Michaels to then I was working at Target doing like the inore like uh shopping orders and so I would go around Target doing that fulfilling the orders listening to like Bitcoin and investing podcasts and then I started as I was like DCA my very small size into Bitcoin um I was just you know started tweeting about my thoughts about Bitcoin so I think I got on on bitcoin Twitter crypto Twitter uh was like June or July of 2020 and um you know it was just like relentlessly bull posting wasn't saying anything that was like that groundbreaking but I think people were like oh this this dude's a kid and you know it's cool that he's saying some of the stuff that everybody else is saying and he's young or whatever um coinbase just sorry I was looking at coinbase earnings that just came through um which continued to just you know post on post on Twitter um you know started to the account started to blow up I put out an article about why Bitcoin was like a great you know macro you know asset uh debasement hedge uh that started to get picked up by a couple people in like kind of the the Bitcoin Maxi Circle um that guy press the pit I mentioned um gave me some love early on and then um Anthony papano Pop um he asked me to come on his on his podcast had like 5,000 followers or something went on basically like gave the the Bitcoin thesis um kept you know basically putting out a bunch of content and then you know obviously Bitcoin went from you know 8K to like 60 to 65k and within like a matter of months you know as soon as I had gotten on Twitter so you I had like some great Tailwinds for the account um and then towards kind of the back half of the year into 2021 I started thinking okay you know I think I kind of have the the big picture of what's going on here you know just in terms of debasement driving Bitcoin and like you know this thing is clearly here to stay um then started to think about you know how how can I kind of a little more tactically maneuver and and and maybe make some some money in this market so you know lost lost a ton of money at the beginning trying to trade my own pa um you know still still figuring it out today you know we're not talking about that much that much long ago um through 2021 you know ate some glass I'm sorry through 2022 at ate some glass obviously you know trying to trying to trade as as the market um just proceeded to go down only um and then towards the back half of 2022 um decided to Launch reflexivity which is uh the research firm that I'm still helping out with we recently got acquired back in February uh but launched the research firm with with poomp um the kind of thought process there was really just you know we had kind of a a competitive Advantage I felt like in terms of the distribution of the two of us and kind of the the social presence um you know was able to kind of utilize that to you know build some early Partnerships and um eventually you know buil built the firm out had a couple great you know early early analysts so you know f j who who's now at blockworks one of my one of my favorite macro guys um found him early on he had like this Banger Banger thread uh that like brought a bunch of of eyeballs to his account um so we brought him on he was like a contractor for us doing some macro work um noer who Oba I know you're very familiar with really smart guy around around my age as well um and so I think you know the firm became pretty well known for putting out some some decent you know thought leadership work and then um you know work with a ton of the the crypto protocols uh as well as we we launched an event buiness earlier this year um like I mentioned got acquired back in February so you know still fairly you know involved with the business making sure that everything's you know running dayto day um but yeah other you know that's how we got also you know just generally kind of managing my own money in the background as well that's awesome uh thank you that's awesome just uh jinx sorry yeah thanks thanks I I took over a little bit of stuff I try to keep it pretty concise no it was good it was good I think I think it's a good good background one thing that I always found interesting about the way that you came into crypto is I mean you're pretty young um you're probably the only person like under the age of 30 at this point that got into Bitcoin first so I feel like everyone else that got into crypto got into altcoins that like at least on the younger side and you normally see the coin Maxi side is like the guys that got in in 2013 or sort of older more conservative people so you started off just basically only BTC if I if I remember correctly yeah c can you tell me a little about that I mean obviously you must have given the time that you got in you must have been exposed to altcoins but what why did you end up just focusing so heavily on BTC yeah it's it's funny I mentioned fou um you know obviously we've become pretty good friends and this is something that we relate to each other on because he was also kind of originally in the value investor kind of bucket which I think kind of goes to show you that there's there's something to be said about you know understanding the way that investing is supposed to be when you have the correct cost of capital and you know all this stuff is in a wonky World post 2008 because of all the you know all the inherent uh you know manipulation that's taking place within our our monetary system um that's messed up the way that you know invest has has worked and the way that that markets have moved um I think when you come from the perspective of this is you know how investing is supposed to work then you understand why it isn't that way and then you come to the conclusion of okay well you know all this stuff is messed up because of all the you know Shenanigans around you know going off monetary policy and then you come to the conclusion of this is why I want to hold hold Bitcoin but I'd say where I kind of midc curved it early on and this is kind of my my bone to pick if you will with a lot of the the Bitcoin Maxes I think a lot of them are you know they they mean well and you know obviously I was originally in that camp of like everything but but Bitcoin is a scam um I obviously no longer think that's the case like a lot of the stuff is is you know not not worth anything um but even if you do um the same you know kind of properties of of what what takes place that would be conducive for Bitcoin to do well over a perhaps you know decade two decade uh you know time Horizon are the same you know kind of uh thing things that you need for a kind of speculative Mania so like one of one of my favorite books about um you know just like crazy periods of of financial Financial turmoil is when money dies and it's about Yar Germany when the you know the mark basically went parabolically worthless and and had hyperinflation um everyone's probably seen the the chart of like the mark measured against against gold um obviously you know gold went to the moon in in Mark's terms but another aspect that's very very Loosely talked about or kind of like strategically not mentioned by a lot of the Bitcoin only crowd is that you also had this tremendous period of financial speculation and that's just a byproduct of you know wealth inequality people feel like they can't you know they can't get ahead you know the prices of everything is is is going up and obviously I'm not saying that we have hyperinflation in the US or I think that we will but um you know as people get further behind as you know wealth inequality increases which is driven by poor monetary policy and the people that own assets you know those assets continue to go up while the people who don't own assets continue to get further behind that type you know that that type of dynamic encourages more and more speculative behavior and so that was kind of the the moment for me where I said you know if I'm a little more cynical you know not only is this is the same thesis that you know I've applied to being bullish on bitcoin that that should also apply to a lot of the speculative activity within the kind of broader crypto Market as well I do think you know people are are generally trying to build good things and there are some interesting things going on but even if you were to take that out let's say it was like only meme coins and nothing else um I you know I still think the the same backdrop that's conducive for Bitcoin um should be conducive for alt and it took me a good kind of year and a half for for me to come to that conclusion that's a really interesting take um a couple of things to unpack there so the first thing is uh how you learned basically how to trade how to invest from podcasts uh that's that's something that I wish I'd had available to me when I was 19 I to picked up Benjamin gr's intelligent investor and it fried my brain after a couple of pages and I turned it into a paper weight but I couldn't like listen to an executive summary or hear it debated back and forth between you know people on Spotify back then so I kind of I kind of I don't know to me that that sort of hammers home the idea that Financial education is much easier to digest through podcasts than pretty much any other format so Shameless plug for everybody out there keep listening to the Thousand X podcast uh and podcasts like us I I I really appreciate hearing that um also appreciate that you listen to ours one other thing that you said that that interested me was that value a value investing framework helped you and basically hold on to bitcoin which I thought was interesting because most value investors I talk to thinks that think that Bitcoin produces no income so it's worth zero dollars a token so it should go to zero but I think what you probably did was you probably took that value investing framework assigned some really high value to bitcoin because you saw it as digital gold before the rest of the world did and then you know ultimately the real the real juice in the value investing framework that Ben Graham and Warren Buffett set forth is basically the idea that you should ride a trade until it converges to your your perception of fair value so I when I was your age I was like well I was a little older than you actually when I was younger I I would like buy Facebook for $19 a share sell it at $30 a share and high five myself for making 50% on my trade I would never like think that that this could happen so yeah I mean in the spirit of riding trades what other you know you mentioned you're you're now not really a maximalist anymore what are some of the other spaces or sectors tokens or things that you're applying this mentality to and you know where are you riding the tiger basically yeah for sure um I just want to before before we move on on the first point um you know totally agree OB obvious mentioned on the Pod before I think especially in in crypto there's just such an openness to share insights with people that you don't know and and reveal some of your Edge to to people that you don't know and so you know I think getting being active on Twitter having somewhat of a degree of being able to filter out you know total Lars and people who like halfway know what they're talking about um you know I kind of use Twitter as like a screening tool to an extent um you know podcasts going back to to 2021 you know up only was was lovely and I religiously would listen to like every episode of that I think this podcast is kind of taken up only spot as like the the premier trading podcast that everybody's listened to but um you know also just getting active in TG and like building a group of of friends to kind of navigate the markets with um I totally agree I think the the ease of of access to information is greater than ever just broadly for almost any discipline outside of like may maybe like engineering or something in like the medical field especially with with trading but or or investing but that that's Amplified even more so I think in crypto um yeah to to go on to the the second question I think there's there's a couple plays that are that are have been and continue to be quite obvious to me going back towards the middle of last year um you know some of these are probably not going to be that controversial you know the first is salana Right Sal has just been the barometer for all the activity going on you know with meme coins and and all speculation there um I also just think you generally have this kind of like cyclicality that's embedded into the the people that are par ipating in crypto's minds and so I think salana is the E of last cycle has very much been ingrained into a lot of people's brains and you know being kind of in the camp of reflexivity I think you know if you just look at the soul e chart it's just the momentum is too far gone at this point I'm not saying that Soul can't go up but I I think it you know I don't see any logical explanations as to as to why Soul won't continue to outperform e um so like a lot um I've been pretty vocal about coinbase from from kind of late last year so I I went pretty long you know like longer longer duration calls on coin around like 70 uh in October of last year and and still kind of hold the the thesis which I did then which is basically that I think coinbase is generally kind of the Venture style play uh very similar I guess probably the the most Venture style play in public market since maybe Tesla like 10 years ago just because they're launching several different verticals within the business that didn't exist in in 2021 that they really kind of laid the groundwork for throughout the bare Market of of 2022 into 2023 um you know I think Bas is a great example it would be interesting to to hear the earnings call after we we get off of this in a bit um and hear maybe they're they're touting base pretty hard but now that seems to be kind of the Premier e eel to um so you know that the the uh custody stuff um you know their stake in circle there's the wallet as a service and there's several this baking stuff there's several different uh kind of verticals within the business that kind of have slowly Diversified it away from just being an exchange U and now I think you can kind of see it as somewhat of a kind of crypto super app if you will or somewhat of an indexation type of play on the on the broader crypto space excluding Bitcoin um I also like microsof strategy um I I like him even more after sailor just said he's going to buy $42 billion of Bitcoin I I haven't looked into that or or what what that even means so maybe OB you you've looked while bit on this but um I I think I think the thing with well I mean I I can tell you I can tell you mic strategies down a lot after hours because obviously this this means that Stock's going to hit the market right like he basically sells sells NCR to buy BTC it's what it's effectively what he does and so right I think the prei the premium I mean the premium should converge a lot if he's announcing this is his plan but we've all said that before because he's tried I mean he he's basically done this in smaller size and the premium just stays where it is which is kind of interesting um so I don't I don't I I don't know how I feel about mstr I think go it's funny going into the ETF it was such a consensus play I mean I I believe that too that the mstr premium would shrink and it just hasn't it just blown out just keeps going up it's like one of the one of the Mysteries of the market I think it's like this positioning thing where I was uh we had Quinn Thompson our crypto investor we talked about this on on this on the last panel of the day um it's one of those things where the premium in a lot of people's eyes shouldn't exist and so therefore you have a lot of these trafy funds they're going to come in and short mstr long BTC and keep getting blown out and so I think you may have this Dynamic where people kept keep keep trying to you know step in and basically play that convergence and then perpetually keep getting blown out so I think there's some kind of positioning stuff there that makes mstr pretty interesting um but regardless you know it's they're basically a you know kind of leveraged yield generating ETF and then you you get kind of these you know positioning targeting shenanigans that maybe are sprinkled on top so I I like mstr as well um and then hold on hold on quick question on that I haven't done the work on mstr but to me it looks like another financially engineered um gbtc like equities phenomenon where there's just this lurking risk that I don't know how to quantify or understand just anywhere where there's a premium and un like locked BTC that you can't really redeem as a shareholder like are you at all worried about that or should should am I just being irrational here they can't keep issuing Equity if there's no longer a premium right because basically what sailor's doing is you know anytime it trades above the value of Bitcoin he just dilutes the shares back to whatever the par value should be um with BTC we we did a deep dive into like the debt structuring of of micr straty I haven't looked in a long time I I don't own micro strategy but I I do generally like it um we did a deep dive back at the end of 2022 when everybody was saying that sailor was going to get liquidated we basically said the only debt that was at risk was the silvergate loan and he ended up actually making making money on that um so I think I think the way that the you know the debt structured out as long as obviously you know the the software business is able to keep paying the the debt payments and they're they're fine so I guess you know technically have risk there but obviously if if Bitcoin keeps going up then it's fine um yeah the other the other big one on the crypto Equity side has just been a lot of these miners that are transitioning to AI stuff so you know obviously with the build out of AI infrastructure people need power and a lot of these Bitcoin miners have not been doing well not generating a lot of shareholder value and a lot of cases just diluting their shareholders into Oblivion so you know I think a lot of these a lot of these Bitcoin miners are becoming very compelling um in terms of kind of a play on on AI stuff um you know we've talked about wolf before in the in the Nigerian Delta Avengers group chat um make sure you're you're in there if you're not uh obious shared a very very detailed thesis I I didn't do daily as much work on the play as him I just rotated all of my my coin calls from last October into into wolf like 420 or 430 and that that's done done nicely so far but a lot of the other ones look nice as well and then I don't know if we're able to screen share but if you just pull up a lot of the the charts for some of these some of these Bitcoin Miners and a lot of these or a lot of these look pretty crazy on you know weekly monthly time frames yeah I I I really I and I still like I still like wolf a lot I'll say that the the wolf thesis for me it hinged more I mean my my analysts did a lot of work on it uh and came came to realize that just what there's a very specific site that was being underappreciated on Wolf which I just think is like part for the course for miners in general people just don't study them enough and don't actually understand their businesses enough there just isn't you know a tremendous amount of coverage especially if the lower market cap ones on Wall Street and so you end up with situations where you know you have a site that you're building out that's going to add you know it's going to double or triple Your Capacity to my Bitcoin and that's just not priced in and that's kind of what's happening with um and I think that generally that's my play when it comes to crypto equities is look for things that people have overlooked um because I think if if you're looking for beta you can look in just crypto in general uh to to get to get beta I mean maybe maybe you just want to keep money in a brokerage but at least with miners it's about F finding those specific specific edges which is why I still I still like wolf a lot because because if you know you found a specific Edge in Wolf because I do think across the board mining is just such a tough business yeah it's just so it's just so cyclical and also it's almost they're they're only you know a few months uh at a time maybe a year where you actually end up really profitable as a minor and then everything just readjusts itself either because Bitcoin prices collapsed or a ton of new mining machines come online so you know it's just such such a business to hold these things long term you know it's funny when I was Mr oh sorry go ahead will no no I just G to say I think some of the the financing stuff that wasn't around in the 2017 cycle I think a lot of that took out maybe some of the capitalist cyclical nature of how Bitcoin mining and the cycle around it supposed to take place and the capitulation around inefficient Miners And I think there were there there's a lot of kind of excess that was able to stick around after the last bare Market that maybe maybe without the you know access to financing a lot of those firms maybe wouldn't have have made it through the bear so interestingly enough I in 2022 I was asked to speak when I was Mr White Collar professional crypto guy um and it was like my full-time job I got asked to go speak at the executive offsite of one of the major miners I'm not going to dox that particular Minor's name but basically I went and talked to them about my views about crypto and then I there was like Q&A where they were sort of explaining their strategy and I got a little Peak under the hood and what this is obviously one of the most successful miners if not for a while the most successful and what I what blew my mind was that basically the way that they deal with that cyclicality is essentially by accumulating gains from holding on to bitcoin not selling all of their Bitcoin essentially during those run-ups and then attempting to kind of lock in profits near local Peaks or tops and and then you know obviously on the way down they're financially buttressed because they've you know achieved greater returns from just riding the sort of upward waves than you know just constantly Mining and selling Mining and selling and when I heard that I was thinking to myself like okay you guys are obviously very good at this but you're valued like a like a stable business but you're actually a trading company and so if you invest and so at that point I was thinking like you know it's great to be them they get that richly valued stock but as an investor you're basically investing in a trading business with a trading business should be valued at like two three times earnings right but you're investing in a trading business at like I don't know where these things trade like 20 times earnings or something so to me I thought that just sounded like a bad investment now post AI you like they they B just open a new business line these guys so they can do the Bitcoin thing but also earn consistent money from you know whatever they're doing for AI demand and maybe it's a more Diversified better investment now back in the day though I just felt felt weird about it that's not to say that it isn't an incredible beta trade to crypto and obi's played that really well I just I couldn't wrap my head around it yeah um no I I generally agree I used to used to kind of think of Bitcoin miners as as just beta to BTC but toward towards the back half of last year they they very clearly weren't trading like that I think a lot of that was just the uh the miners just continued to to dilute shareholders so um I think I think the the green light for me uh kind of the the light bulb moment for for Wolf was I read this uh investment Bing report from uh caner Fitzgerald and they basically just looked at the multiples that were put on you know the the traditional Bitcoin miners valued as as Bitcoin Miners and then kind of compared that to some of these you know data centers that are being used for AI and so you know ju there there's a ray trade just for I think the transition of of you know how how the market is is pricing these things you know categorically um as you know an operating business so yeah that makes sense I mean I guess just pivoting to back to crypto for a second though like markets are getting interesting markets are getting about as spicy and exciting as they've been in what do you think Obby maybe since March uh February yeah I defin definitely since definitely since March I mean I was just reading the micro strategy announcement I mean this is pretty nuts 42 billion Capital PL there's so like I'm literally like offering oh and all is is it just like a Fluff headline or is there actually I mean that that's a little bit of what I'm trying to read read and figure out I mean but that that's what it says look it says uh it says announces a 21 billion at the market Equity offering which generally means that they're raising money to go ahead and buy BTC with that right I mean they want to raise the thing is they're they're announcing a strategic goal of raising 42 billion of capital over the next three years now here's the question uh do we know how much they've actually raised okay yeah so Q3 2024 they raised 2.1 billion right so they're really if you expect them to keep going at the rate that they're going uh they would raise 25 billion over the next three years so really what they're talking about is about a 100 you know a little bit less I guess an 80% increase in the pace of what they're already doing so you know you can basically say micro strategy is doubling the speed of their buying a Bitcoin that that's really what the announcement is it's it's big headline but that's really what the announcement is is we're doubling the pace of of buying BTC which at the margin should have an impact but the headline 42 billion I think sounds a lot more insane than actually when you when you think about it yeah makes I mean still they're doubling they're doubling the pace of buying their BTC that's pretty substantial um BTC probably I mean I I I've been I've been finally bullish for a bit um I think the biggest the biggest question which I'll pose to you will is of the Bitcoin that's been bought heading into the election uh how much of it is sticking around and how much of it is coming out yeah this is the whole like The Giver debacle from the last episode yeah I mean look I I tend to have a have a bit of a bullish bias when it comes to bitcoin um so keep keep that in mind when when it comes to some of these things if I'm being completely honest but I I I tend to think that on a net basis there's going to be more Capital that comes in and buys BTC on a on a trump headline because of kind of you know the the the Doge effect that as you mentioned just in terms of the you know him mentioning it but then that decays over time but then um I think more broadly just the perceived regulatory Clarity you know perceived decline in career risk that you know is brought on by the president and and and vice president both endorsing it relative to the amount of uh you know buying buying that's kind of come in and potentially selling the news so that that's kind of where I stand um I I don't really think the election entirely matters I mean there's probably you know like a bunch of maybe you know V hedging especially in equity that will will come off on the back side of the election that can fuel asset prices higher um even if Cala wins I think you know you get a dip on BTC maybe it you know flushes out some leverage and then you buy that ALS it's it's less clear but I'm not really concerned about BTC as it as you know pertains to the election I just think high level again you know I think I'm I'm a bit longer term you know in terms of how I position myself especially relative to U Obi so but you know I I I think regardless that the deficit widens you know no matter which of these two get in office and you know I think just the amount of people that are talking about the deficit as a Tailwind for asset prices is incredibly bullish for Bitcoin uh it's just been over the last two or three months especially you know ptj and and and and Dr coming on and and you know talking about basically you know shorting sovereign debt longing hard assets um and kind of the the you know and they sprinkled equities in there because you know they kind of have benefit from that that Tailwind as well I think that's tremendous tremendously bullish for for Bitcoin um I guess where where I'm a bit more stuck stuck up in kind of my thought process is as it pertains to alt um you know I I've I've kind of highlighted this on Twitter kind of three big categories of of assets that I liked two or three weeks ago one one was Bitcoin just as a debasement hedge um the second were these miners transitioning to the AI HPC stuff and those those kind of two subcategories have done quite nicely so far um there's the meme coin stuff too but that's just you know smaller portion of the portfolio you just kind of hold the assets that that you like um but then the the third the third big one has been I've liked alts especially some of these VC alts that have gotten beaten down and really hated heading into the election um my confidence has has definitely gone down on that just given the price action of how these things are trading with the election a couple days out um but you know I think some of the some of these assets that did quite well the back half of last year into q1 of of this year I mean you tend to get this thing where you know you you you get the assets that kind of you know moved on the on the first major move um you know at least in terms of Majors tend to kind of see follow-ups in the next leg up um so I I've been eyeing some of those things I I'm getting pretty close to my invalidation on on some of those assets um in particular Pia and and SE um we we've talked offline about the the T1 Obby and you know today's price action has been you know not not that surprising based on on the unlock taking place today but something like that you know I think you got to look at you know what's what's the OTC activity that's taking place you know how is it traded into the unlock like all those factors and and then you sprinkle on top of um on top of all that the price action from Bitcoin I'm leaning into the camp that I don't think that this is a super barish unlock um again I'm getting pretty close to my invalidation on on the idea but you know I I think that a lot of these things are probably trading higher in the next couple months I I think my my big controversial take if I were to have one because I don't think you know mentioning Bitcoin micro strategy salana or coinbase are like that controversial of takes I don't think that all of the VC alts are like entirely screwed um you know I'm obviously bullish on Meme coins I you know I'm not saying that Morad copied anything that I I said in the past but you know I was talking about a lot of these things you know months back in in March and and April um I went on Pomp's pod which maybe it's the last podcast that that I've done um and just talked about you know the bullish case for meme coins and I don't think they're going away I think there's a lot of valid arguments around you know obviously the uh you know the markups and the private side and you know the float Dynamics with all the all we've heard about all that stuff I think the big kind of uh you know um argument against this idea that none of the VC alts are going to do well is that you know people that are allocating Capital want to have a thesis even even if you know even if all these things you know I think with the l1s you can make a strong argument that you know some commodity money like properties of them just something like a soul or some of these some of these L1 tokens um but even even regardless of that you know I think people allocating Capital generally want to have some type of fundamental thesis that even if it isn't fully you know doesn't fully have Merit they want to feel like they have something to hold on to to sleep at night that kind of gets them through the volatility and you know I think I think there'll be a lot of guys that are around my age that maybe you know have money to to just mess around with that are GNA you know punt mem coins and just buy and hold meme coins that that 100% is going to take place but I also think there's going to be a good chunk of you know new new people that that on board that are going to come in and say hey I I want to have some type of thesis whether it's you know network activity of whatever you know token that this is associated with or some type of you know story that I can paint to say okay this this is why I'm justifying holding this thing over the next you know three to six months yeah I mean I think that's that's a great point and your your whole sleep at night uh heuristic for why somebody would want to hold a token is it's really important right and I think that that's why people feel comfortable investing in l1s well we don't even need to make the case for Bitcoin that's obvious but like Ethan salana you know you you kind of I if you have if if you're younger than 30 and you believe that decentralized Computing is going to exist in one form or another sometime in the future like you can definitely sleep at night holding ether salana like that's definitely going to be the commodity base layer for all of you know for the out for some sort of application stack someday in the future I think the problem with altcoins that are a little bit further out the risk curve than Ethan salana is that you know it's like how do you sleep at night holding one of these coins with a a high fdv and a low float like wondering whether it's even going to be legal or not and I think the the whole the whole altcoin uh thesis behind you know maybe a trump Victory would be if Trump wins crypto becomes legal right now it's kind of illegal you know like I I'm borrowing words from uh from chiefing Za friend of the Pod he he he said that not me but it's sort of true right like Trump wins crypto legal crypto legal apps on crypto legal it's really like I wonder if it's more complicated than that so obviously you have to pick and choose much like meme coins right you can't buy everything that comes out of pump. fun but um you know certain certain things maybe helium we we joke about it all the time on the Pod but maybe things like that deepin um you know maybe a uh there there are a few of these things that'll just you know as soon as they're allowed to eat the markets that they've basically already disrupted they just will and then then you're looking at some pretty insane valuations um I don't know I I'm too I I'm too nervous to catch a falling knife in that sector I lack the confidence so I'd rather just sort of like wait to buy stuff on the way up like I'll be I'm if Trump wins I'm going to be like pretty locked in in December watching what outperforms and buying the highs for a momentum trade in a couple of different crypto assets what do you think yeah yeah I think kind of you know I mentioned I'm getting pretty close to my invalidation I would say you know I guess I will call out my exact invalidation based on price but on like a more qualitative basis I think if these things if Trump wins which I'm in I'm in the camp that he wins I think maybe there's like a a micro bubble in Trump winning expectations and they've got a little ahead of themselves but I I think he's going to win um if these things continue to trade you know as as weak as they have been you know after the election then I probably cut all this stuff and that that' probably be my my invalidation there but I I'm I'm I'm with you I I don't think uh I don't think it makes sense to hold a lot of the stuff if if Trump doesn't get elected I also don't know you know if Trump gets in if these things have sustained moves but I I would suspect that you probably get a good multi-week trade in a lot of Al um you know on the on the back half of that just because they've gotten beaten down so poorly um I think you know there's there's a good amount of shorts built up on on some of these things and on a relative basis I I think they're they're fairly under owned but by no means am I am I [ __ ] on the the meme coin thesis because I have a decent mem coin allocation myself yeah I mean I I'll just Echo that statement right there which is that all Al alt are primed I think you have to think about the psychology of why they're not moving as hard right now and it's because bitcoin's about to do one of two things it's about to break out of a range that it's been in for eight months in which case it probably has a pretty significant and quick move to the upside and when that happens it sucks liquidity out of the system or bitcoin's going to break down from the high of this range and probably not going to fall to 70k but probably fall to back down to 65 which is a reasonably significant move so what am I trying to say I'm trying to say that this area is a pretty unstable price alts do best a when Bitcoin ranges at a good price that people feel safe right that's why alts can actually and I'm not Bitcoin doesn't even need to be necessarily a high price alts did really well when Bitcoin got above 60 it's just okay well we think now that bitcoin's above 60 it's not going to go back below 60 for a while uh maybe it'll range here for a bit and that'll give time for alts to alt to go right now everyone's betting that bitcoin's going to make a really big move and so I don't think alts are going to do much until a big move happens but you know what has proved in to be the right move almost every time is the moment that Bitcoin puts in a fat candle like a 5% candle above the range 10% candle above the range and alts haven't moved you just start buying alts and then you wait a week and even if the like first two days are still bad for you by the end of the week all everything's up like 70% so that's that's my thought process behind uh you know p how how to buy alts and memes least I want to hear what memes will hold I like that thesis by the way aie I'm gonna I'm going to do that because I I'm wondering when to rotate and maybe you're right I was gonna wait for alss to make new highs and then just buy them but uh I like I like your way better will how do you invest in in memes yeah um yeah just to touch on the thing with Obby real quick I think one of the one of the most interesting charts to me is just looking at total minus B CC soul and eth market cap and it's pretty remarkable that you know Bitcoin is a hair away from all-time highs yet this is down 50% so I I'm I'm with Obi and I I think if Bitcoin puts in a god candle then you probably start to see a rotation to some of these things um on the meme side so I think there's kind of two ways to play the memes I think at this point you know I I agree with a lot of what Morad said in the sense of new memes are very tough because they don't have the price history and the distribution that's going to allow them to see these really crazy moves higher um so you generally want to look at memes that are that are older you know six six months or or older um I think if you just want exposure to memes and you know you don't really care just want you know exposure to the to the subcategory in your portfolio and you've got more size then you probably just buy the the giant winners um because they're probably just going to reflexively keep trending higher or the other way to to play them I think is just find things that you like and maybe you have somewhat of an edge if you're younger in in understanding culturally um so you know examples of this for me have been things like uh I've been pretty vocal on on Zin coin so you know I I Zen um originally you know bought bit bought Zen at at a million market cap just because I like sins and it's like a very culturally acceptable thing amongst people my age It's associated there's been this huge shift towards like based culture with people in their low 20s and so I think you know Zen is kind of an embodiment of that there's been some recent talk about now Tucker Carlson's got what did you say what culture based culture based culture yeah it's I explain it to the the olds like me just break it down I think I think I think it's just people have shifted more towards a lot of conservative values culturally you know we''ve had think the pendulum is just swung so far to one side that now it's starting to mean revert back the other way and so I think uh you know may maybe just like my micro bubble of people that I hang around but it seems like there's a big shift back in that direction um but yeah there's been people talking about um there's now this this pouch launch by Tucker Carlson and he was saying that Zen PMI donated to Democrats which isn't isn't true I I think that's that's an interesting uh kind of you know play on on the kind of cult rals I gu people manag another one is Giga you know that that's been shilled by Morad and obviously has done very well I think like the Giga Chad uh kind of me orients with with with people our age and that kind of that base culture and then the other one I like which I fumbled very very poorly was lock in um that's just to everybody my age says lock in I I tend to think that like MOG can MOG can do fine but like nobody my age really set and people the M people are like you know complete cult they like spam you on every post but nobody my age says MOG but everybody says lock in like you're like all right I got I got to lock in um so I like that one as well I originally I I bought a bunch of lock in at like 4 mil it ran to 20 and then I puked it as it rolled over it went down 80% and then of course after it went down 80% proceeded to run up like 50x to where it is now um but even though I I don't hold any I'm not a salty bagas Bas holder so I I still supporting that that me as well I like it um but yeah I I I like the memes that I feel like I can resonate with because I feel like I have an edge in being able to identify them I I think this is going to sound a little wonky but I think people who are generally younger and grew up on social media um you know things things like you know especially like fine you know rest in peace toine or or Instagram um uh you know you have to really you have to really be aware of a lot of these social trends because they they turn very quickly and so I think you know by people people in my gener I every generation like has sayings and phrases and things like this but I think like the mtic cultural aspect of it is even more relevant with with younger people and so I think you've kind of had to have to kind of like develop this eye for for that type of stuff um so I think younger people probably have a bit more of an edge in in kind of ID identifying these things the other reason why and maybe I'm biased uh I like memes that I think people around my age will will resonate with is because I think like guys who are you know 18 to 25 are probably going to have more money than any other subcategory of of younger people that are punting memes and you know these are guys maybe like frat dudes or like people you know on investment banking Investment Banking desks um you know tra trading floors um that I think are going to probably be more apt to like punt some some decent size money of five or 10 grand or something into me so that's why I like them as well pretty solid framework I um you know it's funny you mentioned MOG yeah so all all the I guess I guess what really caught me about that was invest in the memes that resonate with you like I've only made money on one meme but I did really well on it it was Bowden and that's kind of a meme that appeals to people like me right and like slightly older people I don't understand the whole Giga Chad based culture stuff St but listening to you talk about it I can see 100% why that or Zin or anything else would resonate with you um and you know like young crypto conservative culture like I guess I'm sort of in the middle-aged uh conservative culture we use different language but yeah I can I can totally Now understand why you would buy one of those things at a $1 million doll market cap like that's awesome um I guess that should be the takeaway for listeners is invest in what res reses with you if you're early if you're late then you're to somebody else's exit liquidity so yeah you really have to I mean it has to it has to Res with you and you know the rest of the people I don't I don't know you know if you're if you're a 75 years old and something resonates with you not sure that's going to catch on in the crypto world so best best to best to people best to talk to people younger than you every now and then Jonah that's what that's what I'm here for Grandpa Simpson to weigh in on this stuff yeah I I I I do think generally um stepping maybe even even further out um I think the the animal memes are very difficult like I think I think you need unless you've got like a you know kind of cult holder base as Morad likes to talk about um with maybe something like Pepe or or like popcat um I think it's really tough for any like animal related meme to get escape velocity because there's just nothing that's time you to to the thing um you know not to like show the hell out of Zen but like for example like I just I Zin you know I have like a positive dopamine association with Zin because it's a nicotine pouch and it's just you know I want to hold I want to hold it or like lock in like all the lockin guys you know they're in the in the chat you know spamming like let's lock in like it's a it's like a cultural it's like a cultural thing that they feel like they're kind of the token somewhat you know kind of gives them an entrance into this uh or like it you know uh amplifies this like cultural thing that they that they connect to I think that's you guys hang out with each other do you have like meetups and do I don't know what um I haven't I haven't done any any uh meme coin any meme coin meetups yet but OB I'm not I'm not sure if you have zero and I don't don't anytime ether The Ether Rock I don't not not not not a huge fan of crypto meups in general mcoins just like me the memes just enrage people me meme coins piss off non- crypto people so much because like if you think about it 50 years ago like with a government job you could have a house in the hills in California or you know someplace nice and if you were a doctor a lawyer you were like crushing it now if you're a doctor or lawyer you live in the ex herbs and it's the frakin dollar sign Zin coin people who are living in like Penthouse Apartments in the middle of New York City it's ridiculous so I guess I guess it is like a kind of generational counterculture and I I tend to be more on the receiving end of the anger from the people that aren't quote in that culture they they more just like oh you're in crypto what the heck I complain to you about it but for for you guys for you youngsters it's like it's literally like a way to a way to develop kind of a parallel track in life and earn some earn some serious cash if you're early on one of these things Jonah do do your friends bet on Sports like avidly they used to yeah they used to big time I think a lot of them have calmed down now because they're like your your risk appetite if you haven't hyper gambled your way into Elite status and you end up as a wage cuck which is you know kind of like where a lot of people end up just by the luck of the draw like your your risk appetite for you know yoloing 15K into the Bears game like that kind of dis dissipates as you get older hopefully yeah well with people my age almost everybody that I know that's on sports or at least all of my non- crypto friends that on Sports like this is like a it's a it's a very very widespread thing I I would to take it even a step back I would say I think there's a dopamine epidemic amongst people of my age I mean you can just log on your phone and get access to infinite amounts of dopamine and I think it's fried to dopamine receptors of everyone my age including me who's glued to Twitter all day and and checking every every tick of Bitcoin even though there's no reason for me to be doing that um I I think that's kind of that's kind of driven people to be like predisposition to to want to punt on memes as well and then you add to that like all the you know hypers culation type of attributes that that you know the the monetary backdrop has been conducive towards I I think you know if people start to get a taste of of memec coin gambling that are very Avid Sports betters Then That Could That Could that could be quite a catalyst for for retail money to to come in but for now I mean none none of my non I mean obviously by definition they're non non- crypto people but a lot of my Normie friends they you know they're putting like 15 leg parlays on like every other night right and this is like they I I think a lot of people Now you kind of have this you kind of have this mindset of like I'm not going to make it from my job so I have my job and that's like how I generate my cash flow and then I'm G to make it by doing something on the side and I don't know if that's always been around but that's like very very prevalent with with guys that have just gotten out of college that I'm I'm friends with maybe it's just that age but um the the sports betting is definitely one where you know people are like all right I make money and then I'm you know degenerately gambling it in in sports some some of the more prudent friends are putting it in something like the S&P but you know they're cognizant that it's going to take decades for them to really make it you know in any any sense doing that um but yeah this guy Travis you know the same thing yeah I I I think I think a lot of that money will my point is I think a lot of that money will will come into into the mcoin stuff yeah I mean you your point is so valid like when I was uh when I was your age there like the side hustle wasn't really a thing maybe one out of every 50 people had one but your career was sort of where you were you were on track to to go in life and now I I take your point everybody does seem to have like a few side hustles and ways to earn money in untraditional ways um I also like I also had my first big dopamine kick from a from a meme coin like hitting a hitting a 50 bagger over the course of like a few weeks um you know I've been like investing in Venture Capital deals and like trying to be smart and trade my way around my whole career and then suddenly you know just like a stupid coin that looks like a shitty cartoon is a 50 bagger like the best VC investment ever like these things are once once you hit one of those like it's impossible to go back yeah I almost think of it as um I tend to think it's worth it to take especially if you're you're you know sub 25 years old and you're probably not trading with crazy size then it it's definitely plus EV to take five or 10% of your portfolio and try to gamble on the memes or or you know try try to hit on on a meme and you know if you don't worst case obviously you know you're you're down five or 10% on your Port you know best case you you've dou doubled the entire portfolio so I I think that's probably how how a lot of people that are coming into the space think and that's at least you know anecdotally been how a lot of people that I've I've kind of got into the space have thought D just question from somebody that doesn't really have friends that uh bet on Sports a ton there seems to be just like a difference in mindset or maybe I'm just misinterpreting it people that are gambling on Sports they just like sports yeah they they can make some money it's a little bit of a side Hustle but people that are buying meme coins are trying to just like hyper Gamble and like really make it are people that are betting on sports like taking like thousand one payouts like like really trying to make it like I don't know I'm asking the question yeah yeah no these are these are crazy I mean I mean it depends on the person um you know some some some are like very tactical and trying to like you know compound like small lenss but yeah I a lot of my friends will show me hey you know on the FR hey I've got like a 12 or 15 leg parlay and they're trying to you know turn 25 bucks into like you know a grand or or two grand or something um it's very much like this like YOLO kind of kind of mindset okay yeah I mean it would be great great to I just don't think they know that crypto exists right I I just think like they don't even know it's it's still early enough a lot of I just don't even think they know what a phantom wallet is they don't even know that the stuff is out there people think it's you know so difficult or such a such a friction to to getting involved with it that I think they're just like oh I'm familiar with with doing um but I I think it only takes two or three you know screen recordings of of somebody's metamask or Phantom wallet on Tik Tok or Instagram to go viral for a ton of a ton of this this money to start flowing into the stuff just thinking like 20 years ago what people would have said if somebody was like posting wins like posting screenshots of their bank account on the internet it would have been the most cringe phenomenon ever and now maybe that's why people want to be a naan they want to do that but they don't want to dox themselves I think it goes back to this like make it culture like there's this mindset of like I'm not going to make it with my normal job so therefore I'm in the trenes with all these other people and then hey you know i' I've I'm clawing my way out you know here here it's you know signaling to all your other other friends that you feel like you're in the trenches with it's I don't know it it's the these these m coin group chats I'm in some of them I can't even open them up because it's just you know a [ __ ] vest of you know like the bottom of the barrel you know worst worst meme coins that you could think of that people are just like you know dumping on each other um before the thing gets to like 100k market cap um but there there is somewhat of a culture of like we're we're kind of we're kind of in this together and people are you know sharing their plays they're trying to trying to you know get it get in things together um so I I do think it it kind of goes back to this like community community aspect that really wasn't brought on until social media it's funny you mention it uh just talking about your generation it's kind of crazy um my former tenant uh who shall go unnamed and I'm going to say the word allegedly because he hasn't been convicted of it yet maybe never will but probably will um allegedly stole $121 million from California uh State taxpayers and uh instead of doing what he was granted to do with it which is rehabilitate um roadside motels and ins during covid that had been abandoned into housing for the homeless he spent it all on private jets and Yachts and presidential Suites in Tulum and Vegas and other places like that in Paris handbags for his girlfriend all that stuff so kind of uh listening to you talk about your generation feeling like they're not going to make it in their typical jobs and then thinking about my tenant among in that generation I'm sort of like oh this makes sense but crypto feels a lot more legitimate um so anecdotes aside uh what happens what happens to that mindset like if that's already going on if that greed that hyper gambling that insanity is already going on what does it look like if Donald Trump wins the election and by December 31st Bitcoin is trading like 110 and things are just popping left and right like what what happens then does it just like does that draw in new new uh new gambling money is are the bitcoiners gonna rotate out the curve what are these what's gonna happen it's it's possible I obviously want to hear obious thought over my own on this but I think with the with the meme stuff um 100K is probably a nice round number for normies to to come in and start punting on stuff you know a lot of if you just talk to somebody who's not in the space I think the average person has no idea that bitcoin's back trading your all-time highs and and nobody's paying attention I think a lot of them have still written it off as as you know a scam or whatever um but I I it still is this is i b 100K it's like a very nice round number also probably generates a tremendous amount of headlines in in the media and normies are going to read that and probably come in and punt on stuff but to the altcoin thing I I think it goes back to to what Obi said earlier I think if Bitcoin puts in a giant God candle then people probably start rotating out down the rist Spectrum yeah I mean my my my my view is very much so in line with what I've said what I've said before which is that we're we're in for we're in for pretty [ __ ] great party if that if that happens yeah I mean for sure you like eight out of 10 long 10 out of 10 long there's like there's like no uh okay I mean like at this moment in time right here right now yeah like eight out of 10 n out of 10 I mean um I I I just this this just goes off of what I was talking about on the previous podcast which is um it go it goes off of what I was talking about on the previous podcast which is that you know I I think if Trump doesn't get elected I'll have time to slam out uh but if Trump gets elected I mean this just turns into one big Dogecoin like B just turns into one big Dogecoin and so the a symmetry is there I mean um you know you know trading and investing you you always have to take into context like where where you are like right like if you've taken a bath over the last if you got chopped up really hard in this range then you're probably not ridiculously long here just because you want to manage your risk um but if you're looking at this with like if I'm like closing my eyes and looking at it with a fresh set of eyes and saying hey I've never positioned in this before where should I like where should I position um yeah I mean I'm pretty I'm pretty D long so I mean yeah I guess I think you and I I think the only the only thing to you know be be a little concerned about it's just some of the some of the leverage but I'm I'm in the camp of you know if you look at the beginning of 2021 we had this period where open interest just absolutely exploded and then you had funding rates you know going back and forth between you know upwards of 30 all the way up to to like 40% between funding rates and and the three-month Futures basis I don't know if we ever get back out to 30 or 40% but my point is you know at some point open interest is going to make significantly higher all-time highs than the peak of 2021 both on BTC alone as well as you know just the aggregate open interest on on all alts so I I you know obviously you get these crazy you know shakeouts that that the crypto Market's very well known for during those periods because the Market's you know trying to trying to shake out some of the The Leverage along the way but I I think you know every every few years guy this might my second cycle but it seems every few years you know in Bitcoin you you get this kind of period where there's there's a two or three month stretch where you kind of just you want to be long and you know fun funding is just is just a reflection of everybody wants to be long and it's just the price to to be long so you know I I think you know things can change but you know as things stand today uh you know I'm holding all my positions for at least the next couple months here and I don't I don't really intend on on changing my my net long exposure to to crypto um you know I can I can either draw down basically just chilling in in spot and then I have you know longer dated calls on on uh wolf that I that I've outlined which obviously you know I can't get liquidated on um but you know I I have no idea if we we see a flush out or whatever you know but this pl we could but I think like the bigger the bigger picture you know the the fed you know we all we all talked about how the the FED could raise rates and like including myself like sced ourselves out you know the the beginning of the draw down after after 2021 then you know were manifesting Ray cuts for so long then they finally came and everybody started saying that they were bearish you know you know when when the context of of the rate Cuts is is what's really important to pay attention to you know the fed the fed's cutting into you know a strong economy and you know then you've got some some very you know well respected macro figures that are coming out basically highlighting you know the Bitcoin thesis in in broad daylight um you know that that people that have been Advocates of Bitcoin have been highlighting for a decade so you I think it's just you've got a lot of apathy in the market people have lost money got chopped up over the last seven months every every breakout has has gotten faded and I think that's kind of conditioned the market to to not trust you know a move a move like this but you know whether we get a short-term flush out or not I I tend to think that I don't want to touch anything for two or three months here so let's uh that that's a nice segue into a little speed round for you will we're gonna pepper you with rapid fire questions AI I can think of a couple uh let's keep the answers short let's just like take take this take this this moment to extract as much knowled as we can from will Clemente here so first question how long are you right now on a scale of 1 to 10 um eight and a half nice um okay next question what what what are your big tools that you use to trade and monitor oi and all that other good stuff v data shout out to shout out to vlo data it's uh that seems to be a popular answer we were I got I got Anthony I think he was one of the first checks into into vo data been been involved with them and papano um you know I was I was involved um that's an advisory Al Alo to to vo from the beginning so um bid hedge is a great dude younger guy super super smart great team that they have there so super bullish on Dow I think they're going to be the dominant data platform for Bitcoin derivatives and crypto derivatives to cycle I think so too shout out to vo um okay scenario kamla wins cryp nukes are you uh are you buying the nuke on like week of election week after election or are you waiting um I I don't know it's tough to say like depends on how much leverage gets flushed out where Bitcoin trades down to but generally I think you want to buy the the dip even if Kamala wins on on BTC I think so too um another speed round question uh you mention you for somebody who talked about meme coins and is in as into the space as much as you are wh like it or hate it yeah it's good it's good okay what about popcat yeah I mean look both both of these I think fall into the category of I mentioned like if you've got a lot of money and I think you know you you come in you're like I want to buy memes like there's probably three or those two fall into the basket like three to five ones that has a lot of liquidity they're on Sexes right you know you you could trade them on Leverage so I I think I think those will keep reflexively getting flows for people that just want to allocate to mem so F okay good good answer um ethereum uh is that the xrp of this cycle or is it gonna be a is it gonna finally perform at some point no I think ethereum's screwed I tried to I tried to give ebtc a shot especially around the the E ETF launch and got hosted on that so I I think it's you just got to look at the soul e chart I mean you know just knowing how reflexive these assets are it's hard not to be bullish so yeah dude eth is eth is completely an utterly I've been saying this for so long and I will continue to say this AI actually talked me out of my eth I he literally ruined my day and thank God he did um AI you got any other speed round questions for will before we wrap it up here what's your favorite superar oh you know I I lived in uh I Liv in Miami for a year and I got to to see some pretty cool cars I I'm not a big superar guy I I like I like the cars they're like a a little more classy like I like the the Bentley Continental like very boring answer but I think that's a nice car the mayback I think nice car I think I I think it's a complete I genuinely think as as a tangent it is it is a complete farce and a lie with superar cannot be classy that's a that's a Miami invention like if you go back to if you go back to 2012 2013 like look at the Ferrari 458 look at it in gray that is a classy car that's not I mean it's a beautiful powerful aggressive car but it's it's not a you know a flashy Lamborghini you know same thing if you go back to 2006 you look at the Lamborghini Gallardo it was it wasn't this it's not flashy I mean it is obviously aggressive and large powerful but it's not flashy you know so you you're good you're good at crypto but we got some got some maybe after this cycle I'll get on the road with you we'll see will uh last speed round question for the part of the podcast where we say that we're we're just idiots who don't know anything and none of this is financial advice why don't you turn on your video so that we can all prove that we interviewed the real will Clemente now that the uh now that your Wi-Fi speed doesn't matter there he is NOP see he's real he's a real thank you so much for coming on the Pod will this was awesome talking to you none of this is financial advice obviously uh yeah wow what a fun one you nice to set this up in the Niger Delta Avengers chat too thank you for being in there yeah oh yeah everybody's gotta get in there great great group chat great energy in there yeah all right well appreciate it all right thank you gentlemen thank you so much take care okay uh I clicked and

Transcript Text:
after Elon Musk mentioned Doge for the first time people bought Doge solely on the speculation that he might mention it in the future and then it outperformed for months and that I think can happen again with Trump effectively what I think mem coins do is mem coins produce uncorrelated returns with respect to being a store of value relative to everything else goes on crypto so if everything looks euphoric you have to ask yourself not is it euphoric Ergo be bullish that's the wrong question the question is like is it going to get more euphoric or less [Music] euphoric all right awesome looks like we're live we've got a very special guest for you guys today we've got the giver lazy vager on Twitter who is known for some pretty amazing and indepth posts which is rare for the Twitter sphere rare for CT normally it's to ship posts um you know I've been following him for a while and I've always appreciated the approach that he takes to the market which is extremely thoughtful and genuinely rare and so we're here to talk about how we can make the most amount of money possible by actually thinking about our problems thank you for joining us Jenna what's with the John Deer hat well while we're waiting for the giver to get his [ __ ] together let me tell you about my John Deere hat which is in stark contrast to your Harvard Business School hat so please note that it says Harvard Business School dad okay so maybe you've got some some Manchild you want to tell us about some biological freak stuff going on anyway um my John Deere hat I got it at man camp uh which in the era of cancel culture got renamed to human Camp um but basically man camp is an event that my buddy hosts every year it starts at Lake Geneva in Wisconsin you drink beers go tubing Do America stuff and then we drive pickup trucks out into the Wilderness to that my buddy's um Father's Farm in northern Wisconsin shoot guns Drive John Deere tractors around cut down trees um like build build fences and you know just basically like do you know what in the past would have been called man stuff but now it's just human stuff and uh I got this hat and you know just being like kind of a kind of like a West Coast liberal City kid um I feel cool when I wear this hat I feel like you know American yeah yeah yeah like a real real American so you wear that around the Mean Streets of London Mean Streets of London what's bre red blooded hey we can hear you okay I closed out like 50 browsers I think it was a technical technical difficulty it's my bad I mean honestly why would you why would you look at porn when you can just pull up trading View and look at the Bitcoin chart I mean that just just sense Bitcoin chart that's that's better than anything I could be could be watching I mean it's like a it's truly truly a beautiful beautiful looking chart flows flows are looking good altcoins are doing poorly which is a great sign you know I I'm I I know I know I'm normally the resident the resident bear and I still advise you know not not to ever go ridiculously levered but I mean basically ever since we flipped 60k I it's been the the Market's been different you're seeing flows into the you're seeing real flows into the ETF uh you're seeing the narrative shift pretty tremendously in favor of Bitcoin and in favor of crypto because equities are punching alltime highs people aren't worried about data as much people aren't paying attention to every tiny little bit of information that they can get about the economy because things seem to look good and the way that I always think about it is you know when you're in crypto and you trade crypto there's a specific flow of money and the flow of money is Bitcoin does well and then it goes to altcoins and that's what happens on the macro level too with the equity markets Equity markets do well people want to keep outperforming they go down the risk curve they push money into Bitcoin and I think that's a little bit of what's happening I mean it's a combination of that and a onetoone correlation with the odds of trump getting elected and what you are seeing right now is you're seeing that traditional Finance like all of your funds out there are figuring out okay well if we think Trump is going to win where are we putting our money and Bitcoin is the answer I mean look at look at the CME Futures open interest is at the highs and the reason is because people are crowding into the trade where's basis right now it's a good question don't know um there there is no bad like I agree with you there is no better Trump trade than Bitcoin I think bitcoin's like an easy two bagger uh which like which and you can deploy a lot of capital there which so if you're a trafi guy just go and buy ibit and like you know you just brought up the ETF flows they're massive 11th of October 250 million 14th of October 550 million 15th of October 400 million 16th of October 450 million like these are Mega numbers and there sir go ahead yeah I mean I didn't have a long rant on this I was more just thinking like if you're sitting in a Trad seat and you see Trump's odds going up like you could put 50k to work on poly Market or 500k or you could put you know like literally 50 million hundred million dolls to work in a Bitcoin ETF I think that's what's going on here I mean 100% there's actually one stock that I I like to look at as a trump proxy and I think it trade pretty aggressively with Trump odds and that's the geog group which is it's basically Geo I'm not advocating for it I'm just saying that it does trade very closely with Trump odds and that's because uh they run a lot of the I mean they basically run detention centers at the border and they get a lot more Government funding when somebody like Trump is in charge than camel so that has also traded extremely well it's basically traded with BTC and what that tells me is if all of the Trump trades are trading like BTC and BTC is trading like the Trump odds that's really what's driving this move that is the whole that's the whole thing right now is that people are allocating because of because of trump and so the way we can hear you Giver you're back hi all right I'm on my phone but it seems like I'm still lagging I uh might I'm not sure it's the Wi-Fi or stream streamyard is just might be too high resed for me high res your your no image for my yeah for my uh iPhone for my iPhone 10 well honestly like we're we're a iPhone so you're tell sorry you're telling me I've been taking advice from somebody on the internet that uses an iPhone 10 you don't have enough money to upgrade and I'm supposed to be listening to you the [ __ ] is going on I'm a I'm a fr guy I'm a real guy I'm like Jesus Jesus Christ yeah the guy saves his CPU budget for mining whatever it is that you were mining to I mean look like look I'm I'm pretty sure even Warren Buffett has something he what does he drive is Toyota Camry and he has like one sandwich a day for McDonald's but he probably probably has an iPhone 11 or better it's an iPhone it's an iPhone XR it's an iPhone XR it's uh let's give some I one of those I had one of those no no this this is great we can hear you now perfectly Giver I appreciate your uh I appreciate not not like falling for the apple shill of every single upgrade cycle what I actually miss phone wise I had a BlackBerry Pearl that was my second favorite phone and then my favorite phone was when I was a kid we had this like you guys may remember this um it was like a landline but it would allow you to roam away from the base station like kind of uh you know you would extend the antenna way up and walk around the house those things were cool I missed those yeah I I had a Blackberry as a kid and then I love I love the Cy keyboard and then I think I got an iPhone for my birthday for my 18th birthday and then and then I've had two iPhones since I get an iPhone usually every five to seven years I think nice I mean that that's pretty solid you know I appreciate the frugality it's good it's good you don't see that very often in CT I will say that I never had a phone with a physical keyboard so I I I don't I don't know what you guys are talking about went straight to the straight to the touch screens that's why my brain is so fried that's why I'm built for this because you know since since the beginning just been fed straight dopamine I played I I played uh I'm a big gamer well I'm not not not as much anymore but I was a big gamer when I was uh when I when I was in school so I would always play on like my 10-year-old laptop because it could run League of Legends fine like Le of Legends is a very low performance game so I would always just never upgrade and I could never play any of the games my friends were playing because I could never make the CPU requirement so how'd you get into crypto what like tell us your crypto Journey yeah sure happy happy the start um so I would say in 2020 2021 I would say mid 2021 um just by circumstance it was just through a colleague of mine effectively told me like hey like there's this group of guys where you know we we talk about markets we talk about Finance talk about crypto um you know I think you'd be a good F and then I was like okay well I don't know anything about markets I'm not very keen on markets um you know I'm just going to I just want to stick to what I know which is at the time um you know was still on the cell side and so you know got got in there and then at that point you know I didn't know right didn't know much so I just like pretty much looked at a coin market cap or coin gecko or whatever set I was using at the time and then I just DCA but where I DCA it was like it just happened to be like the summer of 2021 like just by pure luck so it was it was it was it was when prices had largely crashed like I remember something I I distinctly remember is I was buying polka dot at $10 and then you know and I wasn't you know I wasn't trading right I was just dcing being kind of like a you know call quote unquote long-term investor and then I got I started getting really busy again in in uh around some around September October I didn't really um you know monitor the performance of my portfolio and then by I I want to say end of October or November of 2021 I click over my portfolio and and I'm just up uh a ton of money right like I remember polka dot I think it was at like $60 and I remember DCA into this at like 10 and I was like what what is going on like I I don't I don't know I happening but I'm up a lot and so you know in the journey in the search for wanting to better understand what was happening um I checked out Reddit I checked out Twitter I checked out a little bit um and then you know browsing through crypto Twitter I think the first few people that I followed just happened to be guys like satar um Darren Lao from not three Lao and then I just you know by getting very you know interested by what was happening with defi I thought it was super super cool and so I started writing about defi myself um I remember just one day randomly I learned about M I learned about treasury backed tokens and my mind just natively jumped to the possibility that there there was some degree of intrinsic value uh back at this now you know what a funny thought right but um there was some degree of intrinsic value with appropriating kind of EV valuation based off of kind of the underlying reserves backing a a oh token and so I wrote about that um on Twitter it was my first post ever I randomly you know not randomly there was some thought that went into my my name or my pseudonym but um you know I posted it and then overnight it got a thousand likes and it happened a lot and I got like 2,000 followers in one in one evening and you know I just from there on um you know I started writing about stuff as kind of a patent project on the side it's pretty exciting um I I respect people like you who are able to just grab a bunch of Engagement from like kind of go from Z to 60 it took me it took me a year of like bragging about myself and my my job title on LinkedIn and promoting myself from a large account to gain a foothold into people's mind share in terms of thoughts about crypto so it speaks like I I enjoy your post too like I it speaks to your your writing and Analysis abilities um that you were able to kind of hit the ground running like that it's it's extremely rare so then what happened to your bags in 2022 did you just get absolutely carded out or did you dodge the bullet to to a little bit of to some extent so actually maybe just on your point around there I I think initially when I thought about branding I I I mean this I think even today like exceptionally even more so this year like my Twitter account is somewhat of a challenge to myself on you know if I have kind of what it takes I'll just put it that way um and so like sometimes even on telegram or or other venues other than Twitter I'll I'll purpose be anonymous or at least like not not brand myself because I I want to be evaluated on kind of the Merit of of my thinking um and sometimes people can be biased if they know who you are um maybe they'll be too to to uh to too happy to agree um and so you know this entire journey I would say from 2021 I've been treating it as a way to express kind of my thoughts and see whether they hold up in in in the Market's eye and so from writing about om tokens um I really just you know I I I was so infused by what was going on around that time I thought B5 was the next Bay thing I mean I to some extent I still think so I mean when I learned about rehypothecation through an app like Abracadabra and manic internet money and a lot of the stuff Daniela was building I was I was completely enthralled I I I thought wow this is completely accessible outside of this little cryptosphere on on the web I remember I was shorting Luna and I was making just all the way from like 100 because I think I was very early on destroying Luna and because I didn't know anything about risk management or or sizing or really anything like I actually knew nothing um I was you know putting on big leverage and I was shorting every every Spike so from $100 I shorted it to maybe like 75 and then I took all the money off and then when I went to 70 I thought oh wow this is going down more so I I reloaded my position at 70 and then it went to 50 or 45 and then it took chips off and then at 40 I I jammed it all in again and so I made like I want to say 250k in the span of a few hours and then I remember reading gc's tweet at that time and he said around $30 or $40 I vividly remember him saying okay I'm closing out my bet like there's still more to go but I don't you know I don't it's going to be a crowded trade eventually and I don't really want to compete against these people when it's going to get choppy and I I thought to myself well this guy doesn't always talking about he he's there's so much more room to go and so I just kept jamming money in 40 to 30 to 20 and then I just got crushed so all that money that I made that day it just completely zeroed out like I lost all my unrealized gains or realized unrealized realized gains I lost I want to say half my net worth at crypto that I grew at that time and then through just the brutal reality of being in a down spiral with uh owning IL liquid assets some of the nfts I own those down spiral too and then I eventually found myself in a very compromised position where um I didn't have enough liquidity to support some of the positions that I had opened from naively Trading some of these assets and I just got zero out so I still had a little bit of money and then with the little bit of money which is effectively the principle that I joined with in crypto I that was still an FTX and so then effectively through FTX it got zeroed out there and so this entire Saga ends with having made no money during uh the 2020 and 2021 cycle that's a pretty amazing Amazing Story just because I think you you clearly articulated how how you learn the lessons I think a lot of people end up learning lessons like that but it tends to be from the long side not necessarily the short side I think there very few people that get burned in crypto first on the on the on the short side so that's definitely definitely an interesting story and it does talk a lot about the irrationalities of the market and just understanding you know how to how how you extract money from this Market uh can sometimes be divorced from you know long-term reality and in fact it often is divorced from long-term reality so you know when I whenever I read your post specifically um there there's a lot there's a lot of thought that goes in that goes into these posts there's a lot of analysis there's there's you know sometimes sometimes good good amount of you know math involved in this analysis but often when you produce content like that you're implicitly thinking longer term because short-term moves in crypto tend to be extremely extr noisy and so I'm curious like how you how you balance that now like how have you yeah learned from that experience to balance fact that oftentimes when you think deeply you're implicitly thinking long term uh but obviously crypto moves pretty violently shortterm that's a great question I I think I think the first thing that that that is a helpful leg to answer this is that over time and as I've got more senior in my career and then I I pivot to the buy side in in traditional finance and and um you know in terms of developing some Acumen there something that I've I'm very conscious of today is that there is a very large divorce between thinking about an asset or an instrument between a private market and and and the public market and crypto definitely fits into the into the ladder and so one of my biggest learning lessons from the previous cycle and even one from maybe even you could even say earlier this year um and it's not it's not uh it's not novel you know it's just that markets can remain you know irrational longer than you can remain solvent and so especially in a in a crypto class an asset class at crypto where there's an incredible amount of of reflexivity uh and hype what I thought would be a more strong you know fundamental lens of approaching assets maybe in the last cycle um you know it didn't I learned it the hard way and it didn't pan out the way that I thought it would so very clearly to me that was an indication back then you know that I hadn't solved anything you know that I was I was still missing uh um I was still missing something and you know it's back to the drawing board because you know I I made no money and although I was right at certain points I was also very wrong at certain points and it didn't really feel like I had an edge and so you know similar to you know playing poker um which I did a lot of um in my 20s there's just no point in doing something to me if I don't feel like I can express an edge over it you know and um I think earlier this year that was kind of the first time in my life where I had thought that public markets were really interesting you know up until this point and I would say with most people in private Equity or on the buy side um okay let's let's yeah let's let's main state for private CR and private Equity today I think most nine out of 10 people probably couldn't even tell you what the Ford PE earnings for the S&P 500 are there are there's a big Chasm between evaluating something from a okay what what should this be worth and what is our willingness to pay for it and what have people paid for in the past which typically tends to be the the precedent uh it use and developing a mental model in the former and then the latter which you know it has a lot to do more with capital cons solation you know economic theory so let me let me just let me just dive in on that for a second it sounds like you're you were an investment banker and now you're in private Equity because you said you went from the sell side to the buy side and you're talking about Equity valuations but you're not a Trader so I don't want to dox you too much is that is it okay to talk about it that way yeah that's that's right okay so okay so I mean I've I've rubbed shoulders with a lot of your your folks from my career and I find that if you go into Investment Banking and then private Equity like you get the smartest best educated most brilliant thinkers but there tends to be a lack of um you know I'm I'm just speaking as a Trader from the other side of the fence inside of these institutions like there I've noticed that that crowd tends to have a lack of risk tolerance so I would like to commend you for growing the you know coones to go and and try and you know roll the dice with your money in crypto and and and sort of self- te yourself the art of trading I think is super interesting now let me just ask you on on what you just said you're talking about public Equity Market valuations private Equity market valuations and crypto kind of all in one one uh conversation so let me try to tie those strands together what is your Edge in private Equity valuation and what is your Edge in crypto and are those two edges related I would say The Edge that I'll take from from my world is perhaps a more rigorous understanding of of just the backbone supplying what an asset should be worth in in a theoretical roomm and that can often be helpful in creating a floor or a ceiling on on on on Guiding toward a range and then understanding where one should be in that range and if it is time or what is what what could catalyze dislocation in or out of that range is probably the hard part to learn with public markets and what I've strived to get better at this year I think it's probably the way that I put it I think this is why we love your tweets because we in the crypto world are so used to this mid curve meme where it's like oh doing work is stupid we don't need to invest time in understanding valuations just hold on for dear life and everything works out haha yay but it it doesn't right like the Market's getting more mature and more you know complex and we need these Frameworks so you know I want to poke and maybe OBU do too like let maybe should we try to figure out what the givers Frameworks are for eth for Bitcoin for public markets what do you want to talk about OB I I think that I think that makes sense I do want to touch on a point that you said which I think is I mean I mean even just core to this podcast and the discussions that we have here Jonah when you think about why that mentality is so prevalent in crypto like why is a mentality of you don't have to do work you just have to think like don't think just allocate it's prevalent because crypto is a growing asset class and the reality is that the vast majority of people can't think clearly or effectively uh it it actually is very difficult to do that and what your advice to them would be in a different asset class would be don't trade right if you're not good at trading then don't trade and in crypto there's a difference because there's it's a rising tide lift all boats right if you have decided to allocate your time to an asset class that inherently you think will grow year year over-year then yeah sure you can actually make a ton of mistakes and get bailed out uh as long as you're playing the game and you don't blow up then sure you might actually make more money Trading because if you're just early to One Thing Once then you make 10 extra money and that that can feed a lot of losses right and so I think that's why that mentality is prevalent but the reality is that crypto and trade every Market goes through a period where it is easy and then it gets much harder as smart people come in and so the question is as you're going through this transitionary period which in my opinion we're doing right now how do you maintain your Edge right like how do you start to flip from going I'm just betting on a growing asset class to okay I can generate edge here because there's still a lot of inefficiency there's still you know the smartest people in the game aren't playing it and I can generate Alpha and I can have a smooth p&l curve uh how do I actually get there like how do I how do I do that and it's through this type of conversation and process right it's you're thinking okay well if you know should I be long or short Bitcoin well these are the 10 things that you need to look at and you need to think about and then you place them in context and then you make you make your bets right um so maybe maybe we can start there with with BTC just something concrete when you're evaluating Bitcoin I mean you you sometimes post long short left right what are you what are you actually looking at like how do you how do you start to form a thesis on where Bitcoin is going that's a good question uh I don't I don't even know if I've very consciously thought to myself this so I will this is this will be my first attempt at um at explaining out myself I I think that you know at the core let start this at the the core of all these assets it is it's just a very natural Supply demand curve right and then you know the where price meets happens to be where the equilibrium sets and certain movements like you know like a standard micro Eon 101 class sort of movements can shift either a curve right left um where where price matures or meets at a different point and I would say today and over these last four to six months as I've tried to think more classically about markets I don't even I would say like I don't even look at really a lot of the stuff that other people look at to begin my train of thought for so for example with Bitcoin when I was thinking about when I was thinking about China when I was thinking about um the 50 bips rate cut when I was thinking about even this last week and how this will go into the into the election I start with kind of a hypothesis around where where I think central theory is in terms of how positioning is being aggregated from consensus and then I ask myself is there enough volume is there enough is there enough flows or Capital to support consensus today without new money coming in and if I think the answer is no then I will probably start to do some work and look at I'll look at you know vo I'll look at oi but I think I got asked a question like this on the stream the other day like how much do I or sorry on the what's my Edge podcast which was how much do you trade off macro and my answer to that was the the the the weight that I assign Mac on macro is the inverse of how other people are looking at it so if someone if if the rhetoric happens to be that a certain event like fomc or I don't know CPI or jobs is very important then I will personally probably flatten risk into it or take a contrarian view that it's not influential and and start and start a position there and I think what I love about crypto Market specifically more than other public instruments and especially against you know private Equity put it this way markets are very Snappy I think you can ascertain quite quickly whether or not you are right directionally and sometimes it will take a little bit more time but compared to the life cycle that you can make a bed on in the private realm which can be extended artificially through through you know bankruptcies and you know restructurings and Etc like that with stuffing crypto you will pretty much know within like a week or two weeks or even maybe at Max a month on whether or not the that you're making is correct okay so just just just to ask you a question on that what's if you're if that's your Edge your next kind of like your two weeks two we window is sort of where you feel you know in your comfort zone yeah and you you say that you know on this podcast we like to talk all the time about how the news itself doesn't matter it's the second derivative of the news so if everything looks euphoric you have to ask yourself not is it euphoric Ergo be bullish that's the wrong question the question is like is it going to get more euphoric or less euphoric we talk about this all the time so right now you know you kind of mentioned it too there so just you know kind of tying those two conversations together uh things just really started looking up for crypto right um crypto's a trump trade Trump's odds are are on the on the rise we're starting to feel good here um everybody's getting excited and piling in you mentioned uh you know you mentioned something within the context of fomc and rate cuts and how you wanted to fade that sentiment which sort of speaks to my second derivative conversation are you are you looking at this and saying like hey it's going to be pretty tough for um inflows to confirm the level of current Euphoria so I'm selling into this pop or you are you like hey this is the real thing like it's time to get even longer here what do you how are you positioning yourself with your you know sort of Edge and your time Horizon so the quick toct answer is that I am that short my which um I formed two days ago exactly on the dot um and I haven't spread this publicly I've mostly discussed this with maybe like two or three friends um so last week I I believe um you know when price was still circling the low 60s um due to you know possibly the US government selling um you know lot of reasons why you know price can chop in in the 60s which is like the range we've been bound bound in for for how God knows how long I uh I didn't really have a view I point in time like I was I was long to start sorry I was short to start the month and then I got long around National week because I thought that there could be you could kind of scalp a nice domestic kind of Chinese markets opening that could tie in you know easing effects or in people's mind to to to buy up Bitcoin as a risk proxy and then I flattened out and wasn't really you know I've been secularly short some alts for for quite some time now that I I'm still holding on to those positions but than that I was still like I was very this probably the lightest I've been in my book I want to say for three months 3 four months I didn't have a view um because I had a lot personally I had a lot of uncertainty around what the Trump runup could be like and and how that would how that would manifest and so didn't have a view and then when we when we went below 60 to 59 I started shorting very lightly you know very very lightly on on ethereum and soul um because I thought that you know from from a pure mechanical perspective you know possibly a little bit more downside to scalp off of and then we raced you know to 62 and um you know I I was still monitoring I wasn't really sure what was going on and then over the weekend we um went very quickly from 6 61 62 to I want to say like 64 or 65 like I remember I was working out actually I think it was like 1 or 2 am. when that happened on Sunday and everything followed like e Min salana followed too and again I was still a little puzzled um you know wasn't adding on additional exposure because I wasn't really sure what was going on and so it took a few days to and then I you know I looked at I I still you know given the uncertainty you know wasn't outspoken about what was going on and then as the following days led up I looked at more data points and just somehow I there was like a light bul moment for me where I think I I just put two and two and one together and I think what is happening today and I'll try to distill this I think we are in a chicken or the egg situation right now with respect to to bitcoin and crypto assets and what I mean by that is I think the very popular rhetoric that you see echoed and that Bitcoin is a is a trade that is that has Divergent outcomes based on the outcome of the election which I think is somewhat lazy analysis in the sense that you know let's just put some numbers out there right if Trump wins we're going to 100K if Cala wins we're going to 40 right and then we're kind of at I agree with half of that I don't think we're going to 40 if kamalo wins but interesting to hear your take go on sure yeah but so that that is like I think that is the the the you know it's it's it's sentiment right it's some sentiment that is at least you know Shar and my view is that it is somewhat of the of the reverse which is the money that is flowing into Bitcoin it is unscrupulous execution right and it's it's come very erratically and at first you had Majors follow with alos and pers trending but on Monday when I realized that other assets had started eroding in terms of the ratio against Bitcoin and I looked at the Donald Trump media entertainment company and realizing that I had grown from $10 to $30 in the span of two weeks despite no new guidance I looked at a few other things and I came to the conclusion that Bitcoin is simply being used as a hedge uh a liquid hedge or a risk proxy to manage election risk going into the election and so therefore it is a chicken or an egg situation where I think independent of whoever wins this mercenary flow driven by a new class of buyer that we haven't seen that much this year is going to take off that Capital regardless because can you can you can you clarify who you think of as the new class of buyer sure yeah how so so I think of Bitcoin I sorry I think of digital assets today I think today there are four sets of buyers I think the first set is someone is is the the very common it's the Speculator right it's someone it's uh the class of participants that has historically been dominant I would say even last cycle maybe like 75% plus of the base was was this player and they are typically responsible for very deep troughs and very very high peaks and of course they are they're very present today I think the second uh bidder is a new B and they are the passive Capital bear and they are ETF they are the ETF and and to some extent sailor and I think it's worthy distinguishing them because I think that these guys are generally price agnostic with a with a with a healthy time Horizon because and this is you know this is an assumption I'm making of course this is not proven but the assumption that I'm making is that these biders are you know looking for diverse exposure they have been conditioned by financial advisers over the last 20 to 50 years that when you invest in something like S&P or equities or you know obviously something much more volatile like crypto assets you should have a longer time Horizon to be able to realize that six to 8% annualized gain on like on equities right and so to extent for something like Bitcoin the the same logic applies and and so I think that is very visible because they've been bgf buyers have been very supportive of price in the 50s in the 60s in independent I would say of where the chart looks like whenever we've had a long liquidation event these guys have come they have largely stepped up this year the Third cast are the carry BS so this is like where I would qu qualify someone like a millennium where their presence is likely someone who is they are also similarly press agnostic but they are very rate sensitive such that they are probably doing something where they might be buying ibit but they might be short C Futures and they're effectively doing the Athena trade in real life um and so they don't these three bits so far I would say don't move the needle they're not moving the needle this month the ones who are moving the needle are the event driven buyers and this is the type of participant that I think was responsible for the grayscale E discount closing in one day from the 19 before announcement in July it's the same bidder that put on a lot of OI when there was initial rumor uh initial uh you know kind of rumor Milling around the Strategic Reserve asset from Trump it's basically listeners of the THX podcast the event the event buyers of crypto assets and crypto link assets correct exactly and um and these guys are they're not sticky they don't they are here to monetize either they're here to monetize a naked view on how Bitcoin will do into into the into the rally or they are using it to hedge for example like if they are you know for example if you are a public risk manager and you have liquid positions in industries that are going to benefit of on a Harris win and you're looking for a trump proxy is it easier to invest in something like Bitcoin which has a lot of deep liquidity and is you know G and you could kind of sell out of this position whenever you want or maybe some some an industry or a company that you just don't have enough time to get up to speed around um like coal or energy or something that is maybe very unfamiliar and not not possible to buy your mandate um so I think you know therefore this event driven by bidder this fourth cast they are not sticky that Capital will unravel and most importantly right this is the most important part of this thesis this is not Capital that recycles into the ecosystem it is static it stays in IIT it stays in C it stays in Bitcoin and it doesn't recycle elsewhere and that is my explanation of why you have erosion in alts E and soul against Bitcoin because if this was truly let's say a a risk-on buyer someone who's here to speculate on the outcoming election is going to be their afterward or someone who is simply interest who got reawakened into Bitcoin and wants exposure then you would see more diverse buying especially in something like e right look at the BTC inflows that have occurred that makes sense and you know I I follow I follow the logic of your argument I do want to offer two pieces of push back just to see how you respond to it sure the first the first is that yes we've seen we've seen a lot of mercenary Capital before right we've seen a lot of prepositioning for things like the Trump conference for the Bitcoin ETFs a lot of these a lot of these moves were driven by an massive increase in C open interest and that's generally trii coming in pushing up the prices and speculating the question is why right like why are they doing this are they doing it solely because they want to bet on Trump winning and just on the day that Trump wins then the entire thesis has played out or are they betting that Bitcoin is actually going to flourish under a trump regime right and if it's the latter then they probably actually hold their positions and they could hold it for a multitude of Recons one of the things that I was talking about uh before is that when if Trump does get elected you have this Doge like quality that attaches itself to bitcoin and what do I mean by this after Elon Musk mentioned Doge for the first time people bought Doge solely on the speculation that he might mention it in the future and then outperformed for months right and that I think can happen again with Trump it'll fade over time as it did with Doge and it'll come back down and the speculators will watchh out but at least for the month post a trump presidency there's going to be rampant specul I mean maybe even until inauguration there's rampant speculation that he may say something about Bitcoin and you don't want to sell out because there's there's this everpresent Black Swamp and then at some point that diminishes as as it did as it did with Elon and so I do think that there's there is a big right tail for Bitcoin and with that right tail comes interest and so once you if if let's say we take this scenario for granted that they don't immediately exit their positions on on a trump presidency and Bitcoin sustains itself above 70,000 above all-time highs that's that tends to be when new people come into the market one of the reasons that we haven't had a massive Bull Run uh across the board is because Bitcoin hasn't sustained price pass its alltime high for a long enough period of time right it's just it just hasn't basically every time it makes a new alltime high it comes straight back down and so right now we're close enough that if their sustained price price action past an all-time high we stay there for more than a month then new people come in because they see the headlines Bitcoin making new alltime lines now this is this is a little bit of a weekly held argument I'm more in your Camp than what I just said but but this is the counterargument that I'm making to myself and I haven't actually come to a conclusion I mean one of the things I I I I read once in a trading book somewhere that I love is exploring alternative hypotheses is the Bedrock to good thinking and so I you know I like I like to do this um but yeah I'm I'm curious what your what Your take is on that I think I think I think it's a reasonable I think it's a reasonable push back and I think that that is why I am long Bitcoin and and short everything rather than just being make it because I do think there is a degree of echo chamber that can manifest in Bitcoin I just think that I think the reason okay so like I I think as you mentioned right like price is price begets narrative in that sense that price is a signal in EV itself and I agree with that however I think an alternate approach to this is that it's just looking at the total amount of money that is here to actually support all these assets compared to 2021 in 2021 I think the peak crypto total right total one was somewhere around 2.7 trillion and that was an ERA where we had significantly more leverage we had Co stimulus checks we had 0% interest rates and why this matters um and they actually I was also on like kind of the back end of of real easing that was happening with with Co induced policies right and why this matters is because if you have someone who has $100,000 they can very easily take out many forms of debt which have seemingly no opportunity cost they can buy Bitcoin or ethereum reyo theate that Capital at 90% LTV take out 90,000 or $85,000 buy an nft buy something else recycle that in word and then price is growing so you're you're creating a larger buffer against your loan and you're able to get two or three times your starting Capital um as an ultimate destination so price can be very reflexive in an arena like that however this year and this era um which has been you know much very choppy as you describe there is there is very little there's very there's been very limited New Capital that has come in since since January February March um and for that Capital to come in right there the conditions in which that needs to manifest I don't believe reside on simply Trump becoming president I think it requires you know probably more stabilized Financial conditions and equities I think that capital is coming out right I think the cost basis of this capital I would measure as being anywhere between 61 to 63 and a half if Bitcoin hits 70 that is a 10% gain on a three-week trade that money's coming out let me ask you a question let me ask you a question how many of your Trad five peeps are hedging Equity positions with Bitcoin because of the because of bitcoin's link to an election outcome like do you have you spoken to anyone who's actually doing this because I to me it sounds a bit crazy I'm not I'm not I'm not discounting your thesis i' just more like I'd be stunned if somebody was like long and long some random industrial stock that would get nuked on a comma win or sorry some random Industrial stock that would get nuked on a trump win because of tariffs and his long I bit as a hedge it just seems like you you talk to people who doing stuff like that I would say it's there's a yes or no which is people are acutely aware of the election and what benefits from a win whether or not they are taking that position themselves either at a at a professional level or on a personal PA perspective I haven't asked but I think you can I I think a very keen proxy towards this to to to to generate it is is something like a you know the Donald Trump media entertain company I think that's a very good proxy because that is affected the ameme coin in the real in the real world to proxy a win for Trump or poly Market as a way to generate interest which I think the the Gap has widened to be could be corre incorrect but I think there's like 20% difference now between the two and so bet betting markets are are are very are very viral today um they're very there there's a lot of life behind them and all these different Avenues in which you can bet on a trump win or potentially der risk into for example like let's say Bitcoin hit 70 or 71 you made 10% why roll the dice now when you when you're up in what seems to be a very reasonable return in a Trad setting on potentially a lot of liquidity I agree with you like anybody who's just like anybody any trafi person just flipped a quick 10% return at scale on one of their Hedges is likely to take it off I agree with that where I where I would humbly disagree with you is the idea that this sort of like election hedging community that you bring up which you know probably exists I hadn't really thought of it before so it's interesting like the extent to which they'll matter if Trump wins um oh we just lost just lost the giver basically what I what I was thinking was if Trump wins there's going to be an overwhelming um tsunami of buide flow from new communities of people who are just interested in having exposure to the space on the basis of you know perceived friendly uh you know friendly regulatory environment and you know perceived kind of reflexive inflows I I think like anybody who's long as a hedge and you know pitch pitching out of their hedge on a wi like that flow is going to be spit in the ocean compared to the the the new invest this basically the new investors that are going to come in the new long-term holders yeah I I think I think the difference is it just it just takes time and going back to the original discussion that we had when we were on stage in Utah it's I think on a on a trump election you get you get a move up very fast and then it gets sold into because I think I actually do think it it takes time for people for people to come in and when you are you gonna have the balls to like fade a trump rally if he wins like on Election night oh it's it's just rallied 30% but it's going to sell off as people take profits so I'm going to take profit too like I wouldn't have the coones to do that I wouldn't be I mean look look look from October 10th to October 16th Jonah October 10th to October 16th there's been three and a half billion dollars added in CME open interest I mean some of that's coming out yeah and and that I think I mean basic your signal when the CI C CME open interest starts to drop like Get Out The Way basically look yeah when that starts every time anyone in the crypto Market has always been on one side of I don't think there's a single person in crypto that says that you know 24 hours after the Trump election we're going to be down that's got to like come on that's got to be a warning sign for you right like as as it's not though it's not though because there there's got to be for every crypto person that we know there's literally a thousand non- crypto people out there who are gonna be like oh Trump one maybe I should buy some Bitcoin now because it's safe to do so we're not talking to that Community right they're flat like they have no they have no coins you know I I I tend to believe that this is all that this pool of capital is always overestimated always okay okay that's just that that that's just my you know that's just my belief I I also do think that the the short Al trade is really tough because I think that a lot of alt should do extremely well under a Trump trump regime and so I think that they're definitely certain alts I mean you can probably short still short worldcoin to zero I think that's fine um I do think that things like salana probably do get a bid post uh post Trump Victory because what's interesting though I think is if that is the case then that those bets should be manifesting in line with the growing the widening odds of of trump winning right like I did a I did a study um that used July August and June as a time frame and I regress um Trump Trump's odds changing on the PO Market against uh bitcoin price action and and there was very there was it's a very weak linear case and so to the extent that you believe that there is reflexive behavior that centers around a a trump Victory and okay let's let's say that that is you know maybe that can't be U looked at over a long period of time but maybe you know you make the argument that over a very short period of time perhaps that can manifest okay let say I believe that then we should be seeing that resonate with the alts that should do well which is stuff like the D5 bucket stuff like salana these should be risk on proxies as second order derivatives for Trump so in the situation we're in today there's two outcomes based on the lack of appetite to support those flows for me the first is is that they are underpriced widely underpriced and that they are good long to make at this point in time the second outcome is that the money that came in is not willing to bet on other markets and there is a lack of crypto native Capital at this point to put on in making that bet under a trump win and I think it is the lad and the way that I get more Comfort around the ladder is that when you look at all these long liquidations that have happened this year of which there there's been an abundant amount right every single time that we we we try to take 7dk there's been a lot in the last two or three months you know um there's the Germany there is the E ETF unwind and the displacement of of of e money there's been the um you know shorts even got eviscerated in terms of the move from others from 175 to 250 that I wrote about in August and then just very even very recently there was um you know there was kind of the the you know I I co it the the cross panic bid unwind and Jo Jonah you actually talked about this honestly I I your your threat is what kind of give me a little bit of of of creativity from that which was um you were long oil and short Bitcoin around the um around the Iran Israel you know the War I nailed that one that was a fade oh you nailed it I'll give myself credit on that one a lot of people have gotten totally chopped on this this whole summer of up down up down and you know early fall too confidence is low um I I take your point about poly Market having a low correlation with Bitcoin that that's interesting but I think both you and I can kind of agree that correlations can change and maybe poly Market's going to be pretty correlated with uh with Bitcoin going forward to your point about hedgers and kind of to our general THX viewpoint on you know Trump means Bitcoin number go up comma means number go down at least for a while but like let's before we before we get too much deeper into this election stuff which we've talked about as at nauseum let's give let's give the people what they want to hear everybody wants to talk about the goat the dollar signed goat um that well okay just in case you've been living under a rock there's an AI meme coin now which is like you know a Confluence of um everything that people are looking to fomo into Mark Andre gave 50 Grand to a robot and the robot made a meme coin and now the meme coin is worth you know 100x what it was worth five days ago and everybody's getting all excited do you think we see like a you know Giver Avi do we see like a white hot the goat let's get an opinion on the goat between now and the election and an opinion on Meme coins salana and this stuff in a trump win scenario versus commo AB do you wantan to go first or yeah yeah I mean look it's great great question Jonah thank you for asking me about goat look sometimes you have these things that just capture capture the moment like cap capture the zeist I mean do I think that goat exists in meaningful way in a year very unlikely uh do I think that it can get to two billion in a short period of time potentially uh I'll be honest with you like the way that I view memes is very much so like what is the actual popular appeal of this thing right an AI created meme coin I just don't think it has Mass Appeal in the same way that a cute dog and a hat does like you know just shoot me but I mean it's like a very clearly crypto oriented like Tech I think I think this I agree with you but I think this meme is exactly like Bowden and I would have bought it if I hadn't moved all of my salana onto a centralized exchange to do all the active trading that I've been doing recently like I I have none on chain to go and buy goat and I should have but like I view Goat as this the same thing as Bowen we're going to get this wild Arc up to you know some stupidly large number and then it collapse back down to zero for exactly the same reasons that you just mentioned AI like I think that I mean like listen listen that that I think the Bowden chart you're right I think the Bowen chart and the Goat chart are going to look very Sim yeah they're like there's like an oh my God moment for both of them but like literally no cultural staying power yeah I mean and that doesn't mean you can't make a ton of money on it it doesn't mean it can't go to a billion I do think that in general I mean meme coins are just so very clearly here to stay you know F funds are allocating to meme coins now it's kind of nuts just across the board it's just the best gambling ever uh I mean the the only two meme coins I personally own I mean I actually you know I'm not going to mention them because I don't like mentioning small caps but I I I do think that kind of regardless of where Bitcoin trades as long as it trades above 60 you're you're going to have you're going to have some months where or sorry weeks where meme coins rip so I mean that's just my answer this so the short answer is that I think go will do very well and so this this last 24 hours I compiled a series of thoughts outlining I think the conditions in which mcoins do well and they're they're their usefulness in terms of effectively what I think mcoins do is mcoins produce uncorrelated returns with respect to um being a store of value relative to everything else goes on crypto and so if you look at if you regress for example salana price against Bitcoin which I did since 2021 r squared is something like 0.6 and that is that is when you capture solanus price all the way going from $1 to 200 and then back to like you know 150 which is this year right that's a good point actually I never thought about meme coins as being like uncorrelated with the what's important is that that correlation which I tested it grows with size and so the salana if you look at its correlation this year like year today the correlation with Bitcoin is like 0.8 r s but if you look at salana in 2023 against Bitcoin when salana was you know smaller it was like 20 bucks right correlation was 0.7 and then when you look at it from 2021 it was 0.6 which means that which indicates that as the size of salana has grown larger its correlation to bitcoin has grown deeper and so I tested this with some of the meme coins that have went from zero quite literally zero right zero to being very big effectively a billion dollars I looked at M popcat Whi and pepe and I I came to two novel conclusions the first of which being that the statistical covariance between these assets was the lowest amongst popcat and popcat has taken the longest time to develop it's spent the most amount of time this year in in in in a smaller uh a window of size right sub 500 million sub 200 million I don't know what the exact inflection point is but then I also realize through looking at these charts each one of these seemingly incredible meme coins that have come from you know from from the from optically coming from nowhere once they reach their all-time high or once they reach a high they have never been able to surpass that again these meme coins have reached their largest valuations in critical periods of macro uncertainty and what I mean by that is whiff had its run from Z to two billion or $253 from December to March where there was skepticism around whether or not the BTC ETF would would keep Capital abundant right whether or not these these passive biders were here for real and during btc's incredible run up from 49 to 73 Whi did very well and then ever since then whs whiffs never touched that point again and then Pepe comes in and hits6 billion goes from three to six billion during April and May around the Insurgency around the Israel Hamas War MOG and Mew are able to go and double their valuations around the uncertainty around the E ETF in July and August and popcat runs to a150 eclipsing a billion doll for the first time in September where there was uncertainty about the rate cuts and granted this is a very small sample size but to the extent that we can find a replicable process with mcoin selection and identification we are in a very critical period today where there's a lot of uncertainty around the Trump election I think that well well articulated and when it comes to Market sizing I think only time will tell and time is what we don't have left unfortunately but Giver I really appreciate it you coming on the Pod this was really fun appreciate it love love love listening to smart people this was this was a great conversation um we gotta have you back on some time thank you for having me I appreciate it and uh sorry for the technical difficulties no worries i' I've had plenty of those myself helium helium all right nothing with financial advice uh we're we're all idiots we we just know each other from Twitter don't listen to us anyway till next time thank you thank you everybody adios [Music]

all right we're rolling all right awesome looks like we're live we've got a very special guest for you guys today we've got the giver lazy vager on Twitter who is known for some pretty amazing and in-depth posts which is rare for the Twitter sphere rare for CT normally it's to ship posts um you know I've been following him for a while and I've always appreciated the approach that he takes to the market which is extremely thoughtful and genuinely rare and so here to talk about how we can make the most amount of money possible by actually thinking about our problems thank you for joining us thanks for having me guys uh let me know if uh the audio quality is is good you um you're cutting in and out a little bit uh yeah but there's a delay but it it should hopefully be okay are you on that helium Wi-Fi you guys hear me yeah yeah we can hear you I think I'm on that helium Wi-Fi can you guys he oh there's definitely definitely a delay also you got some weird background noise Giver let me uh let me let me close some stuff I don't I think it might be because my GPU what are you what are you doing with that [Applause] GPU this is so freaking nerdy the GPU immediately starts typing away yeah we speaking to a human yeah he's he's speaking to his GPU and code Jonah what's with the John Deere hat well while we're waiting for the giver to get his [ __ ] together let me tell you about my John Deere hat which is in stark contrast to your Harvard Business School hat so please note that it says Harvard Business School Dad okay so maybe you've got some some Manchild you want to tell us about some biological freak stuff going on anyway um my John Deere hat I got it at man camp uh which in the ear of cancel culture got renamed to human Camp um but basically man camp is an event that my buddy hosts every year it starts at Lake Geneva in Wisconsin you drink beers go tubing Do America stuff and then we drive pickup trucks out into the Wilderness that my buddy's um Father's Farm in northern Wisconsin shoot guns Drive John Deere tractors around cut down trees um like build build fences and you know just basically like do you know what in the past would have been called man stuff but now it's just human stuff and uh I got this hat and you know just being like kind of a kind of like a West Coast liberal City kid um I feel cool when I wear this hat I feel like you know American yeah yeah yeah like a real real American so you wear that around the Mean Streets of London Mean Streets of London what's wrad blooded hey we can hear you okay I closed out like 50 browsers I think it was a technical technical difficulty as my what what were what were in those 50 tabs curious maybe maybe we can start there like what is what is a day in the life of the giver's computer look like look at these comments bro is mining to computer um goes all tabs bro oh man yeah you're still on a bit of a delay like are are you in are you in the developed world or it's lagging like crazy it's lagging like crazy are you are you from like in Costa Rica or are you in a developed country I'm in the US oh no not a developed country get the starlink he's he's in a hurricane Zone oh man anyway we can keep talking about my hat while The Giver gets his Tech set up we'll edit all this out later um God the uh the chat's really going off they really like they're convinced that you're looking at porn man close hentai cat tabs King I mean honestly why would you why would you look at porn when you can just pull up trading View and look at the Bitcoin chart I mean that just just sense Bitcoin that's that's better than anything I could be could be watching I mean it's like a it's truly truly a beautiful beautiful looking chart flows flows are looking good altcoins are doing poorly which is a great sign you know I I'm I I know I know I'm normally the resident the resident bear and I still advise you know not not to ever go like ridiculously levered but I mean basically ever since we flipped 60k I it's been the Market's been different you're seeing flows into the you're seeing real flows into the ETF uh you're seeing the narrative shift pretty tremendously in favor of Bitcoin and in favor of crypto because equities are punching all-time highs people aren't worried about data as much people aren't paying attention to every tiny little bit of information that they can get about the economy because things seem to look good and the way that I always think about it is you know when you're in crypto and you trade crypto there's a specific flow of money and the flow of money is Bitcoin does well and then it goes to altcoins and that's what happens on the macro level too with the equity markets Equity markets do well people want to keep outperforming they go down the risk curve they push money into Bitcoin and I think that's a little bit of what's happening I mean it's a combination of that and a onetoone correlation with the odds of trump getting elected and what you are seeing right now is you're seeing that traditional Finance like all of your funds out there are figuring out okay well if we think Trump is going to win where are we putting our money and Bitcoin is the answer I mean look at look at the CME Futures open interest is at the highs and the reason is because people are crowding into the trade where's basic right now it's a good question don't know um there there is no bet like I agree with you there is no better Trump trade than Bitcoin I think bitcoin's like an easy two bagger uh which like which and you can deploy a lot of capital there which so if you're a trafi guy just go and buy ibit and like you know you just brought up the ETF flows they're massive 11th of October 250 million 14th of October 550 million 15th of October 400 million 16th of October 458 million like these are Mega numbers and sir go ahead yeah I mean I didn't have a long rant on this I was more just thinking like if you're sitting in a Trad seat and you see Trump's odds going up like you could put 50k to work on poly Market or 500k or you could put you know like literally 50 million hundred million dollars to work in a Bitcoin ETF I think that's what's going on here I mean 100% there's actually one stock that I I like to look at as a trump proxy and I think it trades pretty aggressively with Trump odds and that's the go Group which is it's basically a Geo I'm not advocating for it I'm just saying that it does trade very closely with Trump odds and that's because uh they run a lot of the I mean they they basically run detention centers at the border and they get a lot more Government funding when somebody like Trump is in charge than camel so that has also traded extremely well it's basically traded with BTC and what that tells me is if all of the Trump trades are trading like BTC and BTC is trading like the Trump odds that's really what's driving this move that is the whole that's the whole thing right now is that people are allocating because of because of trump and so the way we can hear you Giver you're back he all right I'm on my phone but it seems like I'm still lagging I uh I'm not sure if it's the Wi-Fi or stream streaming just might be too highrise for me highrise for your no image for my yeah for my uh iPhone for my iPhone 10 well honestly like we're we're a iPhone 10 so you're tell sorry you're telling me I've been taking advice from somebody on the internet that uses an iPhone 10 you don't have enough money to upgrade and I'm supposed to be listening to you the [ __ ] is going on I'm a I'm a f guy I'm a f guy I'm like Jesus Jesus yeah the guy saves his CPU budget for mining whatever it is that you were mining to I mean look like look I'm I'm pretty sure even Warren Buffett has something he what does he drive is Toyota Camry and he has like one sandwich a day for McDonald's but he probably probably has an iPhone 11 or better it's an iPhone it's an iPhone XR it's an iPhone XR it's uh let's give some I have one of those no no this this is great we can hear you now perfectly giver and I appreciate your uh I appreciate not not like falling for the apple shill of every single upgrade cycle what I actually missed phone wise I had a BlackBerry Pearl that was my second favorite phone and then my favorite phone was when I was a kid we had this like you guys may remember this um it was like a landline but it would allow you to roam away from the base station like kind of uh you know you would extend the antenna way up and walk around the house those things were cool I missed those yeah I I had a Blackberry as a kid and then I loved it I love the Cy eore and then I think uh I got an iPhone for my birthday for my 18th birthday and then and then I've had two iPhones since I get an iPhone usually every five to seven years I think I mean that that's pretty solid you know I appreciate the frugality it's good it's good you don't see that very often in CT I will say that I never had a phone with a physical keyboard so I I don't I don't know what you guys are talking about went straight to the straight to the touch screens that's why my brain is fried that's why I'm built for this because you know since since the beginning just been fed straight dopamine I played I played uh I'm a big gamer well I'm not not not much anymore but I was a big gamer when I was uh when I when I was in school so I would always play on like my 10-year-old laptop because it could run League of Legends fine like League of Legends is a very low performance game so I would always just never upgrade and I could never play any of the games my friends would play because I could never make the CPU requirement so how'd you get into crypto what like tell us your crypto Journey yeah sure happy happy to the start um so I would say in 20120 2021 I would say mid 2021 um just by circumstance it was just through a colleague of mine effectively told me like hey like there's this group of guys where you know we we talk about markets we talk about Finance talking about crypto um you know I think you'd be a good fit and then I was like okay well I don't know anything about Market markets I'm not very keen on markets um you know I'm just I just want to stick to what I know which is at the time um you know was still on the sou side and so you know got got in there and then at that point you know I didn't know I didn't know much so I just like pretty much looked at a coin market cap or coin Geo or whatever set I was using at the time and then I just DCA but where I DCA it was like it just happened to be like the summer of 2021 like just by pure luck so it was it was it was it was when prices had largely crashed like I remember something I I distinctly remember is I was buying polka dot at $10 and then you know and I wasn't you know I wasn't trading right I was just dcing being kind of like a you know call quote unquote long-term investor and then I got I started getting really busy again in in around around September October I didn't really um you know monitor the performance of my portfolio and then by I I want to say end of October or November of 2021 I click over my portfolio and and I'm just up uh a ton of money right like I remember polka dot I think it was at like $60 and I remember DCA into this at like 10 and I was like what what is going on like I I don't I don't know what's happening but I'm up a lot and so you know in the journey in the search for wanting to better understand what was happening um I checked out Reddit I checked out Twitter I checked out a little bit um and then you know browsing through crypto Twitter I think the first few people that I followed just happen to be guys like satar um Darren Lao from not three Lao and then I just you know by getting very you know interested by what was happening with defi I thought it was super super cool and so I started writing about defi myself um I remember just one day randomly I learned about M I learned about treasury backed tokens and my mind just natively jumped to the possibility that there there was some degree of intrinsic value uh looking back at this now you know what a funny thought right but there was some degree of intrinsic value with appropriating kind of a valuation based off of kind of the underlying reserves backing a a oh token and so I wrote about that um on Twitter it was my first post ever I randomly you know not randomly there was some thought that went into my my name or my pseudonym but um you know I posted it and then overnight it got a thousand likes and it I've been shared a lot and I got like 2,000 followers and in one in one evening and you know I just from there on um you know I started writing about stuff as kind of a Pion project on the side it's pretty exciting um I I respect people like you who are able to just grab a bunch of Engagement from like kind of go from zero to 60 it took me it took me a year of like bragging about myself and my my job title on LinkedIn and promoting myself from a large account to gain a foothold into people's mind share in terms of thoughts about crypto so it speaks like I I enjoy your post too like I it speaks to your your writing and Analysis abilities um that you were able to kind of hit the ground running like that it's it's extremely rare so then what happened to your bags in 2022 did you just get absolutely card it out or did you dodge the bullet to to a little bit of both to some extent so I actually maybe just on your point around there I I think initially when I thought about branding I I I mean I think even today like exceptionally even more so this year like my Twitter account is somewhat of of a challenge to myself on you know if I have kind of what it takes I'll just put it that way um and so like sometimes even on telegram or or other venues other than Twitter I'll I'll purposely be anonymous or at least like not not brand myself because I I want to be evaluated on kind of the Merit of of my thinking um and sometimes people can be biased if they know who you are um maybe they'll be too too too uh too too happy to degree um and so you know this entire journey I would say from 2021 I've been treating it as a way to express kind of my thoughts and see whether they hold up in in in the Market's eye and so so from writing about om tokens um I really just you know I I I was so infused by what was going on around that time I thought D5 was the next Bay thing I mean I to some extent I still think so I mean when I learned about rehypothecation through an app like Abracadabra and Magic internet money and a lot of the stuff Daniel esta was building I was I was completely enthralled I I I thought wow this is completely unaccessible outside of this little spere on on the web um and so I started writing more about def I wrote this piece on um when when Danielle wanted to convert the time piece or the time vehicle to being a spack um I wrote about nfts and then closer you know maybe to answer your question more more specifically um you know I was not trading you know I was accumulating positions in spot that I thought would do well and I made a lot of money from like um how do I put it like identifying good game ofi yield Concepts and nfts I I thought that was kind of the my closer to my core competency and so I kind of ran it up honestly from maybe like I put in like I want to say 25 to you have to imagine like I'm still very I'm still at this point in my career I'm still very young so I don't have that much disposable income so like maybe 25 you know to to 50,000 and then I think I grew it at like probably my my Peak was probably like 300 to 350 just from understanding I think better than others the the life cycle of some of these uh tokens and and memes and then I came around uh Luna and us and you know I think my initial thought was it's too good to be true but it's obviously you know it's a top Luna by itself is a top 10 Market Gap coin uh at the time the the The Branding around it was like Soul Lun navx which was like three coins that were each and kind of the alt Titans and then galo's Capital who's Kevin Z he wrote something on Twitter that really caught my eye and I started collaborating and talking more with him both on Twitter and privately just discussing kind of thoughts around Luna and I think our conclusion at that time was that it would be a death spiral downward and so um we talked about that and it kind of kind of happened the way that it did and then either before or after that there was this gentleman named zerox hems who uh you know even to this day he had this magical ability to very you know I think as I've gotten older in my career something that I'm still not great at and trying to get better at is being able to this still very complex or hard to understand concept in a very easy and to understand a simple way I think that is white magic and this guy was excellent at that um he put together like just very complex macro Concepts and was able to just very easily distill it and and like showing a table on Excel or some sort of graphic and and not being very rose and you know I talked with him a lot and he was very bearish on vus finance or waves the time and so through these two connections I really grew my stack in shorting these these Concepts but because shorting was a tool that was very foreign to me or just trading in general um you know because longing you can just own something right you being you know effectively owning Bitcoin is you could say it's a it's a somewhat of a short against Fiat but you know owning pretty much any asse in crypto like you're just naturally you're naturally ly right just you can just buy it you don't have to monitor the position but being short you have you have to borrow against something or you actually have to go to an exchange um or a DEX and and you know click a red button and so I remember I was shorting Luna and I was making just all the way from like 100 because I think I was very early on to shorting Luna and because I didn't know anything about risk management or or sizing or anything like I actually knew nothing um I was you know putting on big leverage and I was shorting every every Spike so from $100 I shorted it to maybe like 75 and then I took all the money off and then when it went to 70 I thought oh wow this is going down more so I I reloaded my position at 70 and then it went to 50 or 45 and then I took chips off and then at 40 I I jammed it all in again and so I made like I want to say 250 in the span of a few hours and then I remember reading GCR tweet at that time and he said around $30 or $40 I vividly remember him saying okay I'm closing out my bet like there's still more to go but I don't you know I don't it's going to be a crowded trade eventually and I don't really want to compete against these people when it's going to get Choy and I I thought to myself well this guy isn't all he's talking about he he's there's so much more room to go and so I just kept Jam Ming money in 40 to 30 to 20 and then I just got crushed so all that money that I made that day it just completely zeroed out like I lost all my unrealized gains or realized unrealized realized gains I lost I want to say half my net worth at crypto that I grew at that time and then through just the brutal reality of being in a down spiral with uh owning a liquid asset some of the nfts I own those down spiral too and then I eventually found myself in a very compromised position where um I didn't have enough liquidity to support some of the positions that I had open from naively Trading some of these assets and I just got zeroed out so I still had a little bit of money and then with the little bit of money which is effectively the principle that I joined with in crypto I that was still an FTX and so then effectively through FTX I got zeroed out there and so this entire Saga ends with having made no money during uh the 2020 and 2021 cycle I think that's a that's yeah that's sorry that's a pretty amazing amazing story just because I think you you clearly articulated how how you learn the lessons I think a lot of people end up learning lessons like that but it tends to be from the long side not necessarily the short side I think there very few people that get burned in crypto first on the on the on the short side so that's definitely definitely an interesting story and it does talk a lot about the irrationalities of the market and just understanding you know how to how how you extract money from this Market uh can sometimes be divorced from you know long-term reality and in fact it often is divorc from long-term reality so you know when I whenever I read your post specifically um there there's a lot there's a lot of thought that goes in that goes into these posts there's a lot of analysis there's there's you know sometimes sometimes good good amount of you know math involved in this analysis but often when you produce content like that you're implicitly thinking longer term because short-term moves in crypto tend to be extremely extremely noisy and so I'm curious like how you how you balance that now like how have you yeah learned from that experience to balance fact that oftentimes when you think deeply you're implicitly thinking long term uh but obviously crypto moves pretty violently shortterm that's a great question I I think I think the first thing that that that is a helpful leg to answer this is that over time and as I've gone more senior in my career and then I I pivot to the buy side in in traditional finance and um you know in terms of developing some Acumen there something that I've I'm very conscious of today is that there is a very large divorce between thinking about an asset or an instrument between a private market and and the public market and crypto definitely fits into the into the ladder and so one of my biggest learning lessons from the previous cycle and even one from maybe you could even say earlier this year um and it's not it's not uh it's not novel you know it's just that markets can remain you know irrational longer than you can remain solvent and so especially in a in a crypto class espe an asset class at crypto where there's an incredible amount of of reflexivity uh and hype what I thought would be a more strong you know fundamental lens of approaching assets maybe in the last cycle um you know it didn't I learned it the hard way and it didn't pan out the way that I thought it would so very clearly to me that was an indication back then you know that I hadn't solved anything you know that I I was still missing um I was still missing something and you know it's back to the drawing board because you know I I made no money and although I was right at certain points I was also very wrong at certain points and it didn't really feel like I had an edge and so you know similar to you know playing poker um which I did a lot of um in my 20s there's just no point in doing something to me if I don't feel like I can express an edge over it you know and um I think earlier this year that was kind of the first time in my life where I had thought that public markets were really interesting you know up until this point and I would say with most people in private Equity or on the buy side um okay let's let's yeah's let's let's main state for private career and private Equity today I think most nine out of 10 people probably couldn't even tell you what the Ford PE earnings for the S&P 500 are there are there's a big Chasm between evaluating something from a okay what what should this be worth and what is our willingness to pay for it and what have people paid for it in the past which typically tends to be the the precedent uh it used in developing a mental model in the former and then the latter which you know it has a lot to do more with capital consolidation you know economic theory so let me let me just let me just dive in on that for a second it sounds like you're you were an investment banker and now you're in private Equity because you said you went from the cell to the buy side and you're talking about Equity valuations but you're not a Trader so I don't want to dox you too much is that is it okay to talk about it that way yeah that's that's right okay so okay so I mean I've I've rubbed shoulders with a lot of your your folks from my career and I find that if you go into Investment Banking and then private Equity like you get the smartest best educated most brilliant thinkers but there tends to be a lack of um you know I'm I'm just speaking as a Trader from the other side of the fence inside of these institutions like there I've noticed that that crowd tends to have a lack of risk tolerance so I would like to commend you for growing the you know coones to go and and try and you know roll the dice with your own money in crypto and and and sort of self- te yourself the art of trading I think is super interesting now let me just ask you on on what you just said talking about public Equity Market valuations private Equity market valuations and crypto kind of all in one one uh conversation so let me try to tie those strands together what is your Edge in private Equity valuation and what is your Edge in crypto and are those two edges related great question I would say the edge that I'll take from from my world is perhaps a more rigorous understanding of of just the backbone supplying what an asset should be worth in in a theoretical roomm and that can often be helpful in creating a floor or a ceiling on on on on Guiding toward a range and then understanding where one should be in that range and if it is time or what is what what could catalyze dislocation in or out of that range is probably the hard part to learn with public markets and what I've strived to get better at this year I think it's probably the way that I would put it I think this is why we love your tweets because we in the crypto world are so used to this mid curve meme where it's like oh doing work is stupid we don't need to invest time in understanding valuations just hold on for dear life and everything works out haha yay but it it doesn't right like the Market's getting more mature and more you know complex and we need these Frameworks so you know I want to poke and maybe OBU do too like let maybe should we try to figure out what the givers Frameworks are for eth for Bitcoin for public markets what do you want to talk about OB I think that I think that makes sense I do want to touch on a point that you said which I think is I mean I mean even just core to this podcast and the discussions that we have here Jonah when you think about why that mentality is so prevalent in crypto like why is the mentality of you don't have to do work you just have to think like don't think just allocate it's prevalent because crypto is are growing asset class and the reality is that the vast majority of people can't think clearly or effectively uh it it actually is very difficult to do that and what your advice to them would be in a different asset class would be don't trade right if you're not good at trading then don't trade and in crypto there's a difference because there's it's a rising tide lift all boats right if you have decided to allocate your time to an asset class that inherently you think will grow year year-over-year then yeah sure you can actually make a ton of mistakes and get bailed out uh as long as you're playing the game and you don't blow up then sure you might actually make more money trading because if you're just early to One Thing Once then you make 10 extra money and that that can feed a lot of losses right and so I think that's why that mental is prevalent but the reality is that crypto and trade every Market goes through a period where it is easy and then it gets much harder as smart people come in and so the question is as you're going through this transitionary period which in my opinion we're doing right now how do you maintain your Edge right like how do you start to flip from going I'm just betting on a growing asset class to okay I can generate edge here because there's still a lot of inefficiency there's still you know the smartest people in the game aren't playing it and I can generate Alpha and I can have a smooth p&l curve uh how do I actually get there like how do I how do I do that and it's through this type of conversation and process right it's through thinking okay well if you know should I be long or short Bitcoin well these are the 10 things that you need to look at and you need to think about and then you place them in context and then you make you make your bets right um so maybe maybe we can start there with with BTC just something concrete when you're evaluating Bitcoin I mean you you sometimes post long short left right what are you what are you actually looking at like how do you how do you start to form a thesis on where Bitcoin is going it's a good question uh I don't I don't even know if I've very consciously thought to myself this so I will this is this will be my first attempt at um at explaining out myself I I I think that you know at the core let start this at the the core of all these assets it is it's just a very natural Supply demand curve right and then you know the where price meets happens to be where the equilibrium sets and certain movements you know like standard micro Eon 101 class sort of movements can shift either a curve right left um where where price matures or meets at a different point and I would say today and over these last four to six months as I've tried to think more classically about markets I don't even I would say like I don't even look at really a lot of the stuff that other people look at to begin my train of thought for so for example with Bitcoin when I was thinking about when I was thinking about China when I was thinking about um the 50 bips rate cut when I was thinking about even this last week and how this will go into the into the election I start with kind of a hypothesis around where where I think central theory is in terms of how positioning is being aggregated from consensus and then I ask myself is there enough volume is there enough is there enough flows or capital to support consensus today without new money coming in and if I think the answer is no then I will probably start to do some work and look at I'll look at you know I'll I'll pull up vo I'll look at oi but I think I got asked a question like this on the stream the other day like how much do I or sorry on the what's my Edge podcast which was how much do you trade off macro and my answer to that was the the the the weight that I assign Mac on macro is the inverse of how other people are looking at it so if someone if if the rhetoric happens to be that a certain event like fomc or I don't know CPI or jobs is very important then I will personally probably flatten risk into it or take a contrarian view that it's not influential and and start and start a position there and I think what I love about crypto markets specifically more than other public instruments and especially against you know private Equity put it this way markets are very Snappy I think you can ascertain quite quickly whether or not you are right directionally and sometimes it will take a little bit more time but compared to the life cycle that you can make a beted on in the private room which can be extended artificially through through you know bankruptcies and you know restructurings and Etc like that with stuffing crypto you will pretty much know within like a week or two weeks or even maybe at Max a month on whether or not the that you're making is correct and so for me I take a very I think different approach compared to most people where most people I think they structure their setups around how the chart looks and they have a very light you know let called light depth wide bread with respect to thinking about most events and that is where I think the first order Trader is and so if I have no Edge in understanding setups nor nor do I have the well eagerness to learn then I just have to be doing something different to win right like I just I can't be doing what everyone else is doing or if if I am I needed to do it better than they are and that is probably likely not possible so for me that means just going very deep and maybe concentrating and and not going as wide and so what that usually means is I'm looking at time frames in the next two weeks to a month and I'm trying to be predictive on what that setup looks like rather than be reactive because I don't have specialization and execution compared to other people um or trying to predict things out from a six to 12 month lens um which you know there's a lot of info or or that I can kind of Jar up that that perspective Okay so just just just to ask you a question on that yeah what's if your if that's your Edge your next kind of like your two weeks two week window is sort of where you feel you know in your comfort zone yeah and you you say that you know on this podcast we like to talk all the time about how the news itself doesn't matter it's the second derivative of the news so if everything looks euphoric you have to ask yourself not is it euphoric Ergo be bullish that's the wrong question the question is like is it going to get more euphoric or less euphoric we talk about this all time so right now you know you kind of mentioned it too there so just you know kind of tying those two conversations together uh things just really started looking up for crypto right um crypto's a trump trade Trump's odds are are on the on the rise we're starting to feel good here um everybody's getting excited and piling in you mentioned uh you know you mentioned something within the context of fomc and rate cuts and how you wanted to fade that sentiment which sort of speaks to my second derivative conversation are you are you looking at this and saying like hey it's going to be pretty tough for um inflows to confirm the level of current Euphoria so I'm selling into this pop or you are you like hey this is the real thing like it's time to get even longer here what do you how are you positioning yourself with with your you know sort of Edge and your time Horizon so the quick succinct answer is that I am that short my which um I formed two days ago exactly on the dot um and I haven't spread this publicly I've mostly discussed this with maybe like two or three friends um so last week I I believe um you know when price was still circling the low 60s um due to you know possibly the US government selling um you know lot of reasons why you know price can chop in in the 60s which is the range we've been bound bound in for for how God knows how long I uh I didn't really have a a Vi at that point in time like I was I was long to start sorry I was short to start the month and then I got long around National week because I thought that there could be you could kind of scout a nice domestic kind of Chinese Market opening that could tie in you know easing effects or in people's mind to to to buy a Bitcoin as a risk proxy and then I flattened out and wasn't really you know I've been secularly short some alts for for quite some time now that I I'm still holding on to those positions but other than that I I was still like I was very this probably the lightest I've been in my book I want to say for three months three to four months and didn't have a view um because I had a lot personally I had a lot of uncertainty around what the Trump runup could be like and and how that would how that would manifest and so didn't have a view and then when we when we went below 60 to 59 I started shorting very lightly you know very very lightly on on ethereum and soul um because I thought that you know from from a pure mechanical perspective you know possibly a little bit more downside to scalp off of and then we raced you know to 62 and um you know I I was still monitoring I wasn't really sure what was going on and then over the weekend we um went very quickly from 6 6162 to I like 64 or 65 like I remember I was working out actually I think it was like 1 or 2 a.m. when that happened on Sunday and everything followed like e here in salana follow to and again I was still a little puzzled um you know wasn't adding on additional exposure because I wasn't really sure what was going on and so it took a few days to and then I you know I looked at I I still you know given the uncertainty you know wasn't outspoken about what was going on and then as the following days led up I looked at more data points and just somehow I there was like a light bul moment for me where I think I Le I just put two and two and one together and I think what is happening today and I'll try to distill this I think we are in a chicken or the egg situation right now with respect to to bitcoin and crypto assets and what I mean by that is I think the very popular rhetoric that you see echoed in that Bitcoin is a is a trade that is that has Divergent outcomes based on the outcome of the election which I think is somewhat lazy analysis in the sense that you know let's just put some numbers out there right if Trump wins we're going to 100K if Kamala wins we're going to 40 right and then we're kind of at I agree with half of that I don't think we're going to 40 if Kamala wins but interesting to hear your take go on sure yeah but so that that is like I think that is the the the you know it's it's it's sentiment right it's some sentiment that is at least you know shared and my view is that it is somewhat of the of the reverse which is the money that is flowing into Bitcoin it is unscrupulous execution right and it's it's come very erratically and at first you had Majors follow with alos and pers trending but on Monday when I realized that other assets had started eroding in terms of the ratio against Bitcoin and I looked at the Donald Trump media entertainment company and realizing that it had grown from $10 to $30 in the SP of two weeks despite no new guidance I looked at a few other things and I came to the conclusion that Bitcoin is simply being used as a hedge uh a liquid hedge or a risk proxy to manage the election risk going into the election and so therefore it is a chicken or egg situation where I think inde dependent of whoever wins this mercenary flow driven by a new class of buyer that we haven't seen that much this year is going to take off that Capital regardless because I see can you can you can you clarify who you think of as the new class of buyer sure yeah how so so I think of Bitcoin Sor I think of digital assets today I think today there are four sets of buyers I think the first set is someone is is the the very common it's the Speculator right it's somewhat it's a a class of participants that has historically been dominant I would say even last cycle maybe like 75% plus of the base was was this player and they are typically responsible for very deep troughs and very very high peaks and of course they are they're very present today I think the second uh bidder is a new bidder and they are the passive Capital bidder and they are ETF they are the ETFs and and to some extent sailor and I think it's worthy distinguishing them because I think that these guys are generally price agnostic with a with a with a healthy time Horizon because and this is you know this is an assumption I'm making of course this is not proven but the assumption that I'm making is that these biders are you know looking for diverse exposure they have been conditioned by financial advisers over the last 20 to 50 years that when you invest in something like S&P or equities or you know obviously something much more volatile like crypto assets you should have a longer time Horizon to be able to realize that six to 8% annualized gain on like on equities right and so to an extent for something like Bitcoin the the same logic applies and and so I think that is very visible because they've been BTF virus have been very supportive of price in the 50s in the 60s independent I would say of where the chart looks like whenever we've had a long liquidation event these guys have they have largely stepped up this year the Third cast are the carry bers so this is like where I would qu qualify someone like a millennium where their presence is likely someone who is they are also similarly press agnostic but they are very rate sensitive such that they are probably doing something where they might be buying ibit but they might be short CME Futures and they're effectively doing the Athena trade in real life um and so they don't these three bitter so far I would say don't move the needle they're not moving the needle this month the ones who are moving the needle are the event driven buyers and this is the type of participant that I think was responsible for the grayscale E discount closing in one day from the 194 announcement in July it's the same bidder that put on a lot of OI when there was initial rumor uh initial uh you know kind of rumor Milling around the Strategic Reserve asset from Trump it's basically listeners of the THX podcast the event the event buyers of crypto assets and crypto link assets correct exactly and um and these guys are they're not sticky they don't they are here to monetize either they're here to monetize uh naked view on how Bitcoin will do into into the into the rally or they are using it to hedge for example like if they are you know for example if you are a public risk manager and you have liquid positions in industries that are going to benefit of on a Harris W and you're looking for a trump proxy is it easier to invest in something like Bitcoin which has a lot of deep liquidity and it's you know G and you could kind of sell out of this position whenever you want or maybe something some an industry or a company that you just don't have enough time to get up the speed around um like coal or energy or something that is maybe very unfamiliar and not not possible to buy your mandate um so I think you know therefore this event driven by bidder this fourth cast they are not sticky that Capital will unravel and most importantly right this is the most important part of this thesis this is not Capital that recy into the ecosystem it is static it stays in IIT it stays in CME it stays in Bitcoin and it doesn't recycle elsewhere and that is my explanation of why you have erosion in alt e and soul against Bitcoin because if this was truly let's say a a risk on buyer someone who's here to speculate on the outcoming election is going to be there afterward or someone who is simply interest who got reawakened into Bitcoin wants exposure then you would see more diverse buying especially in something like e right look at the BTC inflows that have occurred the last few days it's been 500 mil 200 mil 300 mil incredible appetite right ethereum the ETF is is pretty much zero it's zero and so to the extent that you are looking for divers diversification or diverse exposure you would think that there would be more appetite or spot follow through to generate interest in other proxies to bitcoin but it's not happening and the reason I think it's not happening is because this capital is happy to stay in Bitcoin it's not moving out of it and Bitcoin can do very well certainly can do very well in the next two weeks and so I'm not I am actually long Bitcoin but I am short quite literally everything else um and I so I think there is a world where Bitcoin can go to 70 71 72 73 especially if Trump wins could be a you know Echo chamber and we could get a very reflexive bit upward but even in that situation I don't think that Trend carries over with other assets and so that is the positioning that I'm happy to be in today that makes sense and you know I I follow I follow the logic of your argument I do want to offer two pieces of push back just to see how you respond to it sure the first the first is that yes we've seen we've seen a lot of mercenary capital before right we've seen a lot of pre-positioning for things like the Trump conference for the Bitcoin ETFs a lot of these a lot of these moves were driven by an massive increase in semiopen interests and that's generally trifi coming in pushing up the prices and speculating the question is why right like why are they doing this are they doing it solely because they want to bet on Trump winning and just on the day that Trump wins then the entire thesis is played out or are they betting that Bitcoin is actually going to flourish under a trump regime right and if it's the latter then they probably actually hold their positions and they could hold it for a multitude of reasons one of the things that I was talking about uh before is that when if Trump does get elected you have this Doge like quality that attaches itself to bitcoin and what do I mean by this after Elon Musk mentioned Doge for the first time people bought Doge solely on the speculation that he might mention it in the future and then outperform for months right and that I think can happen again with Trump it'll fade over time as it did with Doge and it'll come back down and the speculators will watch out but at least for the month post a trump presidency there's going to be rampant specul I mean maybe even until inauguration there's rampant speculation that he may say something about Bitcoin and you don't want to sell out because there's there's this everpresent Black Swamp and then at some point that diminishes as as it did as it did with Elon and so I do think that there's there is a big right tail here for Bitcoin and with that right tail comes interest and so once you if if let's say we take this scenario for granted that they don't immediately exit their positions on on a trump presidency and Bitcoin sustains itself above 70,000 above alltime highs that's that tends to be when new people come into the market one of the reasons that we haven't had a massive Bull Run run uh across the board is because Bitcoin hasn't sustained price passes alltime high for a long enough period of time right it's just it just hasn't basically every time it makes a new alltime high it comes straight back down and so right now we're close enough that if there sustained price price action past an all-time high we stay there for more than a month then new people come in because they see the headlines Bitcoin making new alltime lines now this is this is a little bit of a weakly held argument I'm more in your Camp than what I just said but this is the counter argument that I'm making to myself and I haven't actually come to a conclusion I mean one of the things I I I I read once in a trading book somewhere that I love is exploring alternative hypotheses is the Bedrock to good thinking and so I you know I like I like to do this um but yeah I'm I'm curious what your what Your take is on that I think I think I think it's a reasonable I think a reasonable push back and I think that that is why I am long Bitcoin and and short everything else rather than just being make it short because I do think there is a degree of echo chamber that can manifest in Bitcoin I just think that I think the reason okay so like I I think as you mentioned right like price is price begets narrative in that sense that price is a signal in EV itself and I agree with that however I think an alternate approach to this is that it's just looking at the total amount of money that is here to actually support all these assets compared to 2021 in 2021 I think the peak crypto total right total one was somewhere around 2.7 trillion and that was an ERA where we had significantly more leverage we had Co stimulus checks we had 0% interest rates and why this matters um and they actually I was also on like kind of the back end of of real easing that was happening with with Co induced policies right and why this matters is because if you have someone who has $100,000 they can very easily take out many forms of debt which have seemingly no opportunity cost they can buy Bitcoin or ethereum re hypothecate that Capital at 90% LTV take out 90,000 or $85,000 buy an nft buy something else recycle that Inward and then prices growing so you're you're creating a larger buffer against your loan and you're able to get two or three times your starting capital um as an ultimate destination so price can be very reflexive in an arena like that however this year and this era um which has been you know much very choppy as you describe there is there is very little there's very there's been very limited New Capital that has come in since since January February March um and for that Capital to come in right there the conditions in which that needs to manest I don't believe reside on simply Trump becoming president I think it requires you know probably more stabilized Financial conditions and equities a looser credit cycle and time for that money if there is some you know you know for example China if that easing is real there needs to be time for that money to actually flow through rather than the speculation of which it will which is you know it's that's pers that is that those are the initial bets that are being made and so to describe the consequence of a trump win and how that could generate reflexivity I quit the possibility but it will I don't think that will manifest in like 80 85 90 by the end of the year for example right like if that happens it will take time and there will be time to build that position and certainly there is a world where we can hit 80k Plus in 2025 but when we think about the Dynamics that exist today I think that capital is coming out right I think their cost bases of this capital I would measure as being anywhere between 61 to 63 and a half if Bitcoin hits 70 that is a 10% gain on a three-week trade that money is coming out I would AR let me ask you a question let me ask you a question how many of your Trad five Peeps are hedging Equity position i s with Bitcoin because of the because of bitcoin's link to an election outcome like do you have you spoken to anyone who's actually doing this because I to me it sounds a bit crazy I'm not I'm not I'm not discounting your thesis I'm just more like I'd be stunned if somebody was like long and long some random industrial stock that would get nuked on a comma win or sorry some random industrial stock that would get nuked on a trump win because of tariffs and his long I bit as a hedge it just seems like you you talk to people who doing stuff like that I would say there's a yes or no which is people are acutely aware of the election and what benefits from a win whether or not they are taking that position themselves either at a at a professional level or at a personal PA perspective I haven't asked but I think you can I I think a very keen proy towards this to to to to generate it is is something like a you know the Donald Trump media entertaining company I think that's a very good proxy because that is effectively a meme coin in the real in the real world to proxy a win for Trump or poly Market as a way to generate interest which I think the the Gap has widened to be I could be correct incorrect but I think there's like 20% difference now between the two and so bet betting markets are are are very are very viral today um they're very there's a lot of life behind them and all these different Avenues in which you can bet on a trump win or potentially der risk into for example like let's say Bitcoin hit 70 or 71 you made 10% why roll the dice now when you've when you're up in what seems to be a very reasonable return in a Trad setting on potentially a lot of liquidity I agree with you like anybody who's just like anybody any trafi person who's just flipped a quick 10% return at scale on one of their Hedges is likely to take it off I agree with that where I where I would humbly disagree with you is the idea that this sort of like election hedging community that you bring up which you know probably exists I hadn't really thought of it before so it's interesting like the extent to which they'll matter if Trump wins um oh we just lost just lost the giver basically what I what I was thinking was if Trump wins there's going to be an overwhelming um tsunami of buide flow from new community ities of people who are just interested in having exposure to the space on the basis of you know perceived friendly uh you know friendly regulatory environment and you know perceived kind of reflexive inflows I think like anybody who's long as a hedge and you know pitch pitching out of their hedge on a wi like that flow is going to be spit in the ocean compared to the the the new invest this basically the new investors that are going to come in the new long-term holders yeah I I think I think the difference is it just it just takes time and going back to the original discussion that we had when we were on stage in Utah it's I think on a on a trump election you get you get a move up very fast and then it gets sold into because I think I actually do think it it takes time for people for people to come in and when you are you gonna have the balls to like fade a trump rally if he wins like on Election night oh it's it's just rallied 30% but it's going to sell off as people take profit so I'm going to take profit too like I wouldn't have the coone is to do that I wouldn't I mean look look look look from October 10th to October 16th Jonah October 10th to October 16th there's been three and a half billion dollars added in CME open interest I mean some of that's coming out yeah and and that I think I mean b is your signal when the CI C CME open interest starts to drop like Get Out The Way basically yeah when that starts every time anyone in the crypto Market has always been on one side of I don't think there's a single person in crypto that says that you know 24 hours after the Trump election we're going to be down that's got to like come on that's got to be a warning sign for you right like as it's not though it's not though because there there's got to be for every crypto person that we know there's literally a thousand non-crypto people out there who are going to be like oh Trump one maybe I should buy some Bitcoin now because it's safe to do so we're not talking to that Community right they're flat like they have no they have no coins you know I I I tend to believe that this is all that this pool of capital is always overestimated always okay okay that that's just that that that's just my you know that's just my belief I I also do think that the short Al trade is really tough because I think that a lot of alt should do extremely well under a Trump trump regime and so I think that they're definitely certain alts I mean you can probably short still short World coin to zero I think that's fine um I do think that things like salana probably do get a bid post uh post Trump Victory because what's interesting though I think is if that is the case then that those bets should be manifesting in line with the growing the widening odds of of trump winning right like I did a I did a study um that used July August and June as a time frame and I regress um Trump Trump's odds changing on poly Market against uh bitcoin price action and and there was very there was it's a very weak linear case and so to the extent that you believe that there is reflexive behavior that centers around a a trump Victory and okay let's let's say that that is you know maybe that can't be U looked at over a long period of time but maybe you know you make the argument that over a very short period of time perhaps that can manifest okay let's say I believe that then we should be seeing that resonate with the alts that should do well which is stuff like the D5 bucket stuff like salana these should be risk on proxies as second order derivatives for Trump so in the situation we're in today there's two outcomes based on the lack of appetite to support those flows for me the first is is that they're underpriced widely underpriced and that they are good longs to make at this point in time the second outcome is that the money that came in is not willing to bet on other markets and there is a lack of crypto native Capital at this point to put on in making that bet under a trump win and I think it is the ladder and the way that I get more Comfort around the ladder is that when you look at all these long liquidations that have happened this year of which there's been an abundant amount right every single time that we we we try to take 7dk there's been a lot in the last two or three months you know um there's the Germany there is the E ETF unwind and the displacement of of of e money there's been the um you know shorts even got eviscerated in terms of the move from others from 175 to 250 that I wrote about in August and then just very even very recently there was um you know there was kind of the the you know I I co it the the cross Panic bid unwind and Joe Jonah you actually talked about this honestly I I your your threat is what kind of give me a little bit of of of creativity from that which was um you were long oil and short Bitcoin around the um around the Iran Israel you know the War I naed that a lot of capital that was a fade oh you nailed it I'll give myself credit on that one no no I'll give you credit on that one you nailed that absolutely nail it and um I think that that's that that has more psychological impact I think that it that that people are ascribing credit to what I mean by that is if you are a risk manager and you are getting paid to to put on good positions and make money the degree of confidence that you may have at this point I I I would think would shake you to your bone to the extent that when you have such a seemingly binary view which is what this Trump Harris presidency has been has has has shown and you've been wrong possibly either the EF or you got long alts but you got long too late or you were short alts and you got blown up when it when it it got very heated or after the rates Cut Rate Cuts oh no Supply overhang markets look very good Blue Sky no clear SE uh no no clear you know Cliff overhangs F the exit is coming back you Bel long again and then you got wiped uh on the return of 60k that's a lot of damage that could impair your confidence to read these Market market and when there I mean a lot of people have gotten totally chopped on this this whole summer of up down up down and you know early fall too confidence is low um I I take your point about poly Market having a low correlation with Bitcoin that that's interesting but I think both you and I can kind of agree that correlations can change and maybe poly Market's going to be pretty correlated with uh with Bitcoin going forward to your point about hedgers and kind of to General THX viewpoint on you know Trump means Bitcoin number go up comma means number go down at least for a while but like let's before we before we get too much deeper into this election stuff which we've talked about as at nauseum let's give let's give the people what they want to hear everybody wants to talk about the goat the dollar signed goat um that well okay just in case you've been living under a rock there's an AI meme coin now which is like know a Confluence of um everything that people are looking to fomo into Mark andreon gave 50 Grand to a robot and the robot made a meme coin and now the meme coin is worth you know 100x what it was worth five days ago and everybody's getting all excited do you think we see like a you know Giver Avi do we see like a white hot the goat let's get an opinion on the goat between now and the election and an opinion on meme coins salana and this stuff in a trump win scenario versus kamalo AB you wantan to go first or yeah yeah I mean look it's great great question Jonah thank you for asking me about goat look sometimes you have these things that just capture capture the moment like cap capture the Z guys I mean do I think that goat exists in a meaningful way in a year very unlikely uh do I think that it can get to two billion in a short period of time potentially uh I'll be honest with you like the way that I view memes is very much so like what is the actual popular appeal of this thing right an AI created meme coin I just don't think it has Mass Appeal in the same way that a cute dog and a hat does like you know just shoot me but I mean it's like a very clearly crypto or oriented like Tech I think I think this I agree with you but I think this meme is exactly like Bowden and I would have bought it if I hadn't moved all of my salana onto a centralized exchange to do all the active trading that I've been doing recently like I I have none on chain to go and buy goat and I should have but like I view Goat as this the same thing as Bowen we're gonna get this wild Arc up to you know some stupidly large number and then it collapse back down to zero for exactly the same reason reasons that you just mentioned AI like I think that I mean like listen listen that that I think the Bowden chart you're right I think the Bowden chart and the Goat chart are going to look very similar yeah they're like there's like an oh my God moment for both of them but like literally no cultural staying power yeah I mean and that doesn't mean you can't make a ton of money on it it doesn't mean it can't go to a billion I do think that in general I mean mem coins are just so very clearly here to stay you know F funds are allocating to meme coins now it's kind of nuts just across the board it's just the best gambling ever uh I mean the the only two meme coins I personally own I mean I actually you know I'm not going to mention them because I don't like mentioning small caps but I I I do think that kind of regardless of where Bitcoin trades as long as it trades above 60 you're you're G to have you're going to have some months where or sorry weeks where meme coins rip so I mean that's just answer this so the short answer is that I think go will do very well um and the long answer is um actually I wrote I actually just wrote I think I published this this morning um the mcoin role the meme coin's role in portfolio composition where you know because me coins are kind of a they're kind of a mysterious phenomenon right and um I remember even earlier this month like a week or two month two weeks ago when I got asked there's a a few people asked me you know what what I think will happen with Bitcoin crypto assets Etc and I came to you know the conclusion that I came and talk to about guys just now that was two days ago so a week or two weeks ago I had no clue and I told people that I have no clue but I think onchain I said I think onchain can do very well and I don't even know actually at the time I don't even know why I said that and I remember when I started investigating that thought and I I got prompted by I I was getting coffee with someone and they prompted me on on a few things and I realize it's like oh like it aine has done very well in these last two weeks but and I thought it would and I made some bets similarly you know adjacent to that but I don't know why I thought that like let let me dig into this and so this this last 24 hours I compiled a series of thoughts outlining I think the conditions in which mcoins do well and their their their usefulness in terms of effectively what I think mcoins do is mcoins produce uncorrelated returns with respect to um being a store of value relative to everything else goes on crypto and so if you look at if you regress for example salana price against Bitcoin which I did since 2021 R squar is something like 0.6 and that is that is when you capture salana price all the way going from $1 to 200 and then back to like you know 150 which is this year right that's a good point actually I never thought about meme coins as being like uncorrelated with the what's important is that that correlation which I tested it grows with size and so the salana if you look at its correlation this year like year to day the correlation with Bitcoin is like 0.8 R squar but if you look at salana in 2023 against Bitcoin when salana was you know smaller it was like 20 bucks right correlation was 0.7 and then when you look at it from 2021 it was 0.6 which meant that which indicates that as the size of salana has grown larger its correlation to bitcoin has grown deeper and so I tested this with some of the meme coins that have went from zero quite literally zero right zero to being very big effectively a billion dollars I looked at mod popcat whiff and pepe and I I came to two novel conclusions the first of which being that the statistical coari between these assets was the lowest amongst popcat and popcat has taken the longest time to develop it's spent the most amount of time this year in in in in a smaller uh window of size right sub 500 million sub 200 million I don't know what the exact inflection point is but then I also realized through looking at these charts each one of these seemingly incredible meme coins that have come from you know from from the from optically coming from nowhere once they reach their all-time high or once they reach a high they have never been able to surpass that again and there's been a new meme coin that has been burn that that is able to be birthed afterward and even as a subsequent thought to that these meme coins have reached their largest valuations in critical periods of macro uncertainty and what I mean by that is wh had its run from Zer to two billion or $253 from December to March where there was skepticism around whether or not the BTC ETF would would keep Capital abundant right whether or not these these passive biders were here for real and during btc's in run up from 49 to 73 wh did very well and then ever since then wh wh never touched that point again and then Pepe comes in and hits $6 billion doar goes from three to six billion during April and May around the Insurgency around the Israel Hamas War MOG and Mew are able to go and double their valuations around the uncertainty around the E ETF in July and August and popcat runs to $150 eclipsing a billion dollars for the first time in September where there is uncertainty about the rate cuts and granted this is a very small sample size but to the extent that we can find a replicable process with mcoin selection and identification we are in a very critical period today where there's a lot of uncertainty around the Trump election so to the extent that you know Trump wins or you know what have you whatever meme coin flavor or choice is selected to possibly go you know maybe something else that could do very well and so that's the structure in which I I've I think I've been on chain on chain has been great there been some very expansive wins but I also think you know for what I said earlier the uncorrelated return that it provides against your positions on call Bitcoin or something else that is valid and worthy in of itself to have a position on it now do I believe in mad's Market sizing and the coins that he labeled and do we get a muon super cycle I I'm very hesitant to say that and I don't think it will but is there room for the for the for the for the asset class to expand beyond the 60 billion or so estimated by Forbes today I think so I I definitely think so I think it can grow maybe two times from here and um you know how however that man of tests I think is um is is up up up to the bidder but effectively I think to summarize these larger meme coins like Doge and sheep right and to now Pepe with Etc at this point my opinion is that they are just beta against Bitcoin they move expressively with whatever Direction Bitcoin goes but if you want and you seek an actual reason to have a meme coin in your portfolio that I think you would you know it would behoove you to look in you know places with smaller liquidity and and add that asset um as an as an actual reason to own it I think that it's well well articulated and when it comes to Market sizing I think only time will tell and time is what we don't have left unfortunately but Giver I really appreciate it you coming on the Pod this was really fun appreciate it love love love listening to smart people this was this was a great conversation um we gotta have you back on some time thank you for having me I appreciate it and uh sorry for the technical difficulties no worries I've I've had plenty of those myself heum all right nothing with financial advice uh we're we're all idiots we we just know each other from Twitter don't listen to us anyway till next time thank you thank you everybody adios

Transcript Text:
I think that there's a ton of opportunities suddenly that I haven't seen in over a year sort of cropping up in these little pockets of the market I've been super bearish altcoins versus Bitcoin and I've I've allocated accordingly but now I think that's changing like it's this is the time to lock in it's not an accident that I've sliick back my hair and dressed like Steven Seagal today like I'm I focused and paying attention and I think that is this you locking okay you know what guys I'm I'm getting excited I'm trying to make a point here screwing with my [Music] momentum all right guys how many listeners of the a THX podcast do we have in the audience let's go all right so if you're listener tox you know that this is all Financial advice you should be listening to what we say on stage and make investment decisions based off it right is that right guys that is uh absolutely 100% wrong if you ever listen to anything that comes out of our mouths you will lose money that is a guarantee so cool so that's the that's the that's the goal of today we're going to try to make uh everyone lose as much money as possible um I actually wantan to why don't we start actually we're gonna end up definitely talking about meme coins I know we were joking about uh last time we did this live panel at digital asset Summit we talked about meme coins because that's all that was going on in March then they died and here we are and it's back again but before we get into the degeneracy I want to actually get your guys take on the general macro environment so over the course of the last couple days is we've seen uh you know China have its all-in Mario Dr moment where they're throwing the kitchen sink uh from a from a policy standpoint um and we've also entered a rate cutting cycle here in the United States uh drone po uh cut rates by 50 basis points and I just want to get a sense from you guys where do you guys think we are in this General um sort of liquidity cycle I think we are on the Eve sort of the the doorstep of a major asset rally I am conviction long risk assets especially crypto because I think that this smells a lot like let's call it a smaller version of what the governments of the world did during covid I think that once you see people start to step on the gas and make monetary conditions easier more liquid and start to you know cut rates and make things uh more friendly to investors usually you get this kind of um this sort of like weird in between time where things are supposed to take off but they're not and that's your chance to jump in and get long and I think that right now the major uncertainty that crypto participants and investors are facing is the US election in November markets hate uncertainty uh but markets hating uncertainty is an opportunity for you to dive in uh just like the uncertainty of Co was an opportunity for you to dive in right before the money printer turned on and just to quickly speak to the election if they're already turning the the money spigot on again we've seen this movie before and neither Harris nor Trump have any plans to turn it off it's just a question of who can spend more and who can spend faster they're both gonna they're both going to go crazy we know this now's kind of the time where you have to you know close your eyes and Dive Right In I'm I'm a little bit more tempered than you Jonah I I think that we're definitely in an environment where things like equities can do extremely well right based on everything everything that Jonah said but we're here because we're talking about crypto and the reason I'm a little bit more tempered is because I think that it hinges a tremendous amount on the outcome of this election if Trump gets elected then obviously everything that we've been talking about for a long time starts to come true regulation starts to be a lot more clear in interest in Bitcoin probably goes up based on the way that Trump has been speaking about it uh but if KLA gets elected then we're in for a period of difficulty in my personal opinion I think that when you look at the broader macro picture uh and where people are going to allocate their money one of the reasons that equities have done so well after the FED cut rates is because the economy is doing well right and so the market interpreted this rate cut not as a panic cut into a weakening economy but as a maneuver to land the plane effectively and we're almost there right and what that means is that companies that are producing real assets that are producing real services that are generating real Revenue will do well because the econom is doing well and now they're going to be able to borrow at lower costs and expand more effectively but for something that is nonproductive right now like Bitcoin what you need really to send this into the stratosphere is you need gen General stimulus you need General injection of money for basically no reason other than fear into the market and so paradoxically my viewpoint is that a recession is probably the best outcome for this asset class that if we do have a recession then what ends up happening is that it ends up becoming a v-shaped recovery because the fed and because our government pushes all of it chips onto the table and they say okay well we're going to back stop this and now people are going to feel comfortable gambling again because there's all this excess money floating around and so to end this yapping with something a little bit you know concrete is uh I remain cautious and I remain underallocation I haven't heard the recession bull asset thesis which I find very interesting and then there's the outcome of the election and I feel like there's been an enormous amount of air time that's been dedicated to this and here like to inject a little bit of my own opinion and maybe push back a little bit AI is I don't know it's so it seems so consensus that if Trump wins then that we're going to Valhalla and if Kamala wins you know it's like nuclear Armageddon and you know winter is coming and all that stuff and I don't know every single time I don't have the gray hair that Jonah does uh in the good way Jonah but uh every single time I've seen everyone so lined up on that consensus it hasn't turned out correct so I mean what's the what's the other side for why this might not actually matter that much my my best guess for Price action and you can quote me on this is that on a trump election you get a massive candle in Bitcoin that candle gets sold into people panic out because nothing actually is going to happen in the first year of the Trump presidency or maybe six months to make this asset class go up and so then you probably get lot of fear and disillusionment and then that's probably one you actually want to buy so whatever happens on the election night if Trump gets elected and we're up 15% I am basically selling everything that I can possibly sell oh I disagree I'm buying it from you I'm I'm buying it right right out of your your uh your order book that's crazy no I I I disagree so much um yeah Obi was saying before we were doing this panel that we have to create some drama and act like we're feuding so yeah you're wrong U basically the the reason why I think you're wrong it's a fight night guys it's not too late you know uh oh no not not that kind of Feud we're we're both super athletic you're wrong say it again anyway so basically basically the reason why I think you're wrong and like let's say that we go into the election night trading $65,000 a token in Bitcoin Trump wins we're up to $75,000 a token I'm buying 75s I'm playing for 150 on that and I think that markets price the future and I think that the immediate thing that would happen on day one of a trump presidency is Gary Gensler goes back to Academia and I think that what happens on day one of a Harris presidency is you know you've seen like there was a lot of turnover in the Trump Administration you haven't seen that in the Biden Administration I think that the powers that be you know obviously you listen to like right-wing conspiracy sites or media Outlets they'll tell you you know they use phrases like the Deep state I'm not going to do that because I'm not really a partisan person I'm more of an independent but I do notice that in Democratic Administration you tend to get lots of consistency and stability in terms of like Staffing I don't think there would be much change at the SEC which basically means you have to price another four years of a legal and Regulatory strangle hold on our industry if the Democrats win versus like cowboy mode if Trump wins I think there is a big difference there and I think that if you price in the net present value of four years of you know one or the other that's worth you know tens of thousands of dollars in the price of Bitcoin you know I actually I have a question for the audience here because I want to make a point that pushes back a little bit so if you think back to uh to two years ago uh and then today in the context of your crypto portfolio who owns more altcoins today than they did two years ago I know raise your hand if you own more altcoins today than you did two years ago yeah and I assume well raise your hand if you have a crypto portfolio yeah okay you see everyone owns Bitcoin and so what ends up happening is if Trump gets elected because of the regulatory certainty that you're going to get in altcoins is I guarantee you every single one of you that didn't raise your hand uh you're going to sell some of your Bitcoin for alts because it's going to be a much better environment for alt coins so I hear this a lot in oil markets everyone everyone this everyone that everybody I talk to is long diesel everybody's short propane no everybody in this room is long Bitcoin right and I think that if you look outside of this conference center out on the street the the Mean Streets of Salt Lake City um you're looking at some people who are probably a little bit cautious and so I I'm not banking on this room's participation I'm more hoping that outside Capital comes in with more regulatory certainty I I okay definitely outside capital I think a little bit more comes in but this is a point about Bitcoin and altcoins this is even here at a reasonably Crypt native conference a lot of people have Consolidated their portfolio into Bitcoin and so good trade by the way yeah great trade if you did that that was a that that was the right decision right because you look at Bitcoin dominance it's just gone straight up I mean all coins have basically done nothing all year and what about memes and I mean memes memes have done really well M memes have done really well but I I mean actually the Jonas point they the meme segment of crypto is kind of divorced from a lot of the rest of crypto it's a lot of people that don't own anything but memes right their entire their entire portfolio it's very nft like it's very nft like it's like a lot of buckets of crypto trade based on beta to bitcoin it's like eth and salana Etc although that's breaking a little bit with eth at the moment but then it was like nfts were just they were on their own Planet they were on their own universe and they had there were two cycles actually to nfts that actually feel super similar to me to the current meme coin meta which is in the beginning there was a couple of nfts that just exploded it was like punks apes and those things just went parabolic and then there was a lull and then there was this explosion in dispersion and then there were tons of different collections they were all going up but a little bit less because there were just way more and it feels like that's where we are to me to editorialize here with meme coins where we had the first run right we had the Bonks and the whiffs ETC and there were a couple like Blue Chip memes that sounds funny to say but whatever and now it just feels like there's a a million of them I mean how do you guys feel feel about that yeah I mean I participated in one meme that I could identify with and kind of wrap my head around um Joe Bowden uh that was a fun ride for all 15 seconds but at the same time like I think that our our you know friend of the Thousand X podcast our friend anom uh says it very well he says that uh imagine you know you're not supposed to compare these to investment assets you're supposed to compare it to a casino or a lottery and if Jen Z realizes that you know instead of going and buying a lottery ticket at the gas station with a you know billion to one odds they can basically just fire up a meme with a funny cat pick and get rich quick maybe one out of every thousand times that that Lottery is going to get played all day on a global basis way more frequently and I kind of buy into that um framework I think that it is intelligent and in the absence of you know as Chris Dixon said earlier today regulatory Clarity for the more you know air quotes real use cases for crypto that's a a real outlet for some of the you know desire to accumulate wealth um kind of in our space that's sort of allowed right now so I I'm I'm not bullish memes because memes is a spa if you were equal weight all memes you would basically lose all your money uh I'm just bullish the idea of memes uh and bullish the concept of you know trading them if you can get in early to one that actually has some virality attached to it yeah I I I agree with you and I do want to step back for a second and just talk about Bubbles and mentalities towards assets like memes a lot of people outside of the crypto world view crypto the same way that people in the crypto World tend to view memes and that's okay this is nonsense and it's a complete bubble and it's going to collapse at a certain point and then it's going to die and I think that's the wrong mentality to take B with everything in life there's a way to win you just have to really think hard about it and try to find your Edge and so even if you think that memes are the worst moment most horrific thing in in this world and they're all going to die and they're all going to go to zero uh there there's a way to figure out how to invest in these things or trade these things properly uh and how to actually figure out okay well if a group of a hundred memes exists how do I rule out 70% of them and invest in the 30% that show promise of potentially going up in the future it's like as George Soros said if you see a bubble Don't Run Away pour some fuel on it light it on fire Right double you know figure out how to win that game and that's the mentality that I take towards memes uh even if you believe that these things won't have any future no I happen to believe that they will for one reason and one reason only uh there is a massive massive massive wealth transfer that's occurring over the next 15 to 20 years uh from Boomers to gen Z and to Millennials and candidly we love to gamble we love to put our money in things that might might 100x that might thousand X and you can see it when you look at DraftKings you can see it when you look at casinos uh and the reality is that this is the best casino that's ever existed on the history of the planet and it's candidly a lot of fun and so even if you don't believe in real utility there's a wealth transfer to people that believe it's going to be fun and so there're going to be a lot of people on the side line looking at it saying oh my God I can't believe this is happening but there there's a market I agree and I think that you know my advice to people who are interested in memes would be don't buy whiff that trade is already played out right buy something early get in if if you're early to the parade and this these there's no fundamental value attached to these things as we all know so if it if you're just trading a psychological bubble type asset with no underlying value you can't be the greater fool who buys the highs so the best way to ensure that you aren't that guy is to ignore literally every meme that has existed for more than a a week or two and try to get in early on some of them I I think that people who get shilled on things that like whiff and popcat and whatever else is up a lot you know that's kind of stupid so memes is a space are interesting and to ob's point about the wealth transfer that is a big infusion of cash that's going to be ongoing trillions of dollars worth are going to be ongoing it's going to make the covid stimulus look like you know spit in the ocean so a lot of that will will go into gambling on memes because that's what younger Generations do like I talk to younger Commodities Traders all the time and all they want to talk to me about is crypto they don't want to talk about oil so it's like true story so basically my my thinking on that is that as that wealth transfer occurs you know there's the saying on Twitter you have a few years to hyper gamble your way into Elite status or you become a wage cuck for the rest of your life you know it's an obnoxious statement but it's kind of true my person uh Arc has been to hyper gamble in the way that was available to me in my early 20s which was to try and become a Trader on Wall Street and now you don't need to have that you don't need to go to a good college to get a job at well I got one at lean Brothers unfortunately but you don't need to to go to an elite College to hyper gamble these days crypto is the world's trading floor and I do think we'll see a lot of younger people try to turn you know 25 50 Grand inheritance into 500 Grand like you know a gentleman that OB I spoke to earlier today so yeah I think it's going to continue is there um now I hate like I don't want to be this guy you know uh it's like but because I hate the VCS trying to over intellectualize meme coins but is there something more to this I just I don't know one of the as a consumer of memes outside of crypto on my social feeds I actually use them because they're funny but they also kind of tell me what the Zeitgeist of culture is at the current moment like an example would be after you watch the presidential debate right there's the news which I basically don't listen to very much anymore and then I look at my social feed and I see what the meme artists are doing and I kind of look at who they're making fun of and I'm like all that person lost like that is I know that's kind of silly and stupid but you know these are comedians comedians are also really good at this comedians are really good at finding out who is the incumbent in power and they punch up they just feel it instinctually because if you punch down it's not funny so you can always tell who's in power by who the comedians are making fun of and it's kind of something like that with memes you almost squint at memes and you're like is this some kind of market-based algorithm for attention and it's so early and you really have to make a stretch to make that happen but it kind of looks like that to me I mean I I actually I think you're right the only thing that I'd point out is that there's hyper fragmenti in terms of memes and content on social media and online the stuff that you see is not the stuff that everyone else sees like thousands of little subcultures and subpockets and it actually is one thing that I'm generally worried makes me worried about the country is when you have these Pockets that don't interact with each other they don't talk to each other they just view their own information I mean this has been talked about at nazim so I won't talk about it here but I do agree with you on the point that they tap into something more visceral right it Taps into the unspoken emotion of what a country or town or city is feeling feeling at that moment and it is expressed through this humor and that's actually important to pay attention to because what you'll find is that you'll find that I mean if you look back at 2016 uh a huge driver of Donald Trump's campaign was his online presence where all the crazy memes that were posted on Reddit that would go extremely viral and I I actually I remember that pretty vividly that that was it got people talking about Trump in a in a in a really big ways he had this massive online presence so I do think that there's some signal in that and that you know I we started this podcast because we used to talk to each other on the phone you know maybe once a week once every two weeks for an hour and we would always come away with actionable insights and so that's one of the things I like to do on the podcast and I think why we've managed to Garner an audience is because we always we don't like to just talk high level we like to talk okay well we've talked to high level what are you going to do with it and so just to do that with the meme discussion it's exactly as you said is what what really resonates with people and when does it resonate with people one of the best ways to figure out what you should be allocating to is when you're in a low when the market is down when nobody is talking about memes maybe when Bitcoin is 52k 55k everybody's desperate Everybody's scared go into the channels go into the discords go into the Twitter chats what is still being talked about what what still has Community engagement who are the craziest mofos that you can find that are still engaged with these projects and that's when you find Alpha because a lot of the things that don't last when things look bad everybody gets out but if you can identify when things look really bad oh my god there are these five communities that are still like producing the craziest stuff uh that's actually a pretty good signal and you know I would put it on your calendar like if bitcoin's down 20% 30% run that exercise go do that I then you'll come out pretty happy so I I want to change the topic here from from memes I want to ask you guys a coup about a couple of things um Ai and then I want to ask you guys about credit and on the AI let's start with the AI side first and you know how many folks in this room use chat GPT or Claude or something like that on a daily basis how how many would you say you use it more than Google now that's nuts that is crazy if I two years ago if IID said hey there's a device that you're going to use more than there's an application you're use more than Google I would have taken the under 101 times out of a 100 and there's obviously an enormous amount of capital that's getting plowed into this space and I do wonder how that impacts the capital that might find its way into crypto we are not the newest shiniest thing anymore I feel like one of the things that crypto had going for it was all right when they open the liquidity spigots which they have to do then the money is going to flow to crypto because whether or not even you really believe in it you believe that it's going to go up because we're the riskiest of the risk on assets but now there's kind of AI and I wonder if it competes with investment in crypto what do you guys think about that I don't think it does um I think that from from an investment perspective the two spaces are except for they overlap like TOA bit tensor you know just speaking about the you know crypto as an asset class versus AI as an asset class from an Investor's perspective those two spaces are orthogonal like you don't I don't I don't see like there crypto venture capital is its own practice and its own little world and investing in AI as an individual is kind of impossible so for a retail investor you kind of can't get exposure to this stuff and as an institutional investor like you haven't really how many Benchmark like Mega VC firms are there out there there's a16z there's Sequoia there's a couple others they're not like getting rid of their crypto arm to invest in AI like that all that capital is available to both asset classes so I don't really see the two spaces as competing I see them as more synergistic uh in general because you know this is actually I'm stealing one of your arguments AI if you're a retail investor and you want to invest in AI to credit Mr fman here very wise Trader you you can't get into the best deals in the like Trad AI space you have to go for a towel you have to go for something with a token because you're not an accredited investor and so ultimately just to wrap this thought up I think that you know sorry I know you wanted to divert from memes for a second but I think that crypto xai is a meme like toao is a meme coin for now even though the use case is plausible but it's a five-year fiveyear bet it's a VC bet so for now it's just like what's going to get a good narrative and get some hype and focus and attention and I don't think it sucks Capital out of crypto yeah I mean at the at the end of the day the people that are diverting their Capital away from crypto to AI it's Silicon Valley that's that's who's diverting it but from the beginning crypto is not really a Silicon Valley thing I'll be honest most of the capital that came into crypto was from everyday people it was from randos from all across the world Silicon Valley definitely had a part and has funded a lot of you know very interesting projects but they're not a driver they they didn't build the asset class I mean they candidly Silicon Valley built AI right that's that that's their thing and and props to them for it but they didn't do that with crypto and so I do think well in the short term it diverts capital not really in in the long term and to the to the point that Jonah made uh that he so kindly stole from me and then told all of you uh you know it's true you you you can't like you just can't get in there's there's nothing that you can invest in as an average person uh other than Nvidia and maybe data centers that focus on AI I mean you can go short duelingo I guess but other than that yeah I mean the only place where AI really detracts from crypto is morale and sentiment like I remember when did it really start to blow up was it late 22 it was 23 wasn't it when Gensler basically started a big Crusade against crypto post FTX and then AI just blew up I remember crypto as a community just feeling really Bleak and bearish like oh no like now there's a new shiny thing and no one's going to care but I think what's encouraging about crypto is that um there is something Beyond just the technology crypto uh keeps central banks honest it is a foil to centralizing forces in the technology industry which AI is AI is definitely it's got this Skynet like kind of sinister quality to it and all it takes so much money and compute to train one of these big Benchmark models like what Claude or chat GPT are running on top of like that doesn't feel very good where are the articles about AI energy I've seen hundreds of these things about Bitcoin energy over the years where's all the where's all the Articles well there's I mean like Amazon just bought Three Mile Island that's a that's pretty baller I can't even fault them on that that is that is such a like if you talk about putting your nuts on the table that's a big one like that's crazy if you know sorry but it's indicative of it's indicative of how much energy they think they're going to need and you know the competitive Vector that they want to approach was just cheap energy I mean that's crazy um all right moving on from May I want to ask you guys about credit and part of the reason why I think we went up so hard so fast so viciously in 2021 was you had these desks right like the Genesis of the world that were funding these like carry trades or arbitrages which turned out not to be arbitrages uh but they were essentially creating credit uh for people that wanted to uh go long or short in crypto and that space was the biggest casualty I would say of the last bull market I mean those just blew up extremely publicly that was you know the blockies of the world that was the Genesis of the world the Celsius of the world Etc and we haven't really seen a credit complex get built out in crypto since and how does how do you guys imagine that coming back I mean it it exists it still does and you're just looking in the in in the wrong place it exists on exchanges in a huge part I mean open interest across binance okx all the places that allow you to trade on Futures has gone through the roof and you look at the CME you know I I I do think that there is definitely still some risk there um it just turns out that the business of offering Credit in crypto without other business lines turned out to not necessarily be a good business You' make money you would make money you'd make money and then when everything unraveled you would die and if you didn't have that money to you know that all these exchanges get from your actual transaction volume you just ended up in a really tough spot which is why I think nobody's tried to rebuild that business just because people realized it's a really bad business to build I kind of disagree with that actually I have a slightly more Nuance take but I you're not wrong and what I'm about to say is my opinion it's not a statement of fact but what I would humbly posit to you AI is the idea that well look when I was uh running crypto trading at drw we were big we were power users of the crypto lending industry we tra we you know anchoridge blockfi we were we were in you know Neck Deep with all these companies and from my background as a credit Trader as well what I'll say is that crypto lending is an industry there's nothing unique to crypto about it the reason why all these companies blew up is not because it's a bad business it's because they had bad risk management so if you just implemented a proper risk management framework you can hold tokens on balance sheet and lend them out without blowing up in a bare Market provided you've just analyzed the credit of the people that you're lending to and who who you know who you transact with so basically the problem with the crypto lending industry is that it was crypto native and the risk management was terrible everybody blew up in the bear what you need is somebody like a State Street or a bny melon who does stock lending and understands how to model risk and model variance and model credit which is what they do all day there's nothing unique about crypto it's just a widget that has x% annualized volatility and you run your risk models on that basically the expertise for that is not Crypton native it's trafi so I this is another Trump trade I think that if just to finish this thought sorry for rambling if Trump ramble away it's okay if if the SEC becomes friendly to crypto and provides a framework I think you will see the trafi lending industries that operate in other asset classes bolt on crypto with their existing Frameworks and do just fine but without that uh regulatory Clarity I think they're going to not touch it with a 10- foot poll yeah I mean I don't I actually don't disagree with anything that you said and when I say that it's not a good business it's because of the people that comprise it right so when you think about who is State Street going to be willing to to lend to it's actually a pretty small group of people and their borrowing volume is going to be pretty small I mean there's a sort of a limit to the size of the industry right now and if you want to go past that limit then you're lending to people that you probably don't want to be lending to so let's do a bet between you and me and maybe the audience uh can monitor this and you can bet with each other as well contingent let's not make it political contingent upon regulatory Clarity and an sc that accepts crypto's existence whe Harris could put one one in there as well as well just just like Trump could contingent upon that by 2028 my bet is that the crypto lending industry is flourishing and it just looks a lot like the trafi lending industry would you would you bet with me on that well you you have to Define what flourishing means well iolo is going to be our our judge we can we can we can hash out the details over drinks okay we can do a poly Market on this will be up in no time you know your definitional flourishing different from my definitional flourishing let's make it his defin that's perfect can we are any lawyers in here that can help us with this no please please all right guys I want to get a sense of where you see opportunity today broad question for crypto in general um you know obviously Bitcoin is kind of its own we haven't really talked about that some people CL like classify Bitcoin as its own special snowflake uh maybe Bitcoin trades differently relative to even like eth or Salon or altz or something like that depending on who wins this election but you know how do you kind of when you look out into the crypto world you know where do you bucket you know opportunity risk what looks interesting to you oh man everywhere I mean if you're a Trader it's it's everywhere this this Market is still remarkably inefficient I mean if you just do the work to figure out you know what the heck is going on with specific assets and when I mean do the work read some filings read some blog posts go look at the data I mean one great thing this year was helium started signing up you know thousands of users at day started getting contracts with a lot of the large telecom companies and it was actually a pretty good service and it was trading really poorly until people started to figure this out and it took months I mean another example is just news is poorly digested by the market and so if you pay attention to things that come out and the market hasn't reacted to it then you can put on some really nice trades I mean I I just a an example of this was when the SEC appealed the uh Ripple uh the the recent the recent Ripple filing and it took 20 minutes for ripple price to react if you're paying attention I mean that 20 minutes is basically free money right it's these things exist in the in the world of trading now in the world of investing uh what I like to do is I like to think about what's going to do really well when everyone's eyes are on this asset class like where are people which they're not right now which they're not right now which they're not so where where are people going to pay attention uh and the two best sectors that I can come up with are uh dpin and Ai and so the question is how do you invest and my answer has always been you wait for an extreme in the crypto market and then you allocate I mean I I always think it's a mistake to allocate when you're not at at an extreme so for example allocating on a day where Bitcoin is up 3% probably isn't the right move because you tend to get these like pretty nuts uh nuts days um you know and so it's it's about waiting for the right moment getting a good entry price and then allocating to the right sectors and then just waiting so my answer to your question would be like normally I'm a pretty sleepy investor in crypto I I've found that I do better when I just hold on to core positions the last year and a half has really been about Bitcoin dominance on an inexorable rise and I've been pretty much 80% in Bitcoin um I think that's changing now I think that there's a ton of opportunities suddenly that I haven't seen in over a year sort of cropping up in these little pockets of the market I've been super bearish altcoins versus Bitcoin and I've I've allocated accordingly but now I think that's changing like it's this is the time to lock in it's not an accident that I've slick back my hair and dressed like Steven Seagal today like I'm I'm focused and paying attention and I think that is this you locking okay you know what guys I'm getting excited I'm trying to make a point here screwing with my momentum obious so basically what I think like the the Chief came on our podcast and shill to not Financial advice of course and it really awakened me to the possibility of basically there are going to be pockets of crypto that take off like crazy that tend X 100x and I don't I I think toao is an early indicator of that I think that like it's it's notable that suddenly an altcoin can perform for basic like a big one can perform for basically the first time since 2021 and I think there's going to be tens or maybe dozens more of these things more than a hundred of these things and to to use avi's framework that I actually like a lot he tweeted out you have to pick the right sector and then pick the fastest horse within that sector you can't look through the Discord of every single altcoin so you basically have to pick a sector obvious said decoin dpin and AI I would say rwas Ai and dpin are the ones that I'm focused on there are a few strong horses in there and then once you see one start to break out uh during a time when just before uh it that asset class gets mainstream attention like you don't want to be allocating after a friendly SEC gets installed and then lays out a really clear framework for rwa you know crypto assets right you want to be in before that happens so basically we're we're at the point in the cycle where pre-election you have some opportunity to pick winners ahead of ahead of a big Ripper all right uh final final question for you guys we've got three more minutes here so uh how many folks are joined crypto in the last year or two something like that oh wow we got only ogs here all right never mind I was just going to say you know I think the irony of crypto is that you do have this environment where retail is positioned to make money at an earlier stage than almost any other sector that exists in the world which is awesome that's so great I also think that probably the majority of retail investors have actually lost money doing this so what advice would you guys have for someone that doesn't have the institutional training that the two of you do that wants to make money in the space I mean it's just it's all about patience at the end of the day today I think we all get very accustomed to making money very very very quickly in this asset class it's like you wake up one day in your portfolio 5x's and then you wake up in a week and it's down 50% I mean things move fast but you have to move slow uh if you don't have the time to spend you know six hours a day staring at charts just don't just relax be patient uh you know do your research make your bets and then wait and when things get like absolutely nuts you know when literally everyone in their mother is talking about crypto celebrities are painting Bitcoin on their nails you know that's when you know if this podcast starts getting like a 100,000 listeners an episode I'm out I am I am done I'm it's over yeah I I agree with the the general thesis of obious comment is don't overtrade uh I I think that overtrading you know seing it in Commodities see in crypto that's how people chop themselves up and earn very average returns in extreme parabolic bull environments and lose all their money in other environments so not overtrading is key I think um not using Leverage is key uh Bitcoin being a big part of your portfolio is key uh having liquidity to buy other assets uh when the prices look good is key but ultimately I think the the smartest way for new entrance to the space to make money is to listen to podcasts learn understand the fundamentals of the space many of which are podcast there's one called a THX I heard a good one yeah um you just have to if you find that you're not interested in the space like you're not like drinking in podcasts and content and crypto Twitter it's probably a time to dial back your activity and just sit in Bitcoin and do other stuff if you really care a lot uh the opportunities will come I found that in my Commodities career as my interest es and flows um I T I'm always better at trading when I care more so gauge your own level of excitement uh before you before you start to trade and if it's if it's objectively low you should you should ease off the accelerator all right fellas that is all the time we have guys give it up for the THX guys thank you guys so much [Music]

all right what's up everybody Welcome to a very special episode of forward guidance in collaboration with the Thousand xboys we're hosting this live from permission list we're in day one I just ran off the panel and just Sprint it over here to connect with you guys it's uh it's great to have you I've wanted to do this for a while and connect with you guys I love the way you both think so maybe we just have you introduce you both and uh what you focus on hey yeah thank you so much for having us on the Pod this is awesome and this event is awesome just looking around seeing so many people come out to permissionless it's been fun so far so for those that don't know me I'm AI Felman I've been in crypto now since 2017 and I'm professionally trading it since 2019 I've been across the entire Spectrum working at a pure crypto native hedge fund called block tower for a few years where I was the c-m of that managing the book alongside AR Paul and then I ended up uh starting the crypto division at a traditional hedge fund called Golden tree which I ran for about two years before uh now overseeing the exit of that fund to Republic and now trading my own trading my own boat so it's a pleasure pleasure to be here with you pleasure to pleasure to be here as well it's it's a real honor thank you for setting this up um my name is Jonah van Borg uh I've been a Trader for almost 20 years professionally uh I've traded most asset classes not interest rates so I got lots of questions for you on that but the bulk of my career I spent uh running CR crud oil trading businesses first at Goldman Sachs I ran the crude DS book and then I was a partner at Vall for seven years that's the world's largest oil Trading Company doing uh derives in physical and then after that I spent two years uh running drw's crypto and precious metals trading operations called Cumberland uh now I'm I'm just a energy and crypto Trader and more macro uh kind of mindset same as Obby awesome and yeah to the to the Thousand X listeners um I'm Felix host of the forward guidance podcast go on Twitter as as fijo um you know I've been a been a pretty avid participant and listener to you guys' live streams um really enjoy it so it's gonna be a ton of fun to be live here um and yeah you know just in the spirit of of being a collaborative episode I'm GNA ask some questions you guys you guys are GNA ask me some questions we're gonna have some fun back and forth um yeah I want I want to get into it I want to ask Jonah some some questions about oil and the energy space um getting right into it here so obviously there's been a lot of geopolitical conflict and that's been leading to some idiosyncratic Moves In in oil and energy markets that's a realm that I have you know I'm pretty happy to admit I don't have any EDG in whatsoever but like you said you've been an oil Trader for very long time so I'd love to just get your take on what are you seeing there and what's your perspective on it yeah oil is a very I'm glad you asked oil is a very misunderstood Market it occasionally is relevant to other markets that the broader macros space pays attention to now is one of those times and you see the tourists come into oil and they don't know what they're doing so let me just give you a quick overview of the situation um the world consumes about 103 million barrels a day worth of oil barrel is about yay high holds 42 gallons it's uh very physical Market that there's about 105 million barrels a day so an excess of roughly two million barrels a day of Supply capacity out there but Saudi Arabia and their OPEC friends are withholding that from the market to keep prices artificially high so they can fund their you know vanity project essentially um and budgets so the market is essentially very over supped were it not for this cut and geopolitical risk is relevant when the market is not over supplied and when there's no spare production capacity available because then if production goes out uh the price can really Spike demand is inelastic with respect to you know you're going to drive your car until until you can't right so so you can't afford to you have to get places it's such an important commodity so just to wrap this thought up because there's such a spare capacity buffer right now the geopolitical risk doesn't matter as much basically what this boils down to for macro listeners is will the conflict in the Middle East escalate to a point where more than 2 million barrels a day of Supply gets cut off from the world uh neither Israel nor Lebanon nor Iran even have enough well Israel and Lebanon don't produce any oil Iran produces they export roughly 1.6 million barrels a day so even if you took out all that production cause a spike because the rest of OPEC could jump it and plug it the one thing that could screw every single Market over would be if Iran shuts the straight of hor M through which 30 million barrels a day of oil flow so keep your eyes laser focused on whether or not they go and do that and if there's kinetic war in the Straits then all bets are off macro is going to tank and oil is going to go to $200 a barrel I'd say the probability of that happening is less than 5% yeah and absent that nothing there's no risk yeah so do you mostly like react or do you try to forecast what's going to occur like geopolitically obviously you know we're all waiting to see how you know Israel reacts to uh Iran after Iran you know sent a bunch of rockets at Israel so do you like forecast of that or or play probabilities or you just wait to see what happens and react uh in oil markets unlike crypto I a very systematic Trader I have a mean reversion strategy and a momentum strategy which are each comprised sub strategies uh now is a time where you turn off your mean reversion strategy because there's a risk of a spike now is also a time when you turn off any momentum strategies that that get you short because you could get absolutely blown out to the upside um that's sort of how I do it so I just turn off elements of my portfolio and environments like this so basically what I'm long right now is diesel because that's the only part of my portfolio that the robot wants to be Max long yeah interesting interesting um aie I want to talk to you a little bit about how you use macro into crypto obviously you're you're pretty in the weeds crypto Trader um that's your Brandon butter Joan obviously you're you're deep on the crypto trading as well but OB just want to let you open up about what's your high level process how do you think about macro Dynamics in terms of how that impacts crypto and how much do you weigh it versus some of these more interesting kind of like Market structure things that you really focus on as well I mean that's it's a it's a really good question and the answer is twofold you have to think about the time frame of when you're using macro to trade crypto I think over a long enough time frame there's actually a pretty significant decorrelation between macro and crypto so if you're looking on a three-month time frame for example or a two-month time frame it's possible that you can see Equity markets go down when they're idiosyncratic things that might be driving a crypto bid uh great example of this is for the month prior to the appearance of Donald Trump at a Bitcoin conference uh Bitcoin actually went up substantially from from mid-50s almost to $70,000 while Equity markets were going down and it was very confusing to people why that might be happen and it was because there was an idiosyncratic explanation people were speculating on what Donald Trump might say at this conference and the reason that that happens is because still even today the crypto markets can be moved with a few billion dollars with 10 billion dollar of movement you can change the price of Bitcoin and that is not true of the equity markets right and the reason that crypto tends to go down or up with the equity markets is because of cross holder correlation so let's say the equity markets are up 3% and bitcoin's flat it's going to cause some people to want to go buy Bitcoin because historically it's been correlated but only certain amount of capital will be allocated to that so with that in mind the way that I use macro on a day-to-day basis is to look for short-term divergences so I don't think it's a smart thing to say hey over the last two months the equity markets are up 30% bitcoin's up five therefore Bitcoin will catch up because there are too many other factors involved but on a day-to-day basis if I say okay well dollars dollars down what should and dollars down a lot what should Bitcoin do well maybe it should go up short term a little bit right but will it go up over the next week I don't know and I don't think so the thing that I have found over a long period of time is most correlated with the price of Bitcoin are interest rates that's that that's it at the at the at the end of the day I think that Bitcoin tends to thrive in low interest rate environments and tends to do poorly in high interest rate environments and it's about the forward look from there so on a day-to-day basis it's about figuring out where their short-term discrepancies and on a a medium to long term it's really just about interest rates yeah my personal opinion nice um guys I want to ask you a little bit you know Jonah you were actually on the forward guidance podcast a couple months ago when Jack interviewed you and you laid out your your long-term you know fundamental views on on Bitcoin in the crypto space especially how it relates to macro um in terms of you know like a reserve collateral but I want to ask you both just to get like you know your your one pager views on you know for audience on the Ford guidance side of things that you know maybe are cryptos Skeptics and and mostly focus in on macro why do you guys care about crypto being both guys who have who have also been on the trafi side of things maybe starting with you Jonah yeah it's a great question um glad you asked basically let's separate crypto into two things Bitcoin and non-bitcoin my elevator pitch for why trafi should care about Bitcoin uh is that it keeps central banks honest and furthermore Bitcoin is objectively a better store of value maybe not a better means of exchange but definitely a better store value then let's call it a 100 of the world's 150 Fiat currencies so there's no debate about that anymore if you live in Chad would you rather hold local Fiat or Bitcoin if you're looking to preserve wealth I I don't think there's a debate anymore so to the extent that uh we now live in a sort of a post uh gold standard era um I think it is important for something in this world to be keeping central banks from uh printing money with Reckless abandon I think Bitcoin is that thing um and I think that the rest of non-bitcoin crypto you know we don't have time to get into it here but it acts as a similar foil to centralizing forces in technology which I I think ultimately lead to bad things in society That's my kind of over overarching thesis for why it is that the world should at least treat Bitcoin as a good sort of tail maybe 1 to two% of your portfolio even if you hate it it it's it's going to it's going to gain value as uh as governments print and debase and abuse yeah how how do you look at things in terms of like the high level fundamental we can look at like price structure separately but what's what's your fundamental view I mean I I Jonah I mean I agree with you 100% And I think it's really difficult for people in stable countries to wrap their head around this and this is just that's been the thesis I think since the beginning since Bitcoin was created it was hey there will be central banks there will be governments that will act irresponsibly and how do we protect ourselves against that historically there hasn't really been a way other than by hoarding precious gemstones or metals and so how do we build a system or or a currency or a money that protects us against governments basically messing up and for the longest time it's like well okay we live in the United States why does it matter you might live in Canada you you might live even even in China where still been reasonably stable and you might think to yourself okay well why do I need this right and the answer is you might not but the rest of the world does because every year there's a currency that effectively fails and they don't have any other options right they don't they don't have anywhere to go and so that's why I think Bitcoin is extremely valuable is because not only does it protect people that are currently experiencing the situation it protects you against potentially experiencing in the situation in the future there are a lot of things that we have said oh that's impossible that's never going to happen in the history of this world and then sometimes they end up happening and so there's some argument to be made okay well if there's a 1% chance of this catastrophic event happening you know if there's a .1% chance of a Civil War in the United States of America well what value does that assign to a currency that exists outside the bounds even if there's a point zero 1% chance right so you know you think in terms of probabilities which I think people have a problem with it's always been bu you know for a lot of people it's binary it's is it going to happen and is it not no of course it's never going to happen therefore this should have no value well no there's always some percent chance right one other thing I think about it I I love that and one other thing I would just add on top of that point is the idea that even if there isn't like a destabilizing event in the United States like a civil war we may indeed find and this has happened many times in the history of global Commodities trade we may find that as uh the the sort of cold Wars of the world between say China and the United States accelerate and become more acute um and as sanctions and banking restrictions accelerate Bitcoin May indeed become one of those few currencies that can perforate the kind of orwellian hemispheres that get erected as part of that like the global trade is dollar denominated right now but in the future if you want to ship a cargo of crude oil from Texas to you know the Shand dong Province in China that transaction may take place in Bitcoin because JP Morgan might not be willing to send that transfer you know like which is how it currently Works literally so I think that big ticket transactions not buying a coffee but like buying a cargo of crude oil for $180 million that may indeed take place with Bitcoin yeah yeah well so well maybe what we could do here is is do a little uh post Swap and I'll open it up to you guys um just to hear a bit about like what you guys are wanting to talk a bit about I know you had a couple questions for me um happy to talk about anything macro but yo what what's on your guys's Min what are you wondering about one thing that I've been struggling with and curious how you take it is the trade in 2022 November uh sorry November 21 was that as the FED started to raise interest rates Bitcoin basically went in a straight line down and that was a reaction to quote unquote understanding what made the money in 2021 the money was made because there was a tremendous amount of injection of uh money into the financial system right and a lot of this end up with Bitcoin and so the question is now as the FED is starting to cut again Bitcoin hasn't really done anything it's kind of remained flat equities have gone up uh and I think a lot of people in crypto are wondering well why is this not just the direct opposite of what happened in November 21 yeah yeah I'm I'm a bit surprised that we haven't like truly broken out here um with respect to what you're talking about about so yeah yeah you know rewinding back to a few years ago it's we we've been through a pretty clean cycle like you say is that you know we saw the FED take race of zero we saw QE Infinity we saw everything happen in 2020 and then we saw the crypto Market just absolutely Go Gang Busters for a couple years that happened and then we had the opposite occur where inflation really took hold they had to start to you know hike rates a ton um and we saw it going a straight line down things started to get a bit different around early 2023 for a variety of idiosyncratic and also macro reasons so the macro game has changed a bit because of some of these dynamics that you guys both hinted at a bit about in terms of just how much debt is in the system and how much we can really let this this entire debt based economy totally unwind versus try to keep it in check so what has happened is that from 2023 onwards we've seen this baton of easing be passed to these more shadowy hidden institutions um um so you know one example is the treasury uh there's been a great academic paper that's come out that's that's coined active treasury issuance we're basically by having Janet Yellen and the TAC advisory committee issuing bills and and avoiding issuing duration on the long end it's sort of it's sort of the mirrored effect of QE you know when you look at what QE is quantitative using is that it's just removing duration from the market by buying those long end bonds and swapping it for Central Bank Reserves what ATI or active treasury issuance is doing is just stopping it at at the Inception instead of even letting it go on the market they're just avoiding putting that Supply onto the market and just shift it over to the bills so even though the Fed was hiking um and you know we can also debate about the effectiveness of hiking interest rates during this world where you know everybody was locked into a 30-year morgage at 2 3% and as long as they don't move they're not affected by the by the rate hikes companies you know they termed out their debt at really really low levels and as long as they didn't have to change anything there substantially they could just ride out the rate hike cycle as well there's way less floating rate debt out there versus fixed rate debt these days so there's this there's a couple Dynamics in terms of the effectiveness of of rate hikes as well as these other you know distinctions in terms of what the treasur has been doing um you know there's been a lot of people that have looked at the the the reverse repo facility come down from 2 trillion to what like 3 400 billion that it's at now um the TGA is the same thing so there's been these more idiosyncratic dynamics that have thrown up this traditional cycle so it's not as easy anymore more to just look at uh you know fedus cutting things go up fetus hiking things go down there's these more ocratic factors so where are we at now we've had a 50 bits rate cut if if you're going to ask me the reaction we we've done really well relatively speaking equities have certainly done really well you know they're hitting new highs every day Gold's hitting new highs every day Bitcoin is lagging I think it takes time and I also think there's a lot of confusion in the markets right now there's a lot of people that are are are looking at you know you know things like yield curve inversions which I think have issues in terms of signal that is throwing them off and thinking we're on the precipice of a recession there's a lot of you know labor market data that's that's incredibly noisy right now so it's difficult to get signals so I think there's a lot of people that haven't gone through the motions and done the work to realize that we're actually in a very different regime like there's some people that are saying we're at the end of a business cycle there's some people that are saying we're at the beginning of a one you know if you look at like consumer lending uptake and business lending uptake that looks like an early early Innings of a business cycle but then you look at you know where the FED is at you look at where you know unemployment rate is ticking up that looks like the end of the cycle so there's a lot of confusion I think as we move forward that confusion will be less confusing I think it'll we we're going to get some clarity here um you know obviously last Friday's uh nonr payrolls print provided that um you know I was pretty confident that we we do pretty well there but even that you know was a substantial outlier to the upside so I think I think a lot of people are just confused um but it's clear where we're headed I've you know I've personally done the work and and gotten to a simple framework for myself which is that okay the f is cutting rates If the Fed is cutting rates into what's an imminent recession that's probably going to be a bad thing because they're going to have to cut rates a lot more to get underneath this thing and actually stop it and then reverse higher that's why we normally see those like V crashes um in assets until they get underneath this thing but if we aren't seeing a recession but we're cutting rates into a resilient economy that's you know my opinion extremely bullish it's it's party time it's but it's almost party time to the point where it could be concerning in a couple years even you know end of 2025 I'm not a huge believer that inflation is going to come roaring back next week but the the risks are increasing so I just think there's a lot of confusion um and people are trying to sort through it I'm confused I'm glad you broke it down there because to me the interest rate picture is the part of the macro asset kind of puzzle that I understand the least and like Avi I I just think you know rates High Bitcoin bad uh rates low Bitcoin good yeah but I think it's more nuanced than that I think for me the framework I want to I want to get your take on this my framework right now is own risk assets stocks Bitcoin especially Bitcoin uh until one of two things happens number one Bitcoin gets overvalued by your sort of um you know your uh let's call it hyper white hot bull market metric MV rvz going above five or six that's probably when you take profit but even if that doesn't happen I think the other time when you sell Bitcoin is if you see a redistribution political shift like a Bernie Sanders or an AOC uh you know have a legitimate shot at the presidency or or if those if that movement takes charge in governments across the world especially the United States then you're probably supposed to sell otherwise if that doesn't happen then we're probably still in the kind of 200 8 post2 2008 regime of um governments basically back stop and underwrite all risk that goes out in the economy and anytime there's a recession it's going to be v-shaped because they're just going to sweep all that risk onto their balance sheet so that's my framework do you agree with that do you disagree with it what's your interest rate uh mind tell you about that perspective yeah so something that I haven't talked about yet is the world we live in now in terms of the FED reaction function is actually quite different from 2008 okay and the big change to put it in simple wording is we live in this world of forward guidance like if you just look at the amount of fed speeches in the last two weeks it's ridiculous like just so many fed Governors are talking um you compare that to 10 years ago very different world um we have the summary of economic projections every quarter now that's a new thing we have the FED that does press conferences that's a somewhat new thing as well um these ideas of forward guidance are relatively new in terms of monetary policy historically so that creates a lot of of of different signals um that get priced into markets fairly early on so this is the dynamic that people talk about about where it's like you know yes we're going to get ray Cuts we just had a ray cut but so much of that forward guidance baked it in early on that it's it's very different from the old fed that had very little Ford guidance so they're they're their change in fed funds rate was a lot punchier because it wasn't as priced in so that part's a bit difficult um and sorry what was what was the end of your second question when sorry just to ask one question there when did that start really coming about so basically I was around like 2010 2011 is the issue was the FED funds rate was at zero and they were still seeing deflationary concerns so you know they they started to do QE that was one of there's there was a famous paper um that basically laid this out you know it's these five governors go to these these big symposiums and show off their e damic papers and one of them was about tools to use when we're at the zero lower bound so one of them was obviously the proposition for QE that that really took hold but the other one was actually around Ford guidance and guiding the market so that even though rates are at zero by saying hey we're not going to raise rates for at least four years the market can actually price that in um so it was tools that were created now the thing is we're not at the zero lower bound anymore but we still live in this world of Ford guidance so it's it's created these weird dynamics that aren't as clean anymore understand where are they guiding us now where what's where are rates going to settle you think so so this is the other thing this is this is what's been also happening in the past weeks and I've been talking bit a lot about this is that if you look at say like long bond yields after the FED 50 bips rate cut they actually increased um which is confusing and this also reflected a higher dollar so the dxy went higher since the 50 bips cut and a lot of people were confused the reason that occurred is because of the guidance um and what was actually priced into the Curve curve so you know going into that meeting we were pricing you know roughly a terminal rate of of 3% and it was just about the path that we got there so you know the FED came in with their SCP of summary economic projections which you know I don't remember offhand when we would get to that 3% but it's basically going to take longer than what the market had priced in the market had priced in that we pretty much get to that 3% which a lot of Market participants think it's like the neutral rate so you know it's not even like easing necessarily but it's just that neutral area so because that velocity of how quickly we get there the market had overpriced it it had to take out those at the same time that we got the 50 bips cut which means that they're getting ahead of this grow SC that we've been seeing which means they're going to have to cut less which means we actually have the price out Cuts later on which means that economic growth is decent which means that long bond yields actually have to go up which means that the dollar needs to go up cuz it had chist a way more aggressive cutting cycle so there's all these weird things like this that it's not as simple to just looking at you know fed Cuts game on you know the reason why I'm conviction long Bitcoin and stocks is because if we're in a growing economy where things are great and they cut all the way to 3% like you just said it's like I said earlier Party Time Off to the Races and if we go into a recession they've got another % they can cut before they even have to start the QE like where it's going to be v-shaped like you're you're not your downside is capped until like some austerity type political movement takes charge yeah so that's the other thing is um you know people are getting misconstrued now that you know we had that hot jobs report last week and that pretty much you know we were looking at a November rate cut of potentially 50 bips and that got totally priced out and people are like oh this is you know this is bearish bearish crypto we're not going to get as many r Cuts but the reason that's happening is because the economy is stronger than expected so if if we're in this world where inflation is almost at Target and we have a stronger than expected economy and we're still probably going to get a 25 bips cut how is how is that a bad thing right so I totally agree it's just you know the economy is better than we expected at this at it stands right now and yet somehow the crypto Market isn't really reacting that way to every to everything that we're talking about here there definitely some sets that are reacting that way I think we've mentioned in our podcast to a bunch of times that's done extremely well yeah um but Bitcoin hasn't ethereum certainly hasn't salana a bit but not but not really I mean there's a there there's there's an argument to be made in a strong economy if earnings are strong if the actual value of these companies are going up because they're producing into a into a population that is willing to buy and willing to spend and revenues are going up that there's less appetite for these speculative assets right if you're betting solely on economic growth and you're not betting on increased increased stimulus right and unnecessary money that's being pushed into the system you're just betting on a okay the FED is going to control the uh Descent of rates and we're we still have a good economy and things look nicely that's really good for equities but potentially what's needed is actually I'm just spitballing yeah but potentially what's needed is the threat of a of a recession where the FED has to come in and they have to prop up the market because that's what the crypto Market is supposed to be defending against a strong economy where companies are doing okay and everything looks good is actually good for the companies they not good for cash producing companies or not necessarily good for something like Bitcoin until you get to the point of excess until you get to a point of complete Euphoria well you know I just spitballing I have a question for you AI um could it be that the sort of parachute that Bitcoin is that's attached to bitcoin that's slowing it down is regulatory policy uncertainty because uh I think that you know one thing that crypto needs to rally is adoption and a lot of companies from you know my former employers to you know name your traditional Finance in institution who's that's interested in either tokenizing assets or settling things on ethereum they're kind of in a holding pattern until they can get some regulatory Clarity could be I I I agree I agree with when you talk about the concept of crypto companies or you know anything outside of Bitcoin but with Bitcoin that regul that regulatory uncertainty is actually good yeah uh because what it does is if you're allocating in crypto that by definition makes your allocation to bitcoin larger and so that's actually very good for Bitcoin right it gets it gets a larger percentage of every incoming dollar into crypto I had thought of it when there's High regulatory uncertainty about other assets cuz Bitcoin is done yeah Bitcoin is it's good we're good yeah we're good check mark check it's not it's not a security don't worry although isn't there some uh documentary coming out today it came out last night I watched it who who' they who' they say it was what's his name again Peter Cod Peter Tad it was ridiculous it was totally unfounded um totally like totally unfounded not totally but basically it was like there's a couple form posts from this guy um where he he it looked like Satoshi had had changed into a different Bitcoin form account that was this guy and it looked like he was consing his sentence on it oh this paired with a few other things I mean he's renowned guy like there has been thoughts I'm I'm not too well versed on the whole who is Satoshi you know thesis but it was it was ridiculous there's it's pretty unfounded I would say that's that's a shame I was kind I was kind of excited so I mean you know no bar that as a catastrophic event it turns out that they uncovered satoan and the wallets start to move and you know they start to offload BTC I mean uh look Bitcoin bitcoin's been hanging out okay I do agree with you Jonah that regulatory uncertainty is very bad for altcoins yeah um you know going back or going to politics for a second I think the issue is also just uncertainty nobody actually knows what the Democratic Party position is on crypto MH everyone is unaware right and so there's kind of no way to make a bet on it it's it's it's possible that it's a lot better than it was under Biden it's possible that it's the same I actually think it's kind of hard pressed for it to be worse because I think people have woken up to the idea that crypto is actually important and it's a it does Drive votes yeah but obviously Trump would be very good I think the thing right now they're getting on is just yeah the amount of uncertainty and confusion like there's confusion on election outcomes on on policy decisions there's a lot of confusion in the economic data there's a lot of very smart people that you know think we're about to go into a recession and I want to respect that even though I don't think we're going to be in a recession there's some guys out there there's there's there's you know Mike Green who's who's a very intelligent person is pretty strongly in the recession camp and you know I'll just quickly lay out his his perspective and what some of the more articulate recession views are is a lot of it comes down to just bad economic data coming out of Co and how that gets reflected in revisions um you know there's a lot of talk about non-ir payroll revisions we've seen some major downside revisions so you know the simplify and distill the thesis is that things are a lot worse than they appear in the data um I agree with Mike Green is the index the index fund guy the guy that made the argument about passive passive he's a bit of a Doomer though isn't he he's a bit of a Doomer in some way I mean he he's definitely not a fan of crypto I'll say that much um but but he's a smart ENT person and that's what matters is is when he even though I disagree with it um I do listen to it and to your point there is there is downside revisions um you know we had negative 8 800k th000 you know downside revisions to the job State over the last year but look it's it's fairly linear the downside revisions because it has to do with just the confidence interval of how they calculate it and then how that actually comes into existence through basically tax data so it's it's it's it's not as noisy as you think it's not convex it's quite linear so there's some smart folks out there who have just basically baked the revision into the current data so you know even though we got a gangbusters draws report last week just take a 50% haircut on that I think I think we might you know I know there are some people out there who say we are in a shadow recession right now because of those revisions that you site I'm not quite in that camp but I think we're in a shadow bare market and I think that's why it's such a good time to dip by now how could that be with stocks and Bitcoin at or near alltime highs well one thing I did recently was I went and denominated the S&P 500 chart in gold and it's close to the lows of this Millennium only during Co did it go lower and okay you could say well Jonah gold has ripped so that's sort of a all you're saying is that gold is up a lot but the Dollar's down a lot and if you look at what equities are doing versus something that like a precious metal that's technically a store of value it tells you that the stock market is not in a bull market that it's actually in a bare market and I think I think it's important to make that distinction because it basically tells you that all of this sort of froth and asset inflation that has everybody all giddy and looking at larger and larger numbers in their you know brokerage accounts is really a mirage and I think that there there's some pretty Sinister underlying factors in the economy that need to be addressed uh specifically those related to um what inflation has done to everybody's balance sheet like even just out there we were speaking to the the baristo and we were getting uh coffees here you know we had sticker shock Utah is supposed to be cheap yeah uh you know two two coffees is like like two coffees was 10 bucks 10 bucks uh you know and crazy and the Barista was just like we're suffering yeah she literally said we're dying over here which kind which is kind of sad cuz you know obviously income is income is much lower out here but the prices are I mean I went to uh to a place yesterday got nachos for $24 One play of nachos it's cheap it was it was like the nachos are pretty good I'm not going to lie they were very good nachos but like like I live in London and when I moved to London uh 10 years ago London felt like the most expensive place I'd ever visited now it feels literally like half the price of living in the United States so I'm not like daily life I'm not talking about like Central London real estate or anything it's crazy how what's happened I mean is this is this K shaped economy thing it is true like I don't want to I don't want to belittle it like there's people in the lower income classes that are in a version of a recession and a lot of it has to do with affordability is you know we haven't seen a classic inflationary recession whatever you want to call a cost of living crisis we haven't seen one of these in a long time so it's a bit confusing we're used to deflationary credits shocks yeah that sort of unwind the financial markets we're sort of seeing the opposite asset holders are doing really well asset markets are doing great but people in the lower income classes are getting squeezed the problem is that you know they're not the asset holders as much so we don't see as much 100% and one thing that I know there're a bunch of smart macro listeners on this podcast so they probably picked up something Jonas said and they're thinking to themselves well you know you get dividends from the S&P so obviously you can't compare that against gold and I'm here to tell you go look at the charts if you reinvest your dividends it's still flat since 2000 it's nuts you can Total return adjus right right just to just to be clear on that point it is I mean even though we're sitting here saying it's been really good for for for asset holders I think part of the reason that it hasn't been good for everyone else is that is a little bit of that chart right yeah yeah and and it's it is it is sad and the question is uh you know is it is it fixable right now that sort of question number one and question number two because we're all investors is well what do you do about it right like where do you put your money because because of that and you know I I'll pose the question to you before I give my take but I'm I'm curious you know if if we all agree we're all sitting here and we say this is the case the economy is bifurcating into asset holders and non asset holders what does that mean honestly I think the biggest thing is the risk for the sanctity of the FED in terms of its credibility um a lot of the FED policy creates wealth disparity QE is a policy that ensures that asset prices can rise without it trickling out into the broad economy cuz again like I said earlier QE is it's it's a swap of assets really it's it's you know you can some people call it money printing probably but in reality mechanically what happens is that the FED goes out and buys something that is a lot more liquid like bonds and swaps it for Central Bank Reserves that get caught up in the financial system that only banks can hold it on their balance sheet so that's slowing down the velocity of money removing duration from the market and lifting up asset price it's a it's a pretty impressive mechanism um that does great for asset holders but it does nothing you know at the same time during QE they're buying NBS right they're buying up mortgage back Securities that's going to make housing more unaffordable so these policies are not great for the lower income classes so tying that into what we could see in the future here I think the fed's credibility is at risk from a few different vectors the the wealth disparity one for sure as we move into like a continued you know rate cutting cycle even though parts of the rate cuts are more sensitive to either like smaller companies smaller like lower income classes you know car loans and that sort of thing um and also like a lot of smaller companies are on floating rate debt versus fixed rate you know somebody like apple can just have a stupidly low yield on their issuance versus like a smaller company they have to go fix so that that's more sensitive to R cut so there's some validity to it but overall if we're cutting rates again going back to the simple framework if we're cutting rates into an economy that is growing and not in a recession that's going to accelerate things um and so we've we've there's been a lot of talk about how you know this question of who's going to buy the debt who's going to buy the bonds um coming out of you know we obviously saw TLT just absolutely crater during the rate hiking cycle um just due to basic Bond math but coming out of that they're starting to be concerned that okay if the fed's not doing QE other foreign central banks are not they're actually net sellers of debt who's going to buy the debt well if we get a recession scare that's going to bring in a flood of money to buy in the long end Bond so that's fine at the same time that Yellen is limiting the amount of issuance on the long end so that's all well and good we've been in this this little Goldilocks environment but what happens if we keep cutting and and and we get an economy that starts to sore and we see G you know nominal GDP just start to go you know vertical even though it's it's been very resilient if if that happens and we start to see inflationary concerns I'm pretty concerned about who's going to actually buy the long end Bond during this next phase here because they're you know their magic trick of getting the recession scare to get that rotation in is effectively it just it just finished you know long long and mons have be going up higher so if these Dynamics all happen at the same time The fed's credibility is going to be you know at risk like it it could be pretty significant and you know tying that into some of the assets that we own I think that's a reason why you're seeing gold get bit up I think Bitcoin I mean I remember in 2020 I was I was long gold I was long Bitcoin and gold was just killing it every day and I was pretty frustrated I was like why isn't crypto going up and it just had it to wait a few months maybe that's what's happening again but again I I do think if we're if this is actually how it transpires The fed's credibility is going to be at significant risk um so you know you want to own those type of assets I think I think it's a generational thing as well like you know I I think your trafi listeners and my sort of trafi suit wearing former colleagues wouldn't be paying attention to you know memes like the one I'm about to describe but there's a popular meme in in crypto which is you know you have a few years to hyper gamble your way into Elite status otherwise and I'm not going to use the four-letter word associated with this otherwise you're basically a a Sal a wage slave for the rest of your life and um I think that Meme holds a lot of water for younger gen Generations because you know having worked with young people younger people now I'm I'm almost 40 I'm kind of the old man in the in the trading world I'm a dinosaur when I talk to younger people they're not buying gold they're buying crypto and it is like you said it is there is a bation going on there's inequality increasing um under either a trump Administration or a Harris Administration neither of those politicians seems to have proposed anything that would arrest the inequality uh traj that we're on so I think when we start to get this next phase of liftoff in crypto which I'm convinced is happening I think you're going to see some massive you know gen Z and younger Millennial Pile in to try and ride that wave because uh we've all learned what happens when you get left behind to quote the Barista it's a struggle this this is a key point that that you bring up is going back to the original question what happens when there is a bifurcation in an economy of halves and Have Nots is you get the the world right now it's so easy to see the other half 100 years ago you couldn't see the other half that easily if you were of the Have Nots you maybe didn't feel that way in a tremendous uh portion of your life because you wouldn't see them you simply would not interact with them you would see maybe in the newspaper but you couldn't go on Tik Tok and watch videos of people taking crazy vacations and feel to yourself oh my God I'm never going to make it and so there's this idea of I I need to get out of where I am to get to where I need to be that has never really existed before in in such a large scale because it's so easy to see the other side and that's what leads to the gambling that's what leads to the to the investing in meme coins that's what leads that's what lead to to the DraftKings of the world taking off in such a big way is it's that it's that fomo it's that culture yeah and so I I do think that what you see is is you're going to see a lot more money spent on these types of activities and these are hard hard earned less these are hard-earned habits yeah there are people that are going to do this for basically their entire 20s they're going to inherit what their parents have and then they're going to do it at an even greater scale and that's why again so even if you throw out like let's pretend that Bitcoin is completely useless uh there's a tremendous wealth transfer that's about to occur over the next 20 to 25 years and based on the culture that we've established for ourselves there's a appetite for gambling there's an appetite and it's happening look I don't know if it's necessarily rational I you know I want to hear you out but just I I think it's it's a function of uh feeling like you don't have what you need to have yeah I I do happen to think that a lot of people in this world are much better off than they were 30 years ago and so it's it's still it's a comparison game um not necessarily a rational thought process but maybe logical is more the word but yeah um but these are Global phenomena right like in the US gen Z has the option to buy you know ibit or GLD so Bitcoin or gold um if if you live you know if you're a younger person in uh Mexico or Bolivia or something I'm not sure if you have that gldd option but you can certainly buy Bitcoin on binance right so I I you know even if it weren't for the fact that young people overwhelmingly prefer to gamble on crypto versus other assets like gold um even if that weren't the case just access alone is too bottlenecked for traditional um let's call it debasement Hedges like gold and the next debasement uh sort of Adventure that the governments of the world decide to Embark upon you know I think crypto specifically Bitcoin to your point you know you talk a lot about reflexivity AI after you read the Soros book like I think that Bitcoin will be the reflexive asset once we break through new highs I think there'll be a lot of chasing and frankly like even even if you don't believe that Bitcoin is the most performant asset of this this Millennium it is impossible to ignore the Stellar performance of of this this thing called Bitcoin and I think that the next leg higher again like it's it's going to the Tulip analogies will fall by the wayside yeah well this is already gone on a lot longer than tulips did yeah that's the thing yeah people always post that but like every cycle it it beats it and you know just proves that I mean how how tulips didn't last more than five six years in in aggregate in terms of their in terms of their boom and the other thing that people always mention oh my God it's the most annoying thing in the world they always bring up the Tulips as if that's the only financial bubble that's ever existed in the history of financial bubbles no you guys are cherry-picking the one that didn't work come on I mean not to get you know annoyed about this but did you know that in the 1800s there was a canal stock bubble after after after they built the Eerie after they uh built the Eerie Canal it was so exciting to people the concept of a canal TOS that hundreds of different companies popped up to raise money to build their own canal and it booed the stock market and it went up in a straight line until they all collapsed because nobody actually built a canal did you know the same thing happened with railroads and the same thing happened with Airline stocks in the early 1900s every company became the Long Island airline company instead of Long Island blockchain oh my God like and guess what all of those Technologies turned out to be pretty pretty good I mean you know the Eerie well actually the Eerie Canal was railro roed by railroads but you know yeah but you know it's a it is a bubble that hasn't died and when a bubble doesn't die and Roars and comes back to life it is your job if you are a rational investor to at least take it seriously yeah you don't have to you don't have to your conclusion doesn't have to be the same as mine but you do have to take it serious do the work at least a little bit should we uh what's going on in the chat there should we have a couple questions or you know if people are watching fire in some questions there we answer a couple here I bought milk with my BTC the other day milk the beverage of criminals wow this chat uh that is uh I you know I'm actually really curious where can you buy milk with Bitcoin I might start El Salvador while while we're waiting for for the answer to that question um sorry this too ridiculous the beverage of criminals is that's a great tagline got milk no no no milk the beverage of criminals they're new I wouldn't you know there are milk Futures out there there are I'm sure there are don't buy those though um super liquid what what I would say about uh this massive wealth transfer that AI pointed to and alluded to is that when it does take place and it's already starting you know Boomers to Millennials and gen Z that wealth transfer like how old are you f Joe 30 30 okay I'm 39 I want I want to ask you a follow-up question to that did you my parents advised me you know a penny saved is a penny earned keep it safe don't invest in Risky stuff like stocks just save your cash it's the worst freaking advice I've ever gotten in my life did your parents advise you of that too yeah my parents are super risk averse and it's like never take debt I mean I understand you know don't don't lever up on stupid consumer stuff that can be a good thing when all of our parents advised us like that and then we watched them get rich off of their real estate yeah and then we had and you know buy houses in the hills on government salaries for 70 grand that suddenly become worth you know 1 two three 4 million and then our generation inherits that we're going to say well what worked for them and what's going to work for me is it going to be saving money in cash while uh the money printer runs overtime or should I invest in you know the real estate of Our Generation which is you know overwhelmingly digital in terms of what people spend their time like you know to your point Obi I really do think that wealth transfer is something important to be monitored for our space yeah hug I mean it's it's funny when I look at when I look at my dad and how he made his money I mean he's retired and he has a pension I don't think I'm going to get a pension no I don't I don't think I don't think that's really going to exist when I'm 65 you know he he actually he he never invested any money this is actually an interesting uh you know incentives right what are your incentives he knew that he was guaranteed a pension of a certain amount until he died so he never had to invest any money right he would spend he would just spend his money on things or put it in a bank account and he didn't we would didn't worry if that bank account lost money because he knew he was getting a pension nobody in our generation has that luxury we might not even get Social Security no yeah that that's going to be an issue one day too yeah like it it's going to run out um it's going to go one of two ways either we're going to get tons of it and we're going to have Communists in charge or we're going to or you know the capitalists are going to basically take it away because it the the budget doesn't work out when you leave it in there y so I mean even even just a point here even the staunches capitalists don't care about the budget anymore Yeah country and that's the thing getting to like the election outcome thing yes there's slight differences in terms of policy but the vast majority is going to be be the same thing which is we're going to print we're going to run a deficit it's just about half yeah it's it's no no there is no concept of balancing the budget no uh you know of not spending too much it's what what are we going to direct our efforts towards and I think it's I mean if you if you really think about it it's the the it's it's the culture of the states that is the Crux and the focus of everyone right now it's not about what we're doing with our money it's about how we interact with each other that's become the governing philosophy of of politics and to your point about Tik Tok and seeing other people's wealth until until that ends which it probably won't um cash is trash no government is going to have the mandate to go into austerity like you have to be long leveraged risk assets of which crypto is is one of them the hurdle rate is high um before we wrap up I want to you know with the interest that you guys are going to be on a doing a live recording later today on on the panels here and you'll be talking a lot about your your current market views but just want to get a little you know hint as we wrap up here on you know where you see price right now and where you see it headed in the you know we've talked a lot about the high time frame but what are you guys looking at in terms of low and medium term low low time frame guys I don't know I have no like literally no idea and the reason I have literally no idea is because heading into the election you're going to see a lot of chop in my personal opinion I don't think anyone is able or capable of taking strong positions ahead of the election because the outcome is for all of crypto is so Divergent yeah pre-election that what you're probably going to see is a lot of chop and it might you know some of it might actually look like momentum might get faked out you might we might go up 15% because a bunch of shorts Pile in and they get squeezed um I think the TR is true of equities as well I I I do genuinely do genuinely believe that that there's probably just a we're in a waiting period yeah right now I'm wondering what you guys think about this but when I look at just the amount of Hedges on right now like if you look at like the vix contracts for next month the next couple months people are so hedged right now that I feel like this is a working Theory but regardless of the election outcome come it's going to be an incredible rally just from the Hedge on wines what do you guys think I don't well put it this way for let's start with crypto and then let's go to equities for crypto I agree with AI impossible to trade the short term what I'm looking to do is stay up all night on Election night if Trump wins I'm going to buy a breakout it's like even if it goes even if it's 63k go Bitcoin going into the uh going into the sort of polling and then it trades up to 75 on a trump win I'm buying 75 right IFA wins um I'm just going to sit sit on my hands and wait for it to Nuke and go sideways and then when the act action stops then I'm going to buy as far as equities are concerned to your point about Hedges I think we're going to create volatility but in your if you're trading your personal account you don't care about sharp ratio you don't care about draw Downs as much so basically every time I get in I'm already kind of maxed maxed out on spy um what I'm doing when I get my cash inflows these days is I'm buying equal weight S&P um I'm buying the equal S&P 500 ETF because I think that sort of The Magnificent Seven have run quite a lot and I think it's time to invest in other um you know American companies a diversified portfolio I'm not an equities expert but I I do think it's time to diversify away from Nvidia and meta you know and Google yeah yeah that's what I'm doing and in terms of hedge unwinds like yeah if if we get a bunch of hedge unwinds and there's this explosive melt upwards in the equity markets and Bitcoin like do you chase it if it's Bitcoin on a trump win yes if it's equities on a hedge unwind before the election probably not right so yeah cool well that was a lot of fun I've been looking forward to doing this for a long time with you guys it's great to get the two paws together and yeah maybe we'll do it again sometime this is this has been awesome thank you so much thank you for having us it's a real honor really enjoy it yeah we've been on forward guidance OB brother we made it all right we made it thanks everybody thanks guys thanks man how was that that was fun that was

AI we've talked about this for like years right you know range bound markets for majors are are great for altcoins when the environment is right and it almost feels like that's the setup here where everyone right now is kind of hiding out in Majors being like you know I'm safe here I'm safe in Bitcoin I'll I'll make more moves around the election and I'm just going to avoid alt because you know if KLA wins the story's over I do think the market right now is obviously overweight majors and underweight alts but the game with alts is just so much harder than it used to be right cuz there is less money in the space um and so there's just more dispersion but if you are able to actually pick the sector correctly you know obviously that's kind of how you produce Alpha in [Music] this welcome back to another THX podcast we've got our favorite guest chiefing zah on to talk markets since we last recorded a podcast about a week ago a lot has changed Bitcoin is now above 60k people are no longer pre-rich they are simply Rich to is almost 600 things have gone well but I wanted to start off with there were two major predictions that you made last time we had you on the Pod one was that AI coins would absolutely rip and you mentioned to and the other was eth BTC would do well so one of those things obviously did not work and then the other worked really well uh I think T is almost two more than 2 and a half X since you last talked about it I think EBC is down about 10% so that was good um but just wanted to catch up and see how you're feeling about the markets and and your calls are are you selling any tow here are you buying ebtc thanks guys uh I guess said good to good to be back this is this is hands down my favorite crypto podcast and I guess crypto trading podcast um yeah so those those last two calls yeah one worked out well um I'm sure we'll we'll talk about to kind of on the you know for on the show um not not really doing anything with my to position um I think there's yeah there's there's kind of a lot to discuss there but um don't don't really feel the need to do anything now it kind of has some remnants of some of the stronger coins that you know went on these big um you know trending moves sort of last year around this time around October 2023 um obviously there there are kind of risks there but um still still just as bullish and then yeah EPC is is an interesting one um definitely got that wrong uh I think actually I remember listening back to that podcast Jonah said e was kind of his Trump trade uh and I think that's actually just played out you know really really spoton right obviously as I guess confidence in a landslide victory has waned so has kind of eptc and there obviously like structural things I think that happened um at that time with just people obviously sitting in stale positions because of the EPF and that not really going as well as everyone planned um again not to sound like a breaking record at these levels I do think it's tough not to be somewhat constructive just psychological 0.04 it's kind of you know even the most vocal kind of ebtc bear one of my good friends you know even in in 2023 early 23 he sort of laid out the exact kind of eth bear thesis of everything that would unravel with the whole modular Vision how he was never supposed to be marketed as money and we we actually spoke today funny enough and he was kind of like 04 was always what I was looking for but I do think it's Nuance the election you know plays a big role so we'll talk about that I'm sure yeah I mean I I definitely want to get into some of the um some of the nuances both ta and eth with you uh and also see what else you know you've been looking at but before we dive into all of those minutia of those those two ecosystems and more um you at token 2049 uh that was the Talk of the Town on crypto Twitter uh neither Avi nor I made it out there can you kind of can you kind of tell us what happened what your general takeaways were and and what what you think it you know what what's give us the pulse of the crypto market right now this sounds like a really re like people were more excited about this conference and more vocal about it than they have been about many conferences this year if not all of them so yeah I thought I mean the energy honestly the conference was great obviously timing wise it was token 2049 you know you had F1 which just brings General business crowd together you had B was doing the the network state or his Network State event and obviously Salon a breakpoint you know so the energy kind of in in Singapore was um yeah was was kind of on fire and my general takeaway it's funny that's actually happened markets wise last year I think we bottomed around the same time but I think a lot of people obviously were kind of gone for the summer doing their travels doing whatnot and you know a friend even said they they kind of said you know this is almost like crypto's Davos where if you're in crypto you were kind of in Singapore at this time um and so I get the sense I think a lot of people got together and you know really focused for the first time right everyone's saying it's time to kind of lock in for the fall and you kind of got the sense that you know a lot of interesting things are being built there are a lot of smart people in the space You know despite what you might you know see on CT or or kind of glean from all like the meme coin discussions um and the other thing I noticed too is you just got a sense of how big the industry really is now right back in the day kind of you know 2017 2018 you go to conferences and there would be a lot of the same people you know now there's there's so many different side events so many different even sectors you just realize how big the space is and how many new entrance there are here um you know building new cool stuff so yeah I had a great time I think I'm feeling super like I guess energetic after that and I think most people that were there probably feel the same as well you mentioned people are building cool interesting [ __ ] can you maybe touch on a couple of couple of projects or ideas that you heard out there that that were kind of exciting to you one one event not to sound I guess like a broken record but one event that that definitely did stand out there was a uh like a bit tensor agent Meetup which was I just thought it was like very high signal no real like traders in the room just mainly you know subd developers some some kind of investors like dcg had a presence and it just felt like had a real good Community feel to it no frills just technical discussion uh there were a lot of decentralized AI sort of side events as well um that's kind of where I mainly focused uh my time I didn't actually go to the the conference itself just a lot of these a lot of these side events but some cool stuff happening in the social World a lot of excitement on like about rwas um deepin I did stop by a breakpoint honestly the energy there was um was super strong you can just see like a lot of new faces big big focus on consumer apps um I was kind of meaning to go through some of the talks on the on the YouTube Channel and obviously fire dancer was presented as well I think there's a non- voting client that's live on mainnet now um so definitely a lot of excitement in the in the salana you know ecosystem as well yeah one one thing that people were were talking about a lot the performance of the seis and S and these all l1s of the world that are competing for a salon spot I know was it SE or Su I always get them confused one of them had a big event uh at token did you get a sense for how real that is because I know a lot of that is driven by Asia and their their their focus is there so I don't know if that that bled through like the there's maybe a growing of breath in the industry as well yeah so I actually did Miss I did miss suie Builder day um that was an event that I wanted to go to that I wasn't able to um I can't say that I heard specific chatter about it um obviously people kind of we talking about like like token price and whatnot and funny enough suie did actually um hold strong against what you know was typically a pretty you know good top indicator right when a project usually has Steve aoke play at one of their events I think there been two historical times usually marks a local top but uh it looks like so powered through I think they had him playing at Mart for an event which also I was not able to make but um you know some some real strength there if it's able to get past the the stoki curse that's true a lot a lot of people are talking about selling that as the all right this got to be the top this got to be the top and honestly historically it's been pretty accurate that conferences Mark crypto tops it's like you get like a small small pump into the conference then everyone everyone sells off and token has seemed to beat that curse but I think it's also just because people are just so mentally beaten over lot over the summer I think you just got smacked around so hard and everyone's been conditioned now to sell every rip I mean Joan and I have been talking on every podcast all right we're in a ranging Market we're in a ranging Market we're in a ranging market and at some point you have to think to yourself all right are we ready to Trend so I wanted to get your take on that do you think that we're we're ready to Trend do do you think this is still a ranging Market are we still selling rips buying dips or we're just holding tight uh I think we're I think we've just kind of transitioned into a whole tip mode I think Majors can maybe chop around a little bit longer right you maybe have some front running of this October meme uh where we might need to just I I I really don't see any like big big downside in BTC and like sustained big downside obviously intraday flushes can happen um and yeah again maybe right you get you had some front running of October and maybe you get a flush into it where people are like oh look it didn't really F out um but I do think we're kind of there I'm the hard the hard part with having confidence in this View and I actually think the alt setup is a bit more interesting um you know the the election is sort of we're looking at pretty much a month out you obviously have a lot of people that are using the election as kind of their shelling point to decide whether or not they want to allocate I tend to think the market is not really going to give people that that chance to say okay from here until election date prices just aren't going to move and then you're going to have a really easy shot at obviously Trump winning you know that's good for crypto comma wins that's that's kind of bad for crypto uh um what I what I what I do think is interesting also is you know obviously ala performed pretty well into into today for the last couple weeks you know the dominant theme from people is that obviously the biggest risk for crypto is is commo winning and commo winning would be specifically bad for altcoins like that would be the worst outcome for alt coins and the way that alt coins at least are moving now and obviously with PS widening in comm's favor to me I almost I'm kind of playing around with this idea and I'm almost like 6040 on it from a confidence level is that I almost think the trade might be to be longer alts and especially these like utility alts and to me is I I would Express that just with crypto AI coins is you almost want to be long Al into the election and then I'm I'm kind of toying with the idea that if Trump wins that's actually the trigger for Majors to go vertical right because if you think about the two camps that drive you know big price moves with Majors obviously is these ETF flows it is these inos it's these big pockets of money and they're just far more disciplined and they probably will actually wait until you get the election outcome and it just takes so much more money to move Majors as opposed to alts right where you could have Crypton native Capital say Hey you know it's it's it's decentralized AI fall right and I need to be allocated to the sector and it takes so little um you know Capital to move these assets and they might want they might want to wait for the election outcome but they're also watching this Market every day they're they're kind of per bullish this asset class and if majors are kind of ranged around an a we talked about this for like years right you know range bound markets for majors are are great for altcoins when the environment is right and it almost feels like that's the setup here where everyone right now is kind of hiding out Majors being like you know I'm safe here I'm safe in Bitcoin I'll I'll make more moves around the election and I'm just going to avoid alt because you know if KLA wins the story's over it almost feels like from a positioning perspective certain old sectors will do well like I think dispersion continues like it's been all cycle and then the election might be the trigger uh for Majors but I still think Majors can you know grind chop up higher I mean we we've been talking on this podcast for nine months about keep it tight consolidate line items like roll into the majors get rid of your crappy positions and so far we've been dead right like BTC dominance has just been up only all like basically since December 2022 and it's I think the the end is near for that trade I agree with you Chief I think um I you know I've been a I've sounded like a BTC maximalist for a long time even though I'm not but like I I just it's been the trade and it's hard to pick Tops on BTC dominance but you have a really strong point I mean interestingly enough AI you tweeted one of the wisest things I've read in a while this week you wrote A lot of people focus on finding assets that make sense in this world the reality is a lot more simple find the sector find the best asset in that sector and wait and you know it's kind of amazing that we've got the chief on the show this week because he picked AI uh he picked the best asset within Ai and that asset has just gone parabolic while the rest of the space has been ranging that it does feel like we're going to see a few more of those doesn't it yeah I I think I mean 100% And just one one thing on that tweet I was stepping back and just looking at the bearishness that I held over the last few months and over the summer where I said I was cautious cautious cautious going into the election and then post the 50 bit rate cut you have to sit there and think to yourself well what is the market actually going to let participants do everyone in their mother has been saying okay let's wait for the election uh and then we can make decisions is kind of exactly what Ching was just saying we'll wait for the election but why would the market give you that optionality I mean we've sold off a reasonable amount altcoins took pretty massive drawdowns from the March highs there's an argument to be made that if Donald Trump gets elected and altcoins are up right 100 200 300% in that scenario versus Kamala gets elected and they're down another 30 there's a pretty massive asymmetry and nobody was allocated so then the pain trade becomes up at that point and that's kind of what we saw especially post the 50 bip rate cut it's like that that sort of gave the market choose and the other thing is that Equity markets pushed the highs and the crypto Market every Market is just a microcosm of another market right when Bitcoin goes up money flows to SS same's true with the crypto Market as a whole when equities push the highs money to crypto it flows down the risk risk Spectrum right so now what I think we're looking at is we're looking at a pretty good environment for this stuff and what your first question should be is well where where are people going to allocate right like what are what are people going to push all their push all their chips into when the question is hey I just want to allocate to higher risk stuff and I want to make a general bet on the General market they're going to allocate to BTC and then to the best sectors and the probably not even going to do that much research they're going to just pick the best consensus right it's like the consensus horses are going to get the allocations in the beginning so that's why I I I I tweeted that is because this is just the market environment to put chips on the table in the areas that you think are going to get attention if if the market goes up one thing I'll also add to my I guess previous idea too is you know in this so far in this I guess cycle if you want to call it there's I think really only been one time where you've had maybe a couple times where you've had just like a very very strong vacuum created by BTC and Majors um obviously like soul that run was like a vacuum where just liquidity from the entire space was going into one asset and then when BTC broke alltime highs you know the way that thing was trading it was just all liquidity was moving into BTC and so if this scenario plays out where you know SS you know they are putting in two 3x moves from the bottom into the election and then all of a sudden you know BTC goes on the back of a trump win I think there's a good odds that that becomes liquidity vacuum and then you know OB we've seen this markets many times right anytime ALS go crazy people are obviously sitting on crazy upnl and you know the thought of them missing out on like a parabolic Bitcoin move is enough for them to be like all right I'm taking profit and you know I want to move back into the into the fastest horce um this would almost be the scenario I think that obviously I hate when people use like max pain um but I do get the sense I do think the market right now is obviously overweight majors and underweight alts but the game with alts is just so much harder than it used to be right because there is less money in the space um so there's just more dispersion but if you are able to actually pick the sector correctly you know obviously that's kind of how you produce Alpha in this environment I mean you could pick you could pick a few sectors and just pick the strongest horse in the sector for each of them per A's kind of um you know system that he tweeted out his thought process or philosophy or whatever you want to call it so we could say like for AI it's probably taao I'll hand it to Tao I mean I have my doubts about Tao I own a little bit because you know we did a show about it and I wanted to get involved but I don't know nearly enough I I still think it's the strongest horse in AI in defi hard to pick anything stronger than a uh in dpin I don't know helium love it but it always kind of disappoints but if dpin goes helium's going to be the one that goes crazy um you know I know there's uh some hype around gaming and a few other sectors but I think between those three between a helium and taao you're like if if that's what if that's what's in your altcoin suitcase you're probably okay for if the pain trade is up right if there's an up upwards pain trade now the only pain trades I've ever seen in crypto have been down but um if there isn't if there is an upward pain trade I think you're okay with those three in your cycle there's also a little bit of there's just a little bit more nuance to that to that statement which is when you're allocating to crypto a lot of people especially when once you get moves like this they think to themselves well let me try to find the catchup trade and the answer almost always is you don't waste your time doing that and just buy the thing that's going up buy the thing that's working and that tends to outperform I mean I think there's just a power law here right if you find a specific area that you like invest 80% in the thing that is working and 20% moonshots but in general you know you you end up you end up pretty sad when you try to chase a sector like let's say defi like rips and a is doing the best uh try to chase though like chase other things is probably worse than just buying a I think that's actually exact that was a thought I had when I saw ob's tweet and I was actually going to send it to you both where a lot of times not like when one asset really does start to Trend or let's say it has its like yfi type moment um I do think in this market diversification becomes a meme you know you want to diversify for you know a couple reasons obviously you might have like concentration limits or you know you never want to go all in um but in terms of let's say an ALT allocation you might say hey I have my majors and then you know you can you can have all of your all allocation one asset um and that probably ends up being the right play a lot of times in crypto I do think you can diversify also where you know you have your your kind of main pick of like hey this is the fastest horse and then maybe have some percentage in some illary names because I think when the ketchup trades actually start going crazy that's actually a pretty good signal to get out right the the wor the worst trades tend to pump the hardest at the end and so it's it's it's nice just to have a little bit of money in those just to keep you paying attention and when they start going haywire it's probably time to kind of ring ring the alarms so let me ask you guys a question um it you know we we had we caught a little preview of things going parabolic and then right back down earlier this year with the meme coin bubble um for me the top signal in memes was when uh you had people basically revising their targets much much higher on absolute nonsense reasons um you know we're we're starting to see a little bit of that like people were like oh whiff is going to you know $100 per token because after the sphere is done it has a hat Jonah yeah because it has a hat exactly right so I'm like I think that's when you generally like when the greed that's how you see the greed is on crypto Twitter when people just start revising their targets like way too high after a huge rally I don't know what do you guys think how do you pick the top um in one of those parabolic moves I I always I suck at that I tend to get out way too early I I don't know if it's personally for me it's never been about picking the picking the Pico top and I think it's very difficult to do that it's just about making money and trying trying your best to choose the points at which you're allowing yourself to maximize the fact that crypto does tend to produce 10xs and then the way that I do it is like whenever you get I mean I know I know you chiefing you keep a list of top indicators that you refer to um and when a bunch of them hit it's probably time to take a lot of profit um there's a lot there's a lot that you can learn from the past I mean if Katy Perry paints your nails if it's probably a good sign to get out yeah I mean I'm with I'm with ob on this generally like it's I think it's a pure ego game to think you're G to call it perfectly so I mean I think there's a couple there's like there's a couple strategies you know you can just s sell slowly on the way up um you can wait for a clear blowoff moment and then you know in crypto at least with Majors things tend to kind of distri a little bit obviously ball is a bit lower so you have time but yeah I like to keep a list of both like qualitative and quantitative indicators on the quantitative side like looking at quarterly basis is always just a good one right because that just shows you the general financing rates in crypto I think in March we peaked out I want to say BTC hit 36% or like mid-30s low 30s which just in this environment with how I guess how many players are now kind of plugged in or have infrastructure to take advantage of that basis you know people paying 30% a year to Long Bitcoin like it's kind of hard to justify that um you know again like funding rates as well you can look at funding rates kind of across you know obviously binance bit more sophisticated players uh you you look at places like byit the kind of venues of more retail uh Traders look at divergences there um obviously like you know big V spikes uh especially when kskq goes Haywire you know that's that's a good a good area any like big volume blowups on the qualitative side too like you know mvrv before you get to qualitative mvrv but that's more for like Mega like the the big big cycle stuff yeah yeah well like you see you know qual on the qualitative side honestly without fail you know I don't know how social people in crypto are but if you're you know a semi-social person you know people from the outside world will be reaching out to you asking uh you know what coins to buy like I had there were two notable texts that I received I actually put them on Twitter and if you put them on a chart they are within like I think three to five days at the top I got one uh from this girl I know from New York she said hey are you in crypto still in crypto I said yes and she says hey what coins do I buy what's hot right now I I don't respond I leave her on R she follows up again asking what coins to buy with exclamation marks obvious top signal I get a text from a friend who I haven't spoken to in years he says uh hey You' been trading Salon meme coins lately let me know if you have any picks and then says hope you've been good by the way right the G of this guy that followed up follow up by hey you been trading salot of m coins but I hope you've been good um you know celebrities coming in obviously the the Celeb coin meta was was kind of a clear picture but anytime you you start to see just these like levels of grift and greed you know go up it's never a bad time just to take some profit okay so now that we have the chiefing uh top indicators everybody go follow chiefing on Twitter to try and see when people start texting him all sorts of fomo craziness uh but now that we've covered picking tops let's talk about election night are you gonna be like staying up all night Chief to like if if it looks like Trump's gonna win are you just gonna be hoovering Bitcoin or like is this not something that you can actively trade you kind of have to be in or out ahead of it so funny enough uh this actually came from a friend this isn't an original idea you know you likely see another red Mirage on Election night right because so many of the mail in ballots um you know that are going to go those are going to go Blue those are going to be counted obviously during nighttime uh eastern time yeah and so you may have the big media uh houses kind of calling for a big Trump Victory just because a lot of the early voting is going to skew in his favor so what's interesting is if you do have this red Mirage you probably get this kind of euphoric moment in crypto where people are like all right we have confidence Trump is going to win you know slide The Leverage bar to the right you know let's go all in um that effect might be negated actually a little bit just because now you have you know poly Market is such a deep market and you have venues for smart money um to place bets and they might be like hey we obviously know that the early indications are going to be in trumps favor um you know if you got that if you got that I would actually say that's like a tactical a tactical sell um for you know your your trading portfolio not your long-term positions um yeah I haven't really thought about it too much in terms of what I would what I would do um it it really depends kind of how we get there so you know I guess in the instance that I I described let's say alt do really really well into the election um I would probably start looking to rotate some of those over uh into into Majors maybe like equal weight you know BTC e Soul um and then kind again it really depends on what happens going in if if markets are going up and Trump wins I'm probably not really doing a whole lot just because the market I think probably front ran it and I do think the market is going to be horny for a trump Victory and is going to be looking for kind of any sign um and I don't imagine there's going to be any new data between now and election night I think and and I think polls probably fluctuate I think Harris is hopefully probably topping out around here we'll kind of see I I still think Trump wins um so yeah kind of depends on how we get there obviously if Harris uh does win I think uh I would I would look to hedge uh the portfolio with with shorts you know right now top of my head I'd say probably even soul just because you need the most liquid kind of alt representations but I do think it's going to be a volatile time um and I do I I do get the sense it's going to chop a lot of people up so I'm I'm kind of looking to see what happens as we go in um and it might just make sense just to increase your like you know your Tas position going in especially things have done well and then maybe even give it some time post election to see but if if things are quite muted and Trump does win you know I think I think BTC does go I think BTC goes parabolic I think it'd be hard for it not to I agree with you I think it's going to be hard for BTC to go parabolic on Election night even if Trump does win like I think that you could see like let's let's say you go into election night and it's trading you know kind of I don't know where it is now 63 and a half right so let's just say it's there on Election night I could see it trading 70 or 75 on a trump win yeah I think that's still like I I don't I don't really see it going too far above that night of and I still think that's a screaming screaming buy so coming from somebody who does not like to trade like event trade or especially pre-planned event trading like I think it's a Fool's game I just don't think that the the night of the election when markets are shut like Trad five markets are shut so you're your Trad derivatives markets are closed your Trad guys who are going to be buying this the next day are going to be sitting at home watching the election with their families like I think there's going to be an opportunity for us crypto natives to like lift lift every every token that's out there you know just just just talk just talking out loud for a second because said that the markets are closed there's an argument to be made that Bitcoin will be the election trade and so on the night of a trump win you just get everyone slamming BTC and even if there is a even even if Trump does win it just overcorrects to the upside because people once the Market opens will sell out some of their Bitcoin which was the trade at the moment the liquidity at the moment they sell out some and then that's probably a dip to buy um if if you get it just just talking out loud it does feel like crypto I don't I have I haven't really been doing much event trading for a while but it felt like at least when crypto was like you know whenever was paying attention to CPI at least like 30 15 minutes before like price just wouldn't really move right like everyone is just kind of waiting for it so I I I could almost imagine on Election night again assuming no new information um you know BTC is just like it's just not really moving much and and people are waiting for for any bit of news you know I'm not I'm not really like a election expert so I don't know what I don't know what what the earliest point that we might have Market moving news but I do think at some points I think I think BTC is just is just going to keep going up for a while um it'll be like when Elon you know announced his Bitcoin buys like we that day we had so many short squeezes like per basis was roofed and you know a lot of times You' see that you be like oh I can't really buy here it's too juice but it just it just kept going it's just one of those moments where you're just just get long walk away like it's going higher like you don't need to look at your charts for a while Chief what tools do you use to monitor all these indicators that uh keep you plugged in and with your finger on the pulse of the majors I guess I mean obious mentioned it I mean V vo is definitely the best one I think that's honestly the most most all-encompassing um obviously Twitter is a great tool I've been using I've been playing around with kaido uh recently um this is good a good way to kind of get like these highle summaries on it's kind of sentiment reading but you're able to get information and like tweets about a project pretty easily um I think that's really it I mean coin analyze has some good data like I know I think today a lot of people were posting about like aggregate altcoin oi I don't think vo has that yet vo if you guys are listening please add that but um yeah vo honestly has has most things you need okay um that's super helpful just you know here at the THX podcast we're all about process so aggregate aggregate allcoin is actually one that I haven't looked at in a while because alts have been so dead but how's it how's it looking right now so it is reaching multi-on highs so I think we Peak this morning at around 13 billion which was the High um close to the high that we reached in Late July um and then adjust it for market cap yeah I mean so we read it's not it's not that high but it's kind of at it's almost add the resistance resistance point if you assume that we're still range round which is which is kind of the question you know at large here that I think everyone's trying to answer you know it's obviously gone up I think we added like actually I don't know the exact number top of my head um we added we added a good bit but it's not at least for this cycle on an aggregate level on a global level like that that insane where it's like super frothy but you know a good bit has been added yeah I mean look that's uh that that's one of the things that I think is hardest about this particular moment in time is figuring out whether this is a sustainable move or not and that if it does become a sustainable move the psychology required to go from a raging Market to a trending Market is where most people just completely [ __ ] up like when you go from okay I'm gonna start taking my 20% wins and offloading them it's very hard to shake that because I think probably every sing person that actively trades or invests at some point has round tripped p&l and then probably even gone negative and that's just a [ __ ] feeling everybody everybody hates to feel that uh so just if you're if you're listen out there love to hear some of your tricks if you have any just like psychological tricks but uh one of mine is just to to always uh sell a little bit or buy a little bit and I've talked about this I've talked about this before like if you're if you're positions going up you don't have to make binary decisions you can sell 10% you can sell 5% see how see how it feels um but you kind of have to trick your brain into adjusting to the market environment I don't know how how you do that but be kind of kind of interesting to hear honestly I just try to have I just try to go top down and I try to have a view and uh I I do I do hold the view or at least I'm allocating tap now on The View that we did we did shift environments um obviously talking with with a you know decent amount of margin of error like to me like Bitcoin at 61k is still you know to me that we're still in an uptrend um if you want you can you can wait right until a clean break of 65 um but it also it really depends on your time frame actually it really depends on how you're you know how you're kind of view your portfolio right like I like to have my long-term positions that I'm not really looking to touch like these are more like kind of macro three to six months maybe three to yeah three to six month holds and then a more like active active trading bucket and then that active bucket yeah I'm kind of the same where if if there's profit and I'm feeling kind of nervous like I'll just I'll just take it right because in this game you really just want to survive there's something new happening like every every week every day right s to all these things are up like they're up like three times from the loads right um so I think it just depends on how you're how you're kind of allocating capital and then if you do think you're in a Range bound environment yeah I would just be I would just sell rips by dips I tend to not really be active in those environments because they're just kind of boring for me um and tend to like you know chopping chopp environments are not really where I thrive um but I do think with the broader Market I do think we turn to LEAP I think you have to be a little bit patient here um and so to me like right now it just separated out into like you know kind of conviction levels so things I have conviction I'm just I'm I'm kind of sitting letting them ride things that are a bit more speculative that might be kind of more technical trades like I I like took profit on on some old positions uh this morning actually when I saw that that oi uh move it could go higher it's fine like you know we had a big move off the bottom I'm not I'm not like too concerned with it but to me having that extra cash buffer also lets me like buy the high conviction names should we get a dip should we obviously your highest conviction name right now is taao very few people in the market have been as long and as vocal as you on that one um should we you know take we're I guess we're nearing the sort of third Act of this podcast here so we take some time to debate that and try to understand the thesis a little bit because I think it's it's an important asset for the space right now and it's also controversial and we need to like maybe try to poke some holes in it to try and understand what's going on because it is the first major Alt like kind of major cap alt breakout that isn't just another alt L1 trade um it's like the first real alt to do something in a while um yeah I guess you kind of went through your thesis in depth on the previous podcast that you were on with us but like I guess could you recap it like the elevator pitch for it and then tell us why like what are the developments what are the catalysts that you expect to keep driving this uptrend yeah for sure so I mean the also within the high level desus there's like two components there's like a fundamental component and then there's like a more I guess like Market structural component and I think I think the latter is is playing out and the ladder is actually always going to be more important like this obviously trading podcast like you know price always always drives narrative and I think there are structural forces that have obviously been supporting the price um yeah but on the fundamental side right the whole the whole notion for this this protocol is that it's it's an incentive system this incentive game to drive the the kind of creation of better open source AI models that hopefully over time can obviously compete with the likes of you know open AI or chat gbt Claude um I guess llama is technically open source but you know llama M all those um and and I think more recently where a lot of the excitement has been generated is that uh the incentive system is is working you know I've tweeted about it a good bit but the quality of teams building subnets and just generally building Dev tooling the ecosystem is is is noticeably higher right this time last year I think there were two two or four subnets I think we're pushing into the 50s now not all are great actually most most are bad but you can just see the quality increasing and as the protocol is designed to do the kind of shittier subnets are getting weeded out and losing incentives and the more productive subnets um are gaining in in kind of market share and they're getting more control of of to itself and I do think where the reason sort of why this is so controversial is you know an incentive system on its own is like it is this meta concept right but I think this is actually what blockchains have always sort of been been been good for right you have you know what a blockchain really does is it says you know because of these strong cryptographic guarantees we can guarantee property rights and everyone now playing in this game can have full faith that these property rights will stick and the rules of the game are going to be hard to change and then with that belief the way that people operate is just different right so when the incentive is strong you can get people to operate in a certain way for some desired outcome and the desired outcome of the system is just better AI models which I think we could all agree would be better for the world if you kind of had this open source Community um you know building alternatives to the open eyes of the world and my my my general take also on decentralized AI is regardless of if you think it can compete with the likes of you know open Ai and Microsoft it's going to get built regardless like the the the What's the phrase you know Pandora's Box is kind of already open we're going to create the system it's for sure it's going to rival the centralized World in some respects probably fail amongst a lot of vectors but it's going to be an alternative in the same way the same way defi is an alternative traditional Finance it's obviously worse off in a lot of ways you know this decentralized AI ecosystem is going to exist and people will are going to keep building there and they'll keep gravitating towards it surely because it exists so first of all that's a big if right like if uh decentralized incentives can build better models than centralized ones or even like quasi centralized open- Source ones like llama that's we don't know that so it's kind of a VC bet that that's going to happen but if it does happen obviously uh ecosystems like bit tensor will be enormous there's some Delta you assign to that maybe it's 50/50 maybe it's lower but like the beauty of crypto is that unlike traditional sort of like Trad VC where you can't trade in and out of your startup Equity as hype es and Es and flows um you know crypto does give you these tremendous 10 to 100 xers between you know when you put the trade on and you know five years down the road when you know whether your thesis is right or not so I I totally buy your your idea that you know to use Commodities speak the curve is in contango the the price of the future for bit tensor is much higher than the present because of that that idea that decentralized models might matter um and in the meantime you can sort of trade that volatility and and E out a pretty you know substantial profit especially if you're convicted one thing I wanted to bring up to you um I read a really fascinating article in The Economist yesterday uh the latest one is all about Ai and the you know microchip ecosystem behind it you know super interested in that and studying it there is an article about how China can't access a lot of the GPU compute that it needs to build AI models that compete with llama Gemini um chat GPT all this other stuff and so they're building these sort of like skinny uh you know targeted models where you know you ask the model one question and it'll go to a specific LM designated for answering that type of question just basically like China's finding ways around the chip sanctions because they can't access nvidia's latest and greatest um meanwhile I was thinking there are probably a lot of countries that that have national projects like that uh or want you know National AI Champions that can't access the the actual you know silicon they need maybe decentralized AI will provide it for them so I I kind of thought a bit tensor in the context of like geopolitical use cases similar to how bitco coin you know perforates uh these sort of hemispheres of global trade uh because it's this neutral Arbiter um that everybody can sort of agree to use so I I could totally see you know maybe a third use case for bit tensor aside from it like dethroning Llama Or open ai's latest model it could just be it could just be like a thriving ecosystem that helps countries with difficulty accessing silicon to still get good model uh well-trained models into their you know day-to-day use yeah I don't know if it's a way necessarily to Source I mean I guess it can be a way for these countries to source source compute just right because the miners themselves theoretically are like they're expending Computing resources to you know run these run these models um so yeah like I think it plays into this any notion of kind of geographic unfettered access to AI models you know bit sensor plays a role and I guess a couple one point and I think we can move over to the more markets oriented uh you know case of the the thesis I think I forget there's one I think it's womo I forgot what subnet they're they're working on um I think I think maybe it's called dippy but you know they had they had a minor produce uh LM outputs that were scoring you know higher on this like EQ uh I guess standardized EQ scale uh it was it was beating I think like llama 3.5 right and these are just like Indie Developers and I don't think you can I think it'd be probably disingenuous to assume that you're going to have these you know random open source AI Engineers their mom's basement that are creating better better models than you know open AI but again I think it's that I think it's the fact that that alternative will always exist and creating such a bounty for I mean you can think of it too right like within within AI like startups like there's no real chance for someone to compete with with open AI right just because of the scale they're afforded and so bit tensor does it is pretty much kind of funding that or covering that resource cost for a lot of developers right it makes it much more easier for them to to build these models it covers a lot of their kind of almost go to market and that's why you're seeing like startups you know like inference Labs right they like launch a subnet on on bit tensor as a way to kind of bootstrap you know their companies and bootstrap their growth but I think that'll keep going but I guess also transitioning over to the more Market side of this um and again what is happening now and why obviously the narrative is kind of following Price Right retail doesn't really have many ways to get exposure to AI like sure there are a number of stocks obviously Nidia Microsoft some smaller names but you know that under one billion kind of valuation is really really hard for the the more risk on or you know people who want to be Visionary investors and crypto obviously offers um you know offers them that path and within that if you kind of look at sort of what what's like what's available um you know bit tenser is really the only one that like has this big big picture vision of building something that you know is for the greater good and building something that can be long lasting and it really actually is forming into kind of a true you know decentralized Community I don't think many projects both within that sector and within the space can sort of say that right so it's it's easy to kind of dream big about this and also pointing to what you said right like crypto markets tend to almost like fully price fully price in um you know the like the full potential of a project in a in a really short amount of time right like crypto markets they go from like extreme like euphorium being like this is the future this is going to work you know B tensor should be valued the same as open AI which obviously right now it shouldn't and then they obviously swing back to to kind of that extreme so you're you're playing a bit on the inefficiency of the crypto Market um with this thesis even if you do let's say you don't even think the fundamental case makes any sense right you're like nah this token's worthless right there's no incentive if there's no there's no moneyness or value to the Token even though that that's obvious something that's going be worked on you know but you can still be like left curve you know ai ai go up let me long you know kind of the the best coin in the market and there was a there was a good a couple others there was some some good kind of tweets um there's actually posted at like you know High 3es you know the stake rate of this is obviously Super High um you know it is you're not really locked but you can just kind of feel with it with with to right now it's just kind of going through a bit of a supply squeeze right the first run we went from like 50 to 800 and then you know we we kind of ranged from 200 to 300 for I don't know four to five months right so the cost basis of all the new people that got in um is is just much higher than it was before and the levels they're kind of looking at to take profit are obviously much higher than the previous set of holders um and from also what I understand there was like a big fund that that sold a lot down because they were raising a new fund and they want to show DPI and they're obviously kind of out of tokens at this point um there also were a couple of good tweets I mean I mentioned the uh the Meetup in in Singapore I just felt like strong Community steal um you know Grassroots No Frills like that that I think is shining through uh and there's like a good tweet I don't know if this is really true but uh it says all my AI smartest friends in SF are working on bit sensor during the weekends quote Paradigm back founder in Dai who will remain name was probably nothing um there's actually truth to this like I've had a number of friends in the valley who were just tinkering running minors on bit tenser uh one is actually gearing up to to launch a subnet and I think it was Chris Dixon who like you know when he was saying why he got interested crypto early he was like just follow follow what these developers are doing you know when they're off their F jobs and they're at home or over the weekend like look at what they're playing around with right A lot of these things kind of start off as a as a toy that you don't really understand but that's kind of the beauty of like these decentralized networks is that they are networks at the end of the day right there is this big social layer and they can evolve you know based on what the community wants so to me I think this repr pricing is just one obviously like this Market you know driven thing of like hey we want to get exposure to crypto AI but then the part of it is this fundamental case but also the social layer the community community has being built around if you like all right there's some really really smart people here tackling some very very hard problems and you're seeing early signs of it actually working and that you know in crypto in such a dur of innovation is obviously super exciting and I think you're seeing that in the bars Ju Just to just to add to that little bit right there in terms of fulfilling fulfilling expectations it's it's also about like where the expectations are I just saw the news that uh open AI leadership is kind of falling apart right now and it's just a reminder that yes crypto is new but AI is also new and we're not exactly sure how anything is going to pan out we don't know what the upper limit for either of these two sectors are and so that makes it even more fun to bet on these things gone to 100 billion and who knows who knows where because we don't even know what the right model is yet so there's no way to say oh T's the wrong model we just don't even know and even even open AI at this 100 50 billion round which apparently is like demand is through the roof I think 250 mil is like the minimum check right like people on the surface might be oh you know they're making this much in monthly Revenue but you know theoretically inference will probably replace sech will probably replace search you know what's Google worth like 150 billion in hindsight might turn out to be you know really really low right and so you know those valuation caps go up obviously crypto kind of will follow I I think honestly in crypto I think the the magic number on a circulating basis is $20 billion on a circulating basis is usually is very very hard to break very few projects break that I thinku is actually coming up on that so I'm kind of interested to see where where what happens with that but I think town now is is like 4 billion on a circulating basis you can you can look at to maybe on a one year forward because I do think the the inflation rate obviously is high until the having next year so call it call it like eight million I I still think you have a safe not a safe because you can never say that but you know two and a half to 3x upside would would not surprise me you know before Google there were a few different um search engines out there there was like altav Vista lyos uh Yahoo and I remember like lyos was great for a while and everyone used it and then that you know air quotes model kind of became really bad relative to the others and then people switched all to Vista and then eventually Google showed up and decimated all of them like it doesn't take much for open AI die to fall apart right like all the big technologists have left there's like internal strife we're in the midst of the bubble we're not quite at the SPF goes to prison moment Chief uh you recommended Corel um as as having the best UI on uh on bit tenser and I tried it out and it was freaking amazing so I could easily see a world where um you know the the chat bots of bit tens are suddenly One Day become way better than centralized versions for this you know it's not the most probable world but it's a world right it's possible and you know in that world like open AI goes to zero and all that value goes to bit tensor it's it's possible right so that it's still basically my point is uh it's still very much an open season on dominating uh that market share much like it was open in SE search engine in search I think I think that just big picture right it's it's just super it's super actually I hate even saying this but it is early obviously in this network kind of evolution not saying from from from like a price perspective but you know from where the community is headed and I think people also are getting excited about like um some Network upgrades and those are probably like catalysts that people are factoring into their investment decisions like the big one is is detw dynamic tow so like the the kind of way that emissions are going to be calculated are going to be a more Market Market based system and you will be able to use to to effectively you know speculate on Which models are better right so imagine a world in the same way where you know you need soul to speculate on meem coins uh you will need now to to speculate on models right and it's a pretty cool world if you're right and you identify model early on um you know you'll benefit from from that price appreciation so that's a good one they are moving towards some evm support I don't know what that's going to look like past just having TOA you know available on on the evm within defi I think they're there's some sort of smart contract component with building apps but I'm not too sure um I know like dcg I think they're going to be announcing some sort of like financing product somewhat soon um also I mean this is a bit more on like the ship post angle right The More DJ side of me but I mean Barry silbert is Shilling this thing like his life depends on it like he is he is he he is pretty much comparing this thing to the early days of Bitcoin right and and that's thing with this asset too is it's the same Supply schedule as Bitcoin um like I mentioned about the whole Supply squeeze like this this thing just feels hoarded right now right like you kind of think these emissions are so high yet prices keep staying up here like you know the emissions are high but a lot of them are going to you know into Barry's hands into poly Chain's hands like the big stakers who just really have no interest in selling so assuming being like Oh you know the the emission rate is really really high you need to do the work of how much of those emissions are actually going into to hands that are just trying to sell and there's definitely some right like the newest researchers of the world these kind of Indie subnet owners they're for sure selling but I think you know realistically that is probably on the tune of like 20 30 million a month and if you look at volumes I I I promise you much more than that was bought like in the last week um so I don't think emissions are as scary as as people make them out to be it's the same thing as the early days of Bitcoin right like tops and bottoms were kind of dictated by miners right supply side when it gets hoarded you know when they decide to unload obviously that is kind of when it tops but I just don't really see how the largest holders are looking to take profit anywhere near this level yeah I mean but they they have a level right like silbert and Paradigm have LPS the LPS aren't just going to sit sit on their hands and say nothing if this thing doubles or triples from here right there's a Barry doesn't have LPS really I assume that he was running some fund I didn't realize this was a PA trade for him just just just accumulating they they they they put out they actually put out a pretty good research report on on bit tenser which which is solid and VC VC funds I think one one thing that also drives them is that they can just accumulate for a very long time and just hold until they think that the project isn't working um I mean you saw that you saw that with maker from a lot of the a lot of the big VCS because they literally held it for like half a decade until they decided it wasn't it just wasn't working anymore um and then they and then they started offloading it I mean there's a the these guys can hold on and not sell for a very long time if if need be I think that you know if if this does work or if it doesn't just if it's not clear that it's dying which it kind of was a little bit for maker that it just was being outcut by everything else and these guys just basically don't sell until they're till they won the fund down which is telegraphed most of the time that was a good sh Fest maybe maybe we can hit maybe we can hit a now once we once we release this I mean luckily nothing we shill on here is financial advice it's all just hypothetical uh you know the yeah of course and as as as we always say if you listen to anything that is said on this podcast you'll inevitably lose all of your money and end up on the street so please don't yeah to just rallied a bunch don't don't buy it off Chief sell it or or don't um no I I think it's a really interesting thesis and decentralized AI is such a cool concept um it it could totally work and imagine if it did oh my God Jon you just got to believe in something believe I believe green lion chasing the green lion all right boys this was a pleasure as always pleasure thanks for coming on Chief love having you great calls of course great calls [Music]

Transcript Text:
all right we're live let's see who's here oh okay okay all right let me just retweet this for everybody give some people some time to get in the Stream so that we can talk about all the fun things that are happening feel like we're we're like Gamers Obi like really I mean this is this is a literal video game is it not a video game for you because it's video game for me trading is like you got all you got the flashing lights you got the dopamine you got the stimulation you have lack of social life I mean you basically have all the Hallmarks of being a gamer you got the wives mothers girlfriends hating you yeah actually you know uh my my girlfriend knows nothing about crypto which is an amazing thing wonderful thing and she was telling me keep yeah and she 100% And she was telling me that you know if if I want the number to go where I need it to go I should just close my eyes and visualize it no that's terrible that that's like um that like manifesting money doesn't work remember we talked about this uh reminiscence of a stock operator if you're like I want to earn enough money trading stocks to buy that fur coat you just get Rin I yeah the don't don't trade for the fur coat never trade for the fur coat never well I I do think you know there there's this one guy that I used to listen to or this one documentary of this large Australian Commodities Trader named John Molton and the guy the guy was a legend he just yelled out things on the floor and he was a lone guy didn't trade for a bank didn't trade for anyone just traded for himself and he would sling massive size H and he made you know what it seems to be reasonable money throughout his career and he's like the epitome of a discretionary Trader one of his pieces of advice is that if you ever don't know what to do just stare at the chart for 15 minutes close your eyes and then walk away and then it's your gut instinct is the next move so his his middle name is his nickname is Rambo I just Googled him he's John Rambo Molton he's amazing he's amazing if I did that I would literally lose everything so I guess what works for Rambo doesn't necessarily need to work for you but maybe it does in fact I'm gonna try that I I think this is the time to trade actively AI I'm I'm like I'm normally a pretty passive long kind of guy I just sit there and hold stuff that I like and occasionally rebalance or clean up line items or ad line items when I want to gamble on something but like this time I think like basically I think that the market the crypto Market has disconnected to the downside from the sort of fundamental picture for crypto and I think that on some of these Savage dips of Despair uh you get some pretty crazy looking alt buying opportunities like I I have a fair amount of conviction in certain alts uh and their their ability to perform if we get the right sort of outcome in the election which again is a coin flip right so you know the risk reward looks pretty decent in certain cases when when the Market's shanking on fear and uncertainty and doubt I don't I don't think the Market's fully shanked yet that's that's the thing I mean if you look at just look at Price action today I mean one of the things you should always be paying attention to if you're doing anything in this market is just pull up pull up open interest and pull up funding and you look at you know try to look at moves in the cont text of what is driving them so today I just did not for even half a second believe the move to 61k uh and I mean let's see let's see where it shakes out here I still think that we've got a little a little bit lower to go I mean maybe maybe 585 from here but if you're actively trading what you saw is you saw oi go from 185,000 coins when price was 60k to 193,000 that's 8,000 BTC worth of longs that were added and it moved price ,000 that is ridiculous and to me what that suggests is that suggests somebody trying to either take people out of their stops because there probably a lot of people that were short that you know were stopping out above 60k but very rarely I don't think I've ever actually seen it other than when you're in you know the the early stages of a depressed market like when you go from FTX into Market starts going back up I don't think I've ever seen that type of OI ramp stay uh and this is a trending or this is not a trending Market this is a choppy market so anytime you see a data point like that you have to think to yourself all right well I probably should be less Long than I was before right and one thing that's important is you you don't always have to take a position uh but you do always have to evaluate where you are relative to before so again this is only if you're actively Trading but if you were long 100% at 58k and now we're at 61 and you see that data point you have to be either less long or you have to make other Arguments for why you should stay as long as you were before because price went up and the risk risk and the risk in the market started going up right so I mean my general view on this Market is that the vast majority of price action is still either caused by some random person jamming it on coinbase or some random person jamming it on fatures and that is not necessarily a sign of a healthy market and because we're not at you know value levels yet I don't think 60k per BTC is necessarily a value level for allocators we're going to chop and grind lower until we either a stay above 50k for another two months or B have a flush down below that those are you know my my two my two base cases that's interesting um one thing that I liked about that narrative is the idea that we're in a very IL liquid time like we talked about this on previous episodes markets absolutely loathe uncertainty there's so much of it right now um it's hard for anybody to really trade with conviction and if what you're saying is true like you know 8,000 units worth of OI jams the market that much like it shouldn't you know so uh not that many people are are in there trading and it's you know I guess this is the type of Market where you want to provide liquidity you don't want to be a taker you want to be a maker so to your point like if it's actually shanking you want to be there on the bid and if it's Roofing you want to maybe lighten up a little bit but you don't want to be lifting lifting or hitting here I 100% I mean again it's the castanza rule that we've talked about do the opposite of what you know you're you know when when Bitcoin goes up your gun instinct is a I Gotta Buy I Gotta Buy and when Bitcoin goes down it's like ah I gotta sell I gotta sell what would Rambo do Rambo would stare at his screen and YOLO into tons of big I don't know yeah fair enough all all I'm saying is you got to and the the other thing is you know take a step back and I'm saying this to myself as much as I'm saying it to everyone listening you know take you got to take a step back and look at the daily charts and look at the 4H hour charts and not spend all of your time on the five minute charts because what you have to do in these types of environments is kind of only play at the extremes right when something extreme is happening one way or another I mean today like a 5% move up in BTC when equities were down at one point that tells you okay well maybe something weird is happening right may maybe that that's an inorganic move or or you know when when Bitcoin in a single candle trades down a thousand bucks single hour hour candle you think to yourself okay well that's a you know that's a pretty crazy move maybe we should you know start buying a little bit right yeah and we'll probably get our chance the sort of thoughts that you have to start generating in your head because I don't see what starts the trend yet I have a few percolating ideas of what could start a trend but um for now I'm still in chop mode well tomorrow the Market's going to be surprised by the FED no matter what right so that's one potential Catalyst that could get things moving one way or another yet another reason not to trade right this second um Market expectations are like the market the FED fund Futures Market is pricing a 32 basis point cut so if they cut 25 or if they cut 50 um that's going to shock the market either way maybe not shock but little surprise and if they cut by 75 which I think is like less than 5% chance then uh then We're Off to the Races but I think honestly AI you know I'm not an interest rate Trader it's like basic basically the one asset class that I haven't traded professionally I know nothing about it other than just like you know sitting around peripherally kind of gazing at it from the sidelines like like maybe you do I noticed that back in 2022 when inflation was 9% the FED began their hiking program with 25 bips and it seemed ridiculous uh to me how like you know it's kind of a spit in the ocean when you're trying to solve that that huge inflation problem maybe we're supposed to expect an incremental cautious cut just like they did with their hikes in the beginning yeah I think I think that's I think that's fair I mean one thing about the what the FED is going to do whether it's 25 50 or 75 one idea that's going around my head that was brought up by a member of of my team today is that Bitcoin and the markets topped very aggressively once the FED started hiking rates you know just look at Bitcoin right bit Bitcoin basically just started a straight line lower once the FED started hiking rates and we all know that Bitcoin and equities yes they're correlated but sometimes they're not super correlated and sometimes Bitcoin can go do its own thing and it doesn't necessarily need to follow risk the brain dead take is okay well if Bitcoin goes down when the FED hikes then Bitcoin goes up when the FED cuts and that in itself forget the forget the actual implication for risk like forget what cutting is going to do for for equities for Bitcoin that can potentially become something for people to grab onto and for people to say in a looser monetary environment the bet in addition to betting that rates are going to go down is Bitcoin right like the BET becomes Bitcoin and that that's one of the ideas that's at least going through my head right now as to why maybe we shouldn't be as bearish as we've been previously but it's not I I I don't necessarily have high conviction in that yet I still lean bearish for now well this is what I'm talking about right like maybe you're right on a very shortterm time frame but maybe I'm right over the medium term which is that the fundamentals are really improving like central banks are hoovering gold you're been to boot B AI never been to Bhutan but I they're very happy there yeah that's their that's their marketing jingle for sure um they're not very happy with their local currency though and I'm not surprised that they've started buying uh wads of Bitcoin right like this just just to clarify that they weren't they're mining Bitcoin they're not actually buying Bitcoin but they're not selling it yet which is yeah well they're mining it I I mean they they they have free energy so true they do have some beautiful Himalayas and hydro and solar and all that good stuff I mean I think if Bon mines Bitcoin and doesn't sell it that's just fewer units for the miners that do sell so that's bullish um I think we're GNA see more of that frankly in coming days and weeks and months and I also think that you know to your point about Bitcoin sometimes being correlated with stocks and sometimes not being correlated with stocks I think that we've been in a very long regime where Bitcoin is basically lever NASDAQ to the point where you like speak with trafy guys and they're like oh bitcoin's just one and a half times NASDAQ like why would you consider it a separate asset class you know so to me that's like the level of complacency that as a contrarian I want to hear before this thing starts to go um go parabolic now I don't know when it will go parabolic and I don't know uh I don't know how I'm going to feel if suddenly the fundamentals shift but as we talked about on this podcast before um the current sort of news picture is already priced in and what we have to assess and evaluate is the second derivative of the news and what I've seen is the news just getting better and better and better the backdrop getting better and better and better I expect that to continue because I don't think it's nearly as good as it could be um if we're you know cutting rates with stocks and and Bitcoin basically at all-time highs and you know then the if the election it's a coin flip but if if you know the crypto Market flips head like look out right so I don't think things are going to get worse in the near term um and I don't really see the price responding to that so for me the risk reward just gets better and better especially on some of the you know lower vicissitudes of this chop what what do you what do you say things are going to get when you say things are going to get better I mean do you mean just that the F like you know you view the FED cutting as just good across yeah I mean I don't think that people understand you don't you don't buy the you don't you don't buy the argument that they're cutting now because the econom is about to get really bad no no no I mean the the FED okay so there are two kinds of monetary let's let's call it interest rate responses policy responses right one is uh very aggressive action like aggressive cutting or aggressive hiking um that's usually a response to something supply side you know oil shock demand shock something crazy right so so supply side or demand side I should say so a shock right and and shocks are terrible for markets including Bitcoin so if the FED is going quick like it tells you that there's a broader kind of macroeconomic backdrop that you need to be wary of If the Fed is like telegraphing for six months that they're going to do something and then like easing the market into the idea that they're going to do it and then they start doing it slowly and steadily that's less of like a like the again fed policy responses are like an interest rate responses they're lagging indicators they're not leading indicators so unless you know unless the world is on fire them like sort of gradually cutting means that the inflation problem is over and them gradually cutting more importantly like it's just an asset allocation game right like it means that however many trillions or or more than 10 trillion dollars which are currently sitting in things like t- bills and Commercial paper and you know name your mutual fund like iash bill whatever like all of this stuff just looks worse and worse as the yields go from five to four to three and then suddenly you know people are sitting there earning 3% on their T bills one and a half% after tax you know if they live in a high tax state in in America or high tax place like London and they're like why am I why am I bothering with this one and a half percent thing when you know Bitcoin has has rallied I don't know double digit percentages you know compound annual returns for 15 years like maybe I should reallocate a few basis points to that and a lot of basis points to stocks and I again I don't really see a scenario once we clear the uncertainty and you know the regulatory hurdles why Bitcoin not talking about alts why Bitcoin would just Flatline while the rest of the market um goes vertical doesn't make sense yeah I think you know what one one thing that we always that we always talk about when it comes to crypto Cycles is that Bitcoin tends to go up and then altcoins tend to follow and that's just because of the that's just because of the wealth effect so the question is do we see that Dynamic with the S&P and NASDAQ as well I mean I I think the an my answer is yes I mean if we get if we get a rip in NASDAQ and S&P all-time highs I mean we're we're very close touched it on touched it on uh you know uh touch on spy today I think that what ends up happening is that at some point those people start rotating out and buying BTC as they go as they go down the risk curve because people want to juice want to Ru the returns right and what this sets up for is it sets up for a really good I mean really honestly amazing amazing buying opportunity if what ends up happening is that we do get some some drisking as people in the beginning are nervous because I think you see what the FED is doing and you see what the economy is doing differently than some people right and so there's reasonable interpretation that okay hey they're cutting if the data print that comes out if any bad data comes out payrolls come out bad then you probably get a pretty massive drisking event and then that's probably the buy and if they come out good then we're probably just going straight up actually you know the more that I talk to the more bullish I get because yes the less the less the less the bare case makes sense it's a lot of it's a lot of you know what I found is that whenever you handwave and try to use macro uh you know to make a bull bull or bear case for for BTC if if your bare case is I think equities are going down or your bull case is I think equities are going up then normally that doesn't work um so your point about alts though is I think the most pertinent question like when you said that you think that alts will start to perform because of the wealth effect like a cohort of listeners who work at protocols with big ftvs and unlocks coming in the next six to 12 months where literally like I think I could hear them or see them in the chat foaming at the mouth right like this is what they are hoping for like in Commodities in Commodities we call this physical bailing out the paper right so you know for example right now um the the crude oil uh managed space meaning like hedge funds Pension funds asset managers they're required to publish their net Futures positioning to to the cftc for regulatory purposes um basically a you know way of predicting squeezes and Market manipulation all that and preventing Market manipulation all that stuff anyway you can see they're all basically as short as they've ever been in the history of the report and there is literally no way that they make money unless physical bails them out now what does it mean for physical to bail them out it would mean that like Co hits right and suddenly like planes stop flying cars stop driving and people just don't want the sticky black stuff anymore and even though they're all in the most consensus trade of all time the underlying physical economics of Commodities bail them out and make them a bunch of money that happened twice in in the last four years it happened during covid then it happened again during Ukraine the opposite direction now I think you have a similarly like extremely consensus sort of like bag holder community of altcoin people just like literally on their knees praying to whatever deity they worship that uh like the SEC gets an overhaul and clears the way quickly for some other source of capital to flow into the altcoin space other than just like a great you know greater fools there are no greater fools to buy I don't think Bitcoin people are going to be like wow I just doubled my money I'm going to buy suie right I think it's it's going to have to be like applications that get built on suie can pass through Revenue to token holders and that that requires a regulatory change what do you think uh yeah I don't I don't know I I do think I do think that what we're seeing right now at least is we're seeing a as we've talked about over and over and over and over we're seeing a lack of applications being built and there's a gap here right and what is the gap there's a gap for an L1 or infrastructure or something that aess beta to the upside eth has been dog like dog [ __ ] all year uh salana honestly too has not been great this year it was really great last year this year it's okay you know uh it's tracking tracking with BTC the only issue that I have with uh you know being bearish on l1s right now is actually think there's just a gap in the market for these things where if sui continues to perform well then it's a self fulfilling prophecy at some point obviously it collapses in my opinion unless it gets real usage uh but it's you know it's funny because the way that I view alt is they're providing a gambling tool for people and people want to gamble and that's sort of the use case right now there's a there's a missing uh there's a missing piece of that market which is you think bitcoin's going up you want to outperform uh you you might coals around something something like aie I mean if you look at soul today okay BT is up three and a half% and soul is up 60 bits one of the reasons I think this is is because there are a lot of people that Sol is very institutionally owned interestingly enough and there are also a lot of people that did the trade uh yeah now after FTX a lot of that lock salana is sitting on institutional balance sheets it's like a weirdly trafi trade and so I think as the market has softened people are hedging out that risk because they you know if if you bought it if if you bought so at a 40% I don't even I don't remember what the discount was I don't know but you know at a 40% discount um you probably want to lock that in rather than give it up if you see it start starting to come back down so I think a lot of people are selling pops yeah on soul and that has made it you know it's just made it a worse asset to trade from a from a beta perspective it's not just it's not like indiv idual that are doing this it's investors demanding returns of their institutional like basically the LPS are demanding of the GP like lock in some profits like return some Capital to me you know yeah that that that is true I mean there's a there's sort of a forcing function there to actually make make sure that that hedging occurs uh so I mean as you know I'm still of the mindset that btcd is on its way up I mean I was I think that we could see mid 65 on btcd before we finally top out I think that there's actually a long like a long way to go and that's because in general there's it's I think it's very hard to generate a general alt bid right now that's the smoothest Trend in crypto OB yeah it's a great it's a great trade I mean you know basically I I want to go back to the point and say that uh it's it's important to not always trade you have to pick your spots very carefully and you have to understand when you have Edge and when you don't have Edge so for example what I say now hey go out there and go buy a bunch of BTC and then short a bunch of alts against it you don't need to put on that trade now you can wait for the opportune moment and sometimes the opportune moment doesn't come but if we get a squeeze across the board of these short adults then why not be there to take the other side exactly and I think that might be the best trade is once again on pops sell high this is why I want to trade actively like there's certain tokens that I want to put in the you know cycle bags bottom drawer but other tokens that I think you could sell versus being long BTC as a pairs trade and you'll make money I mean one thing that kind of tickled me this week was watching watching I guess it wasn't this week but like recently watching the friend Tech uh platform get rugged you know I think that over the next two to four years we're going to see a lot of alts get rugged right like not not the good ones but I think we're gonna see the I mean like let's say you're a Dev you've been in crypto for 15 years or 10 years you're sitting on a wad of H bar or polka dot which I love to hate or name your crappy Alt with that's basically zero uptake uptake and just vaporware yeah there are sort of like correlation alos that will drive it higher when BTC ticks higher and it will kind of underperform but eventually it'll just sort of go flaccid and these people who are sitting on their bags it becomes this like really awkward prisoners dilemma where they're like if I sell then everybody else who's long is going to be mad at me so maybe I won't but if somebody else sells then I lose everything and I've been working on this for a decade like I think we're gonna see rug after rug after rug friend Tech style or or Belo style dollar sign Belo style for those of you who remember so that's that honestly sad but wish I my with me it needs to happen it's like somebody needs some like some of these coins just need to go away like the I agree I agree I think one of the worst people in especially in the space will constantly talk about how you know amazing the technological developments are and all the new crazy Financial things that it can that it can unlock uh but I I think in the same vein not to you know I'm not going to get political but sometimes progress isn't good sometimes there you know there's a there's an old story you you're walking down a street and you see a fence there do you take down the fence well why do that unless unless you know why the fence was there I mean maybe somebody's smarter than you put it there maybe there's a reason the fence exists I don't know and one of the fences I think in the traditional Financial world is the ability uh to force Founders to hold value in their stock and not have a liquid market for getting rich before your product actually works and that's actually still even changed in the startup world over the last five years uh there's more of a market for this stuff but that was actually a good thing that Founders couldn't get rich before their company went public and now the moment your token is Al you're you're public and you don't need to do anything you just make a ton of money and it takes a you know and and I will say this to be nuan it it takes a very driven individual like an extremely smart driven motivated and well-meaning individual to look at $25 million and say I'm going to keep working hard and that's why there are not that many entrepreneurs in this world right like you know you might live in a bubble where you think everybody's an entrepreneur but the reality is if if you put the vast majority of humanity in a position where they had this company and they were just gifted $25 million would they keep working on it most people I mean we would but I'm sure a lot of the listeners would and there are a lot of people in crypto that do but a lot of people wouldn't and that's why you see these things right yeah and what makes that even harder is that unlike normal startup Equity where it's like oh somebody chips in a few Mill at a $25 million or sorry some valuation that makes your stake worth $25 million and you're the entrepreneur for for every one of those there's like a crypto project where the founder or the devs are looking at their their positions their liquid positions and they say $25 million one moment then over the course of this Summer that number's gone from like 10 to 40 18 times and they're probably not right in the head at this point I think what they're seeing is less what you and I see on a normal day walking down the street and more what you have behind you which is just this weird Fantasy Land uh wheel Wheel of Fortune virtual Wheel of Fortune this is uh there there's there's a story behind this background guys so you see this as a beautiful Wheel of Fortune if you're ancient like me and Jonah you know what this is you basically you spin it and you get a prize but you don't know what kind of prize you're going to get you know and the key here is to remember that if you're in crypto you're probably gonna walk out with a prize if you invest in Assets in general any assets you're probably GNA walk out with a prize you just don't necessarily know what time you're going to get that Prize or when you're going to get that Prize or how you're going to get that Prize or what size it's going to be and the key is to just stay alive make sure you can keep spinning right right make sure you don't blow up like don't overinvestment are profitable so what does that mean that over time as long as profitable companies stay in this index you make your money you make money it's why equities go up equities go up because they make money like these things make money there's a cash flow so as time goes on as long as there's no like World War III probably act the stock market gets to go up because it's comprised of things that make money um same can't necessarily be true about crypto right now however however as long as the equity markets go up over time then people are going to want to bet on things that get them more return than that 5% a year and so Bitcoin probably has a has a spot in that now does anything else as we've talked about maybe not so you know my my best you know to turn this into something more actionable my best plan for getting long this Market is a clear breakthrough of all time highs on equities or a clear flush on bitcoin and other than that I mean guys I don't know why you listen to this podcast because you can probably just like set alerts and go to sleep but sh that was my that was my rant no I love it I mean look to your point sometimes there are just times where like we get we take a lot of crap for this on Twitter oh look it's Belo it's the bear it's the big bad bear welcome beloo his skin looks like a rug he is a rug yeah so I mean basically this is people give us a lot of crap on Twitter because our podcast is called a THX and they're expecting I don't know low market cap shitcoin shells that that THX that's not really what we're here to do it's more about developing a process uh and Lasting time in the market Beats in the market um yeah you're not going to thousand X your money but you're thousand X your knowledge I can promise you that you might thousand X your money like if you bought gbtc then rotated into Bowden then rotated into e like you wouldn't be that far off true you know so like it's possible but hard and you're not going to do it all on one coin I guess my point is like during these times where it's just wild chop and there's no alt narrative um why dive in front of the altcoin bus right like just just like preserve yourself and to the point of this guy or gal nasty who wrote man I miss 2017 making money without mid curving BS about rates and macro I there is an element of like yes you can just belong Bitcoin right now and probably pretty happy about that but as you and I both know Obi um complacency kills right what works today will not work tomorrow or next week and if you're just Blas about your your risk watching the number go up and you know just saying I'm so smart I don't need to Mid curve things you could end up losing your shirt a lot of people lost it on FTX just like that and and I don't like the mid curve meme because basically the the implication is that analysis is bad right um and I don't know I just my career has run contrary to that notion for a long time like stay staying in the game requires thinking and rethinking yeah no I mean and and research and Analysis is extremely important I mean one of the highest Alpha things that you can do for yourself in this particular Market is go on to go on to coin gecko I mentioned this before but just go go go on to coin Gecko and actually spend three hours looking at each project that's below a 100 Mil market cap actually go look right filter by 100 Mil market cap if you're if you're like really looking for a real return that you know you're not just looking at gamble you're you're looking okay I want to be able to find the 10x that's how you find the 10x is you don't don't go on Twitter and look for what people are tweeting about that's silly because by definition if people are actually already tweeting about it then it's probably priced reasonably effectively it's it's better for you as a person to like go look at what is actually being built out there that is low enough market cap do the diligence teams are pretty accessible you can go into a Discord send them a message most of the time go into the telegram tag the founder talk to them do you like their ask them hard questions do you like their answers do you not like their answers right and you can even narrow it down by sector go look at you know go down the list of every single dpin project see see what they're about right and that that's that's how you get things that you can hold for a while and actually make make make some make some good money on um you know I know we talk a lot about the a lot about the majors here but you you offended my ego when you said you know we we won't teach you how to also make money on on other things no I mean we definitely we definitely have plenty of [ __ ] coins left in the old cannon to be fired uh at appropriate times but I think that now just isn't one of those times like at least put it this way not for me I don't I I I like the um like the top 50 coins I don't like the sub 100 100 Mil FTV coins because I'm not a very good angel investor or venture capitalist um I've tried and failed many times um probably broken even but that's kind of what you're looking at when you look at these low fdv coins unless it was like the meme coin summer where something was just hilarious and you buy it for you know 10 days and then sell it 3x higher you know or 10x or 50x higher in certain cas like a lot of these low FTV coins involve a product Market fit that does not exist yet right they involve some vision of the future that may or may not come to pass and that is an area where I personally feel less comfortable um that's fair but you know you can listen to plenty of that is that is how you that is how you find these things right that's that that's the I I I agree and and you know one thing that I'll say is you got to be good at it but I think that probably holds true for everything that we say still have to be good like you can't our secret Talent that's that's the secret no we at least I don't have it you have to be really good he's he's really good started peeing outside good for you Belo you got rugged um you are a rug did anyway this is actually a really good question by the way uh the one here sorry what is the difference between patience and complacency you want to pull that up uh crap where is that oh there we go yeah renley B what is the difference between patience and complacency I'll take a I'll take a stab at that one patience is uh not doing anything while paying attention complacency is not doing anything while not paying attention I don't think you could I don't think you could have said any better that's yeah that's honestly that should like go on the wall in my office I mean literally like when people are like oh it's a mid curve take or oh these guys like yes sometimes there's no trade there's no portfolio reallocation to do but that doesn't mean you should tune out right because then you'll miss you'll miss the Avalanche of flow that you know can either carry you out or take you to the promised land and you know it's funny like I was talking to a guy who you know used to report to me back in the day and he was saying I want to be a crypto pm and I was thinking like it it in like he was like what what advice would you give and my my advice was just like like I tried to think about like the pithiest most concise thing that I could possibly say and I said well first of all two-part advice first do it in your PA don't necessarily do it with tradire institutional guard rails because the volatility is too huge but that aside we already know that like you there isn't always a trade and you have to be paying attention at all times because this Market Market just gets so violent um you have to be very Nimble about switching between periods of calm sideline you know watching the game and then running onto the field and getting in the game 100% I I think that's you know es especially your point about doing it doing it with your pa uh I know we've we've discussed that we've discussed it in the past but that's like a Hidden Gem is for unless uh you know I think it makes a lot of sense for people that are involved especially in crypto to not be super active Traders uh and to just invest in you know in the in the majors have a stable job have cash flow and then just allocate portion of your portfolio to this now even if you're doing this full-time right like let's say you start off that way and you start to figure out that you're really good and you start to figure out that you've you know you you're like okay wow like I really figured out how to trade this thing I'm starting to make some I'm starting to make some real money I'm starting to figure out how to you know uh how how to trade I've seen a lot of people try to go like join a crypto fund and I think that's probably one of the worst things that you can do for yourself uh because one access to people is so open and the ability to learn from people is so open in crypto that if you just I mean like DM Jonah we have a group chat like DM me you you're in a group chat of ,200 people some some of whom are better Traders than we are and you can network if you can Network effectively which you're going to need to do if you want a job anyway you can learn and if that's if you want to focus on crypto I think the caveat is if you want to learn other things yeah maybe go you know you can go try to work at a traditional investment shop and do crypto at a traditional investment shop and then at least you can learn the other things as well if that's what you want but if you're just like I want to trade crypto I just want to do crypto guys get in the chat get active talk to people Network ask questions don't be don't be afraid to be dumb really it's crypto is so bizarrely retail oriented and accessible like if you wanted to learn to trade gasoline you could not hop on Discord or telegram or podcast and figure it out crypto you really can you don't need to do it institutionally and I think like so you're telling me if I called your old boss at VTO and I was like hey man so um how should I trade this oil thing he's not going to respond to me probably not probably not I'm just gonna leave it at that um I'm still afraid of those people so I'm just gonna say probably not but what what you can do like the typical wealth management advice like if you're scared like you know you have a nest egg maybe you're getting a little bit into your into your life and you don't want to just like suddenly lose everything on an FTX like event or some crazy nuclear selloff maybe maybe it does make sense to apply the traditional wealth management advice of like 60% % equities 40% bonds but like tweak that for your risk profile and maybe go like 60 to 70% Bitcoin 30 to 40% you know things that you can sell when you need cash flow to fund your you know your dinners and your vacations and your you know your life uh so that you don't have to sell the Bitcoin um rather than being and then maybe instead of being 100 100% of your crypto allocation is Bitcoin you know not Financial advice Maybe 80% of your crypto allocation can be Bitcoin and 20% you can just be trading up a storm doing doing things that have nothing that look nothing like the long short Equity hedge fund Style Trading that we often talk about like there are many ways to make money in crypto you can do pairs trading you can do centralized versus decentralized Arbitrage I know a guy who built a memec coin bot that just sort of like gets in and out of those things somewhat profitably somehow mid-frequency trading just like analyzing order books and getting in and out like they're quany things there are not so quany things you could probably go and like pick up the VC unlocks table and just pick the worst 50 of those projects and get short them versus long Bitcoin and be okay right like there all these little things that you can do with a smaller percentage of your portfolio so that you aren't the guy who literally just like comes in Leroy Jenkins style and goes like Max short with 50x leverage on binance and gets liquidated today for no [ __ ] reason right like you don't have to do it like that so damn wish wish somebody had told me that before I liquidated my whole account but anyway thank thank you for that I one one thing that uh we get we're getting some questions here two of which are kind of kind of similar uh it's interesting what do you think about the FTM hype fade it or buy it and then uh do you do you all buy this whole defi Renaissance trade that has been making the rounds on Twitter I mean these are basically the same question and I know they're about completely different assets but they're basically the same question and it's that how sustainable are these short-term narratives and the answer is not very sustainable and the only way to trade these things is to trade them technically in my personal opinion so like for FTM you can trade it technically uh I don't I don't believe that Andre is necessarily the most reliable person in the world he could walk away again at any moment uh FTM like the team has been notoriously unreliable as well uh it's possible that it goes up in a straight line um because you know I think it's reason tightly held and it is generating it is generating attention do I think in three years that FTM will be you know huge probably not um the way that you try to approach these trades is by estimating how many people are already in them so there are two really good websites KO and sentiment that allow you to track in you know investor sentiment and with these types of Trades if you look at like the volume of tweets and the volume of people talking about it and uh you know who's talking about it and where it's percolated that is very very helpful so for example if you see you know a 3X standard deviation increase in the discussion about FTM and it is accompanied by no increase in price then you probably don't want to buy you probably want to get out if it's accompany by big increase in price and it's still growing then okay maybe you want to get in long story short is these are traits these are not long these are not investment Theses and so what you need I love how these are just like this is just pure psychology with zero P psychology right and so what you need to do in these types of situations is hey uh you know where am I am I in ear am I early to the trade or am I late to the trade like I mean one one example which is kind of interesting is that uh gamei a lot of the volumes on gamey like IMX has been trading up uh ilv has been you know it's actually been like tra trading reasonably well um hasn't hasn't made a new low uh these things are starting to get a little bit of traction right now uh I don't know if I'm I don't personally I don't own any of this any of this stuff it's a bit too too small for me to punt for me to for me to punt around but it's things like that like look for increases in increases in volume off of like complete low oh this might be a narrative so but by the time you get on here and you ask me hey FTM defi Renaissance that everyone on Twitter is talking about It's just tough for me to trade that uh you know again these things could 2x with the defi specifically it's that there no there there's no real new innovation there I think that uh I think that what's happening right now is that there's interest because of the Trump defi project but at the end of the day there's no new innovation the best assets are going to be the ones that institutions can come into and tokenize their assets on uh so if you want to bet on that specific thing happening then obviously you can find assets but I think defly in general is not necessarily my favorite thing right now A is just eating the rest of defi alive and you can probably extrapolate that occurrence onto many other sub sectors of the altcoin space like I do think that there will be winners in some of these sectors I do not think that you need 6,000 different protocols that'll let you stake your eth and then borrow and lend again against it right it's the the best player is going to win and then the rest are going to kind of fester and then they're just going to start getting rugged one after another so I do think that defi is important uh I know some people from you know some people I'm very close with in the market like have active Partnerships with a use that protocol for trfi purposes like it's it's real it's growing the ux is incredible it's like one of the few things in crypto to be excited about but yeah defi is a space like do you need to be long defi on Phantom do you need to get long the token for Tonic the decks on near like no you don't right so uh maybe this is about selectively picking winners rather than uh getting excited about narratives I mean I guess what El should we talk about we talk about eth we could talk about salana we talk about AI talk about other sectors talk about talk about a lot I don't know how much more you want to you want to cover here I mean if we have any questions from the we can go through them like salana know we we talked about that uh eth is eth is the xrp of this cycle I still hold eth in my portfolio says Mr are you are you okay should I seek therapy are you okay we're here for you I don't think you like look guys just long quick you know PSA if you hold eth in your portfolio give me a call I'll talk you you know I'll talk you down it's okay you know not everyone's intelligent not everyone's beautiful not everyone's smart it's okay you'll live just get rid of it can we discuss internet computer that was probably the bottom for eth BTC let me go look at the chart yeah it it did bottom out I saw it kind of perform today I was like this is different this feels weird going on here oh no it's getting it's getting it's getting smacked again here interesting yeah I mean look I the the issue again the issue with eth is that and we've talked about this on a lot of different pods but it's just cannibal it's just been cannibalized it's just getting um yeah even looks tired it's you know everybody everybody looks really everybody looks tired it's not it's not new it's not sexy it's not interesting the one Saving Grace for eth I'll make a bull case if I have to is that as yields come down it looks better it looks a little bit better as yields come down and it does have at least some yield uh and if that narrative takes hold then it becomes stronger in a way that Bitcoin doesn't because as people buy eth people tend to use eth more and then eth actually goes and becomes deflationary so there is a flexive Loop to eth that BTC doesn't have unfortunately that's true to the upside and the downside it is weird what you just said like when somebody was trying to sell us a Twitter handle they they offered it an eth eth is like a bizarre like Anarchist uh internet currency in a way that others aren't you know yeah yeah I think it's just I think it's just like everyone like every every single person in crypto that you want to interact with has an eth wallet yeah I mean I have an eth wallet I mean I it's not like I hold zero literally zero e I've been in this industry for long enough like a 350,000 metamasks and some of them have e in it right like and maybe that's enough of a moat Obi yeah maybe that's that's all you need it's not the best tech that wins sometimes it's just the tech that everybody uses yeah it's it's a you know reasonable reasonable reasonable Point Oil Man like beepers people still use them people still use beepers I thought only anyway moving on from that moving on uh is there anything else for tonight I'm SI I'm sick as a dog I like I didn't I haven't left London I didn't go to this stupid conference where everybody always gets sick and I'm just sick anyway so I think I'm gonna hit the sack here I'm pretty tired um love talking to you as always Obi none of this is investment advice again we're just pontificating here I'm not shushing I'm shushing the dog yeah shut up Jonah no no no keep keep going keep going that's all that's all I had um I know this is this is great as always uh good having people come in with questions good [ __ ] posting with you we'll catch you again soon talk to you soon thank you

and we're live all right hey everybody welcome back to another THX live stream this stream will not be brought to you by helium or bad Wi-Fi cross your fingers Jonah let's see if I can make it the whole time I think you can we can do this I love uh love your background by the way thank you it's kind of how I'm feeling right now it's uh it's one of those markets where you know I do believe that we're in you know kind of a mega Trend upwards I do think that Bitcoin is headed north of $150,000 not Financial advice at some point before we enter the next nuclear be winter um but what's freaking me out and what I would be if I didn't have a framework to kind of cling to right now I would be Panic selling um the reason why I'm kind of like a little freaked out and panicky but containing myself and doing nothing is because crypto is so election dependent right now I'm not talking about Bitcoin I think Bitcoin is going to perform no matter what but all of the other tokens out there that aren't BTC are really hinging upon this sort of binary outcome on the one hand you have a guy literally running on America's very first pump your bags platform right Donald Trump is like issuing nfts starting defi projects with his son like like Trump trump cards it it's ridiculous you know he's like showing up at the Bitcoin conference on the other hand you have what feels like a continuation of you know the gentler era strangle hold on crypto I don't think crypto is going to be too happy about another four years of just getting you know abused and beaten down with the regulatory hammer uh you know fighting fighting a government that has infinite resources so like this overhang of the prospect of another four years of what we've currently of what we've just experienced like that's not going away for three months Trump Trump's odds could be 80% and we still wouldn't price to Perfection like the threat of that is just too too big so I'm struggling to see how the market performs in the next three months uh until election day and I'm kind of wondering like what am I doing like why why shouldn't I just be shorting a bunch of perss right now against my bags and buying them back after we we bleed out a little further in in in this sort of like downward sloping Trend Channel what do you think honestly I'm 100% on board with that and the issue the issue really is that we've just lost interest in crypto people have lost interest in buying it people have lost interest in trading it it's gone from being you know a hot topic of conversation to something that people have genuinely stepped back and they go well I don't really know hence the background like what I don't know what to make of this thing because obviously Kamala has made statements about being more supportive of crypto than than Biden was but the issue is that the the two paths are so massively Divergent in the world of trump the probability that Bitcoin becomes a reserve asset of the US government go from negative 50% to positive 5% right and that's huge right that that 5% probability I don't you know a hundred times you live through the next four years of the Donald Trump presidency it's very unlikely that it happens but there's a world in which it does right and so that is obviously extremely good the thing that we know is going to happen if Trump gets in charge is that there's going to be an concerted effort to introduce better regulation for assets for tokens to make tokens more like a security right to make them more like a more like an equity where it'll be easier for things like a Unis Swap all these projects actually pass out cash flows to to the Token holders and register under perhaps a less strict uh guideline right relative to running running a company and in the world of Cala alts probably go to zero so the markets as we know we're Traders what a markets hate the most markets hate uncertainty and so taking all of this talk and turning it into a more actionable take is that it's very difficult to hold altcoins for an extended period of time outside of just trading them right I think you can trade a you can trade uni you can trade uh L l1s but I do think in general Bitcoin is the only thing that feels okay to hold in this environment and the reason that I say that is because kind of regardless of the election outcome obviously it's better if Trump gets elected for Bitcoin but it's not bad for Bitcoin if Cala gets elected it's not you know a depth nil like it is like it is for SS so I do think that there's a pretty good trade here to just be long Bitcoin dominance and you over the next three months or sorry two two months I think that probably that probably will pay dividends obviously you know the they'll there'll be one-offs like like like a doing well on the back of Donald Trump's uh son I think Don Jr announcing that he's going to use it to build yeah I mean I couldn't agree more I think I think that you know I one of these it's not like a moment to just sell all of your crypto and forget about the asset class because I think that you know if we do get a trump outcome which is looking increasingly likely on November 5th there's going to be there's going to be some pretty crazy upward price action like I think we could enter some of the some of the most parabolic sort of bull Euphoria type candles that the market has seen since 2021 and you don't want to miss out on that you don't want to dance Between The Raindrops and miss out on all the money when you could have just hung on meanwhile like oh my God this is definitely a good time to start consolidating line items getting out of crappy tokens getting out like you can see the market starting to get a liquid it's starting to get panicky like sure it's not election day but that we've got a long road until the election and I don't think there's going to be any substantial bidding or new entrance between now and then I mean maybe one strategy is options right my my old favorite thing to trade like darab bit's listing xeres on Election night is kind of cool like you can sort of gamble on that maybe maybe what you're supposed to do is like take the October eth three $3,000 calls or like the 2800 calls and just sell them to finance like buying some uh buying some November election day calls or or just sell the sell the eth October expiring calls against your length to sort of collect a little bit of yield if you don't want to trade perss or do any of that stuff um I think I think I think I think that's a reasonable trade I mean I just want to point out one thing that you said which is the the way that the way that Bitcoin has been trading just ridiculously low liquidity The Tick sizes I mean normally what you see is Bitcoin will move a dollar at a time and if you're staring at the charts like I do way too much you're noticing that Bitcoin is now moving five to10 do at a time which tells you that there's very very very little liquidity in this market the way the Bitcoin has been trading is effectively as though one person is dictating price action and you kind of saw that yesterday right where Bitcoin held up in the face of a 3% Equity sell-off during the actual session but then after when Asia came on I think it was basically just a few few major sellers came in and just completely completely nuked the price and it was it was a very very weird selloff where there weren't that many Liquidations in the grand scheme of things and they weren't orderly liquidations it was more of just gaps right you would hit a stop and then Bitcoin would Gap lower to $100 and that's a that's a very bad Market environment for up right yeah that that's normally a market environment where things go down and the other thing that stood out to me is that the last we'll see what happens today but the last five days we've seen outflows from the ETFs and my entire bull thesis for September that I talked about for a while was predicated on the fact that we would see new inflows into the ETF and into crypto specifically because people weren't going to make decisions over the summer and when I saw that outflow on uh that Tuesday or yesterday that made me that made me very very nervous some some of those some of those ETF flows we need to be careful though some of those ETF flows are uh just basis unwinds like people were probably long CME and per basis and just unwinding it as the market came off and those bases collapsed like long ETF short per or short future on the CME so some of those outflows are just like oh the B the is gone let me unwind the trade so it's not like actual risk exiting the market some of it is though that that that that's fine and all but I was expecting to see inflows yeah and we didn't and when you're faced with your expectation and reality doesn't meet it you have to adjust your you have to adjust your thesis so right now I mean bitcoin's at 57 57900 and the way that I'm viewing this is I'm definitely not I'm not positioning very long uh if anything I think you can you can probably short the market with a stop above uh you know well actually I won't tell you where the stop is but I I do I do think that you're you're probably looking at some shortterm down before we get before we get up I mean I'm I'm definitely a buyer 52 53 but right now there's there's no there's no real momentum in the market and I think that the the up move from today was is really just a a one large buyer stepping in the market and I don't really trust it so yeah I mean the Market's trading like gun gun to my head you're probably supposed to be if you're short-term trading looking for places to to sell not looking to places looking for places to buy I I agree I mean I think like you have a point right when things get IL liquid and gappy and the market just starts to trade like some forgotten illiquid commodity on the last day of the future before like expires into physical and it's just it trades like like one of these forgotten markets you're supposed to be super careful um and you know I look at the Bitcoin chart it doesn't feel volatile because we're still you know if you zoom out we're still chopping around in this like super crappy kind of 55 bit at 65 range but like it goes from 59k down to 5 5K back up to 58 and a5k in like 12 hours right Jonah lose Jonah this time I just clicked the back button that's ridiculous okay I thought I thought you disconnect it's like oh no I guess it's Jonah's turn to disconnect no I literally hit the back button I'm sorry everyone I'm sorry Obi yeah you trade from 59k down to 54k back up to 59k and it's just like what what is this like is this like a milk future or is this the world's most important digital currency that's supposed to be hyper liquid and trade like tens of billions of dollars per day it's it's it's not looking good and so you know I'm normally not the kind of person to trade actively and I do I am extremely bullish medium to long term I do think you know this is not a political statement I it's just you know the poker player in me thinks that Trump is going to win and we're going to go directly into like b banana Zone Trading um 2021 style during his administration um so I don't want to sell and then miss that but at the same time like I'm just kind of I'm I'm kind of like getting ready to break my rule get out the old cold wallet send a bunch of coins to you know an exchange and sell a bunch of coin margin Futures uh against them and and just play for this the the Market's just heavy because of this overhang that we know isn't going away right and this isn't one of those markets where it's like oh the price goes too low and then all of a sudden like fundamental demand kicks in which is kind of how crude oil works and then you have this like entirely new exogenous uh group of buyers coming in like buying it to put in their airplanes and cars and whatever else like it doesn't work like that this isn't a commodity this is OB actually you you recommended the George Soros book I recently uh cracked it open and this is this Market is just so reflexive that moves like this especially with a huge headwind like election uncertainty get super reflexive I mean let me just ask you this though is you getting out your cold wallet a bottom signal maybe maybe maybe you're a little bit slow to move maybe everyone else has gotten out their cold wallet already and that's that's why we're going down and now there's kind of nobody left to sell I the the thing the thing that I struggle with is that I mean you can be you can you can definitely be short or you can reduce you can reduce exposure but I I view the max downside here is 50 50k right so is that is that worth risking risking the up move with that in mind I of VI the max upside is is 65 it's I think we're just not going to start trending until we get clarity on the election right so so the the idea here is that you know if you're if you're an active Trader you you know you use what I call the castanza rule which is that anytime anything's crazy like you know I say crazy but quote unquote anytime you get a large up move you sell and anytime you get a large down move you buy and that probably works until that's called a range trade why is that the George castanza trade because because you do you do the opposite of what your instinct is Right which is to to bet to bet on the uh you know like for example if Bitcoin I mean a great example of this was when Bitcoin went went up to 60 65 I think a lot of people piled in thinking that we thinking that we were about to start trending trending up again and then it went straight back down and then more recently we sold off to 558 and you know everybody I want to say everybody but a lot of people including myself thought that we were going to go down a lot more and then when we reverted I I think a lot of shorts got stuck in which I think is one of the reasons for this for this move here from 564 to 58 585 it's just a lot of people short covering and now we're sort of done with that so it's you know whatever whatever your whatever your instincts are like oh man like it's really going to like die and break down here maybe you should start buying or oh man it's really going to break up higher probably probably start selling until we get we get a catalyst in the market we're on the lows of the range um I'm I'd probably be stupid to sell them here like whenever I want to sell I'm not thinking about a price Target I'm just irrationally thinking like oh my God this thing looks so bad and I I'm not I'm very disciplined like I normally don't overtrade if anything I I tend to avoid the pitfalls of over trading which is the worst thing you could possibly do do to yourself in a market like this but even now every time I look at the screen I just get this itch to sell stuff and it's bad so I think you're right I think it's like hey maybe the trade is like send those get out the cold wallet when um when Bitcoin is trading like 65k 66k on a on a trump polym Market Spike and then uh and then buy it back around basically here you know yeah the one thing that'll I don't think we're necessarily in the bottom of the range I think we're kind of in the middle and that's why my personal view is that in this type of Market you kind of you really only want to trade on the extremes that that's when you that's when you want to get in and the other thing is that you don't necessarily want to trade price you want to trade price action so when you see that's that's not congruent with what you just said though like I agree you only want to trade on the extremes a because we're ranging B Because overtrading is literally death in this market so you need to bake in the maximum margin for error that you can but if you're but momentum is like price action is most prevalent in the middle of the range like at the extremes it's reversing and how do you trade that like explain so price action yeah I mean I price price action is most prevalent at the extremes of the range oh I I I sorry what I meant was like momentum when you're moving from the bottom to the top you're going to feel the most momentum in the middle of the range at the top the momentum is going to die and at the bottom the momentum is going to die and it's going to reverse so maybe if you could like clarify for the listeners what you mean by trade price action maybe I've just misinterpreted what you meant so when I say trade price action what I mean is let's say let's say you're short let's say you're short from 60k right you you you sold 60k and you want to close that short at some point the way that you close the short and the way that you think about closing the short in this particular Market environment or I mean really kind of in any Market environment personally unless you have an overall thesis of okay this is going down for a long time what you do is you say to yourself I'm going to close when something extreme in the market happens I'm going to close when there's a big liquidation event and that's what I mean that's what's been happening in this par particular market is when you get a large liquidation event or you get a dislocation in the market that has tended to be the bottom and so then you want to close I mean what what I'm what I'm trying to what I'm trying to articulate here is that if you're short 60 and you say I'm looking for 54k and then you trade 555 but you trade it in a way that is very clearly a dislocation where a lot of people just got stopped out and there are liquidations because this isn't a trending Market you can probably just cover I see what you mean okay so you're basically saying like within the range you identify your little mini pockets of euphoria and despair and trade trade there now I'm with you I understand well speaking of a little mini pocket of Despair the altcoin space looks dire like I every I mean A's performed like there are a couple of other ones we could talk about some of the more um Buzzy projects like grass later in the Pro podcast but like you know like you're you're nine out of 10 are looking like they're getting mulched right now and that that might be the smooth downtrend into election day frankly I think people are are panicking like there's a lot of uh you know nvo crypto Reach people out there who have either founded protocols or invested early or they've got unlocks um and they're basically trying to take some profit before the poly Market 47% outcome that everything just goes straight to zero they're trying to lock in expected value I think a big a big problem is also just the bag holders one thing that's insane to me so if you're if you're listening and you feel bad because you didn't perform that well this this this year I want you to remember that there are a lot of people out there that get paid money to manage crypto quote unquote professionally most funds are down a lot this year and that's insane because bitcoin's up 40% but most funds are down and the reason that most funds are down despite the move from BTC is that on the move from 30k up to 72k those funds held a lot of altcoins and then or they weren't Expo or sorry they weren't exposed to bitcoin maybe they were 50% long because everyone had PTSD from FTX and then once you got up to 72 they realized oh my God we're really really under performing Bitcoin and then they all moved to ult and then Bitcoin went down 20% and ults went down 80 and I think a lot of people are actually still stuck in this uh performance you know they have performance anxiety it's one way of saying it is they're really worried that bitcoin's going to get away from them and that their underperformance is going to look even worse so it's really hard for them to actually get out of the quote unquote High beta uh positions because that's kind of the only way they're going to outperform but I think get slowly starting to happen now because you know it's just like the trade is just clearly not working right yeah it's not and the other thing is it's so hard to be a professional like linear crypto Trader in an institution right now because the expectation is that you outperform Bitcoin right but if Bitcoin goes down you're not getting paid either so your your basically your incentive structure is to just get long levered Bitcoin in the form of picking the right alts and then when you go into an altcoin bare Market which is I would say what we're in right now frankly to call a spade a spade um Bitcoin dominance is on the rise altcoins are not looking good our our boy pav durav is like onh housee arrest like it's you know it's it's not quite 2022 but the alt space is is looking is is looking pretty shaky right when you're in that situation and your job literally incentivizes you to hold Al alt coins and you're down money then you start to approach your draw down and it doesn't matter at this point whether you're trading crude oil or interest rates or crypto once you start to approach your draw down like you have to cut risk to avoid getting fired then it becomes harder to dig yourself out of the hole you can't short alts at this point because they're already on the lows and a lot of the per funding has gone negative at this point so you just have to pay to do that it's like this weird nuclear death spiral and like I experienced it a lot of others uh another problem crypto money managers like when I you know I had 16 years of professional trading experience and like a pretty stellar track record when I first started trading crypto institutionally I traded at PA before that successfully trading it institutionally like a lot of these guys are True Believers and they're just they like to be long they don't know how to be short like it takes a a guy like you Obi who's been through multiple cycles and and seen what happens during these types of moves to have the matur to get short like a lot of the firsttime managers out there are are from what I've heard struggling because of the oh we're in a bull market I have to be long to outform bitcoin type bias and they don't know how to really get short and trade around these things it's it's fraking tough It's a tough tough and the I also do think I also do think a bit of it is just I mean the incentives aren't there I mean the incentives are obviously to be long so it just doesn't really make sense to be short because again if you if you're if you're in crypto and people have invested their money in you to make money on crypto and then crypto doubles and you lose money it's kind it's it's kind of tough that actually happened to to a fund very sad back in uh post postco crash they shorted like 4K 5K 6K 7K and then they blew up it was uh it's pretty pretty pretty sory they were doing really well before that I I won't I won't name name names but yeah I mean look the the opportunities in the market are there they they do they do exist I mean if you're if you're in the trenches and you're sort of a small cap guy and you don't need to trade tens of millions of dollars uh to make money there there are still like probably the way that I think about it is that at least once or twice a month something interesting or new will come out in crypto or there will be a quote unquote obvious trade uh you can't make a lot of money on them but you know if you're trading a million bucks you can you could make some money I mean I don't know if you saw for example Vista that just that just came out um you I don't I don't I don't I don't own any none of the funds I manage own own any we can't you know can't really touch it but um it's at least like moderately interesting it's a pump. fun equivalent on ethereum H yeah I mean that's that does seem kind of obvious now that you mention it but I mean like you really have to cherry-pick those because the broader the broader risk asset and macro picture right now is mostly you know heading south right like there's some some noise about Nvidia we could talk about Commodities near and dear to my heart are getting nuked uh for a variety of reasons the stock market's kind of like on the highs looking a little bit shaky starting to come off so crypto will correlate with with these broader macro assets and trade down in sympathy and crypto money managers who are expected to outperform bitcoin when Bitcoin is trading lock step with broader macro like and they can't touch anything outside of the crypto sphere as a very very tall order to to outperform in that market so I guess we could talk a little bit about what what's going on with the broader macro picture um yeah I mean it's been it's been a it's been a tough market for macrom managers as well right I mean you have NASDAQ nasdaq's off a ton you had the jolt today that I mean what what I've noticed just from my own personal experience anecdotally is that whenever data comes out the first pulse of the market is almost always faded it's so interesting it's like nasda NASDAQ went down uh hit you know I think minus 70 bips and then went went straight back up but I think what's clear to me is that we're in a dangerous environment you know both technically and and fundamentally for for equities and it's not just equities I mean Commodities have been getting hit oil's been oil's been getting hit uh gold you know over the last few days has been getting get been getting hit I mean it's it's sort of it's tough out there what's your take yeah I mean just I the one thing I do actively trade is um Energy Products crude oil gasoline fuel oil diesel propane all that good stuff and what you're seeing in those markets is a Confluence of factors number the number one factor driving the weakness is the fact that the Chinese economy is slowing down and so okay little little Commodities corner for a minute I'm just going to go on my rant here hopefully it's relevant to all you guys who trade crypto because they are both trading sort of down in tandem with each other right now China's weakening and you know over the course of my nearly 20 years trading um you know I've heard pretty much every two to three years there's a China scare a bunch of people get short China and China length things and they get blown out right China's just this massive growth engine they've lifted a billion people out of poverty in the last two decades it grows at 8 to 10% a year like like clockwork it's you do not fade China there was the great financial crisis the 2015 Shanghai comp collapse the the non-performing loans three different real estate crises the covid mismanagement all this stuff everybody gets short China and then they get their faces ripped off what's going on this time why is this different maybe well basically China as far as like the last three decades has been concerned was basically like the world of Deng Xiao Ping's um liberal reforms and kind of like introducing a little shot in the arm of capitalism after all the you know tens of millions of people died during ma right so capitalism kind of proliferated all these people got lifted out of poverty it was great now we have XI Jin pink kind of pivoting back towards communism that happened like two or three years ago when he decided he was going to be dictator for life um you know so basically my not so informed take I'm not like a China macro expert my not so informed take is that basically they've pivoted back to Communism and I don't think we can expect in the current regime uh continued growth at the rates that that we've been seeing for the last few decades so it's not going to be catastrophic there's still going to be an amazing economic engine they're just not going to be an 8 to 15% a year type of economy anymore G growth so basically things are slowing down now one thing I am an expert on is monitoring the outputs of that so like for example um diesel physical diesel coming out of China uh the you can monitor the price of that in commodity markets right and when that price tanks you know there's very few ports that export that particular refined product when China's booming They Don't Really export much of it and the price at those ports is super high because they're consuming most of it domestically when the economy gets weak like that price tanks because there are very few orifices that you can push that product out on the water through and a lot of that product's getting pushed to the rest of the world right now so when you watch those prices those sort of like physical commodity prices at Chinese ports tank you know that they're not consuming Commodities that well so like in commodity markets we can see this slow down right we can see it happening in real time and then uh there's just too much oil floating around the world's not the this summer was a dud in terms of driving season flying season like it was all it was all a bit of an underperforming kind of kind of environment and so now we're going into winter we're going into uncertainty mode with a bunch of Elections and it's just like Commodities look overs supplied across everything and also when you mentioned gold that's not really a a capex or an Opex commodity like oil's an Opex commodity you need it to operate the world capex Commodities are like base metals like steel and coer um you need those to build the world right gold is kind of neither it's a precious metal it's more like Bitcoin but you know central banks buy gold during boom Cycles they don't usually tend to load up when they're struggling to you know keep people from doing civil unrest type [ __ ] so basically it's all like the physical underlying demand indicators in the Commodities Market are all flashing bearish right now um and crypto's probably going to trade and equities are probably going to trade a bit with those markets until we get a new Catalyst I don't see a new Catalyst until November that's the end of my rant I mean that was a that that was a great rant I mean it makes it makes sense and I I do understand the distinction the distinction with gold with gold there I also uh understand here that I think that generally people don't necessarily pay attention at least in crypto to the markets outside of just the US US equities markets I will say that they're what's kind of interesting is that there hasn't been that much correlation between crypto and and this and this and this boom and one thing that we were debating on the desk on the desk today is well if you know things are slowing down if China's not growing growing as fast the US growth start starts to starts to slow down uh unemployment starts to go up and the FED starts cutting doesn't that make nonproductive assets more interesting and you know I think every 's aware that right now the FED is very likely going into going into a cutting cycle and one of the reasons that I think we we sold off a bit in the morning is because after the job after jolt came out um the probability of an additional rate cut went up right and then you had the you had the whole you had the whole Market sort of sort sort of sell off but now it's back it's back to where where it was where it was before right so there's actually been no no major change Bitcoin didn't really do anything uh until until after that rate cut went went back up and then we got we got a nice a nice move higher so I guess one one question is if we get you know a shrinking economy if people you know if we do enter into a session but we do get a lot of a lot of rate cuts that still is somewhat good for Bitcoin is not as a non-productive asset right yeah I mean bad news is good news right now and good news is bad news so like if the economy falls out of bed and the jobs numbers look weak that increases the probability of faster rate cuts and it increases the probability of Mr pump your bags winning the presidency right which is also bullish meanwhile if things start looking spiffy like um you know Israel and that you know the Ayatollah and Benjamin Netanyahu are like shedding tears and crying and like signing peace and trade agreements and Russia and Ukraine have dat taunt and the economy starts booming all of a sudden uh between now and November like uh I think we're going to see more of the the same frankly in in crypto so it's one of those this this happens to you as an oil Trader a lot you're sort of like you find yourself like quietly secretly rooting for chaos and disorder in the world I don't know if Bitcoin is an aric like that what do you think like does is that kind of is that kind of how you think about it too no I mean bit bit Bitcoin I mean interestingly like I was saying earlier there's been some decoupling at least on a day-to-day basis from from General from General risk so you know as chaos increases I think you you're going to see NASDAQ and S&P go down and Bitcoin probably goes down with it but I think it goes down less yeah right and the reason the reason that I think it goes down less is because in times where there's genuine chaos that we've seen we've seen in the past Bitcoin actually does correlate with gold a little bit more and I think gold goes up in those in those scenarios but I do think it requires a flush out a flush out event from BTC first I mean it's not it's not going to be okay you know things start to break the world starts to go nuts and then Bitcoin immediately goes up it's that Bitcoin in those markets tends to bottom first and then starts to and then starts to go up because it it finds buyers a lot more quickly than you know a like apple would in that in that particular scenario like how many people are buying uh buying an iPhone if World War I World War II is breaking out but that is a fantastic fantastic point that you just made that is really smart and we like let's let's dig into it a little bit and prod it like it the same thing happened what you just said happened in 2020 right like everything nuked Bitcoin got absolutely creamed and then and before the world really started to to Rally Bitcoin just began its like Unstoppable upward march to $69,000 token and I think what I think like if I'm trying to just assign meaning to that type of price action Bitcoin is a debasement hedge if things get crazy bitcoin's the first thing to get nuked and then the debasement happens and bitcoin's the first thing to protect you after that right it's not going to like perform on inflation or perform like it may perform in a decoor ated fashion if we get regulatory Clarity and suddenly like blockchain starts racking up a bunch of wins and bringing in a bunch of new users but like absent that uh Bitcoin will protect you even in a comma Administration if they start debasing the dollar because of some crisis right which is almost guaranteed to happen feels like yeah what's what's funny is that I I actually think that the the spending in debasement accelerates under either Administration which is why I'm bullish no matter what on at least on BTC once once we get once we get past the election uh you know it's it's just one of those it's it's one of those things that you just have to survive and that I think is a key component of just of existing in the this Market because it is so volatile is just survive try not to get blown out and pick your spots to be to make to make aggressive bets I mean you know at least for me I mean if Bitcoin if Bitcoin goes goes down if Bitcoin goes down back to to 52 53 I'm definitely I definitely feel very good about buying there and holding through holding through the election yeah I mean it's being flat in crypto is the most dangerous position of them all right if you get stopped out you can't trade or you can't take risk for a little while and you miss a huge rally like 90% of the gains occur from you know very short periods of time so if you miss one of those you might have to wait years to make that kind of dough again if ever and so that's why I'm so freaking terrified of selling perss even though you know Mr nervous Emoji behind me is how I feel and I want to like being flat is just terrifying in this market yeah it it is it is um I mean I I I say that I say that right now as I'm as I'm bleeding short but it's because don't try this at home yeah I'm paying attention to the market 247 you're you're plugged you're basically wired into the Matrix and you'll you know you'll buy it back the second your you hit your stop I think a lot of people aren't myself included just aren't that dialed in so it's riskier to to be flat for the rest of us you're not really flat you're just like you're you're just like monitoring your it's it's something else what you're doing yeah because I'm you know I'm looking I'm looking for spots spots to get back in I mean the one the one thing that I'm probably not going to sell for a while is helium I mean I mean that thing's just been doing so insanely insanely well they are they're I think they're they're talking with the uh Tournament of AT&T soon on a on a on a stage somewhere so that's that's going to be interesting I mean what I am I am locked in and if you can see my eyes I just keep looking at Price H it's it's it's a it's a horrible addiction yeah especially especially on days especially on days like today Jonah I don't know if you miss it but it's like I can't even look away and the thing is you learn on my SC all day yeah like you actually learn a lot from watching price move it tells you a lot about how Bitcoin moves in general and how markets tend to move in general and some like autistic part of me whenever I see the same pattern occur you know I'm like oh I remember that from three months ago this is the exact same thing happened and then you just you know that's why taking notes is so important then you just remember and then you just act it out uh it's honestly there's there's nothing that will there's nothing that will ever replace like the tens of thousands of hours that I've watched staring at this thing kind of fun that's what Peak Performance looks like just got to be dialed in if you're not somebody else take that money I mean I think ultimately for the rest of us who have other jobs like I I certainly felt that little kick in oil today but I watch Bitcoin all day every day because it is such a fascinating Golden Market and I think that you know for the rest of us who aren't dialed into Bitcoin trading it as actively as AI as you are like you can earn money doing other stuff and then just buy dips right and or or not buy when you when you're bearish and then buy when you feel like uh it's bottomed out right you you can play this Market from One Direction because we all have the same you know if you're listening to this podcast you probably have the same long-term thesis as us which is that this thing is going to going to take over vast swad of the global um Fiat economy at some point in the next 10 to 20 years so if you have that North Star you don't have to sell right you can pick when you buy and you can have you can be like well all right I missed this little rally but I'm earning money doing something else so during the next big um you know Firestorm selloff that that's that's when I'll I'll start investing my next clip that's kind of how I've played it for the last couple years um and it worked out really well frankly it's a good time to do yeah I mean I mean I I think it's it's great to have a separate income stream that you can just kind of fun funnel into this because over time you know I think I think that wins and it also it prevents you a lot of trading is obviously emotional and mental unfortunately if you're not trading 100% quantitatively And so having a sense of security and safety while you trade is really important which is why it's either it's either a separate income stream or it's not trading the full amount of your stack and just trying to generate pnl and then pushing it towards the things that you like you like long term but having that you know stability uh is you know it really I I think it really really helps you in this market and speaking of stability Bitcoin is like it has not moved this entire this entire podcast it's listening liter yeah thank you I appreciate it Bitcoin thank you for listening to our podcast it's here is it's here as like there its name is Seawolf and it just typed true Bromance big coin sto trading for a second just to comment on our Bromance speaking of our Bromance um world's greatest transition I think one thing that I enjoy about these dialogues is like you can have two different styles of trading two very different styles and they can both win like even if I'm lifting Bitcoin from you at 55k we could both be right because you're probably just gonna buy it back at 52k and I'm going to hang on and then we'll be high-fiving at 60 and like you'll have made a little bit more money than me but neither of us really Compares or cares like yeah I mean it's kind of like it's kind of like having a friend that has a different taste in women right yeah wingman yeah exactly it's like you know you never have to compete over the same girl it's like oh oh that that's what you like go have fun buddy I I'll wingman you but it's uh you can you can see there's like literally nothing happening in this market right now yeah we have to we just have to watch it so Okay so we've gone through this like this kind of like downward sloping Trend Channel range we've gone through the altcoin nuking we've gone through Commodities are there any green shoots in this market like should we be talking about grass about crypto punks about um per permissionless I don't know like what should we what should we talk through here should we just why don't why don't we why don't we go to the comments literally ask us anything that you could possibly want to hear and we'll just do a live Q&A because the market I've already given you my take on it all right so let's see here Darkness at me writes honestly once you see the government printing it's hard to unsee it everywhere are so on that note I'm just going to interpret a question out of that every time rates get cut I I don't know how many tens or hundreds of billions of dollars need to come out of T bills and go into risk assets are we just underestimating this massive in flow of capital into things like Bitcoin and stocks and other correlated assets it's not quite printing but it's it's monetary easing right are we are we just like sitting here midc curving this as like the world's biggest tsunami of capital lifts our space to new highs or a Rate rates that's not a big deal I there there's a interesting discussion about this where somebody said hey rate rate Cuts tend to tend to lead to the market actually going down because it signals that the FED is nervous about the about the economy and then we looked at you know what happens when the FED actually starts cutting rates and the answer is we have no idea it's like 5050 what the market does because it depends if there's actually a recession coming or not and there's when the FED starts cutting nobody actually knows not even the Fed so you know it's it's it's one of those it's one of those things that I don't necessarily think that you can trade super actively the best way in my personal opinion to trade at these data you know what the FED is doing whatnot is you're trading it on the day or on like the three days right because oftentimes you'll see you'll see Bitcoin or you'll see equities move in a way where it reacts directly to how you know the data data has come out that day but it won't actually influence the direction uh the only thing that really influences the direction is a is a large is a large Paradigm Shift right like if it's so abundantly clear that we're entering into recession and the recession is bad and then obviously you know you can you can sort of sort of reposition I mean the the greatest example of this is uh post postco uh in November November 21 where there was just a paradigm shift um when the FED started to raise rates right that's that's like a change in the market what I always say is you have to understand why you made the money you did so if you buy Bitcoin and it goes up because there's a huge injection of liquidity into the market and then it starts that liquidity starts to be taken away then you have to you have to get out right so it's about knowing what made you your money that's again why this year I think that what made us our money was the Bitcoin ETF like that made you all of your money and the fact of the matter is that the last five days have seen outflows and so how can I be super bullish until something changes because five days of outflows doesn't mean that there will be another five days of outflows but I take your broader point right it goes up and it goes down in and out I guess okay no that's that's really good take my two cents on it is there are two kind I published a tweet about this that that seemed popular with people um there are two kinds of like rate cutting Cycles one is when there's been a crisis like a deflationary shock and so rates get cut very quickly to address that and try to buffer the economy uh then the other type of rate cut cycle is when like inflation sort of tapers off slowly so the rate Cuts come off slowly as a result um like we shouldn't mix up correlation and causation here in the former uh there's a crisis going on so things are looking pretty pretty bad and prices are going down um it has kind of nothing to do with the rate cut cycle the second one like in a gradual rate cut cycle because inflation is coming off that's like a stabilizing stabilizing to stabilize type environment where you can start to get comfortable with owning risk assets um so and also we've never seen this level of investment in short-term interest rate Securities like t- bills in history so there is a lot of capital sloshing around waiting to come back into risk assets uh you know fund managers are bullish the you know broader risk asset stock market type picture so you know I think we're in the lad type of easing cycle and so I think we've got some bold days ahead but but we have to clear the election overhang like you said Obby markets hate uncertainty so that's my take on that next one um I want to ask you this as well if you're invested in helium I think helium is one of the coolest projects out there but I don't understand why what what happened with h&t iot and mobile their token ecosystem seems weird farming doesn't really make you that much coin at this point like why helium just just narrative uh is it actually catching on as a network I'm GNA tell you guys a secret there's like a general General secret about life and markets and and how they move and a lot of it has to do with fundamentals but a lot of it doesn't uh and what do I mean by that I really like helium helium's great uh you know it's the only product in crypto that actually is being used widely it has you know Partnerships are coming for it I mean I I don't know anything non-public but just looking at looking at Twitter looks like Partnerships are coming with AT&T there's a lot to like about it the token and it makes it makes Revenue not to justify the valuation but it makes Revenue now if you look at the rest of the crypto space there's basically nothing except for a that actually is used and and makes and makes money I mean you can say you can say Unis swap but Unis swap is just used to speculate on things I think at some point in the future it'll be used for you know trading real assets so what's what's my point of all of this if I'm telling you that helium can't be you know valued correctly based on based on Tres my point is that there's a lot of capital that needs to allocate to crypto uh there's a lot of capital that needs to be invested and there are a lot of people that need to feel smart and so helium makes people feel smart and you can go to your investors and you can pitch it to them and you can own it and as long as it's going up that's really nice so I like it I like it in the short term I like it for trade do I think that it's going to take over the world honestly potentially it's a great product it's really it's really nice but that doesn't necessarily mean the token price will go up they have to figure out how to actually deliver value back to the Token prices well reg make that regulation could make that possible right and this is this is this happens over and over and over not just in crypto but in the traditional Market there are certain things that people have to be allocated to just structure means a lot in this world and if you can figure out why what people are going to do based on what they have to do then you can make money because the reality is that you're very likely a minnow in the market you don't have to move billions of dollars so if you can figure out how the people that do move billions of dollars have to move their money around then you can actually make you know you you can you can clip you can clip your what I call your fee right on this if you can think through sort of The Logical steps of okay well this is you know I mean another example of this is when something gets added to the to to an index right yeah tends to do better because people need to allocate to indexes and then they weren't buying it before and they buy it they marginally buy it more now because it's in the index you have to buy um that's why you know you you'll see a lot of the technical analysts in or the flow analysts in in the traire world talk about like you know like what do people have to buy at at at the close it's you know you can you can do stuff with that information as long as you're not trading too much so that's know I I think incentives incentives rule the world and that's something to understand not only just about trading crypto but trading the traditional markets and also just life in general is you know show me the incentive in austr the outcome totally speaking of incentives and indices back in the Goldman days um before things were a little more tightly regulated I just remember a salesperson would stand up and purposefully scream at the top of his or her voice hey for you know insert enormous asset manager hey uh so and so needs to buy like a gazillion dollars worth of the Goldman Sachs commodi index gsci dot dot dot in 15 minutes and all you just hear everybody just like clicking away right is that this has got to be pre 2008 um it was a while ago let's just put it that way um so yes I'm pretty sure they're regulations indices indices and incentives are are very uh near and dear to my heart um next question how do you see the Nvidia subpoena impacting ai ai coins in the medium term I'll just answer that one right now it's going to take 10 years well hold on hold on I mean didn't just before you you go on I thought I saw Bloomberg headline that they didn't actually get subpoenad okay so we'll just remove that and pretend that that we we knew that and that I didn't click on it um what about you we keep talking about a on this podcast should we should we just quickly touch on why a is gassing higher and what everybody it's like the only thing in ethereum land that's ripping well it's it's also the only thing that makes that makes real money and it's the only project in crypto that is being talked about by the former president of the United States of America and potentially our future president as well if all goes well so it's you know I I I think I think that it's just it's just getting allocations right now their new front end is so sexy and usable like even even I started dejing on it like I I moved some I borrowed some eth on it the apy is like sub three% I Unis swapped my eth into some wrapped tow just because I wanted to be long tow and I didn't want to deal with centralized exchanges like and it's all super easy to lever up on a like I I like a um Stan's a s's a g that I've met him once twice actually and he's he's like he's a real he's in it for the long haul um I I understand why that token is pumping now though because I I that Trump was specifically calling out a I didn't realize that what we what we don't know about the project yet is how much a will actually benefit from it yeah right I mean it's if if it's a fork then it's probably a pretty good sale of this asset if it's not a fork or it you know pays filty to a that's that's pretty good yeah um the other thing that I'll say that you just have to be you just you just always have to be careful with I really like using data for this personally but you have to check how many people are already in the trade right so when I look when I look at V I can see that there's about 500,000 coins that have been added to open interest uh since $95 and that's a sizable amount that's 67.5 million in terms of in terms of dollar amount and so if it turns out that it's not getting you know paid fees or or it doesn't generate real money from this Trump partnership then a lot of that probably unwinds and you're probably stuck so again it's it and this is this is what I've been trying to explain to people it's really difficult to buy and hold anything other than BTC because there's so much that hinges on you know a specific event or a catalyst or Market structure or whatever ever else it is right the a being at 137 is a function of is a function of trump and a function of a lot of people being in the trade and so it's just really dangerous to hold out unless you're paying attention 247 because in in a flash of an eye you could have a lot of people you could have like 70 million bucks hit the market yeah which is why again it's like you want to own crypto and not worry about these things uh there are really only two things that you can do in my personal opinion opion one is own Bitcoin or two is wait for something nuts to happen like by crypto when Bitcoin is down 50% Yeah by crypto you mean FSE right like when when things are down a ton and right now they're still not down a ton my personal opinion well let's talk about so Amir ofab writes salana in all caps question mark question mark question mark let me let MEK you off top for the brilliant question yeah great question Amir um so I massively overweight Bitcoin because I don't want to worry right now I want to chill out and I feel super comfy and safe and also greedy in Bitcoin like I I still expect that one to perform like crazy no matter what happens between my eth and salana I'm a little nervous about my eth like all this fud all this terrible price action is finally wearing on me what I'm kind of coming around to is the idea that uh salana is worth you know fully diluted valuation it's what like roughly 10% of eth tenth of the the it's worth a tenth as much as eth eth has so much further to fall under another four years of um gentler like characters strangle holding every major project most of which are on eth and then if we get you know banana Zone mode under Trump you know all the new big hot complex important projects are getting built on salana it seems so salana has more upside and eth has more downside like they both have a ton of downside if kamla wins but if eth has more and if Trump wins salana has more upside should I just be rolling most of my eth into salana right now would that be a smart trade to just like manage the segment of my portfolio that's riskier yes yeah obviously I think it's like a prettyy obvious statement I mean I I I view the risk award for salana is just much better than eth in general uh I mean e eth can go down 50% as easily as Sal can go down 50% the only thing that I'll um say is that again it's tough like if you really want to be judicious about it uh there are people that bought a lot of salana at lower prices um and it's locked and they're going to want to lock in lock in profits so I think there's a little bit more reflexivity to salana on the downside as people rush to hedge position does that unlock I I don't know actually off thep I was worried about FTX being the big unlock but that seemed to just get swalled up really quickly yeah I mean it's the people that bought from the from from the estate yeah so the other thing oh what's what's there's somebody asking about base um which I think is interesting I so here are two predictions prediction number one poly Market migrates to base within the next six months prediction number two um the aerody Drome ecosystem is going to grow like crazy I'm really studying that project because I was looking at the biggest tvl and biggest dexes by volume on base Aerodrome out of nowhere is like way bigger than Unis swap way bigger than any of the others I don't understand why that would be I know the founder of Aerodrome personally and so that's why I started studying it and I'm blown away like it's it's pretty rare to see a it's I think it's like the fifth fastest growing protocol of all time in terms of like fastest to a 100 million revenue generated for you know liquidity uh Farmers so basically I'm kind pump. funds number one aerody drums number five it's on Bas people are trading a ton on base Aerodrome I'm like I'm kind I'm not really fully up to speed on this ecosystem yet but since you asked Zack zahariev I'm I'm studying uh ways to farm liquidity on Aerodrome something's going on there yeah I I like so I I like the idea of Base one of the most disappointing things over the last year and a half is the lack of retail that has come in and the lack of you know your everyday person coming in coming into crypto right and a lot of people expected that once Bitcoin broke alltime highs you would get this influx of new people that were interested in it and then Bas would do really well because Bas is obviously associated with coinbase and there they would be able to direct a lot of people to go use the chain now unfortunately that hasn't really happened right what we've seen is that it's the same old people doing the same old thing and then it's new people just buying Bitcoin through the ETFs and so I think base while interesting at the end of the day is really just a bull market right like Bitcoin 100K a lot of new people in in the industry a lot of new people allocating for the long-term kind of play it's you know I think the performance is going to be highly correlated with how many people coinbase on boards so I'm I don't I don't really know how to be bullish on it right now because I don't think that's happening anytime soon that's totally fair and just one other side note John G one of our Twitter friends says salana FTV is a quarter of eth FTV so he caught me out talking out of my ass thank you for that correction John um speaking of Corrections I want to speak on stream about arton art ton bullishness uh on one of the podcasts we were we were pretty pretty bullish about t did not expect pavl DAV to be arrested that was that was a bit of a blow a blow to the thesis uh candidly so we'll see we'll see what happens I still do think that they have it it's t game to lose in terms of onboarding people onto onto their onto their chain but the unfortunate reality is that there are a lot of people that bought ton a lot lower and there are a lot of people that were invested at like a dollar $2 doar that are just starting to unlock right now and this gives them a lot of reason to sell and so at some point I think ton is a amazing screaming you you close your eyes and you just Pile in a substantial portion of your portfolio into this thing uh but that's probably like two bucks like if if if we get the two bucks H interesting well luckily none of this is investment advice so nobody listened to you or did anything when you were bullish ton and it went down so I you know I've said on I've said on multiple podcasts that it's really important to know that if you listen to me you will lose all of your money you'll lose your house you'll lose your girlfriend you'll lose everything what about your dog do you still have a dog I do still have a dog he's not in here right now unfortunately you lost your dog too you just walked right out soon as as soon as you started talking about telegram Belo was just like get me get me the F out of the I'll tell I'll tell you a secret I don't know I mean you have kids I have a dog I don't have kids but I'll I'll tell you a secret about having the dog I also have a wonderful amazing girlfriend and the dog like loves her way more than it loves me because she's she's very sweet and kind and I tell the dog to sit and like try to teach it how to lie down so it's you know doesn't like no don't do that stop chearing the couch she she's so much nicer than I am um so he's not here right now he's with her I wonder what produces more poop your dog or my two-year-old I feel like if we've asked that question it's probably time to wrap the stream Jonah yeah um probably GNA have to edit that one out for the recorded version but anyway that's dude it's great talking to you I always learn so much I think um one of the reasons why I appreciate these podcasts is because these are the these are the trader calls where you chop it up and figure out what you're G to do and I don't know maybe I'm just gonna start buying a bunch of Sal e on the highs because I'm late to the trade but better late than never um you're better late than never 100% agree with that lucky I've got them both uh and yeah yeah maybe time to invest fresh capital in salana just rebalance at any rate um AI it has been excellent talking to you none of this is investment advice um thanks everybody for listening on the live stream looks like we hit 2,719 unique listeners a second ago that is dope I think we peaked out higher like closer to 3K this is amazing love you all thank you for the engagement adios see you guys adios

AI we have 2,000 people watching this live stream and you just blew up that was crazy there's no way we have 2,000 people watching this thing yeah we do we do um I can see that why do so many people pay there's literally no reason wait are we are we live right now are we just Oh I thought I didn't I live we're live like I was okay I I no yeah this this this podcast is great everyone should watch I I'm I'm kind of shocked [Music] and we're live welcome back to another X podcast we're here yeah there are a ton of podcasts with people who don't trade and are never yeah guys look if the Market's trading Market's trading Sor I have to I had to short the entire market so just so everybody knows what's been going on this is our first time live streaming on YouTube this is going to be a report recorded podcast but it's being present presented as a stream where you can join in and chat and we can all talk about crypto together and then we can put um different comments up on screen to just sort of like discuss what people are talking about if there's something kind of relevant to go over but feels like it's been a pretty massive week of news and accumulation of kind of like coiled Springs in the market haven't really broken out yet but lot to talk about don't you think yeah I mean the last the last five days there's just been a lot of f in the market up to up to 65k all the way back down to 615 and now nobody has any idea what's going on Jonah I don't know if you saw but I tweeted out a poll that said hey is Bitcoin G to be up down or sideways in September I voted up I voted up up and down were within margin of error I mean nobody nobody has any idea what's going on which to me is pretty bullish not going to lie I I'm I'm as bullish as ever I mean we're locked in this range we can't seem to break out of it in either direction but I think the next move is up not down I'm I'm really convinced of that so every time it starts to trade back down towards the bottom of the range everybody freaks out hey are we going lower are we going to lose all our money is this the final time when Bitcoin goes to zero and the charade ends and we all have to go back to our day jobs and my take For What Little it's worth is no we're just ranging like we have during every other non 2022 non 2020 Summer um because people are off uh not paying attention they're off on vacation and when people get back in the saddle in September which does tend to be a pretty bearish month for Bitcoin unfortunately but I think I think as we go into the fall we're going to get some serious bids here for a variety of reasons yeah I mean we' we've talked about this for a while that so setember is probably going to be bullish for BTC and I I stand by that I mean if you look when we were trading when we were trading below 60 we were both sitting here I literally had a bull is in my background like guys this Market is is going up I mean just a just to recap at least in my opinion what happened and why we sold off so hard you just had a lot of you had a lot of selling because of technical reasons as the Yen carry trade Unwound NASDAQ came off Bitcoin came off and that caused the sell off down to 50 what wasn't true was that there was overwhelming weakness in the market it was just a technical move and so now that we've sort of rebounded that entire entire move went back up went back up to 65 I think it's possible that we can trade between 61 and 65 maybe 60 and 65 for the next two weeks or so but at some point I think that the allocation that we're expecting comes into the market and then you're probably looking at 70 and you're looking at 70 with no Supply overhang which to me sets up for a very very very bullish Q4 what quick question for you on that why has the supply overhang gone away like are you talking about the US Marshals selling Silk Road coins or yeah it's not that the overall Supply overhang has gone away because I still think that there's going to be some government sales that are going to need to occur it's that you've had a lot of the weekend sell out and you've had the average price that people own a Bitcoin go up a substantial amount and so the people you know just to just to take a step back something that I've I've always used for trading this type of Market is what are what are people's price targets like what do people think that Bitcoin can go to basically the people that bought in the 30s and 40s and when the average price of buying Bitcoin was 30s 40s people's price targets were like 70 to 80 and now that that average price has gone up because a lot of people have taken profit a lot of people have gone out a lot of people panicked out then bought back in price targets are starting to go higher they're starting to go 100 150 and so they're just Le less likely you know every day that goes by people are less likely to sell 70k than they than they were before as long as the average price goes up right the average price how do you track utxos is there like a metric on um one of those glass glass node sites that you look at a lot to yeah you can use you can use onchain metrics to track a glass noes glass noes pretty good for checking when when the last you know the average price of the last Bitcoin moved um but also just more more generally the like yearly weekly moving averages still going up yeah I agree um yeah I I completely wholeheartedly agree with that um one thing we should talk about because I you know I've got a sideways background behind me like my process for dealing with these types of markets is to do nothing like not to not to stop paying attention I'm super dialed in but I'm remaining disciplined and I'm not trying to overtrade um part of it is because I don't want to realize a bunch of gains for tax purposes and then churn around and maybe miss a rally but more importantly like I just think we're range bound I don't think I have the ability to predict when we're going to break out I feel confident in the direction that's going to the direction of travel when we do break out so I'm just trying to remain disciplined and do nothing it's not the most exciting strategy it's not very sexy but it you know frankly it works um there is plenty of money to be made as an active Trader like buying dips and then lightening up on pops you're very good at that Obi but um I'm a little bit less active so I think my strategy works as well in a in a slightly different way yeah isn't it crazy though that you pay taxes to have people arrested for memes yeah well I mean can should we talk about Telegram and the paval durav arrest speaking of uh speaking of whatever the heck that was yeah that was that was honestly insane I mean I you you have a bunch of like Normy relatives reaching out to you like AI why do you use telegram so much are you a criminal yeah basically my my dad my dad texted me my mom hit me up my sister a few a a few of my friends are like what do you see this news it's crazy this telegram you know that the guy the the guy got arrested for crazy stuff I mean what's insane to me is that he decided to go to France I mean come on what are you doing but at the same at the same time it was it's kind of ridiculous to arrest the CEO of a social media platform that has no I mean it's not like he was doing it himself yes the obviously every platform including Facebook has illegal things that Happ on that platform yeah it's crazy that they arrested and it must have been he didn't cooperate with whatever they were investigating whereas the the telling thing is Facebook and all the other platforms must be cooperating uh so it goes to show who's forking over your data and who's not I mean to me it's just funny that he he knew that if he was in France for an extended period of time it's probably going to be an arrest and it wasn't even an extended period of time he's there about half a second yeah he just got like swiped off the the tarmac at at whatever private airport he landed at north of Paris Emanuel Marron the president of France tweeted his take on it just a few minutes ago should I read it with uh it was a few minutes ago I I think it was I think it was a little bit ago oh you're right it was a couple hours let me how's your French accent you speak French right yeah I'm married to a French lady um I'm so sorry yeah so he said um I've seen the false information regarding France following the arrest of pav durov France is deeply committed to the freedom of expression and communication to Innovation and to the spirit of Entrepreneurship isn't it amazing that the president of France can't speak English like everyone's supposed to speak English yeah but entrepreneurship is a French World you entrepreneurship it will REM so it shall so this this like getting arrested for building software thing is is picking up and it's kind of freaky like it's like one step removed from getting arrested for saying something on software which I'm not like an anarchist or anything I don't know whether like being in the crypto Community has turned me into this paranoid schizophrenic or not but like I'm it's kind of unsettling to me I love telegram I use telegram what I told my mom today is that I use telegram because it's the best user experience you can use the same telegram account on multiple phones with different phone numbers which other platforms won't let you do like I'm message and it's like it's fun and half my community is on here like what what the heck is wrong with telegram the craziest part about it is that it's not even safe right it's it doesn't have encryption by default so if the feds wanted to it's not it's not as hard to crack as it is WhatsApp I mean look the issue at the end of the day for us and for crypto and generally is that telegram is associated with scammers right te telegram is associated with bad people with with bad things and then it taints the reputation of crypto obviously because crypto and telegram are are intertwined in a big way and going back to what you were saying earlier if you can get arrested for posting a meme on X then at what point can you get arrested for just using telegram right if there's a government out there that Brands telegram as this Haven of criminals oh if you use this platform then we're going to call you a criminal if you tweak this thing then you are a criminal I mean that to me underpins the need for a decentralized social network that yes you know if if the centralized version of it gets shut down then at least all of the data and the way that you interact with people can be ported over to a new front end and that that's really that's really the beauty of all the decentralized platforms right is whatever front end you have whether you use a telegram app or or or another app if the back end is all on crypto and it's decentralized then at least if telegram gets shut down then you still have your data right that's actually something that I worry about on Twitter is if my Twitter gets shut down how do you rebuild the idea of having the same followers having the same DMS having the same contacts just boom just goes away and so this again is the future in my personal opinion of the telegram blockchain which is why I'm personally still very bullish on telegram I'm not I think this is super bearish telegram's coin because their Visionary founder is now distracted but I think it's bullish longterm the idea that decentralized social should be a thing where like you have skins for the decentralized chat apps that look as beautiful and work as beautifully as telegram does you have end to-end encryption that's like uses the same open source RSA whatever it is live library that signal uses all of the data is stored on your device not in the cloud um all your unencrypted data is stored on your device and the back end for that is on Jan like now I kind of I see the rationale for it because this is ridiculous right like I it's a chat app of course people do nefarious things on chat apps they probably do them on WhatsApp and iMessage uh as well I I don't frankly understand what it is about telegram that's so special um so on that note everybody join our telegram Channel Obi started one um hop in there we talk markets it's fun you can find it in Twitter somewhere I I even post pictures of my dog it's a very very cute dog no I just want to go back to that point real quick I think that this there are 30 I think there are 30 people that work at telegram the actual telegram app but the telegram Foundation is separate the the ton blockchain is separate from the telegram app they have a relationship obviously and they were started and it was ideated by similar people but then it split off I think what this does is it lights a fire under the ass of the ton foundation and the people building on ton to produce something really incredible that's a really nuanced that's an amazing take so you're saying this is like one of those misunderstood dips to buy like I have the mid curve take like oh it sucks Pav's gone sell it you're saying no no no no no no like while all the Jonas are selling by I see what you're saying you know not not the Jonas because the Jonas the Jonas wouldn't buy back but you Jonah you you would buy back let me pull my little trading view here hold on a second what's this what's our little smgr coin doing right now look I I'm I'm of the mindset that him getting arrested is act it's a it's a Barb it's a what is it Barbara strien effect where now everyone realizes the value in the fact that telegram had built out a blockchain it's like they were they knew that something like would happen oh wow the price action's really interesting in this so obviously the news gets announced it was trading seven it immediately gets nuked down to five dollar a token and then today you've got like AI Felman just or somebody like you just sneakily bidding it on this thesis and it's kind of rebounded that that's really interesting it it does feel like it's bottomed out um I mean my take okay look again none of this is final advice it never will be in fact if you listen to the words that come out of my mouth you will lose money and you will go bankrupt and you'll probably end up on the streets yes let's just get that same goes for me if you listen to anything that I say ever with that being said I think that it's important to remember that there are a lot of people that hold Telegram in a pretty deeply concentrated way and what we don't know is how they're going to react to this I think in the long term this is very good for telegram and it again lights a fire under the ass to go build a good product but at the same time if it goes up back up to $66.50 I think that that's probably a sale because I think a lot of people are going to be you know selling out selling out of their positions slowly because they're very concentrated candidly now what that that probably gives you an opportunity and in the long run in a year from now that's going to lead to in my opinion a much better distribution so I think if any if anything in a year from now telegram is going to be High than it is than it is today but you know you have to be ready for the Vault of this thing yeah and you also have to Benchmark yourself against Bitcoin eth salana and the other things that could also be substantially higher a year from now you don't want to like be up 10% on telegram patting yourself on the back and have missed a 100% rally in ether salana so you know honestly what's interesting I listened to um I listened to Pav's interview with Tucker Carlson I'm not a usual listener to the Tucker Carlson show but I did want to hear pavle talk for an hour about his product and this was like the most recent podcast about it so I checked it out um Tucker being annoying aside uh what I took away from that podcast is that this is Pav's second rug pull right like Vladimir Putin pulled the rug out from underneath this guy uh with v contact the Facebook of Russia he basically told him like become an oligarch and publish whatever I tell you to or sell your steak and get the out and he he chose option b and so this is the second time he's having like his baby taken away from him I wouldn't to your point AI I wouldn't be surprised if he's just like all right I literally can't trust anybody or in this world anymore I'm gonna put it all on chain and make it this like permanent like Chat thing that exists in perpetuity and can't be shut down because it's decentralized like I and if anybody's good at building chat apps it's this guy this is literally five years ahead of iMessage Facebook Messenger or Whatsapp it's crazy how good this app is so I could totally see him doing that and that that would probably be bullish the telegram crypto ecosystem yeah and and it and it should be obviously I mean what one one of the things that I think is really important to remember is why we're here in the first place right we're here to build censorship resistant applications so that no matter what the governments try to do to you no matter how they try to mess with you you can escape that that's the key that's why we love Bitcoin that's why we love decentralization that's it's why we're here right at least in at least in the beginning I mean now now now now we're here to trade five minute charts and make money but at least in the beginning in the beginning it was very pure the intentions were pure speaking speaking of uh speaking of trading trading five minute charts one of the worst five minute charts I've seen in a while is the eth chart do you remember when told you that eth was going to be the xrp of the cycle I'm going to pretend I don't remember because I'm long a lot eth and I I said I said it like two months ago I think eth BTC was trading 0.55 at the time I was like eth is going to be the xrp of this cycle I got so much hate for that and the reality is I think that's actually what's happening right now I think that's a that that's a that's wrong that's wrong a lot of interesting applications are quietly getting built on eth um like what even even even vitalic says hey man youi sucks bu well I mean po if you if if something gets built on an L2 that rolls up to eth is that does that count or you're just saying no like nothing that's going on on bass poly Market that's all garbage let's just ignore it and pretend it's not happening is that kind of what you're saying one thing you named one you named one real thing poly Market great poly Market's great it's on polygon it's probably going to move at some point in the the future and it can be built anywhere yeah some memes happened on bass too by the way like there was a there was a thriving moment there but memes brother memes there hasn't I put it this way not not many applications have been built anywhere this cycle the two are like poly market and memes right wait do you smell that do you smell the with this you smell the cope cuz I can I can smell the cope okay we are we are we are deranged for I mean I I think I just saw someone I'm also holding eth we are deranged yeah I mean look the issue with eth is that again it's slow it's it's more difficult to use than salana even the founder vitalica is like hey what's going on you guys are only trying to build out like weird defi stuff like we should build some real things should we read that like okay so just for context for anyone who isn't paying attention vitalic tweeted something that pissed off or got under the skin of a lot of people he basically came out attacking defi on eth he said that it's uh he called it an Uris or an orus it's the it's a snake that eats its tail in my in my California accent I'd call it uros bro like Surfer Style anyway um basically what it's it's he's saying that it's just just like like purposeless um let's call it uh money Chas for the sake of money uh like it's it's some sort of reflexive cyclical um money washing machine uh to to paraphrase and that there needs to be something a little bit more purposeful built on eth other than just like lending money to people who want to uh trade with it in order for the ecosystem to grow and flourish and reason why I disagree with that is because having worked in traditional Finance for the better part of two decades um my humble you know respectful question would be vitalic what do you think goes on in in the normal world of trafi traditional Finance it's exactly the same thing it's just a it's a pipeline of money that's sort of circular and people derive value from it and the to me the the sort of like most important basic primitive of defi is yield and basically most of the world can't get a JP Morgan Chase uh high yield savings account so if you live in an one of the the world's 150 emerging economies with a relatively uninvestable currency and you decide to store your money on chain in stable coins and you want to earn a percentage yield on it you want to earn your 5% in line with t bills you can do that on chain and you would be foolish not to in many cases so like I don't understand why that's not valuable it is valuable but it's not an argument for eth because you can do the same thing on salana more easily in my personal opinion yeah but that wasn't his point he wasn't saying I I just hope this goes to salana because I want more pure things on eth he was just calling the entire activity worthless which I think is what pissed people off myself included uh yeah I think so the the the issue the issue with vitalic statement now that I I I I more understand what you're saying now yeah he wrote it off but I think he wrote it off for very good reason and the reason that he wrote it off is because he's still I mean I think vitalic is candidly still stuck in the 2021 2020 era of defi where you had this explosion of a bunch of different Ponzi schemes the yield generating games doesn't really happen today in the in the same way I mean people still try to do it I see a lot of projects try to raise for it I see a lot of projects try to lean into that but the reality is that they're just not getting much money because I think people have figured out that that's not that's not the game right and so it's just actually if would vitalic said was true I would like eth more because at least there'd be a ton of activity right there'd be a ton of people chasing yield there'd be a ton of people using these Ponzi esque uh programs and activity on eth would be up and gas would be up but the reality is that nobody wants that anymore because they realize that it's all that's all shortlived I mean the one thing that people people say say yield which is funny to me because it's not like crypto develops new yield out of nowhere it just opens up access to a market that already exists right it's not like people in 2020 exactly what it's supposed to do it's democratizing it's permissionless it's yet another reason aside from censorship uh resistance that we like crypto right it's the whole point is to democratize financial services in ways that the centralized entities don't like that's not a yeah like it's not it's not the snake eating its own tail to have borrowers and lenders doing their thing on eth instead of through trafi through like the the t- bill ETF you know it's to me it's like it's very fundamental and kind of democratic yeah I think that's look the way that I view this is that eth is not going to generate any meaningful activity from the valuable thing that you have just described that's the issue and so one one part is I agree that what you just described is extremely valuable yeah and will be used in a substantial way I disagree that it's going to take place on eth and the reason that I disagree it's going to take place on eth is that coming from somebody that has interacted with institutions a lot there's no actual reason that an institution would go with e over salana because salana also has a lot of institutional backers you see you see what I'm saying no I disagree with that I disagree with that look people make people because it's about the application it's not about the settlement layer and so for example if you want to launch a tokenization project if you want to launch let's say Donald Trump decides to do his real estate tokenization it's very possible that he builds that on SL it's equally possible that he builds on salana as he does on that that he that he does on eth I guarantee you if we're in a world where real estate is getting put on chain a substantial amount of assets are getting put on eth like I don't think it's a I don't think it's like a random coincidence that black rock launched their tokenization fund on ethereum and not salana like they will probably both of those chains will probably get a lot of action I don't think it's going to be one or the other like salana is faster it's more performant frankly it breaks more right eth is older it hasn't broken uh but it's slower right so each one has its benefits and its drawbacks I think if you're looking for something that's if you're like at a slower institution you're you know trying not to get fired and you're looking to build on something with the longest history and the most stability like you could choose eth and not get fired for that decision meanwhile if you're trying to build some like new application that requires a lot more um entries in The Ledger uh you probably would be safe putting that on salana especially as the blockchain mature so I I don't think it's like either or I think they can both coexist yeah I I think the issue the issue for me is that I disagree that for one reason and it's that there's really not that much differentiation in terms of risk if you're going into crypto you're that that that's the risk in my per that's that's 95% of the discussion in the first place it's the the the fact that you're going into crypto then there's 5% of discussion around okay like how do we get into crypto but I don't like these people differentiate a little bit I think between eth and but not as much as you think at least from my discussions okay I mean I trust you the issue the issue is hey do we do anything with crypto and and so you're saying once they cross that Chasm they're just headed straight to salana they're not even going to bother with eth or if they head to eth they're going to go to like partner with coinbase or something and it's going to go on base and the fees won't accumulate to the main net the other the other thing is that a lot of a lot of this will have to do with BD and right now Salon is more centralized than eth in terms of BD and nobody does BD for eth vitalic I guess L2 do BD but the reality of the situation I say that a lot the fact of the matter is the fact of the matter is what you have to understand about this e has no business development number one number two uh where am I is that anyway long story short the problem is that eth doesn't have BD l2s have BD eth doesn't and that Tech doesn't always went out let's try some let's try something different instead of arguing about the philosophical part of it you think eth BGC is up or down in a month probably down yeah and why do you think it's down because the trend is your friend and that's just the way that the flows are going right now but between now and next year e e you know eth could be up a lot versus salana Solana's like near near cycle highs um and eth just isn't I think that so e chart's going one way and that one way is up and to the right huh it certainly isn't going to the left but I know I know it's going up and to the right and eth unfortunately to me unless it gets a it it could get a sailor so if anyone's listening if eth got a sailor that would be great that would be a great thing because we could all just go along eth BTC and make a ton of money eth needs Larry thinkink to just come out and be like I'm replacing my back office with this and I'm going to go on CNBC once a week to re explain why right that would be that would be that moment so then with that with that in mind I wonder if you just stay short eth BTC until you get get a piece of news because what B what we're what we're saying here if you really step back is that there is no narrative there is no reason for eth to go up it needs a catalyst and the Catalyst will probably be telegraphed in the sense that it will be an announcement or it will be it probably won't be anything other than an announcement that sends this thing back up and so on any bounces state short and use that as a hedge for your book yeah that's probably the way to play it I mean when you do that in trafi markets when you like collect some carry trade like oh this whole borrowing Yen swapping into dollars and lending lending dollars thing it's just up and to the right and then one day you're down like three years worth of money I don't think it'll be that kind of a violent move in eth BTC or in Sal eth I think it's you'll probably have your chance to flip before you get ruined if you're paying close attention to the charts I I agree you OB yeah maybe maybe Larry think will come in and save you I mean that's that's always my my thesis is is I hope for richer men to save me what a great thesis I mean until there until the SEC like on a serious note until the secc allows Capital to flow into our space in new ways like um you know allowing tokens to pass through dividends or allowing tokens to give you equity in projects Tok basically tokenized Equity with a super clear U uh regulatory framework until that happens the only source of capital inflows is richer people buying your bags or armies of smaller people buying your bags yeah I prefer the armies of smaller people because it's a lot easier to sell sell to them personally yeah I noticed when I was getting out of Bowen that big pumps can occur on small volume and little little amounts of volume uh when you try to like push it through the exit send the price down quite a lot I I did notice that yeah I mean you have to you have to be really careful tra trading those things I mean there's there's a specific there's a specific way to do it actually why I would just ran into this because I'm accumulating a small cap which I can't talk about but because don't want to get in trouble but I think that the best way to accumulate these things are to put in small basically putting these small Market orders that just Spike the price and that always attracts sellers and then people will come and sell into that and then you can just do it again because what people look for to sell is they look for you know they they they look for weird price action so for example if you have a one candle that's 10% in a small cap people will often take profits into that versus if you teop into the token over time and it goes up like 1% an hour then people are actually a lot more likely to buy it and so it's actually counterintuitive but I think it's I think it's better to Market by than to T up in t i I don't think that's kosher in Trad fi like I hear my compliance officer from Goldman Sachs like over my left shoulder like I wouldn't do that if I were you Jonah that's basically um called painting the tape no I don't think so because we're not like I'm I'm not like you know if I if I have a t- and I said it's you have a r for the trade right do like do like one do like one market order an hour why is that why is that bad to do one guess you're genuinely trying to buy it's there's I'm trying to buy the whole thing it's just like instead of SP you're allow you're allowed to pick how to execute I'm allowed to CH do one large order every hour instead of one order every five seconds yeah it's true it's you're absolutely right to do so um I didn't I guess that if you're trying to just get more liquidity by executing a different type of order it seems totally legit obviously none of this is compliance advice or trading ad device again we we clearly don't know what we're talking about but it is it is kind of an interesting concept like how do you get the most liquidity how do you attract people's attention how do you sell it are a lot of these tokens how's the OTC market Obi since I left it uh you know a year and a half ago how has it evolved is it super deep and liquid for random low low market cap coins or have things gotten worse since then I have absolutely no idea to be completely honest with you because I don't trade OTC anymore um I just go you know we just trade Direct Direct on Exchange having run an OTC desk I would not I would not trade OTC like it's I don't understand why people do it frankly I mean look there're if you're going to be trading in this asset class the especially if you're short-term trading so it doesn't really matter if you're gunning for 2 X's because your execution costs are you know if your if your execution costs are 3% 5% each way and you're gunning for a 2X 3x 4X who cares but the issue is that a lot of people are gunning for 20% and then they don't take into account execution costs and they don't take into account smart accumulation or smart selling and then what they end up doing is if you're gunning for 20% and you're 3% in one way and 3% out the other You're really hurting your risk reward so you have to be very careful which is why whenever I trade this asset class especially on choppy days like today the goal is always to it's a castanza rule when things are down that's when you buy and when things are up that's when that's when you sell and I definitely think that anyone that's click trading if you're if you're click trading more than like if you're doing more than a million dollars in volume which is actually pretty easy I know a lot of people like $100,000 $50,000 $10,000 that somehow hit a million dollars in volume um if you're if you're do if you're doing that much volume a month or even you know every six months it's worthwhile invest you know paying $55,000 for a good execution tool whether that's in you know whether that's in silico I I don't use them or coin routes or something else ly ly ly ly here says limit buy not Market buy and I kind of agree with Lily like like I think that unless you're in a hurry and you're foming into something doesn't hurt to just stick a bit in there and wait for it to to get filled the information is too transparent in crypto if you have a limit buy and you put in a limit buy and it's visible whether that's an on Trin limit buy or exchange limit buy I think that that's just I I don't like limit buys what I like to do is I like to uh sweep at a certain level which is why I think execution tools are great because what you don't want to do is you never want to broadcast that information out there no that's fair that's fair especially in really thin markets where some of these low FTV coins or sorry low market cap coins low float um it's really like if you're getting in there trying to buy for a prop trade it's often just you right without you the only thing you're seeing on screen is like Market maker on Market maker violence and if you're getting in the middle of that like those market makers are going to notice you immediately and kind of get make the price uh do things that are not what you want it to do this is why you have to be careful and especially I mean so this week in Trad fi has been the lowest I mean b basically the lowest liquidity week in all all year which is days of summer which is to be expected I think Bitcoin is trading like an IL liquid shitcoin right now which is one reason why you probably just need to walk away you know like establish your positions and walk away there there are a lot of good catalysts coming up that I personally I personally really like I mean you have some conferences like soul soul breakpoint coming up uh you have stacks releasing their Nakamoto upgrade you have Aptos running on the Korean blockchain week remember Aptos and the Koreans one AP equals one apartment that mean there there there I with all due respect to the the cool guy with the long hair like why why what's the point somebody explained to me why Aptos like what problem most the most the point of these things is to trade them and make money and then watch them go to zero after three years or not like cardano and and polka dot but yeah fair enough yeah actually what is the market cap of cardono though I haven't I haven't thought about that Corin in a while let's see yeah enlighten me that's crazy it's still it's still top 15 13 billion 13 billion doll that's good 300 million traded a day see that's the thing the point of these assets is to trade them there's there's a few select group of assets that are actually going to do things in the future and be useful but the majority of these things are just for trading AI we have 2,000 people watching this live stream there's no way we have 2,000 people watching this thing yeah we do we do um I can see why do so many people pay there's literally no reason I I you know what I think it is I think you and I have both worked in pretty professional trading floor environments where we have a conversation like you here in these trading floor environments and I find it refreshing to hear other Traders talk on a trading floor I don't think there is any of that for crypto wait are we are we live right now are we just Oh I thought I didn't I live we're live like okay no no yeah this this this podcast is great everyone should watch I I'm I'm kind of shocked that that um yeah it's authentic that's for sure we clearly don't know what we're talking about but yeah I think it's interesting that that there's no real place to hear trading floor talk in crypto it just doesn't exist because there's no crypto trading floor it's just a bunch of people hold up in their their basements around the world or um super fancy offices uh clicking and trading and it's kind of a solo um game and you don't want to be in your own head too much so it's important to it's important to talk that's a that's something we should all do a little more of is get out there with the community and try and chat another Shameless plug for our telegram chat room Jonah do you own any Soul uh altcoins right now the answer is no I'm flat memes completely flat memes let's take some more question why why why be flat memes here's why I would be flat memes the reason to be flat memes right now is because there's no Catalyst there's literally no reason to be long a meme coin as the space consolidates and you have more and more Supply getting printed on pump. fun every single day um I think that's going to distract from whiff and Bowden and all of the other exciting well bowden's dead whiff and MOG and all of the other ones that are still alive that's why I think that there's no real meme trade right now I think that memes are going to be the last thing to Rally after a big Bitcoin pump uh or a big salono pump but I think it's too soon for that I think you're safer in the majors I think we need to just weather this this uh next sort of fall period of chop let's see what other interesting um what other interesting comments are in here so this guy Robin debates says bruh you have 300 viewers don't be pretentious uh bruh we have 2,000 viewers right now 300 of them are on YouTube and 1,700 are on X so you can see this stream in multiple locations um that's that's why it's like that it's over for helium if ai's truly on helium in Puerto Rico right now which I think there's like a 60% chance of then yes it's this is definitively the the beginning of the end for helium this okay don't don't even don't even start welcome back I've been I've been monologuing here with the the chat room what the are you monologuing about I was we were monologuing about how Puerto Rico is uh not necessarily up to Snuff in terms of Wi-Fi infrastructure uh how you were shilling helium while your your helium Wi-Fi broke down I've got a I've got a few rebuttal to the peanut gallery one I'm on Verizon if I was on helium this wouldn't have happened just saying uh two I don't live in Puerto Rico what is my daily trading routine now this is this is this this is a good question this this is a very good question so the most important thing in trading to me personally is the ability to reflect on my day right because I need to know when you're trading you make a ton of decisions every single day and if you don't have a process or system to understand what decisions you're good at making and what decisions you're bad at making you never get anywhere you just end up you just end up making the same mistakes over and over and over and over so I always write down literally every decision that I made that day and why I made it and then review them at least once a week so that when I go back I can say to myself okay I'm good at this I'm good at that I'm bad at this I'm bad at that right so this this is very important and by the way I just found out that Bloomberg has a Notes app which is great so I just take all my notes finish the thought tell us about your daily trading routine come on stay focused so uh the other the other thing that I think is really important is a trading journal with your trades right so the p&l of your trades and then making sure that you can actually tag them and say okay well this is a long short trade this is you know real Valley long e long de BTC or I call it a blot that's what us old guys used to call it yeah like like a trade blot with reasonable tags so that you can go back and say hey I'm really good at trading events or I'm really good at trading product launches or I'm really good at trading unlocks and flows or I'm really bad at that right and the other uh the other thing that's important is making sure that you end up with a system in place so once you figure out what you're good at you stay away from doing the things that you know that you're bad at and I know that that sounds really simple and really straightforward but you cannot imagine the amount of people that I've seen that know that they're bad at something and can't help themselves because they think that they can do it they're like ah like I can I I you know I I know I've messed up in the in the past for the last year doing this thing but this time this time be different trading does put you into that weird mind warp where sometimes you think that like you think that you're making money on something where you're actually losing money on it like there's there's so much weird psychology I saw this a lot when I was in um cide trading like you'd have people out on a trading floor making markets uh or in the case of physical Commodities like buying and selling assets or assets filled with commodities and they thought that they were doing great prop trading um like but they weren't right they were actually losing a little bit of money prop trading and making a lot of money on the business that they were operating and there's this weird like mindmeld psychology thing where almost down to the last person all of those people thought that they were fantastic prop Traders and then a lot of them went on to go try to trade prop at hedge funds and failed if you're if you're just trading your own book um you don't you know or if you're trading at a hedge fund like you don't really have as much ability to get caught in that bias because you're there's no asset to hide behind there's no Market making there's no business that you can basically misattribute p&l from to your own genius however there is one thing that you can do when you're sitting by yourself um in a room trading that really messes with a lot of people's minds that I've seen and this goes straight to your point Obby I've seen a lot of people trade like crazy churn in and out of stuff make a little bit of money on in the middle of Cycles where Bitcoin like the price of Bitcoin will double they'll make like 10% and they'll think they're doing a great job right and then after tax they're left with like even less than what they thought they made and they're like forced selling things to pay their tax bill and so basically the importance of a process is to know not just how much money you're making but whether you're outperforming uh just huddling Bitcoin and doing absolutely nothing that's really important uh to to monitor in terms of process otherwise you may actually be losing money versus what you would have earned if you just stuck your money in Bitcoin and and walked away and and spent your precious time earning more money in another way to invest in Bitcoin does that make sense yeah I mean I I I 100% agree with that there there's a lot of interesting comments in this chat that we could talk about is there anything in particular you want to discuss right now ai this is I mean both of us are a little off off balance because this is the first time we've done this form but it's freaking awesome yeah I mean this is this is great why don't we do one why don't we do one again this we can even do one on Thursday yeah I'm down we'll maybe we'll invite another guest but I got a I got a I gotta hop unfortunately okay well it was a good time talking to you AI thanks for uh thanks for making time as always I loved it no this is great and keep the keep the comments coming we love all of you we love we love you guys uh none of this is financial ADI advice apologies in advance to our producers who are gonna have to hack this together into something that seems halfway professional for the recorded episode anyway we we'll work on it I'm gonna I'm gonna find better wi-fi for next time use that helium sign up for helium and tell us how it goes yeah bring on high yeah definitely high stakes Capital yeah that that that's a great idea definitely bring on high stakes capital for sure no here okay yeah we'll try to get a guest for the next one all righty Obi see you later [Music]

Transcript Text:
the amount of effort that I had to put in to figuring out these [ __ ] settings Jesus Christ we're technical people Obby we try to move money around internet protocols this is low stakes I know but like it's honestly it's easier to use crypto that it is to use twitch to live stream and this is the biggest bull case ever for crypto I agree who's who's building who's building live streaming on [ __ ] cuz this is a [ __ ] [Music] disaster there is no Buller bear although although I did get a dog and his name is Baloo I think it's pronounced B Baloo from The Jungle Book Ballo and he's got the Jungle Book wallpaper behind him too hold on come here he wants to say hi to everyone hello blue hello blue Mr junglebook yeah it's b a l o o blo I just got him he's three months old by the way if this were six months ago blue would be a meme coin already like should we should we kick off with whatever is going on with pump. fun what do you mean whatever is going on with pump. fun I've seen a lot lot of stuff on crypto Twitter about how pump. fun the founders uh are earning a lot of money and something about how nobody who uses it makes any money um I'm not sure I agree with that but uh it seems to be a little bit of a scandal which I think is inappropriate because obviously if you create a meme coin it's that like you're you're not creating a business there's no pretense around that so have you seen some of the uh some of the hatred and Loathing around meme coins and pump do fun recently out there the reality is that all of these things they're just they're just for the Insiders I mean using pumped out fund very few people actually make any money it's only the coin creators that make money yeah and the the PE the people that buy are these people that are just trying to pump lottery tickets I mean you know marad kind of has gone off the deep end a bit in terms of tweeting about meme coins but he is a good Trader but he has what's up buddy he has some really good points is that it's honestly it's safer to buy a meme coin that already has an established crazy Community than to try to gamble on something that's sub one mil market cap because it's really really really difficult for any of these things to meaningfully break through and I mean a lot of people have strategies to actually trade these things right so there are a lot of people that during the last Market what they did is they would write these programs to automatically scan every new contract that's been put out and see if the contract is a rug risk see if it's going to be you know potentially bunch of new coins are going to be created and they would score them they would assign a score to each new contract that would come out and then what they would do is they would make bets s and if you don't do it in automated fashion I think you're you're basically in for oh losing uh losing battle Yeah I mean basically what my experience with meme coins was was I never understood Doge when I was a professional crypto Trader I didn't touch it because I didn't think that I could justify to my backers losing money on a dogcoin right so didn't really participate in these sort of early memes pep came out during this like nuclear bare Market where it was very hard to trade memes and again if you're you know investing 1020 Million worth of somebody's somebody's like Prop Shop Trad five money and a Frog coin and you lose half of it overnight like it's pretty hard to justify those losses and keep your job so I missed Pepe and then during this meme coin frenzy I was more sort of like um solo personal Trader I just opened Twitter one morning s boen started laughing my ass off and made a bunch of money on it and got out you know 50x higher than where I got in but like I don't think that's most people's experience with meme coins I think most people's experience with meme coins is like getting shilled a bunch of garbage trying to chase the next big winner losing not having caught whiff or Bowden or Pepe or Doge at the early days or shib and I think if you don't catch one of these early it's just this sort of like random noise thing like it's very hard to trade a coin once it's already a mega cap you have to catch it early or you kind of have to stay away what do you think I mean once once it gets to Mega cat world like a Pepe or a whiff the way that I think about trading these is that I buy them as leverage during periods where I think Bitcoin Cann outperform and one thing that I I think the most instructive thing that you can do with a whiff or a Pepe or any of these coins is look at the 4H hour chart going back or even the one hour chart going back three or four days and if it started to bottom out on the BTC pair and year bullish on bitcoin too you can actually short BTC buy these coins and that's generally you know I I I think that makes more sense if you're trying to trade these things they instead of becoming an instrument of okay maybe it'll 10x 100x whatever they become a very good lever beta play on BTC and that's how I treat them once they get above a billion is it's just okay like you buy you buy like when Bitcoin traded 50k at 52k and we were buying it's like okay maybe buy some popcat maybe buy some things that seem like they've boted out against BTC as a lever beta play but I would never really hold these things for a 3X at this point it's just not the market environment for it the only time that you're going to see these crazy moves from memes that are over a billion is if coin is at 90k okay that's an interesting there's there's just not enough there's just not enough money to actually push them up there so the idea of holding a meme above a billion right now in this particular Market environment if you're a Trader just doesn't really make sense that mean you should be trading them and using them in the way that they're meant to be used which is trade uh there actually a lot of really good I mean there are a lot of really good pair trades in the market right now personally I mean wait but so so hold on hold on before we get there let me just try to understand this correctly let's say that I'm fairly convicted that the crypto Market is going to take off to the upside in the next week two weeks three weeks and it's going to go to 100K bitcoin's going to go to 100K you're saying instead of buying Bitcoin for a trade I should buy popcat I should buy whiff I should buy something that's like an established meme I should buy Pepe or Doge because it's going to go up way way more than like 60% it's going to go up 5x or 3x or or 2x is that is that kind of the argument it's like when you're when you're bullish for a trade you're and you're really convicted this is like this is like kind of cheap leverage with limited downside it's like call optionality uh look I'm never going to tell you that there's limited downside sorry I'm never going to tell you that there's limited downside to buying a mooncoin but at the same time it makes sense to use them to trade when you're bullish right so what say is that there there's there's a lot of asymmetry there where something like a whiff or a popcat or whatever on the initial move out of a bottom if you're trying if you're trying to bottom pick they basically can go 40 50% and as was just pointed out they're you can't get liquidated on the if you don't actually use leverage right so if you have 100 bucks you buy it you're getting asymmetric leverage on BTC which is why people buy them and that's why I think you you know if if you if you haven't been doing that you should at least a look at it yeah it's like a call option yeah but it's yeah exactly it's exactly it's it's like a call option but what I'd say it's like a three-day call option it's that doesn't I mean doesn't have any Theta to it either right so it's just a better waya and the liquidity is amazing it's not like you're you have to like call up qcp and get ripped off to trade this call option like you can just buy Doge and have like a much more efficient expression of that sort of like nonlinear payout and I like I like that and that's that's that's what I that's what I use them for so I mean you know as when I when I got po it's like okay let me buy some Mew Whi pop all these like random random things I I don't buy the small caps and I would never even mention anything small uh because I don't want to you know I don't want to cause any trouble but the thing is they're over a billion for sure for sure that makes yeah I mean there was a moment this is like kind of when I went into Avi mode in my crypto trading career like I I was sort of like there is a moment where it pays to get long low market cap meme coins and that moment was when meme coins were sort of having their arrival right there was uh there was whiff that had just hit there were a few other big ones and then it was kind of like the entire world was investing like the money fire hose was like pointed at this space everybody was lighting up a phantom wallet everybody was buying that moment is done that doesn't mean that mem coins are dead that just means that the way that you your process for trading meme coins Works has to like you have to update it you have to update your process so AI I really appreciate that because like my process for trading memes felt like a very it was like okay The Fad is happening profit from The Fad all right the fat is over get out but no you you've kind of like identified a new way to think about this stuff which I think is like super important and you know what else is bullish what's bullish is Belo slobbering all over your your white muscle shirt there um he's a very bullish dog what can I say even though you know his name literally means bear in Hindi but you know he's a very bullish dog he's three months old and I'm going to teach him how to trade crypto soon did you get him with your girlfriend who's now your Twitter photo I did yeah that's that's that's a new that's a new pfp WoW amazing um so okay so do we have do we have any sort of like General broad views about crypto at the moment because I feel like I've been pretty convicted that it's going to break out for some time now I've been kind of wrong it's still locked in this you know earm muffs Belo this kind of dog [ __ ] range and um I'm not I'm starting to lose faith that we're just going to go vertical uh in the near term because I think there's so much election overhang which I I I really do believe is important for crypto however there are like all these kind of good tea leaves appearing in the market the first of which is like okay um despite what should be bearish news like kamla and Lead kamla You Know rumors that she's gonna appoint Gary Gensler to Secretary of the Treasury like all of this like horrible stuff like crypto is performing right you have like price action strength against weak news um also like nfts they're not rallying even though people are saying nfts are back they're not back yet they're just clearing like you're getting liquidity it's kind of like what happened in 2008 during the hous housing crisis when Real Estate was in freef fall and nothing traded and then suddenly a lot of stuff was trading that was the that was like the the first thing that you saw before a 15year long like Giga bull market in real estate which is sort of similarly a liquid to nfts like now crypto punks are clearing you're seeing like 15 20 30 of them trade per day the floor is like leaking upwards you know there they're like there's signs but we're still in this range I don't know Obi are we are we about to break out to the upside or or is it is it still like kind of compl well you just said a lot and a lot of really interesting things in that yeah so the first thing that I'll say is that I've been waiting for mid to late August for a very long time and it's mid to late August and nothing has changed except prices have gone lower which is again what I was waiting for and the reason I was waiting for this is because I think that Jacksonville tends to be an event especially over the summer people want to drisk they don't want to think about the market they want to step away If the Fed hikes a little bit extra there's probably going to be some nervousness in the market for about 3 and a half seconds before the market moves on and starts to go up again and so people just tend to step away during August now come September Q3 what you're going to see is everyone comes back from vacation everybody says okay now it's time to actually do the things that we were thinking about o over the summer let's start allocating to BTC start allocating to eth because there are these ETFs right I think that a lot of people that you would have expected to allocate to an EF or a BTC ETF they just haven't because you're not going to do that in August and so I do think they're genuine flows that are going to come in in September I think an additional point that I didn't consider back when I first said this because I didn't know Joe Biden was going to step down is that camel has decided to step up and try to run for president and campell's having her the an this moment right everybody's she's new she's you know different she's not Trump she's not Biden everybody's talking about her and the media is pushing out this campaign the reality is this woman is a terrible politician she is so uncharismatic she is so unlikable that once the public gets to know her more I really think they're going to get rid of her they're going to say there's no way we're voting we're voting for this woman right she's just not a good politician she's not very smart either so look and I'm not even super for a republican I just I I can't stand the idea of this woman becoming president and I know a lot of people that are even Democrats that feel this way like like there's no chance so I I do think that As Trump odds go up as we pass Jackson Hole as we get closer to September you start to get you you start to get inflows into into BTC now BTC has actually been lagging equities equities have retraced the entire cell off BTC not at all and so you have to ask s why it's because there are no like real allocations right now and also if you look at open interest if you look at funding it's all come off it's all neutralized people are starting to short and everyone that I talk to is sideline people have raised cash and so the moment this thing starts to go up and get away from them I think all the shorts cover I think all of the cash comes in from the sidelines and we're back at 70k quickly and then we probably have an October and and November that we're very that we're very happy about now for the time being I don't know exactly when this is going to this this is going to happen I mean it's possible that we trade down to 57 in the next week I don't know all I know is that if I buy 58 585 59 I'm probably going to be pretty happy in a month and so in the meantime to try to you know scratch that trading itch there are a lot of really good trades in this market that I'm personally looking at uh Tron has been talked about a lot I didn't realize that it generates you know the most fees of any L1 blockchain over the last 90 days they're starting to lean into the mcoin game this is probably going to last another six days and then everybody's getting out but it's a good trade for the time being you can pair it against e if you want to hedge and Market downside same I don't I don't like any L1 other than BTC Ethan salana for like a Time Horizon of longer than three months I could see how you could views for on Tron for a few days but like to me telegram like ton is the most interesting kind of like Mega cap coin and it hasn't budged since March it's like unchanged and so if that thing isn't rallying I'm like struggling to understand how any of these other all l1s will rally um telegram actually has things like actual applications being built on it that have product Market fit like well the one the one thing that I was discussing today that's kind of interesting is that Tron usdt on Tron is used pretty significantly across the board if you want to go rent a Ferrari in Dubai then you can actually go pay for that with usdt but it's going to be on the Tron network if you want to go wait why why not erc20 I don't know I I can't tell you why I just know that they prefer Tron and I know for you know actually I got a really interesting DM that says there are a bunch of people uh from Iran that live in North America that use usdt on Tron to send money back and forth I mean you know probably should report that to the FBI but you know I just heard about it so I haven't had time to do that yet the other uh thing that's true is latam I just saw a comment about this but when I was in Colombia uh you could pay for like a bus like if you like if you want to like rent a car uh for like six people like one of those like Mercedes you could just do it do it in Tron and so it generates a lot of fees and so I think people are starting to wake up for this uh the one thing that I'll say is I again I just to take this is all hindsight I didn't have a positioning Tron I barely own any of this thing uh I probably should buy more but if you look at the chart since May of this year it's just like up only I mean basically since December it's up only I mean even against against Heath since the bottom on May 27th on the ratio pair it's up 20% and it really just took off in the last couple days actually wow this is pretty nuts I haven't paid any attention to Tron um to me like the Justin Sun peacocking uh PR thing was sort of like oh you're you're just trying to be a protagonist you're basically the next BF or Doan or whatever I I just kind of ignored it it was a bit cringe and [ __ ] but at the same time like yeah obious by the way I product Market fit it's it's like this this is the thing Obby I I'll let you I'll let you go in a second I just wanted to like put this out there there are green shoots in crypto right now like product Market fit seems to be kind of blossoming everywhere and I don't want to sleep on it like poly Market product Market fit coins product Market fit Tron and EM apparently product Market fit nfts uh you know I guess you had product Market fit in 2021 but they were priced wrong now you've got product Market fit and it's priced priced attractively like something's happening here I don't know there's just all the all these little corners of crypto that are kind of attracting usage in ways that we haven't seen before and I wonder if it's just going to lead to this like like like you said earlier like disconnection from equities to the upside which as we've discussed on this podcast a thousand times like that is the fomo moment that's when that's when institutional and Retail money fresh retail money just piles in not the same washing machine of retail that's been in here for for five years you know I I agree with you I I agree with you wholeheartedly I mean and that's why I'm I'm bullish you know long longer term I mean I will say that if you look at you know I have the way that I the way that I section out my trading um just to take a tangent here is I have my fundamental core positions that I've done research on that I really like that I want to hold for a long period of time I have my long short book where I put on things either for beta trades like for example if Bitcoin sells off a ton I might buy a ton of BTC or buy a ton of ether buy a ton of soul and then I'll short this is where all the shorts like starkware and worldcoin and sui that I've discussed on a bunch of podcasts go and then I have my real Mal book where it's generally just like Catalyst trades or narrative trades and Catalyst trades and narrative trades I always always always pair and the reason I always pair them is because like inherently in that trade you don't want to take a market bias because you're betting on a catalyst or you're betting on an event or you're betting on a narrative so are you are you like long a versus short compound or something like that something like that I mean that would have been a great trade I didn't do it but like just as an example right now these are two massive assets I don't feel bad about talking about them but you know CZ is getting released from jail in 40 days and I guarantee you like two weeks before he gets released everyone's going to be talking about B&B and B&B probably goes up time and so I'm long BNB VTC uh because the chart looks good because of that and like this it um you know it's not it's not mass you know what I love about what you just said that trade makes so what I love about what you just said is that that trade makes so much sense if you if you if you discuss a trade idea like that in the Commodities Market you get laughed out of the room because underlying fundamentals don't allow those things to happen but in crypto you can literally be like CZ is coming out of jail no one's talking about it he's probably going to do something maybe it's BNB related at the very least there'll be a narrative it should pump and you're right like you're dead right those sorts of Trades work it's super exciting and that's what I love about crypto trading like there's a lot of interesting blockchain Tech going on a lot of interesting ways that this technology can help move money and create the internet of value but like from a trading perspective crypto trading has this beautiful thing where for certain tokens at certain times you isolate out just the psychology just the psychological element of trading and you can separate everything else all the broader Market fundamentals away and just get long BNB because CZ is getting released from jail and actually make money on that like it's it's such a unique Market in that respect every other Market those those trades have been basically arbed out by machines but not in crypto yeah somebody mentioned that the B&B CZ trade is kind of crowded I I I disagree it's it's up 15% off of a let's see it's off it's up 15% off of a five month low against BTC I don't think that's crowded you know it it it has hasn't even reached the highs of highs of this year against against BTC uh but you know I I don't think that that makes it a crowded trade personally one one other so F or F I'm sorry I love you I don't know how to pronounce your name we would have invited him on if we yeah if like we weren't so terrible with tech and I didn't want to like [ __ ] anything up I I would have brought you on because I really I really like your uh F sorry I really like your uh I really like your takes we we'll have to do that next time yeah we'll have to figure out how to get people in here we I can see some friends of the pod in here some uh some familiar faces in this chat this is amazing but I don't quantitatively hedge the positions because it's really difficult because those those ratios are inherently unstable and we just don't have enough price history for me to effectively do that so for example the correlation between two assets might be one for two weeks and then go negative right it's it's really tough in crypto and I've just noticed that there's a tremendous amount of instability in these ratios so the best thing that I try to do is you know you calculate the beta to the asset and you try to think about how the market environment would affect that and then you can you can come to your conclusion you can either do one to one maybe do a little bit more maybe do a little bit less uh but I don't ever what I don't do for example is I don't say okay well uh the position has gone up now let's rebalance make sure it's still beta adjusted hedge I don't do that because it's it's it's very unstable yeah you need ma balance those trades for you yeah exactly better not to do it yourself so I think that right now the the other the other trade that I kind of I I kind of like I mean I I like uh the AI trade I mean Nvidia Nvidia went up the entire way back it's like up 30% in 5 days and and AI coins haven't really done much and I think that if Bitcoin gets above 60 and holds you probably get a Resurgence of that narrative the one thing that I'll say is that wolf has done really well oh wow that's crazy I just mentioned wolf and then somebody typed in Wolf but yeah wolf wolf is Wolf is doing really well uh R bought Soros bought and I think it's I think it's still underpriced I've I've held that position for months at this point I've been accumulating it for for a while I really I really like it I really like the management team uh I like their I like their expansion plans I like their cost of why just for the people who aren't versed on this what is Wolf and why do you like it like what's the what's the elevator pitch so long long story short wolf wolf was a Bitcoin minor um they're also signing contracts to build AI data centers they have a they they ba they basically have a a plan to expand that is a very good plan and they have a very low cost of electricity and they're moving into the providing HPC compute for people that need it and I think that they're going to do very well here okay so a lot of minors let me just poke one hole in your thesis a lot of miners are pivoting to a AI uh the minor C incompetent the minor space has ripped like PE ratios I don't know my Bloomberg in front of me but they're high so why why wolf why is Wolf priced for a rally is it a pure narrative trade or do you feel like wolf lagged and they have a better plan so I mean the I I didn't want to get too into the details here but they basically have a site it's called the lake Mariner site and it is an extremely valuable and underappreciated asset on their balance sheet it's going to take a while to convert it to you know and actually actually provide these services but I don't think the street has quite appreciated like how much they're going to be able to provide from that from that site it hasn't really been you know talked about enough and that's why that's why D and S Source are coming in I also think that the the management is really good so the guys have been in the electricity business for 30 years and you can't really say that about any of the other any of the other Miners and so the management team I think is just a lot more confident and so that's why it's really my only it's like the only it is the only minor that I hope so it's like our new coinbase that we should we should look at in you know Trad five markets as a as a kind of crypto crypto proxy SL AI proxy interesting okay so here's my take on you mentioned the word electricity which I I'm really glad you you brought that up because I have I have a take on this basically I think that the way that AI is going to scale it like the way that it's going to consume compute is at first there like the demands of AI search which consumes something like on the order of 10 to 100x the magnitude of energy of a regular search um I think that at first centralized providers of compute like wolf like you know open AI like Google will be able to keep up because I think that these operators can Source the gpus and Source the the sort of silicon that they need to run our sort of current level like humanities current level of searching needs but as like the volume of queries that the world currently pipes through Google shifts from Google to like AI engines that contextualize the search and consume 10 to 100x the amount of energy that Google does per query um I think that basically centralized operators are no longer going to be able to handle uh well they may be able to Source enough like semiconductors to handle the compute but they won't be able to power them in a coste effective way so basically my thesis is that it's going to be electricity not compute that drives AI into the world of decentralized computing I.E crypto basically and I think that bit tensor Like Chief uh you know shed us on this the more that I do my my homework on bit tensor and I don't like adding core positions without doing a lot of work like the more work I do on bit tensor the more I'm like I think this is the I think this is the platform that's going to provide compute in a year or two years when the query volume goes uh exponential on AI and just to finish out the thought it's like every every Schmo is paying for electricity in their apartment they're not going to notice if their GPU um consumes a little bit more but like you know so I think that basically the way that AI queries need to scale is a horizontal problem horizontal scaling means that like every every Joe out there is mining a little bit of toao trying to earn a little bit of this distributed computing Revenue that's going through the internet it's not necessarily a problem that can be solved with vertical scaling where like one operator just buys all of the GP and sources all of the Power I think the gpus will be available in significant quantities to centralized operators but electricity will not right it's it's too it's too complex you need you need to you need the electricity problem to be distributed so I think that it's actually a commodity question that's going to cause AI to go decentralized and I think that bit tensor will will benefit not because of the compute necessarily like the comput is there on bit tensor or in centralized modalities it's really the power that's going to force AI into the land of decentralized um Computing it's a Nuance take but I like to me it's kind of crystal clear as a Commodities guy you know yeah I mean that that that makes sense that makes sense to me I'm I don't really know how you draw the connection between the decentralization of electricity or the decentralization of AI be happening because of electricity and how B tensor necessarily benefits yeah basically what I'm saying is like there's going to be a baseline network of providers of compute powered compute for AI queries that's going to be a network of centralized providers that we've discussed already but then like when demand exceeds Supply you need some sort of marginal producer of powered compute to come online and that marginal producer is probably a random guy somewhere in the world right and I think that that is that that that is fair I mean regardless regardless of how this specific thing plays out I'm fairly confident that over the next 3 weeks you're going to see a Resurgence in people betting on AI just because of how well Nvidia did uh and the fact that people have haven't really CAU on to that uh in the crypto markets yeah I mean even today like ar ar is up a ton doing doing very well relative to the rest of the market I think you can run all these as pair trades but just to just to take a step back for a second the move into decentralization I think is just it's always going to be forced by costs that's why that's why people are doing it is because in a globalized world it makes sense to be able to it makes sense to be able to run things in a in a decentralized manner and in a in a world where you know technology every day that goes by technology allows a human to do more and more right and so the leverage that you get from using a computer today is way more than using you know a pen pen and paper 200 years ago you could you could do a lot more like an individual human can do a lot more so when you think about something like providing I I'll use helium helium as an example it's been it's been beaten to death but it's sort of coming coming back coming back now it was never possible before for an individual person to provide Wireless services to somebody just by buying you know a piece of Hardware it just wasn't it wasn't possible that technology didn't exist and so now that it does exist you can provide lower cost Services through decentralization because it's easier for one person to provide that service as technology GRS and this is also what AI is doing right it allows one person to provide a service that they couldn't necessarily before which makes sense to have a Marketplace that's decentralized so you can sort of go out there and now you know instead of having to aggregate a bunch of people in one area you can get individual you can get the same output from individuals that are all over the world so it just makes it just makes more sense again one of the reasons I'm super bullish on helium so um I mean I like I like I said I I love I love helium they're actually adding they're adding something like 400 subscribers a day right now what are you serious where year to dat helium moov yeah I'm just making sure that I got the numbers right but year to date helium mobile has added almost 880,000 new subscribers uh which is crazy AT&T and Verizon they' added about 550,000 new subscribers so helium is already is onboarding you know a little bit a little bit more than 10% 133% of all the subscribers that kind of if if this had again more green shoots like if this had that headline had hit the market in 2021 helium would be up like a bajillion percent on it and now people are literally so jaded with crypto that they're just like show show me that helium has intermediated AT&T and then maybe we'll consider buying token you know right well it's totally outperform the market I I will say that and it's you know one one of the things that I'm I'm most proud of holding because I actually think it's solving a real problem in this world you know I'll say that there somebody somebody asked a question here uh brother brother your Wormhole and stuff were going to zero I agree I mean Bridges and l2s basically zero it's it's infrastructure no one wants or needs like there was an under L of block space and an under supply of infrastructure for like 10 seconds three years ago that era is over now you have an over supply of block space we the world is like okay so it's nice that you can Bridge from l1's to l2s like it's nice that uh the across protocol is there to help you get your assets onto base cheaply from the main net but like in terms of cross chain protocols um man dude the the reality the reality is nobody cares yeah and no and l2s are cannibalizing are cannibalizing eth and I think that we're just going to see activity congregate onto specific chains so things like Salona T maybe ethereum although you know again I'm I'm still bearish on ethereum just generally I think the the user experience is pretty bad over over what should I sell all my eth and just rotate it in telegram my personal my personal view is that there's no reason to hold a faar of anything but we've talked about this I don't I don't want to I don't want to rehash it no we've actually talked about the opposite of that like we we've talked about how eth is hated and it's coming back we've never said that it's over you know that's a that's a spicy every every every time I have made this argument I have said that eth is bullish in the short term because of flows but over a long period of time I'm very bearish on etherum this has been my there's been a very clear stance of mine from the beginning is that yes it can do well because of flows over a six-month time frame but over a five-year time frame I see no reason to hold this thing uh personally you know so I mean yeah I I I just see it losing really badly because again its user interfaces is not is not great it's not you know the lack of leadership I think is very worrying it's a completely decentralized Network sure but if there's nobody Bitcoin doesn't depend on BD as much because basically what you have to do with Bitcoin is what gives it value is you buy it and you hold it so if I go to people and I say hey I bought this thing you should buy this thing because it's a digital gold because it'll protect you in times of inflation because it'll do all these you know amazing things for you it's you know it'll it'll save you if you need to flee in the middle of the night because Jew hatred is getting too much it's you just have to buy it that just gives it value ethereum needs people to build on it in order for it to have value and if you don't are though they're just building on l2s well kind of but even l2s are I think under under under I mean l2s will can Will cannibal stable coin market cap is at alltime highs I don't know what percentage of stable coin trans occur on ethereum but I would guess or ethereum L2 but like I would guess significant percentage of it um poly Market you know I guess you know there there's plenty of stuff going on l2s can take off l2s can get interesting activity but they're going to cannibalize and this is what we've been saying or you know I've been saying for a very long time a lot of other people have been saying it everybody kind of ignored us um that everybody that was invested in l2s kind of ignored us but the reality is that l2's cannibalized activity on eth and they don't provide enough they don't provide enough fees to eat to make it worthwhile but l2s are uninvestable too so l2s just kind of play spoiler right like their own tokens suck and they make eth less valuable n like l2s are like the RFK or like Ross perau they they they just spoil it for the for the main guy and then make him lose so basically what you're saying is I should keep my crypto Punk and move all of my other ethereum assets I like I like I like nfts nfts are great but only only the ones that have real history and real Providence like your crypto relevance as they say and cultural relevance the if if it's culturally relevant sure like my you know my ether Rock like rock 83 cultur it'll be cultur com SE is great I like for all I think this twitch setup headache was worth it this is fun it took me so long to figure it out but I find figured it out the tech setup was aing Nightmare like I don't I don't know what I'd rather do have camel be president or go through that Tech setup again we have a guy on who's literally like offering to be our new engineer this is awesome any yeah I mean guy I mean I'm I'm I'm down see the thing is just to just to talk you know about the General market one more time because I see somebody you know wanted to hear about that my view is that we're going to have a great great great year and just to talk about the equity markets for for a moment people are worried about if Jackson Hole maybe maybe they hike 50 it doesn't matter because what matters is growth what matters is the data what matters is the you know every you know the inflation unemployment earnings this is what matters and I think at this point the FED raising 50 the the room temperature take of the FED raising 50 points is that the FED is made up very hold on hold on the FED is made up of these very smart guys and they know something that we don't and so that's why they're raising they're raising 50 cut cutting so yeah sorry yeah cutting I keep saying raising because yeah my bad cutting um so that's that that's that's why they're cutting 50 because because these guys are but the reality is they're they're not and they've proven they're not and you know real money doesn't even follow that anymore it'll be a it'll be a blip but the only thing the only thing that will really change this is a deep recession in my in my in my personal opinion that's not coming and that's not coming based on based on the data that's not coming basically what it would take for a big recession to come is polic a you would need um you need kamla to get elected and Institute price controls you would need Trump to get elected and put like 80% tariffs on Auto Imports or something crazy like you would you would need policy a to cause a recession at this point or or a massive Commodities Supply shock which I don't think is g to happen like I think Iran wants dayt tant I think Russia and Ukraine are more likely to like end the war next year than not and flood the world with hydrocarbons um like honestly like I I just don't see a recession I'm I'm a macro bull right now I like all equities um especially on dips I think that against that backdrop and against the backdrop of rates going down like crypto the macro Tailwind for crypto just looks insanely good but but like I say crypto I really mean Bitcoin like what I'm worried about that when I look at my portfolio the toxic risk that I'm worried about potential toxic risk is like is my eth allocation which is substantial going to become um a flaming pile of elephant [ __ ] or is it just GNA uh Skyrocket past Bitcoin and go straight to 10K and outperform like crazy on institutional adoption with a more friendly SEC like it to me it feels binary I don't know what's right or what's wrong and I'm getting a little uncomfortable with that piece of my portfolio I'm I'm thinking like I I go back and forth some days I'm like Trump's GNA win the sec's going to get friendly institutions are going to start settling somebody said going to the moon and then other days I'm just like why do I even own this thing like I want to get out of all of it and rotate it into other things that I'm more excited about what were you saying somebody said what yeah sorry so somebody said that um 25 BBS unless onfp is shockingly bad why is BTC under proring both NASDAQ and gold uh one BTC really never follows gold like it it follows gold in very short periods of time but it doesn't actually you know if you look at look correlations over month-to Monon time time frame it doesn't really follow gold M mainly follows NASDAQ and the reason is because there's just less people looking at crypto and less allocation into crypto than there is in in in into into equities and a lot of the people that sold crypto like sold and are just waiting waiting on the sidelines right right now because there's you know most most people don't have a mandate to be allocated to crypto whereas people have a mandate to be allocated equities so generally what you see is like when Equity markets sell off and then they bounce it's very rare that Bitcoin outperforms that it's just it's it's it's actually quite rare what ends up happening is that when equities stabilize then Bitcoin starts to rip and the other thing is that Krueger said 50 is needed now and 25 would be an error no I I no just wrong um 50 is not needed now no I mean it's it's not needed with stocks back on the highs if things look shaky I think the FED is much more reactive to stock markets than they'd like to admit right so maybe a week and a half ago they would have a 50 50 basis point cut would have been more on the table um I think that it's an election year I think that a lot of people are politically sensitive you know I hate to keep begging on this election drum but it's just as like crypto has become an episodic macro asset just like many other things that I've traded in my career and I I see all the Hallmarks of it it's you have to pay attention otherwise you're going to miss opportunities and to me like one of the biggest opportunities that I've seen this entire year was something that we shouted out on our emergency thousand EXP podcast crypto nuked right as crypto and stocks nuked in the middle of an a Very Sensitive time for Washington uh and they telegraphed very dubish things very loudly it seemed like an obvious dip to buy across equities crypto all risk assets we shouted about it and frankly we were right like I think you have to buy these dips in this in this particular election year you just have to yeah I mean the only the the the only thing that'll just destroy us is if Campbell puts in uh price controls yeah other than that I I think I think we're good um polici a it's really what the only thing that could cause a recession is just like showing up and and getting it wrong I mean Trump trump could do it too just to be just to be totally bipartisan here like Trump could do something stupid um tariffs like get get too aggressive with it who are you texting um my mother because I hear you I hear you I hear clickity click click so it's like you're you're like my my mom who has sound I'm listening to you I just my mom was texting me some wild stuff uh to respond to her before she gets before she gets upset is she in the chat no she's not in the chat girlfriend who else is GF what GF your GF I'm not a doctor now she she asked me she asked me today if I was going to quit because she said she she looked at Bitcoin she goes bitcoin's under 60k you gonna quit what's going on [ __ ] h no no no Med no med school yet no med school my wife's like how much do we have in crypto again and I tell her the number and she's like what the [ __ ] like what are you you know I get I get shouted at basically um and that's just how aging goes oh look they're asking us personal questions what did I go to college for I graduated with a degree in chemical engineering and computer science wow I I did um e Eng oh sorry I did econ and operations research but no one knows what operations research is so I just say statistics because it's basically that but with a little bit of engineering on top chemical engineering was the worst mistake of my life to be honest because why I did it so the whole reason that I studied chemical engineering not that anyone cares is that I was fascinated like super super super fascinated with the way that water moved and I wanted to figure out how to like think about it yeah I remember you like take the drain off your bathtub and you'd see the swirl and like why does it do that and so then it turns out that the way that you model the movement of water is na is the navier Stokes equation which is literally unsolved so one way of solving it is this thing called Newton's method where you basically just like iterate through a bunch of numbers to try to figure out like what the actual answer is and so basically what I found out is the whole reason I went into it they were just like I have no idea it just does doesn't then I fell in love with thermodynamics um so that was fun thermodynamics is great I I think one thing that's I I started in physics too I I used to work at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs and the particle accelerator and it's called the ALS the advanced light source and one thing that those subjects teaches you is that um one it teaches you to do your your own research and work really hard and actually like try to solve complex problems by just sitting there and grinding it out which is valuable even in crypto the other thing that those those subjects teach you is um just how much stamina you have to have in order to sit through like 60 years of researching a question whose answer you may never find and so I think a lot of people who St in the hard Sciences end up in trading because they want a shorter feedback loop they want to know whether what they're doing is like kind of working or not you know 100% it's like you know the the the dopamine is great and you still get to use math and you still get to think about statistics and you still get to solve complex problems it's just you make a lot of money um yeah or lose a lot or lose or lose a lot of money and then you just go back to engineering that that actually I will say if anyone here is studying in University right now getting an engineering degree was the best thing I ever did for myself because it taught me how to think I probably wouldn't have chosen chemical engineering but because really really [ __ ] hard but uh engineering just helps you helps you how to think and oh hello hello we have to go my girlfriend is calling me well that's the end of the episode not Financial advice love you all do your own research we don't know anything I I know nothing all right coming see you guys got to go some grass see you later first twitch [Music]

look I'm a bull why there's a bull behind that's why when you look screen it's green there's no more bear bear is gone we got rid of the bear but I do think that it's very possible that we're just entering into a new downtrend the people that bought below they're probably going to sell 60k and then 60k turns into turns into resistance it'll be very hard to get people to buy an asset like crypto which is so volatile if you can go 30% down in a week and this is what we've learned in basically every major crash scenario is that there's no such thing as an uncorrelated asset when things are falling apart if the equity markets continue down then Bitcoins in my personal opinion still in big trouble this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance the onchain defi primitive redesigning derivatives for the defi native you'll hear more about perennial later in the show [Music] welcome back to another God you can tell you can tell I've uh been staring a CHS too long can't even talk properly right now Jonah I know about you yeah I mean I'm pretty fried uh not not like anything's going on in the markets or anything AI I don't know if you seen anything happening in the charts no I mean um what did I do this weekend went to to West Virginia saw my parents um they met my girlfriend nothing really else happened you know yeah same you know oh is Bitcoin 55k right now oh did it did it hit did it hit 49 did I miss something oh that's a big move that's crazy we should probably talk about yeah uh yeah we should probably we should probably make this an emergency episode of the THX podcast for everybody out there in ourselves who who's just uh wondering giant WTF is going on right now kind of kind of emotions I would I'm also WTF is going on one one thing which was insane did you you see the vix chart yeah oh my God that's a wild chart yeah and the craziest thing is it's the third highest peak ever but nothing happened like like if you really think about it right vix hit 65 NASDAQ is off 15% nothing crazy right like it's a the equity markets yeah they're down yeah we had a bad day but during covid we went down 30% vix didn't do that or vix vix did that that but it took you know a 30% drop from November of 21 to the bottom went down 40% vix didn't do that yeah I mean the last time vix was up here there were a couple of times one of the times was covid when there was like an outbreak of an unknown virus that was just like killing people and then the other time that I remember pretty vividly was 2008 when I worked at Leman brothers and the vix hit 65 and then uh it was kind of like hey here's a cardboard box you should put all this all your stuff from your desk in the cardboard box because your company doesn't exist anymore like this time we hit 65 in the vix the volatility index it's just sort of like why like what what is going on I have a theory and like as you can tell from our relatively Blas conversation here I don't think either of us is particularly worried about this one I don't think either of us is [ __ ] the bed we're going to get into it get into it deep on this podcast but like for me um the lower the sort of volatility landscape gets the calmer things are uh the bigger the positions you need to run in order to make you know the same kind of money that you were making during what you know previous volatile environments right so in 2022 one unit of risk will generate you know X return or X volatility uh in 2024 volatility is so low that you knew you know you you need two three or four units of of risk to generate that same X level of p&l variants and so I think what what we've been seeing is just like after you know some really wild years of covid and Ukraine Wars and you know Regional Bank crises uh you know people have made a lot of money and I think uh you know speculative participants across the board across you know the the investment landscape now need to deploy much more risk in order to generate commensurate returns uh and when you get an unwind of a crowded trade if every every body has a lot of risk on you can see some pretty crazy moves so to me this is just like a technical unwind type trade I don't think there's anything fundamentally flawed about the economy I don't think there's a supply shock a demand shock I don't think that we're seeing some sort of like crazy thing happening out of left field like covid I think this is just like classic textbook everyone crowded into the same trades ins size you know dollar Yen carry trade short options long crypto long stocks long AI you know all all of these crowded trades and then um you know when they start to look a little bit shaky I think I honestly think that the you know maybe the election odds tipping a little bit away from from uh Mr I pump markets has been a bit of a catalyst for this like it's starting to look a little bit shaky you see all these people with a lot of risk on in a crowded trade thinking huh I'm up a lot this year I want to protect these returns I'm you know time to get out time to de risk and everybody from Buffett on down to you know your your three fig retail Trader on crypto Twitter is doing the exact same thing at the same time it just seems to me as you just eloquently put that this is just one massive deleveraging event and it's a growth story as well which is why equities equities are puking and I think it's just the com combination of these things that is leading to the selloff it's nothing it's nothing that we haven't seen before it's actually pretty in line like you would expect something like this even in a even in a bull market so it's not as scary as previous sell-offs which I think we've been we've been going going back and forth and saying but that being that being said still went down a lot right I mean from Peak recent Peak to the recent low Bitcoin went down 30% that's actually that's a big that's a big move right and I think a lot of people got carded out over the weekend just to help people think about how these things tend to go when you get selloff into a weekend Trends tend to continue why especially selling uh specifically selling because most people are not going to be allocating or buying heavily over the weekend people aren't going to make decisions to initiate new positions over the weekend especially big money but what people can do and what they often do is they reduce existing positions or they play with existing positions and when the trend is down when it was down on Friday down on Saturday and Sunday is an extremely illiquid day in general you tend to want to just stay away from doing anything on a Sunday like you don't want to buy the dip on a Sunday which I did a little bit but got blown up but that's just a lesson that I think people should take away is you almost never want to fight the trend on a Sunday the flip side of this is sometimes you get a move on a Sunday where it's like a flash like maybe Sunday morning goes up or a weekend like you know weekend buying tends to be very on you know on and then off so if Market moves up on a on a Sunday maybe you want to sell it Market moves down a little bit on a Sunday maybe you want to sell it but we were we were selling off on Friday Saturday Sunday you just don't fade until you get some sort of liquidation event normally hey Obi let me interrupt you for a second uh some guy is in our streamyard saying that you tweeted the streamyard link so you should probably untweet that oops I mean can they see us no oops I I took a screenshot I said we're recording an emergency pod um cool anyway back back to what you were saying sorry actually if they can't see us recording does it matter oh GCR just connected or somebody who's pretending to be GCR just connected all right kick from Studio [ __ ] all right so we're just gonna get all these random people in here if they can't see us or hear us it's kind of fun no yeah we're just gonna have random people in here we could just we it could be like radio where we just like in invite random people on to say like extreme [ __ ] and it's kind of like it's kind of like an Easter egg you know it's like if you find the link then you get to hang out here yeah there you go all right anyway so you're saying don't buy dips on Sundays because it's extremely a liquid and also like what I would add to that is it's a Sunday in August right like this is when the big Risk Takers are out on vacation they're on their their um their yacht in sand Trope they're not like thinking all right time to get go all in buying this dip especially since this dip isn't some like weird crypto idios Sy itic thing that's going to mean revert on a Monday when markets open right like this is this is being driven by bigger macro markets than crypto well that's the part that confused me is I thought that it would be reverted and it was a bit right so basically throughout the entire session today we've gone up at Market open at 9:30 we are trading 50k we're now trading 54 so we reverted it just so happened that we died rically up until then right so the the real move the real move down started Sunday at 800 PM so we were trading 58k Sunday Sunday at 8m and then we nuked down to nine we nuked down to 52 and then we had one more puke down to 49 and that and then and then we cleared out I think a lot a lot of the supply which I you know right now the way that I think about this is if you want to play this from the long side you have to understand who sell most people got carded out most of the buyers got completely destroyed so the only people that are selling right now are the people that bought the bottom of which there were very few and so it might take a while to chew through Supply above but the reality of the situation is that they're just not that many people left to sell unless something crazy happens right if Equity markets keep nuking that can be crazy if you know we don't go up for two weeks three weeks then I think people that are holding Bitcoin get very nervous about holding too long because normally Bitcoin tends to reverse reasonably reasonably quickly and I think a lot of people start drisking alts in that scenario I actually think bit coin's probably okay in that particular scenario it's just that bols are going to get totally destroyed so people are going to slowly trickle out of salana they're going to slowly trickle out of jeto all these random things but Bitcoin probably just just chops around unless you get a shock right and and I don't know what that shock would be because I think the the two the two major shocks were just earnings that were really bad and then major cap Tech selling off aggressively and then the yend trade unwinding there's also a bad um payrolls number yeah but the services number today was okay yeah so I mean I I don't view this as a as as necessarily existential yeah me neither I mean I think that I like okay so I've had mixed success to put it generously to myself like pretty actually not limited success just like trying to step in and buy like catch the falling knife when it's falling this fast right like I I'm I'm so not worried about this selloff this has none of the Hallmarks of like a proper bare Market that's just going to Nuke the economy um and nuke nuke the middle class and nuke the average investor and and business alike this just doesn't look like that doesn't smell like it it doesn't feel like it and as Market participants with a little bit of uh you you know a little bit of experience now we've unfortunately seen what real bare markets look like quite a few times in our short careers and it's it's like this just isn't one of them right it has none of the Hallmarks of that however it feels dumb to just be like all right thing just came off I'm G I'm just gonna go Dive Right In there and catch this falling knife like it feels like you get hurt pretty bad so I don't you have to manage your risk effectively yeah at the end of the day I mean you can't get you can't get taken out of the game the most important thing in crypto is to just never get taken out of the game survive so that you catch the next upswing yeah so like I think what would be dumb would be to suddenly add a bunch of line items here just start like going going shopping for random altcoins and meme coins and doing stupid [ __ ] I think that um I honestly think that the smartest thing you could possibly do in this market is either Hold Steady or if you're G to buy like buy Bitcoin or cons or consolidate line items into Bitcoin because I do think Bitcoin dominance is gonna is g to you know Rally from here after sell-offs like this you're 100% right I've seen this happen over and over and over Bitcoin dominance goes up yeah unless you get a very very sharp reversal reversal you tend to like you sorry Sor Bitcoin dominance T tends tends to go up so the way that I'm trying to play this market right now is I'm I am buying some alts I'm buying alts that I really think could have idiosyncratic strength or that have a narrative behind them including things like helium uh but and ton but basically other than that I don't really like touching alts I like touching BTC eth and potentially soul and even then I don't know if I love eth one thing that really [ __ ] so many people I don't know if I can curse on this podcast but curs all you want I'm I'm here for you one thing that like really really really hurt is all of the people that were long eth and eth BTC because of the ETF and then they just got they just got taken out back and that's that that that's tough because I think a lot of people viewed that as a quote unquote safe trade which is a reminder to everyone out there that's investing anytime you feel super comfortable with the trade probably the wrong trade in fact almost always the wrong trade so what I would say is in this in in these in these types of environments do the hard thing yeah and buy Bitcoin yeah Jon is buying Bitcoin hard for you right that's the issue it's a little hard for me I mean I'm I'm not like fully allocated in the way that you know younger people without kids and families are fully allocated like a lot of the guys that I talked to who are in their 20s they have literally 100% of their net worth in crypto me like I had a career in oil before crypto uh so I you know at this point I'm trying to defend some some Capital as well as grow it so I have a sort of a maximum threshold that I allow myself to be allocated to crypto like a maximum percentage of my portfolio and I'm at that percentage so I could lose discipline if it keeps going down then your percentage of portfolio will go down too right yeah that's true but I mean honestly what's happening this time like it's going down a little bit but it's not going down by too much because again everything's nuking right so except bonds so obviously like I'm as this as this selloff happens like my crypto Equity balance is like kind of still almost preserved but now I'm getting more overweight fixed income which probably isn't the stupidest thing in the as as we go into a rate cutting cycle but like you know honestly like where where I'm at right now mentally is I could lose discipline and just YOLO more cash and rotate stuff into crypto or or not and I'm I think where I'm personally feeling like gut feel I I have some fear about adding more to to crypto given that I already ma I like maxed out like I'm I'm so bullish but I need to maintain discipline because I don't want to get myself into trouble you know yeah I think that's I think that's very fair and I think a lot of people would do well to just listen to that advice which is that you just need to maintain discipline at the end of the day also like weird you know it's it's funny like when I had no money whatsoever it was very stressful to take risk um because I grew up in a you know raised by Baby Boomers who said you know a penny saved is a penny earned and don't take risk and you know I I sort of came of age during the 2000s under the you know GW Bush Administration when the stock market literally did absolutely [ __ ] nothing for 10 years right so it wasn't just like this guaranteed oh investing makes you returns kind of mindset I was like you know mostly in cash for for my early career it was very difficult for me to get used to taking risk um in my PA obviously at work I took a lot of risk but then it's funny like now things have changed for me I've been a Trader for 20 years but as they say like Mo Money Mo Problems I I still I still get that same like weird stress uh that I used to get when I was like 20 years old uh you know buying like buying stocks because I you know when markets are absolutely nuking it's it's hard to take hard earned money and just like throw it in front of the throw it into the you know into the arena hoping that that you don't get it blown out um that's not to say that I don't do it on occasion but for me like crypto is a momentum asset it's reflective as you always say Obby and I think that I I've gotten really hurt in crypto just trying to catch the falling knife made a lot money in crypto buying like buying early on recoveries like buying that upward momentum once it seems like the the [ __ ] storm is passed and to me this [ __ ] storm is just positioning so I'm I'm gonna wait and see just how deep and how how Savage this unwind truly is I don't know how long the world is these short Vol carry trades that are unwinding right now maybe it's over maybe it's not going to be over for a few months but one thing that I'm damn sure of is that uh you know in a in an election year you're not going to have the government hang the middle class out to dry and just like stand silently on the sidelines while the American populace gets absolutely obliterated and elects them out of office that just that just doesn't seem like an outcome this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance perennial is quickly becoming one of the go-to derivatives platforms and liquidity layers for all of defi so let me tell you a little bit about them there are kind of three things you need right when you're thinking about a place and a platform to trade on first one great trade execution second one low fees and third of course an onchain permissionless platform and perennial Nails all three of those buckets with the launch of perennial V2 they've made all of that possible by introducing a ton of new features suches faster oracles which reduce trade execution to seconds lower fees competing with major centralized exchanges and minimizing fees for both takers and makers fully modular markets which allow the protocol to support any price feed out there and fourth cash settled right the trades are cash settled in USD not in crypto perennial allows you the trader to gain access to deeper liquidity with only a fraction of the tvl how it works is that perennial enables a two-sided Market made up of both Traders and liquidity providers right Traders deposit the assets to get leverage exposure while liquidity providers provide these pools of capital to earn fees for taking the other side of the trader position renal allows you to trade crypto pers FX and coming soon nfts and more backed by some of the best investors in the industry perennial is a must checkout platform if you're a crypto Trader go check them out by clicking the link in the description give thousand XM credit go check out perennial you're going to love them all right let's get back to the show the thing is do you do you think that the FED cares about the equity markets or nor they talk about you know credit spreads but you know Equity markets yeah I think they can I mean look the first thing that equities and credit are part of the same corporate American capital structure right equities are obviously riskier and uh credit is secured so it's less risky so equities go first and credit follows and they're highly correlated so you know when I used to Trade high-grade Credit um the index of high-grade credit uh Insurance called IG CDX or CDX IG uh it's just correlated with the vix right like when volatility goes up uh the price you pay to ensure bonds goes up meaning um bonds go down like bond prices go down so it's or sorry credit spreads widen excuse me it's late um but yeah it's just it's literally it's just one interrelated system and the equity part of the capital structure moves faster and earlier than the the debt part but it's all connected and so like I think the only thing that investors should be actually worried about like the only way you lose your shirt is if there's a credit crisis and you know you and everybody you know and the company you work for and everybody else's employer are forced to do things at irrational prices when they don't want to do them that's what credit crises are all about we haven't had a credit crisis since 2008 because the fed and the treasury and you know basically like the bureaucracy in Washington DC stopped letting those credit crises happen they basically just transferred risk from balance sheets of individuals and companies onto the balance sheet of the government and that happened again in 2020 happened like in many little ways in 2013 2018 2023 with the the regional Banks like it keeps happening so if if this thing metastized into a credit crisis where suddenly you can't access Capital you need to get a home or to grow your business or if credit really dries up which just seems like totally out of the question to me but let's just say that it happens right if if the the bureaucracy in Washington DC decides to just let that let that go right and not do anything about it not buy asset back Securities not cut rates not print cash if they just let it go they're not just going to be taking one crisis worth of medicine they're going to be taking like 15 years 16 years worth of post Global financial crisis worth of medicine and stock market's going down to like what if they are like that's that's that's a question that people have to answer is what if they AR if we have if if we don't have a reason to step in so why did we step in last time uh when we had a sell off this fast this hard it's because it was Co there's a political reason to step in now because there's no political reason it's just happening because it's happening is there enough backing to come in or or people going to go up in arms back I I I do think the one you know the one bullet point that's good is that this is happening during an election cycle and so the people that are currently in charge are very incentivized to continue the bull market and so there might be some level of political pressure on the FED even though it's you know not not necessarily the best thing in the world uh the qu the question is when it does happen how how can you even tell right again why I am an advocate at least right now of look I'm a bull why there's a bull behind so when you look screen it's green there's no more bear bear is gone we got rid of the bear but I do think that it's very possible that we're just entering into a new downtrend and the reason is because I mean the the people that bought below they're probably going to sell 60k and then 60k turns into turns into resistance and unless the world becomes less scary so unless you do get intervention then people will be very hard it'll be very hard to get people to buy an asset like crypto which is so volatile if you can go 30% down in a week right that's that's uh that's pretty scary asset I mean so what do you think happens when let's say intervention is announced in in one form or another let's just say it's uh the FED comes out with a 50 or 75 basis point cut that's kind of interventionist what do you think crypto does I think I don't think 50 points would be construed as interventionist I mean it was priced at 60% so the way that I mean may maybe 75 sure we got to got to take a look at the got to take the probability that that is being priced in right now I mean I think that if the FED does intervene in in a meaningful way or the treasury intervenes in a meaningful way then crypto's probably back at the highs but question is is that is that going to happen and can you even can can you bet on that right can the the worst thing that would happen to this Market is that people bet on it and then it doesn't materialize and then we're probably looking at 42k I do still have trouble wrapping wrapping my head around the probability that let's say fed treasury whatever they they they step in they they back they back stop they back stop the market um this makes me nervous because it might provide a short-term sugar rush but the question is once you've capitulated from back stopping the market for a financial crisis or a pandemic to we're backstopping the market solely because credit spreads blew out because earnings are bad and uh you know the bank of Japan raised rates and that caused a selloff then you're near the end and I don't think I'm smarter than everyone else and I don't think I understand this the macro Market better than everyone else but it's pretty obvious to me that that would signal that we're getting close to the end of the fed's ability to actually prop up this Market because if there's no real reason to do it other than the fact that well the market is weak then that signals that it's no longer action that you take in an emergency regular action that's needed in order for the market to not die well the the FED has a dual mandate right I kind of disagree with you on this they're they're basically they're they're supposed to pursue two goals maximum employment and price stability um price stability obviously refers to the price of like goods and services not price of equities um so I like I I know that market stability technically isn't part of their dual mandate but they always take it into account because as as capital markets crash companies do lay off people right like they like it filters through if there if the stock market is careening lower and it looks like we're headed for a real problem like companies will batten down the hatches is and they'll they'll tighten their budgets and they'll fire people so it there's sort of like an indirect feeder effect into that un like that employment part of their mandate so that's why they pay attention to you know falling equities markets I take your point the the big difference between this and sort of like previous environments uh during where they at you know did a bunch of stimulus was that in this environment rates are high like in previous during the Zer era the only the FED could do I guess it wasn't even the FED it was the treasury would could print dollars and the government could spend those dollars on stimulus right so that's sort of like modern monetary Theory quantitative easing whatever you want to call it tarp like those that's the last resort [ __ ] this time you know interest rates are north of 5% you can just cut them and that that's a much more effective tool for managing uh volatility right than than QE so while I do agree with you that we're in like kind of a problem Zone that the that governmental bodies be at the fed or the treasury are going to try and manage something as stupid as a positioning driven unwind um I think what that tells you is you should be long-term bullish Bitcoin because that shows you that uh bureaucrats have lost the plot a little bit and they are starting to kind of deviate from that dual mandate and instead try to you know keep people high on that Sugar Rush that you just mentioned which is which is not their job like it's bad and Bitcoin is ultimately the only thing that's gonna it's like gold it's digital gold it's it's basically a foil to frivolous Central Bankers who debase dollars in an attempt to provide short-term results for their own careers and political parties it's just never acted that way is uh 2021 when there was just ludicrous stimulus for no [ __ ] reason didn't Bitcoin just take off yes but so did the rest of the equity markets I don't think there's ever been a period of extended period of time where the equity markets have done poorly and Bitcoin has done well and that's sort of the issue is that and this is what we've learned in basically every major crash scenario is that there's no such thing as an uncorrelated asset when things are falling apart and the reason there's no such thing as an uncorrelated asset is because there's almost nobody that singularly holds one asset everyone has a portfolio and when you have a portfolio and everything else is going down then you actually still you rebalance right you sell the goods you sell the stuff that's going up by the stuff that's going down to rebalance and so what that leads to is that leads to just everything going down and even then it might not be that you're rebalancing it might be that you're meeting margin calls it might be that you're getting [ __ ] somewhere and you need to you need to save yourself so the issue is that if the equity markets continue down then Bitcoins in my personal opinion still in big trouble and yes we might get to a spot in the future where you have Bitcoin go up against the equity markets going down because people genuinely genuinely are worried about the stability of the dollar and the stability of the financial system and then and then people buy Bitcoin but that's a that's a reason to about that's a reason to own Bitcoin 100K calls that's a reason to own like Bitcoin 200k calls because I guarantee you the moment that that happens the moment that that happens bitcoin's going to 150k in a short period of time not a long period of time because in the situation where can you imagine the situation where everything is down 10% and Bitcoin is up 20 that's going to create the biggest fomo in the history of fomo I mean if if I were Sor and I had Giga billions of dollars to deploy into the Bitcoin market and I could move the price of Bitcoin or support the price of Bitcoin that's like I don't understand why he buys when he does it makes no sense it's like he always buys at the worst possible times it seems what I like I would always an only buy during periods of stress so that Bitcoin can always out like always looks like it out performs to the downside and then you create this image of image of stability um s if you're listening to this when it gets released let me know I can I can consult for you for one Bitcoin an hour you're going to make a lot you're going to make a lot more money you just listen to a few pieces of advice promise you you know it's it's just it's just one of those things again where um you know I am I'm definitely nervous for the short term mostly mostly for alts I'm not you know if Bitcoin trades down to 45 from here that's got that's got to be a low I think that at 45 people would look at that and they would say to themselves well this is a great risk reward trade if Trump is going to get elected president and he loves Bitcoin and Bitcoin just sold off almost 50% from the highs you know maybe I should probably buy right I think that's what going to go through people's heads at that point so I think that the Trump narrative the Trump announcement what he was talking about gives a Bitcoin a floor in a way that you never really had floor before so I'm I'm definitely I'm I you know I definitely go all in at that level not Financial advice yeah I mean me too but I think it's harder to do that with alts right like because alts okay let's say you let's say you get to that level in Bitcoin and then you look at your favorite alts and you're thinking okay well you know there's two ways of looking at it one is like well okay I I want some cycle bags I'm going to add here another is like okay I think we're going to get a bounceback let me pick the highest beta thing the problem with the with picking alts for a bounceback is that if you're wrong unlike Bitcoin those alts could go down another 90% right and then when you finally do get your rebound maybe you don't even make it back to your high water mark or your purchase price uh whereas Bitcoin it feels like does perform to the downside so I think alts and memes like that's that's like the catchup trade when we're already in the banana zone right when Bitcoin is sending and eth is sending and Salon is sending and alts are still like they haven't like really started to outperform yet I think once once we're in safer safer Waters that's the trade but we're just not in safe waters for at least a few months now that's clear yeah and after I think a lot of people make this mistake so this is what happened in May of 2021 in May of 2021 you get this massive collapse Bitcoin goes down 50% off the highs and for the first week when Bitcoin was ranging and going up a little bit everybody piled into alts everybody alts had a little bit of a pop and then for the next six weeks alts basically bled to zero because there's no real buyer of these things and there's inflation and when you're when there's no momentum in the market or even perceived momentum what do I mean by this well at least in the range that we had since March every two weeks there was perceived momentum to the upside even though we didn't break break out we would go up 10 15% and it looked like we might break out right like we might break out if we go up 15 if we go up 10% right now we're at resistance at the bottom of the range for Bitcoin 58 to you know 58 58 to 62 so so a lot harder because you don't actually see momentum at this point until you get to 65 which seems like a hard hard target to reach right now at least over the next two weeks because I think we're going to work through some stuff so I think alts are kind of [ __ ] but I don't think bitcoin's going anywhere again that's why there's a bull behind me is like I think it's very possible that we trade 60k in the next week or two do I think we're gonna 65 no but do I think we're going to get a violent bounce and the next like my bet is that by Friday we've tagged 60 let's see how that plays out we could tag 60 tomorrow I mean the things traded in a 10 range in the last 24 hours this Market is so volatile um so yeah I think you're right AI I it's hard it's hard to trade these markets because when things are just like wildly whipsawing around um you you kind of lose your Edge as a discretionary click Trader you know like there's there are levels that you can achieve with a longer term Horizon but just trying to to like get in and out of stuff with this sort of insane volatility is is tough I've seen people chop themselves up on it so like my my thinking slash advice would be um if you're gonna buy or like don't don't try to buy and sell don't try to like Market make this this chop just like pick pick your direction either you're drisking or your scale in buying on levels as it goes down and then when it rallies back maybe you can sell out some of what you bought at a higher level but nothing nothing like trying to generate generate like Alpha in the midst of this chop and then go home flat when you're done that that's not going to work um huh looks like looks like the the loiterers in this chat are starting to participate here so some people this could be kind of fun maybe we should do maybe let somebody in here some so eth Mr eth 10K end of year is in here so is um somebody wrote Avi is a cutie for real no homo um why why don't we let an eth 10K end of year just add them to the oh no they don't have their mic connected should we add in Nexus let's this like I don't think I don't think we should add any of these people in to be completely honest okay cool what what if they what if they get in here and they just uh you know sh Shi their own bags and then I have to like if somebody shs your bag I have to buy it and it's like a whole thing it cause issues yeah this dude wrote you are risking ear rape sir don't do it okay yeah we're definitely not letting that guy in um yeah it's kind of like that NEX that Nexus guy's pretty smart because he's he's warning us not to do it so he's a smart guy yeah exactly CU I was thinking this could be like this may be past your time Mai but like when I was a kid I used to listen to radio shows where they would just let in random callers then occasionally you get like a really crazy one and it was kind of funny you know you know what maybe maybe we should start doing that in like the last five minutes of the podcast we'll just let in a random dude like I'll I'll tweet out I'll tweet out the link for like five minutes see who feels and then we'll just let in a random person yeah we should just do that and hopefully they don't go on some like crazy Rampage actually sound pretty fun but going back to the markets for a second I was just checking some of the data the last time that we had this much open interest on bitcoin was when Bitcoin was 44k there's kind of no leverage in the system right now relatively and that to me indicates that we're in a very very good position to start going up if I were to bet there are actually quite a few shorts that have entered in entered in the market and this is again why I'm bullish I'm bullish for that 60k 60k setup it's one you have vix at vix tag 65 vix is at 38 that's insane uh especially given the way that the market the market has traded what that indicates to me is that people are really really really really fearful and the fear doesn't actually the price action right and so what that tells me again is that these people are probably quick to buy back uh if things if things start going their way however there's a lot of Supply that's underwater and so when we go up to levels like 60k people are going to start offloading so it's just going to chop also you got to be careful with that open interest number because a lot of it is against like a lot of it is Basis you have people's short CME Futures versus long spot or long ETFs and basis was positive for quite some time meaning Futures traded at a premium to spot so you it's just like risk-free Arbitrage to be long spot and short Futures and then on sell-offs that basis collapses and the Arbitrage goes away so then what happens is people get out of their Futures oi goes lower and on the other side of that equation people exit spot and exit ETFs and that's why you know you probably you know on on the 2nd of August which would have been last Friday um the Bitcoin ETF space saw $240 Million worth of outflows some of that was probably just like straight up Delta one selling everybody getting out of their Bitcoin to me I actually I I I I interpret it differently everything that you said is correct but the way that I interpret it is that in December the last time so the last time that we had this much open interest was in December 23 it's been 8 months since then and the ETFs have traded billions and billions and billions of dollars of volume and so the amount of people running that basis trade has probably gone up substantially so the fact that we are at the same levels of open interest that we were back then indicates to me that there's way less leverage in the system than there was even at 45k back in December because in theory the substantial portion of that basis should now be or substantial portion of that open interest should be basis so even though it's the same number and you might say there's the same level of Leverage I actually take what you said and I say there's l in the smart I agree with you is grown yeah no that makes complete sense that's that's really good take so the way that again the way that I view this is that everyone that was going to get blown out has been blown out there's nobody left to blow out the only people that are left to sell this asset are the people that are going to slowly get out of their positions because they think it's over which there are probably some they're idiots and they're dumb and don't deserve to live well there's also don't don't forget like if equities there are plenty of people who can still get out of the stock market right and if the stock market keeps puking lower there's probably some correlation alos that'll take Bitcoin down with it um but that's a second we talking about jump for a second yeah yeah let's talk about jump these guys liquidated their whole basically like all of their eth they liquidated their their entire portfolio spook the whole Market is that confirmed or like is it confirmed that jump unw their portfolio or is it just like some guys are looking at nanson and saw that a jump wallet got out of eth but like who knows what's on the other side of that trade like maybe they were selling eth to buy Zin I don't know I'm I'm making [ __ ] up but I mean are we are we certain that jump is out we're not certain but I mean they've definitely been winding down their activity as far as I understand it and they definitely did sell some they they were uh you know I I I do I do think that they sold some at least and this is again coming coming from wallet movements coming from Price action uh coming from the inability to candidly get in touch with them yeah I mean there there are rumors flying all over the marketplace like I'm not going to allege anything specific related to jump but like mustache Warrior disappears um from the jump leadership team there are investig s left and right involving mustache Warrior uh suddenly their eth wallet um is uh you know has been seen liquidating an insane amount of eth in what what seems like a particularly sloppy type fashion you wouldn't expect that out of a high frequency Trading Company now I mean I worked at a jump competitor so I you know there's no love between me and jump but um you know I it just seems like kind of an unceremonious end to what in 20 21 was like one of the most interesting and Polished stories not just in crypto but in in the entire world of trading I mean these are the guys that were rumored to have made somewhere between eight and 10 billion dollars on U [ __ ] coinery in 20121 and now it's it seems like it's all just kind of ground to a halt like the crypto space everyone everyone's feeling that Jonah I think you talk basically I would wager based on my conversations with all of the major funds in the space that 80% are down year to date which is which is funny the [ __ ] is that possible bitcoin's still up like 35% on the year eth is up like five to 10% it's it's because it's because they all most of them weren't allocated to Bitcoin in the way that they were supposed to be and what ends up happening when you are lagging your benchmark Mar is you rotate into the higher higher risk higher beta assets and so what ended up happening is that over time during that entire rally you had portfolio shift from Majors to alts and alts are down tremendously I mean most of them have retraced if or not below we've been warning about this again and again like I took I took personal heat for this for this call like we've specifically been saying like stay out of that stuff it's it's toxic in environments like sideways chop or worse this you know dude arbitrum is below FTX loads it's 30% below FTX loads like imagine just the paint imagine the pain of being such an idiot you would hold that and also like arbitrum is it's not vaporware like it's it's a you know if you go if you go a little bit into the weeds like it's a good it's one it's like basically that and bass are the two performant l2s that that you want to be part of yeah I mean look it's good it's good Tech but it's not used at the end of the day and that's that's what matters I mean if you look at my again just going back to what I was saying at the beginning if you look at my portfolio it's you know the the the three the three Majors probably going to pick up some some coin stock I think coin's good a good bet yeah that's like buying Bas if Bas had a token you you know except it does it's called coinbase stock that's a great trade helium's actually up 10% today which is which is really great that's encouraging yeah I mean you know things that actually have usage but basically everything else I mean I closed most of my shitcoin shorts I mean like just going through the short basket Aptos Tia alt Arkham ethi ID say suie starware World coins I not again not Financial advice but these were the ones that I thought had really bad unlock schedules and we're just we're just gonna just going to bleed out I've close all of them no longer short those assets also if jump were liquidating like they would be selling that stuff right like there jump an organization like jump I don't know what what their bags look like but something tells me they don't just have like a couple of line items they're probably long like hundreds of different tokens including all the ones you just mentioned so yet another if they're sloppily selling eth in the most visible possible way again all this is speculation have no idea what they're actually doing like it would be overwhelmingly likely that they're also just blasting out of uh other things that are not only like worse bets fundamentally but also less liquid so when they get when somebody sells uh you know they'll puke harder yes sir uh the other thing that I think was spooking a lot of people but I actually don't think spooked the market it was just in all the group chats because it's fun to talk about it was this whole Israel Iran thing I don't think it's relevant to the markets personally I'm not worried about that the oil Market doesn't doesn't care about it I think that it's very clear that Iran just wants to again do a saber rattle scare scare Israel talk to talk to a lot of friends of mine that live in Israel in the IDF and in intelligence and they're not no nobody's freaking out the oil Market's nuking right now like it's it's trading like Bitcoin it's basically kening lower and literally today Libya which is you know a sizable oil producer one of their major oil fields called Shara just like went out because the warlord in charge of it um my second favorite Libyan warlord General Khalifa haftar he uh you know he's in some sort of dispute with the locals there so he shut this massive oil field oil just nuked like like oil is shrugging off all of this geopolitical risk and and that pretty much tells you which uh which Market is driving price action right now it's it's it's risk assets it's not it's not the Middle East geopolitical uh scene setup um that could change rapidly I just don't think it will anyway we have a few questions here this is actually we should invite more people in yes is great we have like a Q&A Jonah dude I'm farming volume on polym market right now who's your pick for 2024 for election winner hook me up Jonah who's your pick I think Trump's going to win and this isn't a political statement of support for anybody this is literally just like I think these guys are lay the Republicans are laying a trap for Cala Harris I think that they're just letting her letting her have her moment and uh she's gonna have her honeymoon period and her convention and then um as soon as she locks the nomination like if they if they if they try to take big shots at her right now she might not get the nomination but I think she's perceived internally in the Republican party as a weak candidate so they want her to run against Trump and I think as soon as she gets the nomination and she's locked in I think I think all kinds of horrendous stuff is gonna just rain from the sky and torture chances of winning so I think we're seeing Pete Kamala here what do you think Obby 100% agree with that in every way shape of form him I think that Kamala the Kamala candidacy reminds me a lot of DeSantis in that in the beginning he had all this momentum all this hype everyone you know everyone loved him on the Republican side blah this blah blah that and the reality is he's just not a viable candidate because he's a little he's weird he's uncomfortable and Trump just has the hearts and minds of the Republican party and he's a great political candidate you ever listen have you ever heard Cala say anything smart ever no no and me saying that Kamala is gonna lose have you ever heard her do anything that would indicate to you that she's a good political candidate no no she like she flamed out so hard in the Democratic primaries and just got bailed out because candidly she was the right profile for a candidate that you know Biden needed at the time for VP she's not a good politician she's a terrible politician and at the end of the day I don't think somebody like that can win no matter how hard they try to push her so I think this moment and that's fine but that's actually a good setup for end of year for BTC I mean I I don't see why we can't end the Year back at back at the highs if I mean if Trump gets elected which I think he will because as long as we don't through the highs as long as we don't have World War II and Trump is elected and the market hasn't completely [ __ ] itself in terms of equities even if it has gone down a bit it's very good right that's a very very good setup for pick oh it's huge I mean I think we could end up we could end up you know not Financial advice I think I think Bitcoin could easily be trading 100K e could be 5K if Trump wins right in the middle of November no eth eth 100K or sorry BTC 100K eth 3K okay fine whatever whatever you want eth was just trading 3K recently but I mean let's just let's just let's just keep our let's keep our pants on here AI 3K sure uh my point is like this isn't hopium that me saying that Trump is going to win like again I don't really have I'm not I'm not trying to come out with a political endorsement or or affiliation on the on the podcast here I'm more just saying like if I legitimately thought Cala had a decent chance I would be slashing my Bitcoin exposure right now I would be I I would be reducing it and I think that that's what you're seeing in Mar in at least in crypto and a lot of markets I think as kamala's odds are are you know sort of rallying on poly Market I think a lot of people who had these Trump trades that they were putting on that they felt really confident are suddenly like wait a second oh hell this is bad right like I gotta I got I gotta pull some some dough off the table here while I'm still up on the year um it's it's yeah I I think Trump's got this one in the bag unless he either gets shot or or really manages to blow it for himself which I don't think he's doing uh somebody asked me to give one bullish single narrative for Ethan until end of year [Music] that's I mean you know the most bullish narrative I can think of is that I can't think of a bullish narrative it's so hated right it's like it's so hated that I can't think of like a real bu like all the bullish narratives I'm sort of pulling out of my ass uh I mean they're not completely out of my ass and they actually were talked about by chiefing on the previous podcast but people people view crypto as an asset class and because there's an e ETF and and a Bitcoin ETF once people start allocating to crypto again which probably happens in September it's likely that they also buy ethereum and ethereum is a lot less liquid than Bitcoin which could lead to price appreciation for ethereum the other thing is it's again is we've talked about Ed nauseum it's easier for Wall Street to understand so the only the only real bullish narrative for ethereum is that it's B basically is added to the S&P of crypto is the equivalent of adding you know stock to the S&P now it gets all the passive flows but I I mean there's there's no real interesting activity going on on eth in my personal opinion there's no real interesting projects that are building on eth all the most poly market right isn't poly Market on polygon which is on eth no not not not really I mean kind I think a polygon is an L2 but that you know there there they're moving away like when you put when you put usdc on poly market like you're not doing that via SPL you're doing it on like a sort of an ERC transfer the only the only thing that I can think of is that e is just horrifically under allocated relative to BTC that's it that that's that that's literally that's literally it unfortunately yeah my my ethb narrative is is that it's literally like it has a huge OTE which is that it's the smart the granddaddy smart contract platform that Legacy business can get their head around and not get fired for using if you if you if you're like if your legacy business like you know trafi or web 2 and you start doing crypto stuff and you choose aptose and you get worm hold and lose all your money or you get you know mustache Warrior um mustache Warrior accidentally like loses it you know you get fired but if you lose it on eth like you know you're playing it safe madic $3 and of dude this no no no way mad's no go to three if mad is at $3 by the end of the year you can have my spot on this podcast I'll give madx madic may never see $2 ever again I never did don't want to sh my backs but what do you think about the a fee switch proposal I have no idea whether it's going through or not I don't know uh the answer is that it would be Giga bullish obviously because it would be the first real productive defi asset that actually has a real product it's actually generating real Revenue that is actually tying its token to the revenue stream but I don't i' I've got no clue I mean it's very possible that goes nowhere I mean if it goes somewhere then a probably goes that's my guess so we'll see it's a deal um I think it's probably worth the issue is it's like hard to say it's even worth owning because I think a lot of the recent price action has been because people are starting to buy it in anticipation that it might go through and if it doesn't go like if it doesn't actually work get implemented effectively then it's probably just [ __ ] so anyway that's that that's my take I do I do like I do like defi though because I think that I think that people are going to look for look for like real productive assets ens actually looks kind of interesting retrace the entire move uh from May all the way back so your bearish eth but bullish ens what yeah I mean because because there are some you don't have to be bullish the platform to be bullish one product right I I I probably need bullish for a trade or like bullish for a cycle bullish for a trade a a bullish for recycle if they turn on the fee switch but I think that the the issue is that you need more than one or two applications and I like a and I like ens and I don't really like anything else e so kind of hard to maintain my bullishness I do like AR still uh I think that ar ar is good I think that the AI narrative is going to come back at some point and that you can probably build a portfolio of these AI coins but you got to be again just a little bit careful um yeah yeah I mean my my my my bullishness is fir firmly shifted towards Soul at BTC well on that note we got a comment in here after jump leaving crypto feels like they're going to leave a vacuum in the soul Eco Soul Ecco te scene so my take on that is salana does not need jump they did a great job surviving the FTX collapse I think they're going to be just fine without jump um I I don't think that salana I think salana is doing a great job overcoming The Narrative that it's just this Mafia of insiders uh controlling things and I think that shedding jump from their ecosystem is actually a great thing because uh as a Trader I never understood why anyone would want to use like basically use a blockchain that's supposed to be open permissionless and decentralized where the entire validator client ecosystem is designed by a highfrequency trading company whose literal business model is to see your transactions before they hit the market and front run you right that's kind of how I've always perceived fire dancer now toly knows more than me about how Salo Works obviously and shot that down on our podcast with him but I'm still suspicious and I think that like just in terms of getting the uh just just getting the sort of like overhang of that possibility out of the way um jump and jump in its mustache Warrior Army uh being gone is probably it probably does does wonders for the salana ecosystem it probably gets everybody a little bit more confident that it's this decentralized open- Source Linux like project unless this like sort of um Sinister Casino where you come in and and you're wooed with free drinks and you end up losing your your money in there um you know uh transaction after transaction just getting bled away into into jumps coffers guys it's a pleasure thanks for spending to scan the picture that I tweeted out and look for a link and then manually I guess could probably I think you copy and paste on my phone if any of you manually manually typed it in that's pretty sick appreciate it this was this was a great episode I kind of like having a um like having people in here listening in and and chatting with us this is great we should we should probably do this in the future yes we should oh somebody said L this format you should keep doing with the chat yeah we probably should the only is the only sometimes I say really stupid things and I ask them to edit it out whoever listens to this podcast is going to realize that we do no preparation this is our job our jobs are the prep we like spend every day doing this and then we just come out here and talking about it this is this is true trading floor [Music] chat all right see you Jonah see you later time [Music]

we cannot understate the importance of the world's preeminent superpower a a nation's state with basically unlimited resources um backing our space as opposed to actively trying to fight our space like uh like white blood cells fight a virus so I think if KLA wins we're going to see a big dispersion trade we're going to see Bitcoin outperform everything else in the crypto asset space like crazy Bitcoin dominance is going to go up all these other tokens like you're going to see a lot of people throwing in the towel meanwhile if Trump wins like we might see tokenized equity on the NASDAQ like it it could it could get there pretty quick this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance the onchain defi primitive redesigning derivatives for the defi native you'll hear more about perennial later in the [Music] show welcome back to another episode of THX Market Market is currently dying uh which is honestly to be expected at this point I'm sorry we didn't record before the the the Trump announcement uh but basically that was possibly the most telegraphed thing I've seen in a very long time you had 30,000 coins added to open interest in the week leading up to his speech at Nashville and so obviously kind of no matter what he said short of I'm buying billions of dollars of Bitcoin it was the market was going to sell off the good news is that as far as I can tell we're pretty close to the end I think that there's there's an unwind happening right now because people are getting out and there was a lot of there's too much excitement going into this but we're almost totally Unwound uh eth is finally doing well eth BTC eth BTC is up because I think it's slowly running out of Sellers and the eth outflows have actually outpaced the gbtc outflows pretty significantly and salana is still holding up quite nicely I mean we almost tagged 200 and you know we're we're back down we're back down at 178 but once this unwind happens we are in a pretty good position uh I'm going to be very you know beating the the bull drums I know I got my bear behind me right now you're in the Bear's Lair I'm in the Bears Den [Laughter] but I'm going to be beating the drums of a bull pretty soon uh for the last you know I was I was sweating so hard because I think we were we were short around 68 685 got up to 69 70k and I was like dude there's no way there's no way that this is sustainable but I was sweating for a bit now we're good yeah I mean I I I we're just banging around in Bitcoin in this like tight little range kind of 60 bit at 70 or maybe 56 bit at 74 if you want to zoom out a little bit it's it's a wide range in percentage terms and I think most traders in most asset classes would be delighted with that sort of amplitude but we in the crypto world man nothing nothing really gets us excited if it isn't a 100% instant gratification rally like Face Ripper rally and we're not getting it um yeah I think you know what you just said is really important you said that short of trump saying he was going to buy billions of dollars of Bitcoin on some sort of regular basis the market was going to sell off that's absolutely right I I would put a little asterisk there and say RFK actually came out and said he was gonna do that um if only if only there's a lot of things he would do if his uh if he were in the obal office r i mean RFK is kind of irrelevant and the dude said had a brainworm I mean you can't really elect a guy that said he had a brainworm actually I I loved it I just thought that in in the crazy world we live in like why not why not why not vote for somebody who's being controlled by an alien space worm like in Men In Black anyway that was a tangent like you're right Trump trump would have had to come out and announce what RFK announced in order for the market to keep going and it's funny like when I was at Cumberland uh you know there was there was always somebody on the team who who would be like oh um so and so is gonna speak at breakpoint like we should buy salana or oh they're going to talk about render at this conference we should buy render and then you know more recently it was like oh Ilia is gonna talk to Jensen at the Nvidia conference we should buy near and honestly like these trades just don't work I they're not they're not good trades like the Thematic trade here is crypto is about to go parabolic I believe that for a number of different reasons um but the near-term trade or sorry not the near-term the trade of the last basically six months that would have made you money is just buy when it dips and sell when it pops just keep trading just like range trading the problem with that trade is that no participant who's still in crypto is a range Trader like every single crypto person who's left standing right now as a momentum Trader they if you trade ranges in crypto you you miss these big blowoff tops and you get nuked in 2022 and you're dead and you're you're out of the market so yeah we have a market of momentum Traders getting chopped up in this range buying high and selling low and so I guess it pays to range trade but the question is for how much longer seems like you know with the giant bear behind you Obi looks like you are still range trading but soon you're gonna yeah I mean I think it's important to be able to switch your bias this in this asset class I mean I go from being a momentum Trader to a range Trader I think I've said this 150 times at this point but there are two ways that I look at Bitcoin and I look at crypto in general and when I'm thinking about how do you buy it it's is there momentum or is there value right and what you have to understand is most people just stick to the momentum side but the value side is actually where you make the most money right so the question is at the price of Bitcoin is at you Tak into context as Cala Harris says everything in which you came and before it so you have to look at coconuts take you think Bitcoin just fell out of a coconut tree no you have to look at the previous price action so basically if there wasn't sub substantial momentum heading into that move kind of hard to kind of hard to buy it and when I look at Bitcoin basically since uh March 5th of this year or you know I guess it topped out on March 13th there's no Trend right there it's just sideways and so it's kind of hard in this type of Market environment you just you can't buy the breakouts you kind of have to buy the value levels right and the value levels are bottom of the range they're sub they're sub 60 or they're mid-range maybe you can buy mid-range for a bounce right 63 but it's really tough to buy top of the range betting that momentum will occur because it has a been momentum so you kind of either have to wait to accumulate your positions lower or you have to buy a true breakout of the range above 72 um which is why again when it traded 70 the other day it just didn't really make sense to buy it because it's just not the market environment to it's just not the market environment to to to bet to better momentum you have to you have to you have to be careful and so my you know my view the reason I have a bear behind me is that uh you know we we just had you know a huge huge huge event which is at the former president of the United States Alto who is current according to current betting odds most likely to become president again voiced extreme support for BTC and BC's down and I think this right so yeah yeah it's you have to you have to wait so what I think this event did you know Trump coming out in support of BTC it set a floor and what do I mean by that people are going to be more comfortable buying Bitcoin when it's scary to buy Bitcoin now because of what Trump said they're going to have some some level of comfort buying BTC in a way that they didn't that they didn't before because if the you know former president endorses it basically says I think it's going to be worth more than gold one day then you want to buy value you want to buy blood especially since the former president if he becomes the next president can announce a strategic Bitcoin Reserve which is you know we can talk about this there's yet another parallel with the oil market and how that works uh it's it's you're you're right and you know what you know what else is crazy in terms of setting the floor Obi um the other stuff that's going on right now like the technicals these two seconds are very bearish like as soon as Trump spoke at the Bitcoin conference I think a day or two went by not much time before um the Democrats in charge of of these offices moved two yards worth of Silk Road Bitcoin to you know a centralized exchange to basically sell so you have that and you have these um you know just massive outflows from the eth ETFs kind of the opposite technical effect of the Bitcoin so the Bitcoin launch so basically you have like bearish technicals you've been trading sideways the market should be fragile and yet it's kind of not like higher lows what we're seeing let's wait uh I mean I don't know I think the market has been you know there there some segments of the market that have been okay A lot of salon and beta has performed well uh and Salon itself is you know obviously performed well up until up until the last two days Bitcoin itself I think has been remarkably fragile I mean yeah salul BTC is on the highs of the year right now it's uh 0.0027 it it it was there in um it was there in March during M Mania and then it sunk back down but now it's right back to the highs sana's Teflon right now I think I think that strength is going to continue what do you think about what do you think about eth and and the ratio here I mean the eth ETF has been really really depressing yeah I mean basically what I think about eth goes back to what we were talking about I think eth is a trump trade and here's why I think that what matters isn't like who wins the El like let's talk about what actually impacts the price of eth what I think impacts the price of eth is is will there be regulatory Clarity under the next Presidential Administration for crypto assets or will the current like you know Paradigm of let's let's just throw a wrench in their plans and keep kicking the can down the road the Gensler the Gensler way will that continue so basically regulatory Clarity yes or no basically what I did was I when I when I like to put on macro trades I always like to try and work out a just probability u tree so Trump is at 60% on poly Market let's call Kamala at 40% under Trump I assume that an SEC overhaul is 95% likely under comma I assumed it's like 25% likelihood and then for each of those like SEC overhaul yes no like if there's a new SEC for you know with each in each scenario I assume I basically cuffed some probabilities for regulatory Clarity very high under a trump SEC overhaul you know still high under a comma SEC overhaul very low if comma doesn't overhaul the SEC and then I basically just like put price scenarios for Bitcoin Ethan salana on each of those sort of like SEC overhaul probabilities and I came up with some forecasts and basically that's it's not it's not an exact science but it's something to lean on when a trade is going in your face you know you can look at these little spreadsheets that you made and see if the assumptions still make sense and basically what I came up with is like if if the SEC finally gives a measure of clarity to builders and projects on what is and isn't a security and immediately like snap your fingers overnight eth and salana are the protocol layers for the internet of value like massive massive massive upside like fin slow stayed financial institutions will probably stick with eth because it's stable and they don't need like high performant blockchains because they're working with [ __ ] Swift and anything is better than t plus2 five days a week right um eth is way better than that even though it's not salana and then salana you know is like a micro payments infrastructure thing that could turn into something huge stable coins you know faster value movement all this other stuff so like suddenly a whole world like a whole internet of value becomes viable once um financial institutions and web 2 companies can reassure their employees and and their management and their shareholders that they're not going to get sued by the SEC for doing their thing in crypto and that's why I think if we get stuck with another G four years of Gensler or you know Gensler 2.0 eth eth is is going to be absolute trash um it's just going to it's going to underperform it's going to look the way that xrp looked after its big you know time in the sun meanwhile uh if we get a new regulatory Paradigm like all the pipes have been built institutions can just light up eth and they're ready to and they will um that's that's what I think about eth what what do you think yeah I think that's I think that's fair I think this is at the end of the day for for better For Better or For Worse it's going to take a long time for people to come in but at least the infrastructure is now built in order to do so so once people decide to allocate to eth Once people decide to allocate to BTC it's going to be easy to do I think there's still a lot of uncertainty because as as you said you had to build a spreadsheet out for this right like will there be SEC overhaul will the US be friendly towards crypto will the US be friendly towards you know applications built and the answer so far is no um and so you need to see if Trump gets elected you need to see what happens if Cala actually switches or stance otherwise you're looking at a lot of uncertainty and I don't think there are enough people left that are willing to buy an uncertain Market I think basically everyone out you know if you look at the numbers of who owns crypto in the US it's pretty massive 50 million people substantial portion of the people that invest in the stock market also own crypto right and so the way that I view it is is it's about the level of allocation and Retail and your average person probably is already reasonably fully allocated I don't know how how much more as a percent of portfolio your average person is going to increase their Bitcoin Holdings so it's really about the family offices of the world the institutions of the world the big money of the world and they're not going to deal with uncertainty very well so that that that that's my that's my view yeah I think that's a good view I mean ultimately like the the I think what needs to be underlined here is that you have a lot of Institutions family offices bigger pools of capital like yeah like you said the retail Deens are either in or they're out um by now but you know like let's just take the pool of family offices um or you know even even like basic hedge fund strategies that touch crypto those guys are all ready to go they just don't want to get sued they they so if if gets fired if Trump starts buying Bitcoin if there's a new crypto-friendly regulatory framework those I think they they're ready to pull the trigger I really do I don't think it's going to be like 2021 where we were all sitting here like the institutions are coming maybe but we don't know when like they're all they're all ready um they will show up the second they know they're they're not going to face legal risk and family offices too right nobody wants to because like if you're a family office and you want to get involved in crypto your concern isn't getting sued your concern is like does your qualified custodian uh support Bitcoin does your Bank of New York melon does your JP Morgan like can they custody your coin um I think family offices are like if I had to guess my gut feeling is that family offices are behind the spectacular inflows into the Bitcoin ETFs like ibit because custody is not an issue there but I think you'll start to see I think you'll start to see more adventurous uh younger wealthy techie types uh directing their family offices to go out the risk curve and buy other tokens riskier tokens once they know that they can get solid custody and they're not going to get worm hold um you know it's it's it's all it's all like either contingent upon institutional Clarity or it's like institutional adjacent stuff like custody and lending and all the other things that you want to do with with a coin to make it more Capital efficient yeah I mean the capital efficiency is actually actually key and one thing that I hope will happen with the eth ETF as well which will allow people to buy more eth is that if you can borrow against these things then you're good you're you're good to go um so the way that I'm currently thinking about the the E ETF and like when do you want to buy a ton of eth BTC is when you start to get that leveling out of the E flows and when you actually take a look e is being drained a lot faster than gbtc was be was being drained and so I think that that selloff a full selloff underneath has probably already has probably already happened and what we're what we're waiting for now is we're just waiting for the last little bit to to to drain to drain out uh we actually the news on the EF was sold a lot faster so we went down 17.3% in four days I think the BTC ETF news trade bottomed on day 12 so I think the Market's just getting more efficient at pricing the E Trade I that probably would is going what happen with salana Once uh once it happens and then BC proceeded to rip 92% in 50 days post so I'm uh I'm I'm of the mindset that you we we can uh probably see a pretty strong performance from eth over the next you know I'd call it mid August is when I'd be when I'd start to turn pretty bullish on eth I mean I agree with you tactically but I think that it's important to note that eth eth was never like this Benchmark uh important trust in the space right like it was always the the sort of redheaded stepchild of gbtc gbtc had like tens of billions of dollars of AUM it was this massive trade where you could like create it and then sell it at a premium versus the Bitcoin that you had in there and it was this Arbitrage and it would like dominated news flow back in the previous cycle and it was like this massive thing that then entangled a bunch of people three arrows Capital exploded on it they pledged it as collateral as part of the F FTX estate it was like this big story and this big macro asset and this big way for people to you know retail people to buy Bitcoin in their 401K seven years ago now like eth never had that cache right eth was I think eth was just a way for degens like us to you know basically replicate the gbtc discount trade on a shortened time frame and so the rapid outflows right now aren't that surprising it isn't it isn't like something that's as sticky as gbtc was so I don't I don't know if I'm as bullish as you are based on like price action um mirroring what Bitcoin did post gbtc Bitcoin uh ETF approvals but you you might be right I mean I think I'm bullish for other reasons there there is one other bigas Reon that I didn't bring up that I'm I'm bullish uh both eth and Bitcoin and and also salana to some extent which is again I I do think that Trump is going to get elected um I do think his odds are being undervalued by poly market right now and one thing that he's going to do both he and kamla will do whoever wins is probably devalue the dollar right Trump wants to do it as a mechanism for trade uh basically to make our exports appear more you know cheap and and and uh you know good value to foreign consumers because he's obviously a he's he's obsessed with trade balances or imbalances um so weaker dollar means uh Stronger Bitcoin and the other one with Kamala just to finish the thought very quickly and then I'll I'll stop rambling uh Kamala I think if she wins we can expect a repeat of the Joe Biden uh stimulus orgasm of of 2021 where it's just like we're going to print trillions to pay off student debt we're going to print trillions to you know do social social welfare type stuff like you know preschool and after school care and that kind of stuff like you just just wait for the printing machine to start humming and and that like bitcoin's a great debasement hedge as well when you think about the election people got really excited when Kamala got installed and I think there were some polls that came out out saying that she was leading leading Trump the reality is that politics and markets and life work in a very similar predictable pattern which is that whatever the most recent thing to happen is is the most important thing in people's minds you saw this with the Trump assassination people were talking about it oh my God Trump got shot this is going to change everything this is going to change Politics the world is going to change and it's a few weeks later and nobody's talking about it Cala you know Joe Biden steps down and Cala steps up this is new this is fresh this is exciting in two weeks people are going to forget that this was this crazy event that happened that Joe Biden stepped down right and this was encapsulated somebody on Twitter I saw a funny post talked about the President Garfield's assassination and they said this this will be taught in history books from for years to come this was an insane event we America will never forget this tragedy and now I bet you like 75% of people don't even know this guy right President Garfield is isn't Garfield an orange cat who's Garfield who's President Garfield Andrew Andrew Garfield never heard of him exactly yeah so James Garfield sorry James Garfield 20th president of the United States was assassinated on September 19th 1881 the shooting occurred less than four months into his term as president actually that's kind of crazy oh shot yeah that's a real bummer four months didn't last very long anyway long story short is that every event that you think is going to be life-changing every event that you think is going to impact your your life for an extended period of time everything that you think is going to you know every event where you're just like oh my God I can't believe this happened I almost guar to you it will fade into irrelevancy which is kind of nuts to think about but it just happens so often I mean like think of right think of all the announcements that seemed like huge in the moment that that in hindsight are no longer that big right Elon Musk selling Bitcoin off of his balance sheet in May yeah I catalyzed some shell off but then two months later we were right back to where we were before and Elon loved Bitcoin again right and so you have all these things that happen um that don't really impact price in the in the long run they impact it in the short run so that's not to Discount what just happened that's just to say you know don't don't overestimate the impact of these events uh the world the world tends to just go in a s in a direction and Trump my personal opinion is the better candidate than Cala and so despite the fact that she got a recent boost I think he still probably wins I think he wins too I mean okay so when I talk about Trump trades I'm talking about like episodic macro themes right and the probability waiting of those things Catalyst trading is like oh I'm going to buy because elon's going to go appear on SNL oh I'm going to buy near because Ilia is going to talk with Jensen at their conference right I'm not I'm a terrible Catalyst Trader I think I'm a decent episodic macro Trader and I I personally am am I am a momentum Trader and so the way that I avoid killing myself during these periods of chop where it's like oh some bullish catalysts come up and we rally up to 70k and then some bearish Catalyst send us back to 65 is I stop trading and then in you know like in big moves I do okay or if I get it dead wrong I'll just get out of the market and sit on the sidelines for a while and then get back in when when the price is more in my favor um and the risk reward is better but like I'm a macro Trader a macro momentum Trader you seem like you you have this ability as as a more active guy to kind of switch back and forth between range Trader and momentum Trader so are you looking for a theme no it's it's just it's being it's just being it's just being a crypto Trader I think because you unless you know if you're a crypto Trader and you want to actively trade BTC and eth you have to build that skill set you have to know when is time to set and forget and you have to know when it's time to pay attention and this is just by virtue of you get it after a while when is Bitcoin trending when is eth trending when are these assets trending is a very you know it can be subjective and you just have to understand and you know what to look for in these in these certain types of in these certain types of situations I mean it's it's actually I'll give you an example when you're looking at Bitcoin and on a one week time Horizon I'm staring at the onewe chart uh and then I stare at the four four hour chart and then I stare at the hour chart and then I stare at the five minute chart basically every micro dip gets Boughton up when every $100 goes down and then boom gets swallowed and that's been happening for a week straight that's momentum right and that's what kind of kind of what happened in October of last year if you look at the period of time from Tuesday October 24th to you know November 24th which is about a month period of time there was a full month where every dip would just get slurped what do you call that dogee a downward dangling dogee I have no idea but every every dip would just immediately get eaten up uh and you never actually had like a trend down for for any extended period of time that to me signals that you should just stick long and just wait until you get a crazy blowoff which we which we ended up doing right and so you know there are all these different tips and tricks so are they slurping it right now I mean you watch you watch this thing tick for tick what's going on here no they're selling it a lot of sellers in this market uh which is again why I have the bear here I'm still I'm still pretty bearish I think that you know from here I'm not going to get crazy along unless we trade 63 so you know like right now at 65 850 Bitcoin is pretty bad Tech I think that it's really slow and and block sizes are too small uh at when it trades 63 and I will reverse my opinion um okay so I'm avoiding this range trading because I don't watch the market tick for tick like you do so you know to all the Traders out there who don't exhibit the Peak Performance attributes of Market focus and process that Obi just described you're probably better off um setting it and watching from the side watching your position from the sidelines rather than like just constantly getting in and out um but what I would say is I do think that while catalysts as Obi said come and go and momentum comes and goes it's really hard to understate the importance of a regulatory macroeconomic or other sort of broad-based backdrop theme and its impact on macro assets like Bitcoin and eth like for example I'll give you an example the I I keep going back to the gentler SEC like the slow grind the that sort of of like War of Attrition on crypto where the SEC just basically sandbagged it in the United States for four years that impacted a lot of people including the two of us right and it also impacted the price it delayed institutional adoption it slowed down the ETF approvals like it forced a lot of people out of the market it forced a lot of capital out of the market like these paradigms matter and they're not catalysts they're paradigms so when we're talking about Trump trades we're talking about comma trades what we're talking about is like not a catalyst an election could seem like a catalyst it's it's really what Paradigm are we going to be looking at for the next half decade and I really you know to to your point earlier in the podcast Obi I agree we cannot understate the importance of the world's preeminent superpower a a nation state with basically unlimited resources um backing our space as opposed to actively trying to fight our space like uh like white blood cells fight a virus you know and that's that's relevant so I think if KLA wins we're going to see a big dispersion trade we're GNA see Bitcoin outperform everything else in the crypto asset space like crazy Bitcoin dominance is going to go up all these other tokens like you're going to see a lot of people throwing in the towel meanwhile if Trump wins like we might see tokenized equity on the NASDAQ like it it could it could get there pretty quick and I I think you're right you can't understate the import of that yeah I mean if if we get if kensler gets fired I mean basically just make a list of everything that's under SEC investigation and this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance perennial is quickly becoming one of the go-to derivatives platforms and liquidity layers for all of defi so let me tell you a little bit about them there are kind of three things you need right when you're thinking about a place and a platform to trade on first one great trade execution second one low fees and third of course an onchain permissionless platform and perennial Nails all three of those buckets with the launch of perennial V2 they've made all of that possible by introducing a ton of new features such as faster oracles which reduce trade execution to seconds lower fees competing with major centralized exchanges and minimizing fees for both takers and makers fully modular markets which allow the protocol to to support any price feed out there and fourth cash settled right the trades are cash settled in USD not in crypto perennial allows you the trader to gain access to deeper liquidity with only a fraction of the tvl how it works is that perennial enables a two-sided Market made up of both Traders and liquidity providers right Traders deposit the assets to get leverage exposure while liquidity providers provide these pools of capital to earn fees for taking the other side of the trader position rennial allows you to trade crypto herps FX and coming soon nfts and more backed by some of the best investors in the industry perennial is a must checkout platform if you're a crypto Trader go check them out by clicking the link in the description give thousand XM credit go check out perennial you're going to love them all right let's get back to the show yeah let's talk baskets so you were talking there's an AI basket there let's that's a great basket that we should start talking about is like the which coins are being investigated by the SEC and are going to are going to just absolutely rip once Trump gets elected yeah I mean if anyone has ideas any listeners comment it below but I like I like uni a lot Lio Li's really good what else H let me think here probably it I think coinbase stock just explodes coin coinbase definitely does well like you're supposed to see coinbase's market cap converge with the CME I don't have my Bloomberg in front of me but it's it's a a number of bil it it could get weird yeah weird weird is a good word for it banana Zone def definitely definitely in the banana Zone that happens what what do you think happens to um yeah what do you think happens to coin like to the miners in a in a trump winning scenario it's a good question um the the thing about the miners is that a lot of them just a lot of them recently have been driven by things outside of BTC right so there was a they just turned into a data center trade for HBC and so it's a bit know they're I think Riot it's like the Pure Play minor um all everything else that I look at just turned into a turned into an HBC play so it's kind of hard to say I think I think it's uh I think it's cyclical like I think the miners are all focused on AI right right now because everybody's training expensive models but you don't need that kind of compute forever once all the main models have been trained and they've absorbed the entire internet and I think that you know I I didn't come up with that thesis I listen to some tech podcasts that did but like let's say that's true and let's say that bitcoin's trading 150 because because you know the United States is either buying it or printing dollars with Reckless abandon I think you see the miners like pivot back to crypto I think Ai and crypto are kind of like the two ends of the spectrum that these miners can service and they they probably will they'll just do an economic calculation and just like a Refinery will be like is it more profitable to produce diesel or jet fuel like I'm just going to switch between the two like you'll see you'll see the miners become like the mobile like the sort of like uh Nimble compute equities that can just sort of like be like refiners that produce whatever the world needs at any given time yeah I think I think that I think that makes sense and the only the only question that I always have with these uh with that specific trade is just the demand side because every research report that I take a look at talks a lot about the supply and the investment in infrastructure and then less so on the demand side it's almost like that's a given it's like yeah of course it'll be demand and so that I think is is is the only is the only danger uh with with that trade and just just just to take it back to uh what else might do well in a scenario where there's where there's more clarity basic Al anything that would do better if it was integrated with traditional Finance So Def I mean defi in general I think does extremely well I I was most bullish like in a scenario where like you just mentioned like where crypto can integrate with trafi I was thinking like oh to me the most bullish token in the world is Ando uh you know we obviously talked about it we did our little project review a while ago um but then I looked at ando's fully diluted valuation it's $10 billion Circle is about to go public at 5 billion so maybe Circle the trade like they're all these little weird adjacent trades where you could probably get a two or a three bagger if you pick it up ahead of uh ahead of a like I think I think Trump's gonna win I don't I think poly Market's wrong and the reason why I think Trump is GNA win is because I think that his campaign strategy is to slow playay all of his criticism and all of the dirt that they have on comma until basically just before the election and then he's going to dump it all out right there's no point doing it before she even gets the nomination so 100% And it's about the it's about the recency bias again right yeah exactly so like there are no secrets about Trump the guy's like getting shot on live television in the face like we know like his dirty laundry is out in the air for everyone to see meanwhile um Kamala like the country doesn't really know her yet and so if I were a Republican strategist I would tell Trump like cool the Jets until she secures the nomination and the you know the coconut brat friend stuff sort of like dies down like all episodes do and then then you know just start blasting the airwaves with um you know anti-a propaganda and getting her dirty laundry out there like that's what I expect I bet like we're going to get like a FBI Hillary emails 2.0 type thing for her and I really think she's gonna lose like I I'm willing to bet a lot of money on this and I am you know indirectly bya bya crypto like I'm pretty much all in at this point so um at this point like when that happens um you know I think I think that's I think if poly Market is underpricing it certainly like circle circle stock coinbase stock um and a bunch of different random tokens that aren't currently overvalued which is there's a lot that are overvalued so you gotta be got you gotta be choosy certain baskets of cursed tokens yeah maybe Unis swap maybe Lio maybe uh maybe even xrp like you know tokens that tokens that are getting basically teabagging by Gary Gensler will probably rally a lot you know yeah I think that's I think I think that's all all all reasonable I mean I do I do Wonder uh when when this all when this all comes to a head I mean what does the repricing look like right that's something that that's that's something that we have to we have to think about one thing that's always been clear to me is that whenever people's price targets are too low you probably just want to sell everything so the fact that people at 65k were calling for 75k with a lot of excitement makes me nervous I think you you need those 100K 150k price targets because it just tells you a lot about the psychology and mentality of people if you're asking for 75k when you're at 65k you're probably selling at 70 yeah cuz then because then the risk reward isn't isn't really in your face anymore and so at what point do people get the confidence to call for okay this is going to go to 100 this is going to go to this this this is going to go to this is going to go to 150 I mean if you look at Defi and you're thinking that these things are going to reprice if uh you know gz gzar gets fired it's like how much right what how how big how big can these things get yeah not that big I mean I think they're layups I think they're like two to five Baggers and the Thousand a are probably hiding in the um you know kind of like the Thousand to 10,000 coin by market cap right now and I I don't personally know exactly where to look yet maybe like Niche AI coins or I don't know some something with a little bit of like native traction maybe Chief was right maybe I just got to start hooking myself into the Discord fire hose of garbage and looking for those thousand X's but I I do think I do think you're like Mega cap def tokens are just like easy one to 500% returns if Trump wins I I do I I think that's like the kind of layup that you never get in trafi like if you're if you're an interest rate Trader you're never just gonna like show up and and buy something and have it double in on a relatively obvious Type move I don't know may maybe I'm oversimplifying this I don't think so I mean I I think it's also just because you get to you get to front run those flows because once the Market opens up the flows will come that's a that that that to that to me is a is is is an no-brainer other than that I mean kind of in the market not too much that is crazy interesting to me I mean I was looking at you know was trying to get a handle on dpin uh because helium was trading extremely well over the last uh over the last week and basically off the bottom was one of the was one of the best performers noticed that it was just getting a lot of getting a lot of traction in in latam and it while technically being crypto it doesn't really have anything to do with crypto as well um yeah other other other other than the other than the token incentive um so it's kind of kind of kind of interesting so I'm doing a doing a little Deep dive on on that right now which I think could be quite fruitful I think helium is so interesting like back in 200 22 I was Shilling helium to my oil buddies and they were all rolling their eyes at me but like how you know how is it possible in this world of inflated services and goods that we live in that there isn't a space for a helium to come in and just offer cheap Wi-Fi or you know bandwidth to everybody secured by I don't know what you call it proof of I plug this black box into my Wi-Fi box um anyway like my point is uh I think helium is a really good idea and I think what's holding helium back is the fact that a token no matter how amazing it may be even Bitcoin is kind of just a Ponzi scheme if it doesn't give you some sort of equity or dividend in the underlying project and I think that soon helium will be able to register its tokens as Securities and offer token holders basically pass through revenues that come from paying you users of the network and then once that happens like air quotes bootstrapping helium is less reliant on on you know just more people lighting up helium nodes and buying helium and it's and and more just like an actual company like a decentralized vone or decentralized AT&T and that is probably a better business model than centralized AT&T um so we're really just kind of on the cut of this massive unlock of you know the internet of value I just hope it happens like I I really do I I want it to happen so badly not just for my bags but also because like because AT&T sucks like it would be great to sign up for helium at one5 the price of you know Verizon right 100% I and I and I think I think the the real the real thing here is it just it's it it doesn't te Tech techs become better obviously over the last over the last 10 15 20 25 years we don't necessarily need to have these really expensive uh setups you know maintain I used to have somebody in my life that worked at maintaining telegram uh uh phone poles and it's comp very complicated very difficult and I think that if you have this infrastructure and and it works it's actually great right probably easy easier easier easier to maintain uh it's just a matter of of can you get it into as many hands as possible so that you have coverage so it makes it makes sense I think the the only the only drawback was that helium inflates a ton there's like a huge amount of token issuance that subsidizes that subsidizes the running of this uh of these of these nodes so that's the only thing that I'm I'm concerned about but other than that I mean obviously great great idea and clearly other people think so people are buying it I think the way that price action would play out if like let's say Trump won and the SEC gets friendly you were saying like what does that trade look like I think a lot of people would expect like a god candle like this this massive green Face Ripper on everybody's screen I don't know about that I don't think it's going to be like a 1999 moment I think it'll be like you'll get a big rally when the you know election results are announced and it's it's Donald Trump if it's Donald Trump like you get a big Rally or if it's kamla maybe you get a big selloff and then a rebound in Bitcoin and less of a rebound in the other tokens kind of like what happened to the S&P when Trump first won everybody was like oh my God it's going to be World War II so the S&P sold off and then it like regained all of all of its lost ground and then some so maybe you get that in Bitcoin for comma but anyway back to Trump like if he wins um I think you get a big rally on the day then probably like a little bit a little bit of follow through but then I think you just get this like steady um multi-year uptrend as just like project after project uh gets adoption and institution after institution uh lights up you know either inflows or crypto adjacent products like lending and custody which lead to other forms of inflows settlement on chain like gas gets spent eth Coast deflationary like I think a Confluence of factors will lead to like a let's call it a 2002 to 2007 style rally in crypto like a slow one what do you think I think this kind of goes into the idea of will there be fouryear Cycles right like are you going to get these compressed periods of just absolute rip or is it going to be a slower more methodical growth as you suggested and I think it's 100% what you suggested because I think there's the the issue with the whole four fouryear Cycles is that Bitcoin the reason that fouryear Cycles would exist is that Bitcoin was an asset that nobody paid attention to and so you needed catalysts in order to get people to pay attention to it in order to buy it and the having just happens to be one of those one of those catalysts so you would go in these fouryear Cycles where you'd get this like crazy move into the having post having and then you get the crazy collapse and everyone would forget about it and then it would toil around for a bit and then it would come back as attention came back to it for probably for another having right and now everyone pays attention to bitcoin all the time like everybody constantly on Bloomberg constantly on you know uh on uh on CNBC it's like constantly everywhere and so you don't have this uh you know cycle of attention in the same way in the same way that you did that that you did before um I think FTX definitely impacted this a ton and caused you know an 18-month lull because everyone was too scared of it but I don't know what like FTX could happen again necessarily in crypto I mean even if binance went down at this point as long as it wasn't that everyone on binance lost their money kind of hard to imagine FTX level event an extinction level event that would nuke Bitcoin out of existence so I think it's just a matter of a slow growth over time I mean you'll have like these 203% pullbacks but I don't I don't think you're going to get an 80% pullback ever again 85 I don't think so either I I I don't believe in the fouryear cycle anymore I I think that you stated it so eloquently like also what Market in the history of of markets like adheres to a a like time frame for its Cycles consistently for multiple decades like it's unpre it would be unprecedented it's just it's it's too ridiculous it can't be so I think we're done with the four-year Cycles couldn't agree with you more and in terms of like extinction level events for crypto um you could have the US come out and ban it but even that would that's probably a down 80% move that probably doesn't kill it um I think I think what would be like a pretty scary FTX like event for the alts space would be and I'm not suggesting this could happen I I fed what I'm about to talk about once before and got absolutely eviscerated for it so I for for the record I'm not fuding anything here I'm just hypothetically stating in an imaginary world where tether's tether collapses for some reason that would be pretty tether tether yeah that would be the one that that really uh knap crypto for a while I think uh I think that's probably a great note I if if we're if we're talking about tether Jonah we should probably uh we should probably talk sports or something yeah we should probably just stop listen I'm in I'm in Rick and Morty's garage right like this is fantasy we're talking about here tether's fine yeah I I remember I remember the I remember the tether short I used to talk about it uh man I think I I think everybody shorts him because just jealous of the business like how great would it be to run that business yeah you just sit in Lugano drink your macchiato and check your bank account and it goes up by a billion dollars every day or something it's it's ridiculous out there dude it's just like it's it's it's honestly it's honestly incredible um well anyway Jonah as a as always great talking to you it's a pleasure chatting with you I hope everyone enjoyed this pod we will uh we'll catch you next week we're going to start doing these weekly so bringing you guys more content great talking to you Obby thanks for making time as always [Music]

what I think the market is sort of missing on eth is Wall Street and the powers that be have pretty much anointed to crypto assets um as the sort of you know digital forms of money that they are going to show their clients for for a long time it's Bitcoin and eth and I do think eth is actually competing with with Bitcoin I think that'll become kind of more obvious over the next like two to 5 years um and the that people are missing is e is becoming an Institutional asset and given how small it is and how underwe I think people are to it um I think it could see an absolute Face Ripper this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance the onchain defi primitive redesigning derivatives for the defi native you'll hear more about perennial later in the [Music] show all right sick welcome back to another THX podcast we've got a very special guest today chiefing zah the lion smoking a blunt who's here with us to talk about how he became at one point the number one Trader on bit and why he's such a gigachad and how we should make money and how to not lose money so thanks for joining us appreciate it GM everyone excited to be here GM so I tell us a little bit about yourself I mean how did you start off trading crypto like where did this all where did this all come from we need to understand the origin story behind how you became such a gigachad Trader myth myth so I I've never been I've never been honestly so flattered as I have been uh joining this podcast but um no like uh probably like many others in the space um got into crypto uh when I was in when I was in uni so around uh kind of 2016 2017 um yeah originally was actually enamored by the concept of hash functions I thought that was kind of like some sort of you know pure kind of sci-fi Tech and I thought Bitcoin kind of was SFI money and then obviously as many do once they uh kind of delve a little deeper they you know they find the world of found the world I guess of iOS shitcoins ethereum um and that's kind of how I uh you know got started telegram chats all the subreddits the the kind of Basics makes sense and and so did you start off were you always interested in actively trading or when you first got into crypto I mean were you were you more of a Buy and Hold guy were you a scalloper were you trying to trade e BTC like what what did you uh what what did you start off doing yeah unfortunately I think I've always held the mentality that I'm smarter than others which is uh you know has not made me lose a lot at certain times so I think I always had this penchant for for trading um and trying to sort of outsmart the the market um and a lot of times kind of failing to do so but yeah I always sort of have this inclination of you know unfortunately trying to T time the market finding new opportunities uh and not not necessarily just just buy and hold so obviously confidence is pretty important if you're going to go put on some big contrarian bet that proves you right and makes you a lot of money um what are some of the big trades that you've done that have given you that confidence over the course of the last six years seven years yeah I'd say two I'd say there's been a few a few kind of Trades that um you know where they're sort of backed by you know doing the research having high conviction holding through a lot of volatility and kind of more or less joning like we talked about just sitting through a trade and sitting through a trend that that you kind of have belief in um the first again like for many was was defi summer um you know was was very involved kind of in that ecosystem at the at the time um so was in a position where you know I knew you know basic things on how to you know debug you know like failed metam Mass transactions right which at the time time was kind of of the essence um you know the faster you were sort of the better you did um same thing with interacting with sort of new smart contract so it was kind of uniquely positioned to take advantage of that um next sort of big trade was actually uh kind of Ethan eth BTC in uh was it Q2 of of 2021 kind of following the the coinbase IPO um yeah at the time like you know a close friend and I were always kind of even now I sort of talk about EPC but we were really saying that the market is not really appreciating the change that's going to come from EIP 1559 um you know along with that you kind of had a very just classic sort of topping structure on on BTC going into high-profile event uh with a lot of kind of Sailor buying baked in in the sort of final leg um and obviously you had defi nfts happening so that Eun was was one of my larger kind of notional trades and more recent and probably how people kind of found the account was uh was salana which you know as most people know I definitely did uh sell too early but but sized it quite hard um in the low 20s and yeah same idea there uh I think you know in 2022 or around the merge obviously eth became definitely the most consensus trade like everyone said eth is money and you had a lot of people even spinning up funds of kind of thinking well how do we just acquire you know eth eth exposure in the most efficient way um at the same time the sort of vision that you know the ethereum foundation and all that the ecosystem was kind of pitching you know you were clearly unbundling the system and this belief system that people bought into and there were obviously going be a lot of open questions around that um and salana obviously offered this you know competitor or differentiator in a monolithic chain which I actually did not expect it to gain as much traction as it has but to me obviously saw at the time a very crowded trade and a very sort of hated trade um and there's really no other sort of smart contract platform that offers any different differentiation right everything else is either some evm spin-off L2 another L1 L3 whatever um so yeah those are kind of the three sort of big uh big trades that I've kind of I guess hit in my career well I'm glad we've got you on the podcast today because you we've done some Builder episodes recently and it's cool to talk to the people writing the code and building the tech and building the future but markets just got markets just got spicy they just got super interesting and we need to talk shop like we need to talk markets it feels like there's a ton of opportunity uh right now and it's you know it's good to have like a a pretty epic Savage Trader on the podcast to chop it up with because I think everybody wants to know what to do right now like it we were going into kind of despondent bare mode for a while things were nuking down into the 50s and Bitcoin every you know went a little bit lower than most of us thought it would and then suddenly um Donald Trump gets shot in the head and we're so back now now there's talk of a kind of like a strategic Bitcoin Reserve JD Vance is a he's got he's got coin in his wallet he got $250,000 worth of bitcoin he's a millennial like this is it almost feels like a paradigm shift has happened overnight um and Biden is just self-destructing with every day that goes by and his administration's been pretty bad for crypto so AI chiefing like what what are we looking at here are we supposed to be 10 out of 10 all in what's the what's the quote it says was it in the midst of so over I found or we found out or I found out we're so back Bo it's amazing it's always it's in this market it's always when it just looks like there's nothing that can save it when something comes out of left field when everybody's when everybody's bearish when everybody's D RIS when everybody goes well I guess it's over we're going to trade down to 40s alts are done everything's everything's [ __ ] there's there's always some something that happens well I think that's like if you want to talk about markets maybe even like top down right I think what you what you pointed out always happens especially in Bull markets right bull markets are characterized by generally positive headlines and when things are so bad for so long in a bull market you kind of know something good should be you know coming along the way and it's funny uh I guess in those like whatever I don't know how long the draw down was right but you had people finally coming out and saying the know the two words right bare Market you had people kind of questioning whether even you know it's funny in this market I feel like I don't know what has caused this but I think so many people lack conviction like they almost want like their dad or someone to tell them to step up and bid right so that's why everyone's like oh well GCR you know GCR said this GCR said that they're kind of are lending their conviction to someone else um and obviously there was a lot of rhetoric around you know whether or not still a bull market or a PA Market but I think the thing that I would sort to emphasize at least is we're definitively in a bull market and if we do get in a situation again where it's so dire and we haven't had good news I think you should expect good news sort of uh around the corner because that is kind of what Cate Rises a bull market I think um that's an interesting take that you have because I've I've never thought about like just the general backdrop being bullish and so we should expect bullish news I always figured the news is kind of independently distributed and not related to like oh it's been bad for a while but we're in a bull market so we should be expecting more good news I've never thought about it that way but in crypto you do kind of get these you know multimon or even multi-year um time periods of either just utter despair or utter Euphoria and it is I guess it's more of a reflexive asset class than some of the other ones that I'm used to in trafi but like Okay so let's just assume that the odds of a republican Administration that's friendly to crypto just went through the roof and you can see that on poly Market as well like what are there altcoin trades are there you know obviously Chief chiefing you've made your you've made your bread on a few Big Al coin trades are you looking in altcoins you looking in Majors what's the what's the trade yeah I I haven't really I've kind of been thinking about the market like I tend to be a little bit more passive now um I don't really actively trade with a big a big portion of the portfolio I like to think of it as you know you have your sort of major of choice um because obviously the majors have just been so supported the cycle and then you you have different theme sectors that that you might want to play um you know for me I again people know this uh by now um eth is definitely my major of choice and we can kind of get into that and then in terms of themes I'm not really looking right now for a certain theme that is would be bolstered by um let's say Trump winning even though I think that is probably there are a couple interesting trades to be had there uh I'm personally very fascinated by the kind of kind of crypto AI intersection um I do think we're un ironically very early there I don't think there's much that's investable um but there are a few certain things that kind of excite me and so I I like to think of it as you know what other opportunities do I think would outpace me just buying and holding let's say an 8020 basket of of eth and let's say you know an AI asset I think people know I like I like Po tenser um I think AI actually tweeted this but yeah I think a clear sort of trade if you want to trade the um the betting odds on on the election would be obviously like Soul um soul is going to be I think kind of baked into Trump winning just because obviously in a new admin the the odds of the ETF going through are quite high but we'll talk about that um I actually think one of the sweeter trades will be nailing the the soul top into the March 2025 unlocks um which will coincide nicely with the ETF decision um you know Lido is so extremely hated I don't love the defi rotation but I think you know Hester Pierce came out yesterday and pretty much said there's no real reason why staking shouldn't be included in the ETF offerings um so I think something like Lio or the staking field might get attached to Trump winning because there really isn't you know the only reason for not to be staking is purely political and all investors will want that extra yield and I don't know exactly how it sort of plays into into Lio um other than sort of narrative like obviously from the get-go clients will want to probably stick with coinbase you could see black rock and all the sort of Institutions build their own offerings not that compx them Outsource their they could Outsource their staking to Lio so you could have like a black rock eth ETF uh with staking by Lio so that would be the real black pill and it's actually not you know Unthinkable because Black Rock you know their CIO at this coinbase event pretty much said like the future is on chain they have this build fund or this money market fund I forget what it's called pretty sure has half a yard if not more there so you know Black Rock the biggest financial institution in the world has committed to you know putting assets on chain so it's not it's not crazy easy to think that they you know stake some of their eth or or do something with Li and then obviously in that world I don't think it's it's priced around here I'm kind of curious you said that obviously this was kind of a bull argument for defi in general but you said you're not super in favor of the whole idea of a defi rotation and Jonah and I have talked about on the Pod for a bit it's it's that I think at some point we have to get allocation to things that are quote unquote useful and people are going to get tired of buying Buy platforms and I think you're kind of already seeing that with a lot of the things that are performing like really poorly this year it's a lot of the new platforms that are coming out I'm kind of curious is it is your view on defi more of a short-term bearishness medium-term long-term what's the no I don't I'd almost say short-term bullish just CU I think so many Al like the alt complex is so oversold with Defi and speaking of someone obviously who who came into the the world you crypto world really through defi um it doesn't really have the same it doesn't really Captivate you know people or the marketplace really as much as it did before so I think there's going to be short-term opportunities but would I want to hold you know let's say a decently growing defi platform or like a burgeoning you know new AI L1 or new AI ecosystem like one the valuation cap on the other thing is just going to be so so much higher um and idea I've kind of been mulling over and it's actually come from a friend but I think it's it's really interesting right so many investors are kind of asking themselves or trying to reason with mcoins you know doing well and obviously all utility coins doing doing terribly I think it ties a bit more into you know these crypto tokens aren't they're not they're not stocks right they're there's something a little bit different and kind of my friend's thesis on this is that you know tokens are a way to almost invest into into movements be it political movements social movements right like holding Bitcoin and buying Bitcoin is you saying you know I believe that money and State should be separated and I'm holding this as a badge of honor you know again it's almost like a religion right and so I do think if you're a crypto investor and you're long term you do need to evaluate a Project based like I don't love the term cult but it is sort of what it is right you need to evaluate like is this a religion like is there is there a movement behind this is there an objective reason it exists like do you have all these people working towards a unified goal do you have even like a single common enemy that people can rally around and defi that's why like short-term there's going to be trades right like Lio could be a trade on staking policy it would probably do really really well but what I buy and hold a defi asset for one or two years versus something else probably not this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance perennial is quickly becoming one of the go-to derivatives platforms and liquidity layers for all of defi so let me tell you a little bit about them there are kind of three things you need right when you're thinking about a place and a platform to trade on first one great trade execution second one low fees and third thir of course an onchain permissionless platform and perennial Nails all three of those buckets with the launch of perennial V2 they've made all of that possible by introducing a ton of new features such as faster oracles which reduce trade execution to seconds lower fees competing with major centralized exchanges and minimizing fees for both takers and makers fully modular markets which allow the protocol to support any price feed out there and fourth cash settled right the trades are cash settled in US not in crypto perennial allows you the trader to gain access to deeper liquidity with only a fraction of the tvl how it works is that perennial enables a two-sided Market made up of both Traders and liquidity providers right Traders deposit the assets to get leverage exposure while liquidity providers provide these pools of capital to earn fees for taking the other side of the trader position brenal allows you to trade crypto hers FX and coming soon nfts and more backed by some of the best investors in the industry perennial is a must checkout platform if you're a crypto Trader go check them out by clicking the link in the description give thousand X some credit go check out for any you're going to love them all right let's get back to the show that makes sense it's more about you know the the risk award and multiples that you're going to necessarily necessarily get on this thing I guess the question the the the question is are these things that are coming out like these these AI projects these uh other things that that you're looking at are they not already going to be valued so highly right are they not going to come out at at really at really high valuations and then are they actually going to fulfill fulfill those valuations so I I I get it but it's just it's it's always it's always been tough for me um because I think in 2022 I said probably incorrectly that the next the next run is going to be filled with things that actually matter because people are sick of the things that that don't actually that don't actually deliver and then and then we got meme coins right and those were by far like by far the best the the the the best performer so I guess it it also just comes down to like where you think crypto will be useful right if you think that black rock is going to start integrating defi assets then I think everything reprices a ton or at least the things that they integrate Ric a ton if you think that crypto is you know still just best for for gambling and and for and for and for moving money around and for financial infrastructure then then obviously I think CH changes your answer but um I mean you've you've always made your money by basically building massive conviction in in things that people hate yeah that's like generally generally how I've seen you how I've seen you trade um and that tends to be tends to work like very well so with that with that in mind is there is there something that you think people like really really really [ __ ] hate right now that that you don't hate as much eth yeah I mean there's twoo I mean I'm I'm happy here to to shill you know hash shill my bags um but I mean eth yeah I think like I do think eth is hated obviously it's unfair to say it's like the most hated asset right because it's in most people's crypto portfolios even though you know who knows by now but to me yeah I think eth eth fits this bill and talk about that like what I think the market is sort of missing on eth is Wall Street and the powers that be have pretty much anointed two crypto assets um as the sort of you know digital forms of money that they are going to show their clients for for a long time it's Bitcoin and eth Bitcoin was such a successful it was the most successful launch in their in their history right like everyone there's obviously super excited about it clearly their clients are um and I don't see any reason why eth doesn't follow in its footsteps uh and I think the backdrop is obviously eth right now one in general actually is so much so much less liquid than than BTC and I think people are really overthinking this whole you know uh demand side like in the traditional world the way people make decisions is just market cap leading they don't make people don't make financial decisions anymore there's no you know valuation fundamental analysis it's just hey I put money in my savings account and go buy me the NASDAQ or the S&P and that buys it for you based on whatever the market cap you know weighted is so everyone does a market cap weighted index so why would eth not get 30% of the flows you know from I've heard murmur obviously the clients are kind of ready for this product to launch and they're ready to move some of their ibit over to the new eth product and eth is in a position now right where the common narratives are it's it's lost to salana gas fees are low l2s are parasitic um ebtc down only BTC is the better form of money when if you actually look at it I me I don't have trading you in front of me now but I'm pretty sure ebtc hasn't really moved uh in like 10 or 11 months I think it's even higher than it was maybe October 23rd is the day I sort of always look at that ratio really hasn't moved and I do think eth is actually competing with with Bitcoin I think that'll become kind of more obvious over the next like two to five years um and the ship that people are missing is e is becoming an Institutional asset and given how small it is and how underwe I think people are to it um I think it could see an absolute Face Ripper I do think a lot of things have to go right for it to happen and E has not been dealt the best hand of uh hand this this Market but I do think that all ultim or ultimately ends up being fuel for a a pretty a pretty nasty nasty rally know one thing I didn't appreciate I think is much until you just said it and now I'm thinking about it is just how illiquid eth is like I mean the thing went up 20% in a day on the on the news of the ETF approval yeah I mean if if if it even gets a a fraction of the flows of the of the BTC outet I mean I think it's definitely not 30% as liquid as BTC I think it's lower so it every dollar in so that makes what would be the religion of eth this is what I want to know like Bitcoin is sort of stateless money uh that's what you believe in if you if you invest in Bitcoin and the enemy is like uh the US Treasury and the money printer inside of it um what what is the eth religion like what are you buying what are you belie I think the eth religion probably comes down to uh I guess in advance other people have kind of tried to come up with their marketing pitch but it revolves around just right this uh completely open decentralized you know App Store that anyone can access right now it's sort of Unstoppable Finance right financial services that anyone in the world can access but yeah it's something it's something along those lines I don't think it's actually oh here's here's another sort of one of my takes is people always say you know Bitcoin has this clear marketing message that trafi can buy eth doesn't that's why it will fail my answer to that is you want to buy before they come up with the message because they're going to because they're greedy and they want to sell this product they're going to come up with some unified message meme to sell their clients you can get into the trade before they do that so I don't think it's sort of as important but it would probably be something in the separating financial services from the state if you had to if you had to dumb it down Jordy also has a good um a good meme around I think it's Community money eth is definitely like people use eth as money they hoard it as a store of value they they use it to to trade to buy nfts what have you use on l2s like eth eth is a form of money it has the SV aspect and it has the media of exchange um a lot of this stuff I don't really think you know matters all that much like a lot of this is kind of just philosophical waxing um from kind of a markets persp perspective right I think you have you have an AB like I think the market is just wrong on how successful this ETF is going to be I wasn't always this big of a ebtc bull like you know when Black Rock announced their ETF I was like yeah this thing's breaking down it's over this is like a 12- month range break like it's done and then once the ETF actually like all the marketing happened was about to launch and it wasn't making new lows and you had this crazy salana run like it was still holding so I was like all right clearly the next trade is going to be this ETF and it's been such a long build into it I think sentiment is still so poor I do think most people are kind of convinced they're going to be able to just trade the flows post um so I'm interested to see what happens I'm not interested in trading it myself because I think it's going to be noisy and think Majors continue grinding higher but yeah I think the setup is there uh for eth interesting I agree when you think about like actually expressing that Viewpoint are you just buying outright eth are you just like hoarding it are you 100% allocated are you 50% I mean yeah how how do you actually make sure that you make the most money on this without getting I mean for example you might have had this view before and then e is down 15% then you're just like ah [ __ ] what do I do for sure um it's definitely all like kind of dependent obviously on the type of portfolio you run right I'm able to sort of manage personal Capital um you know luckily don't have any any dependence or like legal immediate dependence so I'm able to obviously sit through a bit of of higher Vol there obviously kind of have like mental stops in my head um but sort of at this juncture yeah I think you just I'm I'm personally kind of uh Diamond handing with you know a set percentage of a fairly high percentage of the portfolio obviously leave some cash to to buy on dips emergency funds you kind of never know be responsible but um I don't see I don't see much downside from these levels um and I do think what I've experienced personally is trying to actively trade Majors the cycle I think has been extremely difficult right they just they just tend to mean revert we have this ETF this ET buying think you generally have people obviously who are just so far down their all-time high coin balance let's say even from like 21 you know that cycle where I do think people are just not that exposed to Majors um so you don't have these like vicious vicious draw down so I would say the way I would express it yeah just spot eth no leverage um not very interested in trading uh around the kind of ETF flows I think if eth would dip to certain levels um could maybe try low leverage Longs even though I don't I don't I don't know if the juice is uh is really there and kind of the mental the mental anguish of having to to hold the leverage position eth is my trump trade like I think that if you install a new regulatory module in Washington DC trafi like the way that traditional finance companies work is they have you know multi-year like it basically takes them the better part of a decade to onboard a new asset class and get their heads around it and build the plumbing and stuff and realistically Bitcoin is not you know there there's not enough going on on that blockchain for trafi to to use it for anything meaningful but eth obviously is is the first smart contract platform that arrived on the scene and proved to be stable so that's sort of the one that's been blessed by trafi and you know from my time inside of you know institutional crypto I I did watch and learn about plenty of eth rails being built inside of you know massive massive conglomerates like Black Rock Fidelity and dozens of others basically what they're waiting they they've built all the infrastructure for eth to settle on chain to store value on chain to move value on chain but they're kind of hesitant to deploy because they don't want to get rugged they don't want to have they don't want to get fired for succumbing to a 2022 like FTX event but most importantly they don't want to get sued by the SEC um so I think if you if you basically extract the current SEC which I think will happen under a new Administration implant a new one that's friendly to crypto uh a bunch of rules get made and enshrined um then I think basically Wall Street to use a blanket term will be able to just light up eth like they'll be able to do all sorts of stuff on top of eth um maybe even payments too uh I think that's the last bottleneck that those companies are waiting for is just the the assurance that they're not going to get sued for doing crypto stuff I never thought of it that way but I think that's I think that's correct right there's nothing I mean you could see a lot of these corporat spin up their own l2s right Bas obviously has kind of showed that that's a viable strategy and the the sequencer fees honestly they're a great Revenue generator on their own um not to mention all the new products you could launch but yeah you could totally see a world right in a new Administration where it just kind of in you know from a macro view just allows institutions to just get on chain right creates a framework for them to do so I'm sure they'll explore other chains right I think Ethan salana are probably the the two where they go um but yeah think it's a good point how do you so you mentioned earlier that there's a thesis out there that says that l2s are parasitic to eth so do you believe in the fat protocol thesis like do you think that all the value will most of the value will dribble down to eth or do you do you think that these l2s are just going to sort of capture it and not really transfer it through to token holders and so you know maybe the next big trade is actually going to be salana or something monolithic like that how do you think about allocating between monolithic chains and ethik chains yeah I i' I've kind of said this since the start of cycle I think l2s are probably uh the most uninvestable segment uh in crypto definitely for liquid markets obviously in Venture like the returns have been staggering um I guess not everyone is kind of unlocked but you know if you invest in the kind of last vintage you know all these l2s have done super well but no I think I think l2s are they're almost like parasitic to themselves I think all the value will just flow back to eth um again I don't think a lot of the value like you know we we love our boy Andrew king um but when he was putting out his threads on you know institutions are going to be valuing eth on a PE basis like no one like none of that is happening right so I don't think that L2 siphoning away uh transaction fees in the interum um are really going to affect e value prop much um so I think I think the value there flows back to E I think increased L2 usage uh increases kind of e form of money right because they're for the most part using e as gas theoretically right in a world where you actually are able to have decentralized sequencers and you can you know pass the the gas spent to stakers right it all sort of looks like l2s kind of look like their own little economies that are passing dividends back to their holders in the form of eth which again kind of strengthens eth as this internet Community money use case so um yeah but but do do you think like as a as a Trader do you think that they're gonna move up with eth when you get when you get an ETF is there is there a short-term trade that you think we can take or is this just these guys are kind of [ __ ] and you have no interest in in touching them even if we get an ETF like it's funny it's funny because if I say I think they're [ __ ] and there's no interest in touching them that's that's probably when you bid that's kind of when you bid I don't know for that I I would try to I would try to look I guess at at the market structure data and maybe try to look at positioning see if it's like lopsided it's just hard with these markets right because the the kind of OTC markets for these things have gotten way deeper people are smarter in terms of how they're actually hedging you know at least how these desks are actually hedging these coins out you hav't really seen any insane like just big short squeezes happen a long time other than like the DWF manipulation you know you don't have your your mobile coin or uh your uh your like Aptos like even Tia shorts are paying Hefty amounts of funding and coins not really moving anywhere um so I kind of think they're just [ __ ] for now um You probably if you wanted to trade it and you wanted to find Alpha there You' need a mix of you know positioning you'd have to really dig deep into unlock schedule track all the tokens that have been unlocked so far see what investors are doing with them see on like what dates that their people usually distribute tokens and how they sell you have to do a lot of like onchain forensic work um it would be doable but it's again coming back to this whole point that Jonah puts out right you can do all this work or you can just hold eth and you're probably going to get a bulk of the return with way less volatility but have you ever considered just calling Andre and telling him you have it it's it's you know it's on the if things get bad we might have to break that one up but yeah see that'll be uh I I do I do think that there's you know is amazing how much the market has changed from that perspective there used to be so much so much Alpha in just like tracking all of these tracking all these people seeing whether Andre is going to pump something or not and now even though bitcoin's trading at 6063 I mean extensively it's doing very well even the things like worldcoin which have a pretty crazy cartel behind them like yeah just went up 50% and went straight back down I mean the thing things just don't seem to work as much worldcoin is the stupidest idea in not just in crypto in anything that I've heard in a long time like I think it's I think it's there's a lot of dumb things here Jonah there a lot of really dumb things out there Jonah including by the way that thing behind you yeah what is that that is a that is a a a North Korean AK47 covered in dead butterflies um with bullets bullet like fake bullets that have um Commodities inside of them like gasoline and Diesel and jet fuel and stuff um and yeah I'm not in my usual uh place today but this is this is a piece of art that I like and it's pointed at my ear in honor of uh current events you know I just realized um but yeah no it's it's is okay so this is obviously a stupid idea that somebody paid for me um I think that scanning people's eyeball this is this is where this is where I'm too much of a boomer to trade crypto I look at World coin I'm like it's a giant orb that people scan their eyeballs with like not since the that like juice machine that didn't work that tried to Value itself as a tech company like 10 years ago have I seen an idea this dumb um I don't know let me let me let me steal man worldcoin for you thank you so you need some way there there are a lot of bots in this world there there's with with AI coming up basically you're going to get to a place where it's going to be very easy for people to game systems and so knowing that somebody is human is actually extremely important whether you're building a platform you're building a product you're trying to incentivize people to use it like how do you know you're not just getting taken advantage of worldcoin at least presents a an attempt at solving this by saying hey if we get everyone in the world to scan their eyeballs then we can prove that you're a human and yeah I get it I get the premise but that's a big if Obi like who the [ __ ] is gonna scan their eyeballs are you dude I don't know like I'm I scan my eyeballs to skip the line in TSA yeah we talked about this recently but I think we were hitting on worldcoin and everyone's like well if you have clear you did the same thing and then I was like damn it I did the same thing and by the way clear is also they say the weirdest [ __ ] I every time I go I tell them to like change the little voice over but when you scan your eyes at the end they go we have finished taking pictures of your eyes you're just like dude like say anything else anyway man listening you listening to this that's how you innovate I'm making sure the world coin team is listening to this they can they can add in a different uh audio confirmation guys I will happily take a million World coin a year to consult you and tell you how you should you know run your project happily just let me know no at some point we need to we need to talk to the people who actually do earn millions of tokens per year advising and helping uh helping tokens like launch there's a whole Market making business like the gsrs and winter mutes of the world actually like do that sort of thing and there's a lot there's a lot of that going on behind the scenes in crypto it probably be valuable to talk to those guys but like in the short run I think those are the the only guys who are trading most utility coins right now is the the market makers I think it's just like when I look at the liquidity in some of these I call them altcoins we could call them utility coins whatever anything that isn't a major or a meme it really just looks like Market maker on Market maker violence every day it doesn't look like there's real participation these things are like Loosely correlated with Bitcoin and eth and everybody everybody shits on me when I say they're going to underperform because obviously they're they just trade like levered Bitcoin and eth but that's only because like somebody at winter mute has a correlation model that makes worldcoin move sort of in line with eth but in more percentage terms more percentage points per day because it's it's worldcoin and it's not a major I really think that's going to end at some point especially when these unlocks occur but I might be you know to your point chiefing I might just be missing out on the next big narrative that needs to get ridden I I I think I'm wait until these altcoins get so hated and then maybe it's time to start selectively buying ahead of a regulatory Paradigm Shift you you don't think they already are no I me not not enough uh I'm kind of with Jonah I mean I meme on Jonah on Twitter when he does the threads of like here's why all like here's why all coins are [ __ ] thread below and he absolutely deserves it by the way he absolutely he did that he did that with soul at 20 and he was like here's why salana is [ __ ] and I remember trolling him on that one before it went vertical but no I I like I think obviously these things can remain hated and and do terribly at the same time right I do think with inflection points often times you kind of there's some Catalyst like there's some trigger so if it's for some category right like there's something that incites people and you can see the market react and I think you generally have time to act like the only the only other alt that I I hold a sizable position is in is is to like everything else is for the most part A Trading position um so I'm I'm withon I don't think there's much that is investable obviously there are um might not have done all my homework but most of these things are as Jonah says are they're kind of [ __ ] so so take me take me through the day of figuring out well what is investable even for the short term you say most some of these are trading positions like how do you find the alts for trading positions when you're constructing your book for sure so set aside let's say like five to 10% towards if you want to call it more active per per trading um you know things that could happen there would be obviously you're you're kind of just watching news um you could be trading kind of news headline events could be some Catalyst you know protocol upgrades um there are certain times obviously like trending environments where I do think you can gain signal also from just what other influential like accounts are posting you can kind of get a sense for what the Zeitgeist of the moment is and it's kind of up to your intuition to decide how much sort of there is obviously you're watching you know you have V dashboard open you're kind of seeing what positioning looks like um but I don't know I I thought about this even for this podcast like there's some kind of loose General Frameworks but I do consider myself I think more of like a Vibes investor and Trader where I do think you have to lean on intuition a bit in some of these situations but in terms of unearthing New Opportunities obviously it's like monitoring news flow monitoring Market structure what are people trading you know uh in terms of what's gaining volume what's what's decreasing in volume wor where sort of attention where's the general kind of flow of liquidity that's sort of what uh what I would look at but not many things actually even you know I think I think I look at more opportunities and say no then I'm like yeah let's do that so how did you walk us through using that Playbook that you just described play by play to arrive at the conclusion that you should accumulate like a slug of TOA how how' you do that yeah so again even starting top down right so I'm assuming one we're in bull market so I think you want to be structurally long these assets um two from a from a thematics perspective um big believer in crypto AI for a few reasons one I think crypto AI reminds me a lot of defi in the early days and even Bitcoin I mean I wasn't around in the earliest days but where you kind of have this unifying theme and rallying cry that kind of gets everyone together right I think I tweeted this you Bitcoin is we're going to separate money from the state ethereum right we're going to separate Finance from the state and to me decentralized AI we're obviously going to separate AGI from the state you know and and ethereum obviously does piggyback on bitcoin but I think Bitcoin and AI are probably the two most those are the two most powerful narratives that can exist AGI we obviously have no idea what this is going to look like but we can I think we can be pretty certain it's going to be kind of Life altering um it's not really hard to imagine a world in which any single state actor you know will want to sort of control and influence this um and that that power to me is just too great for it to be kind of confined into the hands of a single power now I'm not saying anything that interesting has been built so far I'm just saying that the rally and cry The Narrative the message is very very strong and it's going to entice people into it and it already is you know you're seeing a lot of kind of independent AI developers just sort of tinkering with these systems in their spare time no know many that have kind of Spun up um you know bit tent or subnets or or mining certain subnets um you know you saw Gary or sorry Barry launch their decentralized AI Investment Trust um so it's very clear this is going to be a movement that's going to see a lot of capital flows and then I do think it's true right know retail people they don't really have an Avenue to access investing in kind of the best AI Talent um you can buy Nvidia Microsoft who knows if those trades have played out but obviously they've done really well but you can't really get access to private Market valuations um and again in crypto I don't think many things are investable but there are going to be sort of a few projects that that are you kind of have to do the work of of finding them um so I think you have this story in this theme this very powerful story that I think can last Cycles I think it's actually an objectively good movement like the world would be much better off if we can separate AGI from the state and I think you have you will have a pretty steady flow of capital because one any new capital raised by you know your traditional funds like they will have to look at this category and then I do think retail you know there's a good chance that retail Capital flows in as well so I start kind of from there and then when I look across the things you can invest in um you know they're all very narrative driven to an extent but bit tensor is the only actual kind of decentralized community or something that looks to be forming into a decentralized community that has kind of grown organically and in a Grassroots manner from day one I think back in like October of 23 they might have had like four subnets I think they're up to 38 now uh and the quality of them is is increasing there's one called subnet 8 it's like a just a trading Bond so you have all these miners that are creating different trading algorithms um and the best ones you can kind of copy trade behind them on on buybit and I actually I I haven't back tested it I kind of followed on Twitter but I think they've lost maybe two three trades out of maybe like I don't know 50 60 um they're definitely like kind of just momentum trades like they just they buy big dips and sell rips but I mean this is like investing in systematic strategies basically and they just built it as a as a bit tensor subnet um other things too honestly like the monetary policy mirroring Bitcoin is interesting right I think it's is an asset that that just tends to be hoarded when it's that scarce um you know the founder is definitely like a a zealot like figure and again right I'm kind of deep in this thought of you want to invest in these movements and you kind of need you need these types of leaders that almost sound sound kind of deranged right like almost an AI Jesus and I think K has taken on that form which is good right I don't I don't know if it's all going to work out but you need uh you need someone that can can constantly rally the troops and and paint you know paint world that is different from today um and really I just like in the beginning when I first kind of looked at I was just hanging out in the Discord watching like it was honestly all engineering related questions right it wasn't like please sir price Target my family um the types of things you normally see in a crypto Discord uh there was no there's no price there's no price talk all louded in the main one but I just saw a genuine Community forming around it and from a trade perspective at the like I think I first bought it like 216 back in back in Q4 it had just done like a 50% correction from like a huge move I'd heard about it on initial runup was feeling insane fomo I didn't I didn't enter um but it was a lot of like sharp people around me that were getting into it and the thing I think that people don't get about it is it's not really using it's not using a blockchain for any of the actual like AI computation um it's just creating this incentive game around building models and it's super meta and it honestly probably might not work um but it's kind of starting to work and if it does work I think it can be pretty big if anything I think it can have just an insane kind of you know hype driven uh move and I do think it's one of the only it's one of the only invest like Assets in AI you can buy where you're like it might not work but it seems to be growing it's Grassroots and I need to put money in the space somehow so let me do it and and you know Barry silbert being a huge backer and holder um it's not going to hurt it he's obviously going to pump resources into this just like he did with Etc straight to the moon now I believe believe it was a compell compelling very I think compelling Vision I with AI coins in general I always thought that if somebody was able to actually build a real product in AI it would just attract so much damn usage or so much damn investment because of exactly what you said you can't access anything in the AI market right now right that's why when you look at Bitcoin miners Bitcoin miners across the board just had this massive massive massive rip solely because they said they were going to start building up facilities uh to for um for you know backing up AI right basically saying okay we're going to give you we're going to give you guys high performance compute and we're going to build this over the next five years and they all like tripled uh but even then it's like not that's not really I I think that's like s super super overblown because it's not even a direct investment in AI it's an investment in something that maybe is going to build out good warehous so it's uh I think if you know if if they actually do build out a good a good prodct is kind of the only place you can go to get exposure the other thing with bit tens I'm realizing the my view on it is definitely more of like a longer it's a longer term investment this isn't this isn't a trade like in terms of a trade I you know I bought I bought a fair amount honestly at um even like at like 212 220 there was actually a huge dislocation decent dislocation between like the r version on chain and uh what it was trading on centralized exchanges because the chain went down for it was a small vulnerability but the chain was halted and the only way people could offboard uh is if they H held rap tow they could just sell it on chain and just get their liquidity out it was trading like a 10 15% discount and if you read the Discord like the bridge was coming back online right so that was a pretty quick you can't size it that aggressively but you could you could still size it um that was a free like 10 15% right there and then prices I think are up like 40% since then so that was that was a fun little tactical trade but yeah the other my other view on it as well from like a longer term view is most of the AI coins you see stuff like live Pier stuff like render IET all of these things can actually just be their own the tensor subnet and I did notice a trend a bit earlier um I think that the the ecosystem got a bit derailed with some of the stuff recently but it'll be back on track but in like q1 and Q4 of last year you saw a lot of projects like um kaido and then uh myell inference Labs doing their actual initial kind of product launch as a bit tensor subnet right because obviously there is this big reward in subsidies uh if you launch one of the better models um but to me I was like this is actually it's working and it's a clever way of bootstrap it's a clever way of pretty much saying hey instead of launching on your own with no resources come launch on bit sensor and you'll sort of be paid to do so um and if you kind of create that flywheel like there'll be sort of enough Demand on the other end to offset the the emissions and obviously I think we're in probably year three I actually don't know exactly when it went live but we we saw with ethereum right like the the concept of high emissions like these things can get changed by the community this is a dynamic thing it's not a static thing so um yeah I think I think that's one of the more interesting kind of Grassroots ecosystems that has developed this cycle that I don't think is getting as much love uh as it could or as it should that's super exciting I mean one if I may I just want to try and poke a theoretical hole in it because that's that's one of the best trade pitches I've heard in a long time one you just gave uh for bit tenser here here would be my like let me pait something to you and and have you defend it um what you know we all in crypto as crypto participants WT witnessed The Vicious brutality of the bare Market of 2022 it's fresh in everybody's mind you know there are multiple ways to lose money you could get exchange rugged you could get worm hold you could just get uh you know just be down bad on on your bags lots of ways to get [ __ ] over um but the anatomy of that bare Market is very clear and present in all of our minds so wouldn't you say that AI is at the peak of the hype cycle and perhaps primed for maybe not a a vicious bare Market but a bare market like what happens if Nvidia trades down 50% what happens if AI cools does that impact bit tensor or or valuations in crypto or is it just completely distinct and undervalued uh I'd say I think they're I think they're somewhat Loosely connected I don't think you can make the argument that they're highly correlated because Nvidia ran I don't know maybe did a double and and really pretty much took over everyone's imagination the stock market while crypto AI coins fell like 70% if there was a tight relationship that that shouldn't have happened right people should have been like hey I'm buying the div on AI coins because Nvidia is up those flows obviously aren't there I think the AI coins are really just a reflection of the alt Market in general and any idiosyncratic things that are happening in that in that ecosystem [Music] um I don't I think it'd be foolish to say that if Nvidia really really Drew down that it wouldn't be bad for AI coins but I think they're so relatively under owned like to the kind of global you know like the mark cap of Nvidia I think I think these things are so small um that it won't really matter right like they're just these things are tiny in the kind of grand scheme of things like there's just a finite number you know I think render is makes no sense to me like why people buy it right but people hold it they want to believe it it's it's small like you kind of run out you run you run out of sellers at some point um so I think crypto is just so small comparatively that I don't think the flows would matter over let's say like a three-month time Horizon could you have a week or two week pullback for sure could you have people try to play that trade definitely but I don't think it would be sustained by any means I don't think the people or I don't think the price Discovery in these coins is happening on the basis of what's happening in AI that's actually a really good way of phrasing it and maybe maybe they're not even comparable maybe we can't even compare bit tenser to Nvidia maybe it's more like hey look at what Cisco did during the tech bull market of 2000 um and the Bitcoin equivalent at the time was the TCP IP protocol underlying the internet right like Cisco is selling the network switching equipment and the hardware kind of like Nvidia does and tcpip was the protocol right now tcpip wasn't investable but right now you could easily have a situation where Nvidia comes off because gpus are oversupplied and suddenly G you know compute is cheaper so that's bad for NVIDIA but it's bullish for protocols that need compute right so that's that's kind of interesting I hadn't thought about it that way um wow it's cool to have somebody actually do like a proper like altcoin shill that I can buy into you know there's been a lot of it and it doesn't make a a lot of sense to me but that one that one I can get behind there's not much that makes sense to me either it's beautiful honestly I love being in Industry where nothing makes sense well let me speaking of nothing making sense uh chiefing zah you mentioned Discord now you and Avi are obviously a lot younger than I am when I look at Discord to me it's it's the same as when I walk into like uh not that I do this that often but when I walk into a nightclub these days gen Z can't focus for more than 20 seconds so the DJ switches the song every 20 seconds it's like this ADHD um Twisted apocalyptic nightmare for me and I kind of view Discord the same way like it's just like just millions of messages per second uh of like utter brain melting ADHD nonsense so I was kind of wondering you mentioned that you use it for Alpha purposes like how on Earth can you find Alpha in that mess of that Fire H of garbage called Discord what do you guys do in there and what do you look for both of you the uh the the question of what do you guys do in Discord is so hilarious to me but it's like what do you do on Bloomberg chat Jonah it's the same [ __ ] talk to my buddies yeah but there's like three messages per minute it's not like three million per minute yeah it's just funny um you just G find the right channels I don't know Z what do you think yeah I mean well you're kind of just stalking the conversation like if you know if you were around back in the day there was a in the synthetics Discord there was a tra there was a channel called D trading that channel might have found like the most 100 X's probably in history all just Community people are just like sharing ideas in there obviously it was it was defy Summers it's a different time but like yeah just you just sit there and just read like read the conversation there's all these like sub channels um and a lot of it is organic too or like not even I don't say organic but a lot of like these channels are just Engineers are trying to get stuff done and they don't think anyone's actually following it right because there's no reason for anyone to be in that channel other than like Engineers trying to get stuff done but you can just stock browse you kind of get a sense for you know is the is the project like are the docs like well done like how much help you know do they need from these engineering teams to get stuff off the ground like you can kind of get a sense just VI the discourse like how well a projects run but I think you have to go autist mode a little bit and just sit there and read yeah maybe I'm just too social and normal and not on the Spectrum I you just take like 20 grams of aerol 20 mgs of Aderall and you just sit in front of the Discord and you just like Let It stream into your eyes this is financial advice I promise you you will come out a richer man on the other side not fin lot a lot of people they're always asking it's kind of like the Ronnie Coleman thing right everyone wants to be a bodybuilder but no one wants to lift no heavy ass weights everyone wants to make it in crypto but no one wants to face 20 milligrams of Aderall and sit in the Discord all day it's not that hard folks it's really not that hard I mean it's so funny because like it's so true and also you know as I you know as I get to to meet you guys and and meet this sort of like this crypto crowd the really like the real OG onchain uh dgen traders who actually made it and made it big the more I realize that These Guys these are self-taught traders who are far better than most of the traders that I've worked for at like Premier white shoe like institutions of High Finance so you know you guys are putting in the work it's just a different kind of work than maybe digging through a 10K or a 10 Q you're instead you're just trying to find signal and a fire hose of noise called Discord speaking of a fire hose of noise which this podcast is uh I think uh I think that's probably probably a good amount of noise for the people today um dude love talking to you as always this was this was a ton of fun yeah guys really appreciate you having me on this was fun thanks for coming on zah I know what to call you now um let's keep talking this tow thing is interesting none of this is financial advice of course we don't know anything we're two people in a green lion that smokes weed don't listen to us us do your own research etc etc um good luck out there everyone until next time stay safe

when I think about like you know what a future for crypto looks like I think we're moving a in the right direction a lot of different ways right we're seeing lower latency blockchains we're seeing higher TPS better proving systems but really at the end of the day we can build the best infrastructure possible but if people aren't building applications on top of it then it doesn't [ __ ] matter this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance the onchain defi primitive redesigning derivatives for the defi native you'll hear more about perennial later in the show [Music] welcome back to another THX we have a very special guest here who I'll introduce in a second but just to take a step back Jonah and I have been talking about making real Investments and doing real things and finding things with real product fit and real value and crypto and how difficult that is so with all of that in mind uh We've brought on Smokey from beer chain today which when I first found out about it I legitimately thought this thing was a complete meme I think this was two years ago I just thought it was a joke and then it actually turned into something very real and Smokey's here to explain to us how it is both real and not real at the same time welcome Smokey glad to have you thank you for having me guys yeah truly The Duality of Man or bear if you will um yeah that was actually really funny I don't know if you still remember Obby but uh back in the day when you SL into my DMs it was because there was a pasta going around on like Twitter and it was like bear chain does not exist and like a few more lines and you just hit my DMs with that and then I responded with the exact same thing and I think we repeated that for like four or five iterations and then you're like anyway what the [ __ ] is this thing and like should I be investing I was like yeah totally and then uh that somehow devolved into us making fun of you and Steve tanon bomb and and a number of other things yeah that was that was a hilarious hilarious introduction because I I genuinely thought this was just a meme coin launch yeah me too I didn't I didn't yeah I didn't I didn't really know I didn't really know what it was I just something the content was really funny and every time I saw it I would crack up and know I looked at the bong Bears I'm like dude this stuff is great but when I when when I when I originally was talking to you guys I mean I couldn't I couldn't really wrap my head around what the hell you guys were actually trying to do other than just be hilarious and fast forward two years you've actually you you've done a lot you see you seem to have accomplished a lot I see I see like some pretty insane headlines in the in the news like bar chain raises from insert all top VCS have ever existed and and what's kind of fascinating to me is that you know you've managed to combine this sort of like weird Whimsical nature with what seems to be real Tech um dude how how did Bear chain even start like what what did how did you come up with the idea the backstory is honestly like a A Series of Unfortunate than fortunate events if I think about it um I'll give you like quick background on myself my co-founder you know without doing too doxy um you know myself my co-founder Papa have been in the space for like the better part of the decade um definitely not like OG e Ico but you know a couple years after um we're both originally Founders in the healthcare space you know raised and scaled companies raised Venture Capital blah blah blah Did the whole shebang in the valley um all your classic meme [ __ ] um and of course had fun along the way buying shitcoins um one of my First Investors on my first company was um was pretty senior at the eth foundation back in the day um so you know when you're living in the Bay Area and seeing a whole bunch people you know running in a given Direction you either think everyone else is stupid or you're stupid and I know for a fact I'm very stupid so I decided to you know at least take a shot and follow the crowd a little bit um and you know [ __ ] around the space and then I think like watching the market evolve um you know over the 2017 to 2018 you know like absolute me my co cycle and then like more interesting unique things popping up in terms of uni and curve and a and compound and urine and everything else in between and D5 summer um was always keeping a pretty steady pulse on things while you know effectively in my day job as a Founder than a VC um and I think that at some point it was probably it was early it was late 20 late 2020 early summer 21 when um pop and I had been messing around with a whole bunch of like these like defi 2.0 you know I say ecosystems and discords so like fra alchemics like all that kind of stuff uh Olympus of course can't forget the boys um and we uh we found that like nfts were starting to take an interesting turn on one hand they were starting to become a little bit more financialized and like beyond your you know 10K profile picture Collections and on the other hand um you know you're starting to see things that might have interesting utility as much of a meme as that's become you know three years in the future in that you know like we S I think it was like parallel that actually was like a little bit of an AA moment for us and they were like oh cool these like you know high quality matches the Gathering hearstone on chain type cards and you know they're going to have like Revenue acral potential they're going to turn into something that's more than just like look at my AP bro um and we thought that was interesting so of course we chose to launch an nft collection of 100 completely useless Bears smoking weed because we thought it was funny having been inspired by the greats uh and it honestly just started as like hey let's see what we could do with the nft project and see where we could take it it was like it was very much you know make it up as you go um and we actually decided to raffle these off at like 0.069 e in a whole bunch of different like heavily dii oriented discords um so we ended up doing by accident was cultivating this like initial community of like of bong bear holders that were highly left curved because they were willing to buy a JPEG of a bear smoking weed for no apparent reason um but like you know pretty defin native and and tuned in and sharp as well from the communities that they came from um and I think after enough times where the group is like when marketing you know what happens next like when road map Dev you're like huh maybe we should do something like kind of spicy with this and see we can where we can take it um so we decideed to make those nfts like you know effectively rebase definitely not you know 8,000% apy good old days rebase but expand over time such that if you held one of the first NF collections then you would automatically be entitled to claim one of the uh one the nfts from the second collection for free with a small amount being Minted as like inflation every time so that new people could enter and like buy into it um and what we ended up doing over the course of like four or five collections was effectively bootstrapping a community of a couple thousand like real users which feels like an oddity nowadays um in terms of people who are like on one hand like hey these are kind of fun like with Game Theory mechanics with these multiplying bears and on the other hand maybe there's an actual interesting like endgame or Community there um and at some point actually talk to like the Olympus guys about what it would look like to build oh chain just because we thought that was a funny and interesting concept There Was You Know whole thoughts about what a reserve currency could actually look like and despite you know perhaps Falls from Grace or a number of of of you know reductions in sentiment over the past few years um I think there were a lot of cool ideas that came out of like the you know Olympus defi 2.0 ecosystem like protocol liquidity and a lot of that stuff really did sort of like find its its existence there um and at some point after talking to those guys for long enough along with the own you know that we had developed who was largely like Traders developers retail users um we just tried to better understand like the problems they were facing their day-to-day you know like user environments um and one thing that came up a ton that was just you know kind of silly at first thought was just the trade-off that was experienced between liquidity and security um when someone's actually you know allocating capital on network and that you know nine out of 10 times it's okay I have 32 eth do I run a node or do I you know toss this in light do I toss this in you know like your um your your dexas Unis swaps your obas what have you and and stuff like Lio and nigan layer has very much started to move this in the right direction in terms of allowing you know like one to use lsts to go a lot further um but nonetheless that isn't actually like sort of a that's not really a native out theeg Gates thing right it's something that you opt into it's something that's very much an option uh it's not a default if you will um and we thought to ourselves it was really illogical especially after viewing so many like ghost chains that 2021 2022 cycle with hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars securing the chain but AB you know zero capital or activity actually active on the network that the this had become the metag game so we thought to ourselves what if it was possible to effectively build an ecosystem that allow you to effectively you know align incentives between liquidity and security at the protocol level um and I think more importantly along that time frame as well we were in the peak of like this like [ __ ] zero interest rates phenomenon like drow grants at everything meta where the only differential between a builder going to chain a or chain B was how much money are you going to throw at them um which I think is like incredibly curv completely stupid um and just generally a waste of of time and funds and attracts the wrong type of Builders um so I guess the secondary point in the backr heads was is there a way that we can actually build a system you know from a mechanism design incentive design point of view if you will um at that protocol level that's meant to drive value to the application layer um because when I think about like you know what a future for crypto looks like I think we're moving a in the right direction a lot of different ways right we're seeing you know lower latency blockchains we're seeing higher TPS we're seeing you know effectively better proving systems so on so forth um but really at the end of the day we can build the best infrastructure possible but if people aren't building applications on top of it then it doesn't [ __ ] matter um and I think there are some very like clear use cases that are quite basic in terms of stable coins payments Etc but I think my my strong belief is that if you don't have applications that are uniquely um you know built or existing in an onchain environment then there's very little impetus for someone to actually go from a web two world to a web 3 world and start actually using them right um and we see be chain as more anything a bet on the application layer powered by the chain itself um so you know if I if I sum this all up and put these Rambles into a nutshell um we thought that it made a lot of sense to build be chain because it's the first L1 that allows users to effectively turn their liquidity into security without you know adding leverage risk Etc um and actually use that liquidity to help power the protocols that are building on the Chain itself so hopefully that that gives a little bit of context on you know the story how we got here all that kind of good stuff that that is is a deeply articulate take for a bear apprciate years in the forest man you know what's kind of interesting is that we've been talking for a while about how it's sometimes hard to see how you derive value for the base layer from the application layer right in theory the application layer at some point in the future should be worth a lot more than than the Baseline because the applications are what's actually driving people to use the platform it's what people are actually engaging with in theory they should be able to you know generate some economic value because of that now in the cases of chains like salana uh or really really high throughput high scalable chains having that value uh you know ACR back to the chain it's a little bit it's it's it's it's a little bit tough I mean the chain is effectively just a place for uh you to run code right that's it and you know you you you get some security for that but it's just it's just a place for you to code you've brought this idea of the application and the Bas slay are a little bit closer together right that's that's sort of what you're you're you're you're tie you're tying it together but one one question for you is does that improve that does that improve stability of the platform or is that you know are there are there risks to to to embedding applications so so closely with uh with the base layer in terms of security like what you're describing yeah I think I think it's all a matter of like um Nuance in the process right so the way the bear chain works like at a fundamental level is that while the network itself is still secured like from a you know a stake perspective um by the bar token which is like the gas token of the network is like you know relatively generic in that sense used to pay fees Etc um where it actually does become interesting is like the flow of value in the flow of emissions across the network um so like a typical approv of stake chain right um the vast majority of those of those emissions and block rewards is a chain in flates or as you know more blocks are produced end up going to you know validators and their delegates right um and in most cases in a lot of cases in Pur stake chains they just sort of end up going to the validators and um while they play a very important role in maintaining the security of the network and keeping it up and running um they aren't necessarily the groups that are actually like driving new value or bringing new applications like we talked about into that Network itself right um and I think that in a world where the biggest meme is like cool we've got all this infrastructure and all these layers for people to build stuff on but no one building things on it or you know users to actually use the apps uh that seemed really counterintuitive to us as well um so the way bar chain actually works is that you know validators have to you know post a standard bond with Barett to effectively you know come online or turn on their validator um but then they're also able to get bgt delegated to them bgt is the illiquid soulbound uh rewards emissions token of be chain um which is what block rewards are actually given out in um now the thing is the only way to earn bgt is via providing liquidity on the network in a set of different venues when the chain goes live um this is a pretty vanilla pretty basic set of D5 Primitives so a DEX a per Vault and a stable coin lending Market um but over time and this is where you know things might get spicier from a security Etc point of view um is that it can extend to really any application on the network as voted in Via governance so you could think of it as like curvic of the chain from an emissions perspective at the at the at the network level right uh and instead of those emissions only being able to go to you know pools and a decks they're actually able to go to any smart contract on the Chain um now the thing is um a given validator always has the um the same likelihood of proposing a block however a validator with more bgt delegated towards it I.E more people who have provided liquidity choosing to delegate towards it um will produce a larger block reward when that block when it actually produces the block so in this way the security of the network is not actually threatened in any manner because there's always Bearer at stake securing the network but the validators that have the have effectively worked with the people who have provided the most liquidity to the network stand to gain the most from producing larger block Awards when they actually hit a block this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance perennial is quickly becoming one of the go-to derivatives platforms and liquidity layers for all of defi so let me tell you a little bit about them there are kind of three things you need right when you're thinking about a place and a platform to trade on first one great trade execution second one low fees and third of course an onchain permissionless platform and perennial Nails all three of those buckets with the launch of perennial V2 they've made all of that possible by introducing a ton of new features such as faster oracles which reduce trade execution to seconds lower fees competing with major centralized exchanges and minimizing fees for both takers and makers fully modular markets which allow the protocol to support any price feed out there and fourth cash settled right the trades are cash settled in USD not in crypto perennial allows you the trader to gain access to deeper liquidity with only a fraction of the tvl how it works is that perennial enables a two-sided Market made up of both Traders and liquidity providers right Traders deposit the assets to get leverage exposure while liquidity providers provide these pools of capital to earn fees for taking the other side of the trader position rennial allows you to trade crypto perss FX and coming soon nfts and more backed by some of the best investors in the industry perennial is a must checkout platform if you're a crypto Trader go check them out by clicking the link in the description give thousand XM credit go check out perennial you're going to love them all all right let's get back to the show okay so just zooming back out a bit I have this sort of theory about crypto right now that I've taken a lot of heat for and I wanted to run it by you because it ties into that specific point you just made basically I'm worried that just like you just said there aren't enough apps showing up enough there aren't enough people building applications that that users want to use there's a lot of infrastructure getting built everywhere but like you said um applications need to show up and attract users otherwise what the hell are we doing here so my thesis has been that we don't need more infrastructure uh we need people to build killer apps the push back I've gotten which I would assume you probably agree with is like hey infrastructure has been built and there's a lot of it around but there isn't the right infrastructure and so you know to your point about incentivizing a certain type of activity on your network that's conducive to a certain type of app building like I guess here's my question for you bit of a longwin question but bear with me uh back in the day near did something very interesting which is that they uh rewarded economic activity on their Network by basically paying developers in near uh proportionate to the amount of smart contract activity that a given app would generate and I thought that was really brilliant that's like what the dollar does you you know you participate in the system you get rewarded in dollars that's how Petro dollar economies work etc so they built this Empire this sharded amazing technological Empire with that premise and nobody showed up to the party to build apps um can you maybe touch on why it is that your liquidity based reward system which is you know similar but actually very different as well will reward a certain type of Builder to show up and build like what type of app yeah I know great question man um I think that it Bears resemblance like some like the CSR type stuff we've seen even like the last cycle or two like and I do think that unfortunately a lot of those metrics end up being gameable um which is why I think both the mid curve take and the correct take is that social consensus and capital consensus is what should drive incentive distribution um and I do think that that's very much what what the bear chain system sort of enables right and and just to go to double click on that a little bit more um each validator effectively has a gauge and they can choose how they would like to um you know direct the emissions when they win a block right so they could say hey I've got a bunch of capital in this pool as like myself as a validator I'm going to put all my emissions there or they could say I'm going to put 20% on this pool 20% on that pool 20% on that one 30% in this options protocol whatever it might be right um where I think that gets more interesting is when you add or you explore the incentive Marketplace that's built on top of it this is probably what one would think of most conventionally in defi as bribes um so you can actually have a um you know an application go and say I'm going to give you as a validator or I'm going to post a bribe or an incentive that anyone can pick up and say in exchange for x amount of emissions I will give you y amount of my token to be distributed amongst myself as a validator I'll take some Commission on it and my delegates who've chosen to actually you know provide um to to delegate bgt to me and give me voting power right and with that you actually cause I'd say a new layer of that market to emerge in which people can basically you know decide their own risk preferences and what they want to get more exposure to um now that doesn't answer your core question it just more answers the idea of like you know what is it that actually makes us more interesting perhaps for a protocol in the first place it's that they can decrease their cost of capital right and instead of just doing a classic pool two sort of liquidity mining type program where they're pairing a token against their own token and then emitting a whole bunch of their own token they're actually able to actually you know effectively pay a small amount in their token and ideally based on you know an effective Market receive a number of commissions in the form of that you know chains token itself bgt which one would hope is you know value uring and useful over time right um but I also think the answer is and this has been the biggest efficiency as I see it in most ecosystems is this like Le Fair attitude that if you build it they will come I think that's [ __ ] um I think that if you build it no one will give a [ __ ] and I think that you have to go out there and aggressively tell people um what Solutions you have why they need it and and why it's a good fit right and I think that like we've seen so many people pontificate and build like you know Castles in the Sky about things that have ultimately yielded very little to nothing and maybe they do in the five to 10 year time Horizon um but I very much believe in like power law distributions and I think that if you you know go and hit up a hundred different teams and you know 10 of them are half decent then again out of those maybe there's a chance that one of them turns into a unicorn app right so if you're not going out there and chatting with hundreds if not thousands of Builders um then the chance of finding the next you know Stone you know like just load Stone Crazy app the next Unis swap the next GMX whatever you want to call it on your chain is near zero um so you know I think my my broad answer to that is I think that you can have all the right base plates from an incentive design or from like a builder point of view but if you don't go out there and do the work then it's ultimately useless um having the right design just sort of helps remove friction as I see it but by no means guarantees outcomes wow that's a that's a fantastic answer I I will I will say that you have you guys have definitely figured out how to go out there you're the community and the and the memes and uh I mean it's just it's just absurd honestly what what you've been able like the cult that you've been able to assemble and I think that that that had that had to have been somewhat intentional to build what is effectively a a meme coin cult around real product in a way that I haven't really seen since kind of since link you guys are remind me a lot of link I'll be honest like yeah I know a lot of like pretty like deep hardcore in terms of community at least and then also you know backed up with you know some some you know at least on the side of link I you know some somewhat real Tech and I think that it's kind it's kind of interesting to see that combined because that it's really it's really hard to to do that it's hard to thread that needle to be both to be both a serious you know serious Builders but then have fun while you're yeah it's like it's whim a l people take themselves very seriously what's crazy about it is like your okay so let's take a trafi lateral right if you were going to start a hedge fund you wouldn't name it like pissant Capital LLC so everybody's afraid to a great idea yes let's start this Obby let's let's go found it the thing is because that doesn't attract L LLP um and so because like investors don't want to put their money in something that with a name like that and so what you yet is just this like the opposite end of the spectrum everything is named like brid Bridge Water Bridge Stone Stone Bridge Citadel castle and you know it's all boring you kind of hit that middle of the gradient which is perfect like your background is uh like uh Jesus Christ is a bear with a bunch of bear Apostles it's freaking hilarious like it's whimsical but it doesn't sacrifice the sense of like you're safe on this chain you know it's uh it's you you struck a very very difficult balance like yeah like why bearss Bears make price go down where bro you know what I so I don't know if you guys saw but for our um for April Fool's like gag this year we like rebranded to bullet chain for a day and we like dropped this video that show like the running running up the Bulls and stuff and like how we were going to build a perpendicular evm L for to cardano um and I think that's that's exactly it right which is to say that um I I also believe in if you call it horseshoe Theory or or you know a barbell distribution if you will but I I really do believe that the left and the right curve even out at some point uh and that to win you need to be both highly [ __ ] and highly competent at least in a space like crypto um where the industry is so new but it also very much caters to like a younger demographic as well right um while we are seeing the fidelities and like you know the Franklin templ and so on so forth like starting to actually plow in here and get involved in many cases they're involved by they're they're being advised or or you know they're taking a a good look from someone who is more like closer to our ages right um and I think you have to be able to appeal to that population too I think I also realized a while back that between like our founding team and like just the guys we have on board and what we've seen of the space over time we we weren't going to win by being fed chain um there's no world in which we you know try to to come off as I think polished as s or like miston or like you know polygon depending on whether they're making polygon jokes or not or whatever right and and ended up in in a position of power um I think we realize that we very much had to carve our own path and carve our own brand right and the bears it just felt fitting because it's like okay this whole thing is going to evolve out of an nft project of bear smoking weed then we might as well just like run with it uh so we didn't even actually we called them the bong bears and then someone came into the Discord being like o bonga Bara and then we're like hey that's pretty funny and then we just kind of ran with it and I think that's been a lot a random guy random random [ __ ] is he a is he a court team member now bro I this man like dropped off the face of the Earth like a a couple years ago but like you know his impact is is felt and lasted um and I think for us like what we realized at some point is that uh leaning into that like Whimsical nature if you will um and being able to execute while also being kind of silly um was a space that had not really been fully explored or done right at the protocol level either and it also just sort of felt like correct for us to to your point like the virality is so critical because you can't just build it and expect people to show up and build amazing apps so here we go Smokey get ready for the best transition ever uh you you built the bear chain during Build A Bear during the the bear Market of 2022 um tell us what that was like very few products launched or got conceived of and worked on back then most people were just busy throwing in the towel was it like ring themselves I think yeah was really thing there's a healthy amount of rope around the office but um I think that we we managed to to grind through it for the most part um I guess when I think about that I probably attribute to a couple different things one is that like the community sentiment has always been pretty meaningful right I think that on our side um I think we've typically seen chains built by someone being like okay like I've got you know a Prof at X or Y University or you know someone out of X Y research institution I'm going spin this [ __ ] out raise a bunch of capital and try to make people care um I think we took a very opposite approach which meant that we effectively had a bunch of people who like kind of cared from the beginning and then as more and more stuff came together they still kind of cared um and then you know as we worked our way along and sort of iterated on the idea we saw more people popping up and you know saying Hey I want to build this hey I want to build that um and I also think that like having um seen somebody's like you know just grows their business develop and relationships mature over the last couple years um I think that period of like trauma bonding was also kind of important um it's like when you get hazed in a frat right like you go through some shitty times together but then you end up being closer over a longer period of time right so I think that with that um you know building through the bear was a pain in the ass but it wasn't the worst thing um I think that if we had a live product at the time I probably would not have enjoyed it quite as much because I'm sure it would have just been you know Doom and Gloom and people being like when will dev's fix price Etc um which I you know I truly feel for all of our comrades who had to go through that um but I also think it it provided Mass massive like turnaround opportunities or massive um you know like just hero moments for some groups that we're big fans of like I remember talking to the Pendle guys in like I think late um late summer like early early um fall of like 22 and at the time you know they were sort of like figuring out I think end of V1 early V2 and what that was going to look like um and you know completely rebuilding their internal pricing models and the market had absolutely destroyed them they're like a four or five mil market cap and I talked to them and I'm just like yo these guys are cracked uh and like I'm pretty bullish on interest rates derivatives so I feel like I should pay attention to this um and I wish I bought a bigger bag but then I saw them like you know absolutely kill it for the next couple of years right and you know kill the points meta kill the LST meta everything alongside it um so I guess like it I find that the whole building of the bear thing is just more of a of a barometer of like gritin uh and or like mental fortitude which is to say that if you're a grifter decent chance you tap out there uh and if you're mentally weak decent chance you tap out there as well um I think the we were fortunate to not be in either of those scenarios and it gave us a bunch of good time to go heads down and figure some [ __ ] out that being said like raising towards the end of that was a pain in the ass we were um I remember we were closing up our series a like a week before FTX blew up and then FTX blew up as we were still like taking wires and stuff and it was like ah this is this is less fun than it was a couple weeks ago so um that was definitely an experience wait wait was FDX committed to be an investor at that point no no no no [ __ ] that we were not taking money from FTX we I we we had a conversation with some of the members on their team and they were really unimpressive that's that's really that's really funny I I mean I remember at that point they were basically just throwing money at at everything that they could but but then then the way that the way that they would do it is they would come up to you and they would say we are the best thing that's ever happened to you take our money and give us the best terms ever yeah yeah we we do not negotiate with terrorists so it did not you know no no such luck over here yeah that was a it's a different time that was good it's good you guys persevered through that was a I I mean I I don't think I've ever wanted to rope myself that hard after after FTX like I remember I was sitting there in in the trafi world and it's always it's always BR the best feeling and the worst feeling in the world when tradire looks down on you with disdain and disgust because on one hand you have to deal with all of them but on the other hand you know how good it's going to feel when it starts going back up not in it yeah you know that uh you know that back AR is GNA be crazy yeah it hits differents and everyone told you three months ago that it was gonna die like alive sh shit's alive it also I mean what what what really hits different is when you try to explain to somebody that you invested in something called bar chain and it's like returned you meaning for Capital and they look at you and they're like I invested in Walgreens and it's down 25% today and dude anyone who invested in like biote during the 2021 like covid vaccine boom and whatnot oh my God I I had a lot of fundamentals homies being like what the [ __ ] are you doing in these these internet coins sir yeah this is honestly honestly hilarious but I mean somehow through all of this you man you managed to get some trfy money I think I saw in the latest headline who who who was yeah it was BR Howard on the Howard Howard yeah yeah yeah they're pretty I mean I know they have a crypto business but they're they're pretty Trad fi what is it what is it what is it like like what is it what is it like sitting in front of somebody and trying to pitch them something serious while also needing them to understand that it's like supposed to be a joke because that's good for it right yeah yeah well like compliance definitely didn't get it too easily but like you know they figured it out at some point um after a lot of a lot of leg pulling um I think that the good thing is you know like the the partners at brevan have become increasingly Crypt native over time you know they picked up the guys from the dragonfly liquid desk ET who were you know good friends and early investors of ours so it made that that transition a lot smoother and then I think there's also the fact like in a past life like myself and papa like a lot of our team members we're like we were suits right like we've we've we've had to to be serious on an extreme occasion it's something I really do try to avoid doing but um you know when necessary you got to do what you got to do uh and I think that we were you know capable of cleaning up and more than that I think just like allowing people to take a peak under the hood and and get past First Impressions and I find that that really does tend to be an interesting cognitive distance activity for us I think there were a lot of people who at some point you know rote us off um or were like this is [ __ ] like what the [ __ ] is bar Chain man like you know this this can't be serious um and uh and you know just sort of formed a very strong opinion based on that um but then it's sort of the same thing as you mentioned earlier with the markets right when we actually chatted with them and they got a chance to like you know look under the hood a little bit like oh wait maybe these guys are actually like you know onto something here and in that reversal of like you know someone who's highly against you to to extreme zealot uh tends to be a pretty powerful one if you pull it off properly um so I think that definitely also leans in our favor um but I think you're totally right man like there was a number of times I remember around the time that we were finishing up that race our series a like K was live OS was live and everyone was like trying to compare us to that and we're just like okay cool guys like you know not you know lots of respect for those teams in some cases um but I just think that that's inaccurate and then we'll let the market decide and I think the market has has made made some some noise since then perhaps in One Direction uh so I those those two names I have not heard in a long time so yeah right um I think a lot of them on to cool interesting ideas just like and and I don't think by any means that we've found ourselves in a position of success yet like we still so much to prove and we can still [ __ ] up so many different things um but I just think that like it was very easy for people to Mid curve and uh and also for institutions especially to be like oh but isn't it just this and it's like no not not really well hang on so on that note what does success look like like I mean obviously there was a period of time during the post 2021 Euphoria when you know every new L1 was you know it's like all right get a couple dexes on there something that looks like a clob something that looks like Unis swap V3 uh and a few like basic infrastructure plays maybe an L2 depending on the Chain blah blah blah but like I get the feeling that your chain I I think it has one of the highest throughputs TPS in in the entire crypto space it's capable of processing immense amounts of computation um like surely you know talk to us about your ecosystem and what success looks like and what types of apps you want to see just crushing it on your chain and I'm sure the answer isn't oh just like something that looks like Unis swap but on be chain or oh just another clob um like you know what what is it what does it look like for sure man so you know one thing is I always try to be super you know direct and honest about where we are like where we do win massively and where we don't right um I think that I'd love to see us and we have you know thoughts on how the in the future we can be incredibly scalable right now I think we see ourselves as like one of the fastest most efficient if not the fastest most efficient L1 designs I do expect groups sorry like evm compatible L1 designs because like you know I'm I'm sure that's La is fast than us since we and M have their own you know time frames as well um I think that what we have that's pretty interesting um from a tech point of view really quickly is that like be chain is actually the first completely evm identical L1 so I think you've heard a lot of people say evm compatible you know polygon avax Etc um and that means you know vast majority of things are compatible um but it's still in many cases maintaining some degree of a guess Fork um what bartin actually has is like an identical in execution environment to mainten it in that like you can you know run bechain run the eth environment using like nethermind like like argon like ref what have you any of these different execution clients and for that that means that we don't need a you know team of 20 researchers trying to figure out to maintain a GU Fork it actually means that if there's an EIP or if there's something that actually goes into into place on mainnet or it's upstreamed um you know we can make that change very easily as well um so that compatibility saves us a ton of trouble and also makes it super easy for people to build scaling Solutions rollups everything in between on bear chain um which we're actually already seeing prior to launch which is like pretty exciting for me um and then the other thing is that we use Comet bft consensus under the hood so that we still get that single slot finality that's really nice to have um and is one of those things that's on the ethereum road map um you know definitely Pro I expect the theum to implemented in the same manner as as Comet to effectively caveat that right but um I think we really do end up with the best of both worlds in terms of like a super evm identical environment where if you could deploy something on mainnet you could deploy it on bear chain without having to reinvent the wheel or do extra leg work which tends to be a point of friction um and you get that single slot finality which is super nice from a transaction you know execution ordering point of view um more importantly though like I think that success looks like bear chain being the ecosystem where people go to see cool new things being built um and and I I don't know if I necessarily subscribe to the concept of an e killer I think it's possible in some senses but I don't necessarily know if that's like I don't think that's the game I want to play um the game I'd much rather see us play is one where if you were looking to find the most interesting new applications that actually do have a shot of product Market fit uh they're coming to life on be chain from a cultural and liquidity point of view uh and this sort of goes back to what I was talking about earlier in terms of like shots on net portfolio construction power laws whatever you want to call it um the structure of be chain is meant such that validators drive incentives and drive reward W towards the application layer and I see that as effectively an enabling factor to give the most number of applications the best amount of you know shots on net and opportunities to like reach escape philosopy to break out and actually get real adoption um so you know what I would love to see is like those next groundbreaking apps that end up defining the crypto space as a whole like living on bear chain and then finding their home there before going multi- chain or a fact that we having that as their home based settlement layer whatever you want to call it um and there are a ton so I'll about ones that you know come to mind off right off the top as cool ones to start but like um you know one of them that i' I've been yapping about a bunch recently and I bet you guys would probably think is cool as Traders uh is called exponents um it's effectively A A pretty new take on derivatives and that on one hand it's something that we've seen a little bit more recently in terms of allowing you to take leverage on long-term asset on longtail assets so you know purpose on shitcoins um but the part that gets really cool if you ask me is that they've actually added a different incentive layer on top of that um in that it's not just longing or shorting here's your funding rate Etc they've actually added a separate incentive layer such that one can actually um speculate on on uh trading Direction and say hey I'm going to bribe someone or incentivize Longs or incentivize shorts specifically so you can actually have like you know coins pvping each other in a more explicit manner than ever before if you ask me and that you know if you're like TR versus Bowden for example you can be you know bribing people to to short one coin while long another which I think is very cool Beyond just like you know incentivizing LP which has been The Meta game to date I think that's really cool I think it's something that relies on you know effectively the velocity of capital and something that turns into a pretty crazy like you know yield sandwich when you think about that in the bear chain environment you could have a given pair there um they use sort of unisat Unis swap spot Arbitrage style of pricing but leverage to actually determine like the the fees that are generated by the protocol um and then you add that bribe layer and longing and shorting on top of it and then you add Pro liquidity andm missions on top of that like that in itself becomes a really cool set of applications for someone to build around um you know there's groups that are building you know funkier stuff in the consumer space I was telling you guys a little bit prior to the call um there's one that I've I've been calling Vape to earn on bear chain it's actually quit smoking to earn um but it's called Puff paaw it's super cool and then a bunch of really sharp guys who've shipped like you know um 75 million Vapes to some of the leading you know tobacco manufacturer Vape manufacturers in the world and are partnered with some of the largest like quit smoking applications in the world and it's actually like a custom made like dpin Vape that incentivizes you to decrease your nicotine usage over time and you get like more tokens for using less nicotine until you get down to effectively a green tea extract um that one that one's an absolute that that's that's that's actually really cool uh it's I've heard of an application in crypto that actually helps people with their health everything else destroys I think it's really cool because like my thesis on a lot of these like I think the tokens are are incentivization tools in many cases right and what they do is they actually take a behavior that people are already accustomed to doing and allow them to potentially financialized it that's that's broadly how I think about crypto gaming as well in cases where it might work right it's like if you could play RuneScape versus playing RuneScape that's like 75% as good but maybe you could make a few bucks I feel like you play the second one as long as the quality like drop off isn't massive right so I think stuff like that is really cool I'm like I've always been a defi guy so I think that like you know I'm super excited about the defi ecosystem there there's a group called um Shogun that's that was incubated by us as was as was pffpa the V turn one um that's really exciting and those guys are effectively building um what's the best way of putting it they're building a platform that allows you to trade any asset from any chain um without any without any difficulty there as then if you want to go from you know Sayan on say to you know Bowden or DJ on Soul they they make that trade rout possible and they have some very interesting just in time liquidity vaults that allow you to turn me effectively into Trader extracted value and like put that back in the hands of the user um so basically uh an intense layer intense solver system um combined those just in time liquidity vaults that allows you to to get the best execution possible without ever leaving your home network um I think that kind of stuff is really cool um there's zero day to expiry options with the guys from ivx um there's credit default swaps and distress debt on chain um from the guys that concrete Finance um dude that that's one of my favorite ones more recently um Founders a you know a prolific onchain Deen but trained as a surgeon at Oxford then was a VP for years at 72 then was absolutely in the trenches buying and selling jpeg tokens with me um you know little did I know uh and is now built you know one of the most interesting onchain derivative systems I've seen um so all that kind of stuff is is coming to the Eco um pretty sweet so where are you guys aren't on mainten though right now right you just launched yeah so how did you get all these people to start building on just test you know that that's been uh I think that's been very difficult in general for people to get any activity prior to mainnet launch and I mean you're talking about all these projects so I mean it seems like you have a lot of projects even though you're still on tus right yeah for sure I think that like for us man it was um it was seeing that if we actually took a very proactive approach to this it's very possible to get people to build especially if they understand that like um they understand that they really have an opportunity to like do more with their applications on bear chain than anywhere else like I think the the fact is like proof of liquidity feels tangible it feels like something where it's not just like Hey we're going to give you this Grant and like please stay with us for a few months it's hey there's a way that you guys can actually should be effectively enshrined into the block creation block Awards process on a chain uh and I think that that is you know kind of special for applications uh in terms of a just thinking about their own road maps and capital efficiency uh and B I think tapping into the culture that's been built as well right I think there's like a very like collegial like you know feel of camaraderie uh and we've gotten like you know teams together in the past for dinners and events and you know token and Denver and stuff um and it's crazy to see them come together uh the other thing that we've done that I think helps supplement that is we also have um an incubator program that's run at arms length from the foundation called builda um and that basically helps incubate work closely with five teams every every six months um that are just meant to be cool new exciting things that are there to set a bar for quality in the ecosystem um and you know the goal there is really to help teams that go to market help them figure out fundraising all the stuff that actually you know is required to to build a lasting company um you know figuring out their tokenomics and management structure and what it takes to scale in organizational internationally how they have to figure out their taxes and like legals and all that kind of stuff um and use that to like you know give those guys a leg up so I think we' really we really do view the foundation/ laabs whatever you want to call it as an extension of the ecosystem and it's very much there to empower people um and I think that by combining that with you know proof of liquidity is a fundamental um with the culture that's being built of like you know [ __ ] around find out but do it in a really effective way um you end up with with a pretty you know magnetic group for Builders um so I think that that's been our our great Edge honestly and also making sure that we don't like take our feet off the gas right like the the team has been incredibly incredibly competent when it comes to going out there and tongue Builders how they have an opportunity to win on bechain and you know how we're there to help make that a reality well I mean I love that you obviously need Community I I I experienced this the the hard way where you know back when salana was trading $20 I I I fed salana and the community just came out and took me out and basically you know I think I think that that was an early sign that the token was going to adx from there right like if you've got a strong community of people fighting to create valuable products and build things that people want even in bare markets um and fight back against fud like you know you have something lasting so if you're seeing that Community inside of your ecosystem already that's like a phenomenal sign even if you haven't made it to main that but one thing I I I heard you say that that really kind of I found inspiring I think our listen would appreciate is that you know you talk about the gamification of activities that haven't been gamified yet but but should be you know like vaping for example or quitting smoking um also X to earn right play to earn or or quit vaping to earn you know it's obviously a massive a massive use case for crypto but I I honestly think that one of the reasons why with you know a few notable exceptions like axi Infinity it hasn't really caught on in a sustainable way is because in order for your earnings to you your earning tokens right you're not earning greenbacks so in order for your your earnings to kind of be sustainable and for them to hold their value there needs to be like you said liquidity and so there hasn't really been a chain until now that's kind of guaranteeing pools of liquidity for all these different types of applications or at least building it in at the at the L1 level uh the way that that yours does so I think that's super important in order to unlock that massive potential in crypto for you know X to earn applications to go live and and scale yeah thank you man and like you know we very much do see liquidity as a lifeblood of of Defi and then defi to be fundamental in crypto nowadays right um I think everything you see whether that's like the fantasy top like bonding curves or like pump fun stuff or like everything is in some manner Downstream of or or or tapping into a defi ecosystem right um I just think that some things are more obvious than others um and I think that like you know a lot of people think oh can Pro liquidity only be useful for defi apps I don't think so actually I think it can actually play a role in a whole bunch of different things because almost everything has some element of of liquidity Centric ISM right um so I think that's also where I'm very excited in the long term um you know we're starting to see plans right now that are at very early stages for proof liquidity being used um outside of the bar chain ecosystem if you will for for extensions I'll leave that one a little bit more amorphous um but I think we'll see those assets doing a lot more than just providing liquidity on be chain over time which I think will be really exciting um I think we're seeing more like nfts Games social apps um you know all the stuff that is an extension of the culture if you will um and then these l2s which present their own like interesting world right because the bearan has its own brand it has its own like selection of of life if you will um but I think we're seeing you know highly competent groups from consumer gaming like media Etc go and build l2s that are going to roll up to Bear chain and sort of take advantage of and draw on that native Community but also help to onboard like tens of millions of new folks in a completely sort of like um in in a same same but different manner if that makes sense in that they'll very much be an extend or an arm of the brand but they'll have their own ecosystem their own lifestyle uh their own you know culture that can that can go back and forth here and I think that that's part of what also becomes very interesting about building this anonymously um and that we end up being a little bit amorphous in terms of what the identity of bear chain is right on one hand people could view it as a defi chain other hand people can view it as a meme chain on the other hand people can view it as you know an application acceleration layer right people can say oh it's like something between evm and Cosmos like there there's a hundred different ways to view it and I think that um where things get really interesting is by having a number of different extensions of that brand that allow it to tap into all the different demographics like not it's not us trying to boil the ocean it's can we in a B2 B to C manner find enough ways um to spread the good word in enough places where it actually makes sense such that you know everyone has a reason to care about bear chain um and I think that like that's one thing that you know going back to that Sal example I think they've been doing a really good job of that at different points of their life cycle um you know and I think that it's exactly what you mentioned like having the the community beat down or the ability for someone to get absolutely you know wrecked by a community is one of the most bullish things possible saw that a ton back in the day with link and at some point Omen stuff and I think we're seeing that too but that only comes when you have people who care about all these different aspects of it whether it was like you know the magic Eden ecosystem and the [ __ ] like oh my God I feel what those robots were called and then the torans and all that or the deepend ecosystem there or like pump fun and defi stuff I think I honestly do think they one of the best to have done it so far and I have a lot of respect for what those guys have put together as well from a uh you know I'd say a longevity point of view and also just like a scope and performance point of view interesting I mean yeah I I couldn't agree with what you you just said more and in terms of like what our listeners care about PE people that listen to a trading podcast hosted by Traders tend to want to know like where's the money how am I going to make money off of this somehow and so just in thinking about how to bridge the gap between your community and the trading community one thing that just immediately pops into my mind is if you're building a liquidity focused L1 um the money is where there's going to be liquidity for your tokens for your your your earnings um and so I can kind of see if I were to try and brand bar chain it would be uh the chain where the chain where you don't basically get rugged by disappearing pools um I don't know if you want to Brand it that way but because it's like because you can't validate without basically staking liquidity into the network uh I applications that touch bar chain are ultimately going to be more stable for people who earn tokens on those applications I I think that's part of it and I think like what I'd even sort of double click on even more is it's it's a chain that's built to provide the majority of its value that's being generated towards applications and users like ultimately it's like you know validators to apps and apps to users in terms of like that flow of of incentives if you will and I think it's you know there's a way that you could position it that's probably a little bit more B but it's like you know in a sense the chain rewards you to use it right um the the term that we've been playing around with internally is like this whole idea of like you know have your steak and eat it too and that the whole idea is like you know on bear chain you go and you You LP and whatever you want use whatever protocol you want and if that protocol happens to be one of the ones that is whitelisted or that is receiving emissions from you know from the the protocol the chain itself uh then you know you're getting whatever rewards that you normally would get but you're also getting this additional upside in in the governance token SL the emissions token of the chain right and then you can choose to use that to compound in whatever manner you like you can go stake that with a validator that is incentivizing the pool that you're already you know taking part in and effectively use that to compound your own rewards you can use that to stake with a validator that is effectively receiving incentives or bribes from another protocol that you want exposure to that's like a you know a longtail call option effectively right there's I think a lot of game theory and a lot of different choices that the user has um all without sacrificing the basic behavior that they'd want to take either way so I guess when I think about it it's like you're getting to do what you want or you're getting to to pursue your average user user Behavior ideally with a whole bunch of fun cool new applications if you choose to use them um and you're just reaping the benefits of of actually having exposure to a new ecosystem um so I don't think any system is is truly perfect but I do think that there's a lot more thought put into the incentive alignment across all parties here you know that's actually really exciting because this reminds me like this particular conversation the last 50 minutes of us talking reminds me a lot of the convers ations that I used to have in 2021 or 2020 when people were actually building new and Innovative def5 applications feel like I haven't had a conversation like this in a very long time everybody's so everybody's just so focused on like dogs with Hats which I I love I love a dog with a hat like I love I love them it's good Tech it's good Tech it's good Community it's good cult however sometimes you know it's nice to you know get get in the weeds of something something new and Innovative and the other things you know not to not not to talk bad about other projects you know a lot of the latest projects that release aird drops a lot of the l2s they're they're they're sort of effectively the same they're they're all the same across the board totally right it's just okay yeah maybe this uses a slightly different version of ZK Tech than this you know but it's all basically the same um yeah and I think I think's I I think in the market there's just been a lot of fatigue from this because people are are really tired and the reason that they they keep chasing Mo coins are one because of the returns but too because there aren't people working on or releasing interesting things and it's just very it gets it gets very repetitive over and over and over so I think a lot of people in crypto the way that I would phrase it have gone back from being users like I was a power user of crypto for two years three years I have I I probably have used crypto Less in the last you know like actually messed around on chain Less in the last 18 months um than I did in like one month in 2021 because you know there were just so many things to do back then right and there's just it almost seems like there's less to do today which I mean I think there is um in terms of you know at least at least what I'm what I'm doing what I'm doing day today so this kind of it's kind of fun to listen to we're gonna have to everybody should go check it out can we can we use the test net is it public yeah yeah dude 100% it's it's usable it's pretty pretty Snappy I enjoy it um and we're seeing a bunch of applications starting to go live on it we we basically moved over from our old test net to a new one like about two and a half three weeks ago um and with that we're going to see a lot of the Old Guard redeploying um but there's already some pretty fun daps on there to play around with so I think that like that's exactly it OB it's like I want like we want to make crypto fun right I think that uh if there's any brand or any community that that probably has a good chance of making that happen um from a Vibe point of view and and also from an application point of view I think we've got a lot of shots on that over here um and I think that like what I care about is is what I mentioned and what you just touched on which is like net new things you haven't seen somewhere else um and I think we've seen like a couple like flashes in the pan over the last you know six to 12 months like there's definitely been you know four or five times I'm like hey that's something cool and new but I don't think it's like as usual by by any means and our goal is to keep like a a steady stream of interesting things on bear chain right because my high level thesis is that like I think the most altel ones or most you know chains that are not main net and and maybe salana but I think mostly just not main net can really only sustain like 10 to 15 if you're really if you're really optimistic maybe 20 applications and actually get a bunch of use without like a ton of like liquidity fragmentation and and lack of real usability um and I think that that's ideally some degree of like a rotating set right I think there's always a few that will remain in that it's like [ __ ] English English Premier League teams or something right there's always a few that that stay up at the top of that league but there's a few that swap out but there's like a very solid cohort that that ends up being at the front of that Cambrian explosion um and I want to make sure that bear chin has like the coolest ones at the front of that P and there's some that're like really [ __ ] fried um but there's some they're like just things I think could completely reinvent the way that we think about the industry right so on one hand we have B.T which is like literally like you know AI bear reporters that will talk about [ __ ] and eventually is going to turn into like a maple story megaphone kind of thing where you can use that for distribution of content and bidding over slots where you can actually like talk through people and whatnot and it's effectively a Content distribution engine or you have like you know gummy fi which I maybe you met those guys at one point I'll be like you know allowing you to basically borrow lend against any asset and like an order book style under the hood um with share liity profiles say desired so like you know what I mean you get The Duality and I think that's that's really important like you got to have your stuff that's just good [ __ ] bent and you got to have your stuff that's like Future Finance and sometimes they're one the same I like I I I love it I'm I'm so on board with this and and I wanna I want to mess around onchain again just just talking you about this like AI when are we gonna when are we gonna start tokenizing random people who are trying to quit smoking and like bribe them to fall off the wagon and play against each other you know holding your level of the game bro OB you're on mute are you saying incentivizing people to relapse Jonah yeah I that that is what I said but now I feel bad for saying it no it's okay it's okay look I I think look if you can go one way you can go the other way we're all capital this year my my favorite was like we were trying to figure out like you know what that flywheel looks like we're like Okay so this Vape earn it's like zind to win but like do you do you eventually go back to like straight sigs like how do you how do you continue this Loop and it's like hm maybe we shouldn't continue this Loop but dude honestly I I I've actually s SS are making a comeback I are Lindy now I think Lindy I think people are getting tired of you know the the blueberry ice Vapes and like the strawberry raspberry sorbet like inhaling that stuff I can verify that in the in the Commodities industry there's like for every one genen Z with like the banana um ice Vape there's like three guys outside at any given time smoking them really yeah that is Edge remember return to tradition return to tradition this is this is what it's all about at the end of the day remember where you this is how we win the future of Finance is Good Vibes I like this this is good I Tommy if if I were to put the Future Finance in anyone's hands I'm happy to give them to you Smokey you're you're too kind you're too you just got to get the um the air conditioned bear suits for the future conv I bet those things get look I I don't want any sweaty bears in charge of fin yeah no no honestly you need the marshmallow Style with the big fans like a like nice nice large headset all the good stuff real deck outle bear suits putting putting the fundraises to good use amazing dude uh we we appreciate you know we appreciate you coming on smooky this is definitely one of the most fun podcasts we've done definitely so cheers man I'm always happy to entertain we'll have to have you back on once you guys launch main net and then you can meticulously walk all of our listeners through exactly how to make money on be chain and if they lose any money on be chain you can guarantee their funds right yeah yeah totally that sounds exactly like some that my my legal compliance Department would love NFA NFA nothing nothing on this podcast has been Financial advice please don't listen to us about anything we are literally interviewing a bear none of this so appreciate it um but yeah well we'll catch you soon Buddy any last say to our audience uh yeah man I guess I'd just say like um you know would love to see you guys [ __ ] around and testing out the the bear chain test net and playing in the community a little bit and keeping an eye on things when we go live I think the the goal for us is to when we when we think about what we care about and achieving going live it's on one hand you know helping to reach new users and making that like lots of people have an opportunity to get involved in be chain um on the other hand you know if the Chain's called proof of liquidity there better be a bunch of of liquidity on it so making sure we bring a whole bunch of capital into the ecosystem uh and then doing right by all the application Builders community members folks that

take July off just look for Alpha stop worrying about trying to pick the bottom unless we trade 55 maybe 52 like don't don't worry about going all in don't worry about lever long and BTC and then depending on where we are August mid August all right this [ __ ] this shit's going higher uh so make your Sho make make your shopping list of coins now and I'll see you at 100K at the end of the year see you then this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance the onchain defi primitive redesigning derivatives for the defi native you'll hear more about perennial later in the [Music] show all right welcome back to another episode of a THX now we're actually going to be talking about markets I know you guys missed us last week we went deep on we went deep on R weave but enough has happened in the markets that I think it's worthwhile talking about so we sold off pretty aggressively tagged that 585 level bounced really hard and now we're sort of just Meandering around I mean that this has been like I actually think that the market was reasonably easy to trade up until the last week or up until that sell off so I don't know about you Jonah but I I bid a lot on that day that we collapsed and then we bounced and I wasn't really sure if that was the full bottom or not so I ended up taking off a lot of profit on that initial bounce and then what ends up happening is that you know we're like hitting 62 62 kind of hard to get through um but I made a bet around you know 615 that we were going higher so I end up buying a lot of just a lot of length end up lifting all this Salon of meme coins uh I grew a rally stash hoping that we'd get to 64 and then the US government starts moving BTC we sell off we get down to that uh you know 6,800 level and I just go ah [ __ ] did I make a mistake adding adding a ton of length end up basically cutting all my positions getting getting to Flat selling you know BTC against uh some of some of the alts um I ended up getting out of all the all the soul and all the uh whiff and bunk and then I wake up today and uh an hour later you get this crazy Salon ETF news and everything that I sold is up [ __ ] 20% and that's just the life of a Trader Jonah that's that that's the life of a Trader you're you're never you're never always going to be perfect I mean you know we can Pat ourselves on the back from missing the draw down but um the reality is that it's a this is this has been a tough Market I think I think for a lot of people it's hard to maintain conviction because they're like the camps are so divided right now it's okay well there's one that says we're at the bottom of the range we defended it now we go to the top of the range now the're real rally starts bad news isn't sending us lower but the reality is that there's still we're still not getting a ton in ETF inflows uh you know bitcoin's still trading a bit weak it's kind of hard for it to to get through to get through significant significant levels um but alts are down 80% across the board you have some dispersion that's come back in the market which is really good to see and eth and soul have been trading really well and we're kind of in this weird spot here where uh you know I think Bitcoin has become the weak asset everything else is is is Trad trading a lot better the question is well how do you trade that market environment right how do you if if you want to trade it how do you how do you trade it because one one of the things that's that's scary right is whenever you get this dispersion in the market alts are doing well bitcoin's not if Bitcoin pukes down to 55 these alts are you're dead they're probably down 30 40% on you then you're in the hole so it's like this weird dynamic where it's very easy to get chopped up it's very easy to to to make to make mistakes and it's also hard to build conviction so when you're in this type of Market environment like what do you do Joe well first of all I just want to say I appreciate you being a little bit vulnerable on the podcast and saying hey you know I added length I sold it a bit lower and then I watched the coins that I sold rally and I wasn't participating like I really admire that you're willing to do that because you know even even me on you know just when I talk about my positions often I'm inclined to talk about my wins and pretend I never lose um so I think it's important for for everybody to just be honest with themselves and you know it's nice to hear that you know even even crypto traders who have you know made it like you in a in a major institutional way can you know still have these feelings that like even the very beginners have so you know it's nice to hear you talk about it I what I do in these markets what's what's kind of funny is that you know I've traded a lot this month I've put on you know probably more than hundred million dollars worth of volume through on trades this month alone and I'm flat because of uh you know I I I'm H I avoided the draw down right but I'm still like basically flat on the month even with all this effort that I put in which is kind of funny uh you know some times that's just how trading that's just how trading works I mean I'll P you know you get I give myself a little pat on the back just because I didn't take a loss yeah I mean if you're if you're trading that much volume transaction costs are negative and guaranteed so if you're trading that much volume in and out like you know you your your basically your process made money and you bled it back on transaction costs is basically what what happened small you know like yeah it's it's hard to trade that much volume and not lose money it's that's a lot of volume to be in and out of um but yeah I appreciate that you're you're telling the truth and being being you know honest because it gives all of us license to be honest too um what I do in these markets is nothing like I look at the chart and I just see something that's been ranging since February since late February I see the more I zoom out the more I just see this like flat line like realize 60-day realized volatility in Bitcoin obvious is 35% okay like this is it's this this asset looks like a trafi asset in terms of how little it's doing so you know like it's very easy to get hyper involved when it's rallying and then hyper bearish when it's selling off um I try to remind myself that this thing is going sideways it is boring and um not to touch the screen like I have have like a yellow sticky note on my monitor saying don't overtrade uh that's basically how I deal with these types of ranging sideways markets I'm I'm a momentum Trader by uh persuasion like I I I just love momentum trading you know in Commodities and especially in like the refined product space you find mean reversion traders who just love selling highs and buying lows and you know if if you're a mean reversion Trader this is a great Market every time it goes up to 68k you sell every time it goes down to 63k you buy and you just round trip that again and again you would have had a really awesome few months but like how many of those Traders exist in crypto really like people who tried to fade moves in crypto uh all died like um you know $50,000 ago in Bitcoin they they got fired or stopped out or rage quit because they lost so much money so what you're left with is this group of momentum Traders like you and me um and we struggle during these times when it's ranging so basically the only way to make money in a market that's ranging this tightly is to have a process something you can cling to when the Market's going down and something you can use as a framework to decide if you should be adding or selling on rallies so like if you don't have a process and the market sells off you start to doubt yourself because you're obviously long then if something comes up like the US is moving you know tokens to coinbase kind of thing then you can panic and sell which is right which is the right thing to do you get out of the way of flows but then when when deciding whether or not to Reby that's where your process kicks in um because you're you're scared you've just avoided a a steamroller you don't know what to do next you have to have some framework and for me I don't really have a good systematic framework like the systematic Frameworks that I learned at Cumberland are all mid-frequency things that like basically with an Outlook of minutes or hours that I can't really replicate in my PA because I don't care enough and I don't have time um but like you know in terms of this type of like longer frequency trades with the Horizon of days or weeks I got nothing systematically so really the only frame work that I cling to right now Obi is the idea that I'm like ludicrously bullish for Q4 like I think by then we'll be like really rallying so all that's the only thing that allows me to psychologically hang on and if we go you know I kind of have this $55,000 level in mind if we go down there I'll probably buy more in the meantime all I'm doing is [ __ ] around at the meme coin casino which I don't really consider investment I like you you're probably trading it as levered crypto right for me it's more just like something to have fun with while I'm bored with the benchmarks this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance perennial is quickly becoming one of the go-to derivatives platforms and liquidity layers for all of defi so let me tell you a little bit about them there are kind of three things you need right when you're thinking about a place and a platform to trade on first one great trade execution second one low fees and third of course an onchain permissionless platform and perennial Nails all three of those buckets with the launch of perennial V2 they've made all of that possible by introducing proding a ton of new features such as faster oracles which reduce trade execution to seconds lower fees competing with major centralized exchanges and minimizing fees for both takers and makers fully modular markets which allow the protocol to support any price feed out there and fourth cash settled right the trades are cash settled in USD not in crypto perennial allows you the trader to gain access to deeper liquidity with only a fraction of the tvl how it works is that perennial enables a two-sided Market made up of both Traders and liquidity providers right Traders deposit the assets to get leverage exposure while liquidity providers provide these pools of capital to earn fees for taking the other side of the trader position brenal allows you to trade crypto perss FX and coming soon nfts and more backed by some of the best investors in the industry perennial is a must checkout platform if you're a crypto Trader go check them out by clicking the link in the description give thousand XM credit go check out perennial you're going to love all right let's get back to the show I think I think that's a very key point which is don't overtrade don't try to do too much in this market environment focus on the alpha focus on what actually matters directionally punting is tough I mean you can have your core allocation if you know you're bullish on crypto but then with your trading it's about okay well instead of trying okay I'm gonna buy a ton here I think the bitcoin's going up let me try to bet on that it's just so easy to get shaken out speaking from experience that it just doesn't make sense in this particular environment to be very aggressive now like what what do I mean by Alpha right it's things that you genuinely have an edge on things that you think are going to work regardless of if bitcoin's at 65 if bitcoin's at 55 you know and and this is a lot of pair trading I mean so one trade that I've had on uh for a while is just short all of these coins that have massive unlocks coming that are super high FTV you hold it against eth and Bitcoin and soul like you know maybe you have like five million bucks of that long you have five million bucks of those coins short and then over the next month two months can be pretty confident that that outperforms you obviously have to be worried about squeezes and whatnot but most of these things have actually a positive funding which is wild because I just think there's so much spot selling involved I think that's wild too still can't believe it yeah why who's who who's paying funding oh actually I know exactly who's doing that it's the people who every time it starts to Rally they uh they get their their gambling addiction like starts to tickle them and then they go and on you know buybit and okx and get long with leverage on these on these sort of you know altcoins or shitcoins depending on the the token dour and uh and then as soon as the market sells off they all get liquidated like this week we had the big or during that big puke down to 58,500 we had the biggest long liquidations since April uh so clearly there are still people out there who just can't resist getting levered long guys if gals if you're out there getting levered long altcoins right now paying funding away every day bleeding just hoping to catch this next up move in a Range like the market can stay rangy longer than you can stay solvent and if it goes down which is kind of a coin toss in a ranging Market you get liquidated don't do it like please stop with the leverage it makes no sense it's it's it's really it's insane to me that that people still do that like uh just taking taking a step back looking at the market where do we think things are going to go what do we think is going to happen my personal view is in line with yours but maybe a little bit earlier so I think that Q3 can be very good I think that Q3 basically what's going to happen is over the summer you don't have a lot of decision makers in the market that are actually making big decisions everybody that's allocating real capital is probably [ __ ] off in Europe somewhere they in the Hamptons or who God knows God knows where these people are and so all the institutions the people that are buying that are that are buying BTC even retail they're less engaged during the summer they're just less engaged so what tends to happen is that come September M these people come back in the market and now that we have the ETF vehicles that are going to be live you're going to probably I'm 80 90% sure that the EF will be live by September 1st the after Labor Day these people are going to come back and they're going to start buying I think they're going to start they've made they've made their decisions they're going to come back in the market so what does this mean for us it means that July is probably going to be tough but you're probably going to see some front running mid August into into labor day and then we can really start to get that up move it's possible that we trade 52 in July at some point because there's a lack of inflows because there's a lack of interest and that's why I'm nervous uh and that's why I'm you know trying to take a step back don't overtrade don't get chopped up you know when you get crazy really in crypto when it comes to trading directionally you kind kind of only want to trade at the extremes right when something nuts is happened so for example or you want to you you have to trade when you need to get out of the way of something like a big us Marshalls sale or an FTX like event sometimes you just have to like pull your chips off the table before the table emulates itself right but so so you know sometimes that that's that's exactly what went through my mind when I cut all my positions when the US government started moving their coins and then everything went up for I mean I couldn't have known that vanak was going to come out with this fake ETF list thing this fake ETF product um I say fake because I don't think it's going to get approved there are no CME Futures on this thing uh Vanek is I think running a marketing campaign off of it if Black Rock files it's very very very different story uh but I I don't I don't believe that Vanek even believes internally that it's going to get improved I think that they're just doing it to generate some hype because it' be very really if Biden is reelected zero chance if Trump is reelected which you know Nate silver said puts a 65% then I think there's probably a 20% chance that maybe the 30% chance that during at some point during his administration the salana ETF gets approved uh but as of right now as it stands today I think very unlikely that that happens that doesn't mean I'm short Soul it just means that I'm not you know I I wouldn't put all my chips on the table I'm not gigal along you know hard hard for me to have known that a priori that selling whiff at you know 195 or whatever I stopped out at uh would would have been a would have been a bad bad idea no you did the right thing you you you got out of the way of the steamroller which our our listeners should always do like if something you know there's obviously a balance here like if a you hear something that's like marginally bearish you're not supposed to to take all your chips off the table but if there's like a massive amount of government flow about to smack the market in you know nine or 10 figure size imminently which is what happens when uh tokens get sent to a major exchange like you get out of the way now something that I'm horrendous at in my oil trading career is I'm very good at getting out of the way of those things or getting in as they're like just before they're happening and profiting but then what I'm terrible at is taking my position off afterwards or if I've taken it off rea it like I'm I'm very bad at resetting to the state that preceded my drastic action and I've lost so many millions of dollars in my oil career over the years like for example um getting long for all the right reasons uh ahead of you know a very bullish summer in 2018 but then when Trump wavered uh Iran sanctions and oil started to puke um I I was in denial like I'd gotten in for the right reasons but then I I didn't realize that the world had changed equally like you know in in this example like you get out of the way of a big Steamroller out of out of a big selling flow you and I both know that selling flow doesn't last for months or years or if it does it doesn't have an impact on the market like you have to get back in quick right and I'm I'm terrible at that I'm I'm terrible at re actually I actually have a psychological trick for you because I also was horrendous at this I've gotten a lot better by doing this I mean let's say let's say you uh I'll give you the example start without 100 $ you're long you're long a 100 bucks and you get this news of the government sell and you get out you sell right and then it bounces back and nothing happens you're like wait a second well the way that most people's their brain works is because they sold and it didn't work they get anchored to the idea that it's bearish and you start you start looking for reasons why the market is bearish and then you convince yourself that it's bearish and then you never get back in position and if it rips in your face you're [ __ ] and sometimes by the way by the way sometimes that's a right thing to do sometimes it actually is bearish but you in that moment are not looking at it clearly you're not looking at it clearly so what do you do how do you reset your brain you buy $5 worth you buy tiny size you get back in to your original position a little bit not a huge amount not the not what and then your brain starts to go well maybe you know if bitcoin's up at least I'm up now so you start to look for the bullish reasons and that you know that actually resets your brain a little bit and you're not risking a ton you're not getting chopped up a huge amount but what it does is it helps you you have skin in the game again you have skin in the game again and it helps you think more clearly it's amazing how difficult it is to understand a market without skin in the game and you have a very solid point it's like it's tempting to just be on the sidelines after something's just happened anchored to that thing even if it's gone and dissipated but then you should have skin in the game because then you feel the market a little bit more without without the 100% risk that you were running previously that's really smart I like that I I've done that like inadvertently without realizing I was doing it a couple of times and now that I I reflect on it that was a successful way to maneuver myself back into things I should just like write that down in my trading journal and do that more often thank you Obby that's really helpful yeah I'm I'm I'm happy you found some value in it it's amazing how many things about trading are psychological because even if you're extremely data driven which I know we both are it's if you're a discretionary Trader at the end of the day even if you're using a lot of quantitative metrics you still have to make that decision and what ends up happening in these moments is you you end up introducing inertia so when you get on the sidelines and then that decision to get on the sidelines doesn't seem like it's playing out your instinct as a human is to just stay there because you don't want to deal with the idea that you were wrong so the the buying it what buying a tiny bit what it does is it helps you accept that you might have been wrong and then you look at it clearly and then you make a decision this is this is the right way to do it this is so smart and also what's so beautiful about this idea is it dovetails absolutely perfectly with our earlier conversation and something that I really a point I really wanted to make which is that you said all the big hitters are you know off to you know wherever wherever hit go for the summer I don't know Shad uh St Morris that's the winter any I I don't know that's a win are you even a social obviously not people go to mikinos whatever the point is the hitters are the hitters are hitting they're not they're not at or sorry they're not hitting they're at the um they're they're at the uh the beach club but you know who else is not playing right now all the people who just got burned on this chop all the momentum traders in crypto who have been moment mum trading for years and this now now we're in a Range they've gotten chopped up they're pissed off they've taken their chips off the table and they're not doing an Avi there's not like 5% of the chips back on they're just out out and what happens in those markets is uh like like in this happens in oil too especially during the summer like you said you know if it's a summer where everybody's super dialed in like the summer of Ukraine then whatever but uh this summer people are going to dial out the crowd that's gotten chopped up and lost a bunch of money is out so like who's providing liquidity moves get gappy in these environments like sell-offs they go lower than they would have otherwise if there are a bunch of people like aggressively clicking and buying because of whatever reason uh rallies tend to get extended to the upside and you end up with these like kind of random noise brownie in motion High amplitude hard to analyze markets so like not overtrading this is key things can get violent um and a lot of people from the institutional player to the uh you know the day-to-day traders who who would be trading but like are sidelined right now for the reasons we just discussed all that liquidity is out so who's left like who's left there's it feels like the initial spat of Institutions coming in to get like kind of uh structurally long via the ETF it feels like that flow's died off but the ETF inflows and outflows are massive Obi like there was you know I think there was a streak of like $1.2 billion dollar worth of outflows that just got broken this week and what's happening there is I think there are institutions that are playing basis so not all of it is like directional flow it's just you know people getting in and out of the ETF against CME Futures but that also drives sentiment so people see ETF outflows and they freak out and sell so ultimately what you're left with is these like CTA like um kind of momentum players in a ranging Market it's a real recipe for losses so what I'm doing is I'm maybe I should maybe I should be I'm I'm long but I'm not like trying to trade this range I'm long with a plan to add if it if it really Shanks because like you I think uh I think we're going to be in for quite a rally later this year every having in the past has preceded one and I don't think this time's any different maybe maybe it's as simple as uh selling short dated Vault buying long-dated VA um you know just trying to find places where the view that you express you actually have high conviction in like if you decide to go buy a ton of alts right now or you decide to go long BTC or you decide to go long eth what's your actual conviction level of right like for it's like it's it's one thing if I mean I'll give you an example right you're super bullish on eth um you think that eth is eth is going up but if he trades 3,300 then you stop out of the position how convicted are you actually right like what what is the what is the actual trade that you're putting on this is really important to to to to recognize to stop yourself from getting chopped up and the way that you can think about is like okay well I buy here I wake up tomorrow bitcoin's at 60k what am I doing do I have more money to buy am I stopping out of my position if you're stopping out you're probably not supposed to be buy yeah you get in thinking you're an eight out of 10 convicted and then you get out two days later with a you're like basically a two out of 10 convicted so you're not understanding your own psychology one way to play this really well though is with options um like I do this in oil all the time in ranging markets because Commodities range when when the when the price goes too high people just stop buying it and the price goes back down it's not quite like Bitcoin where there's an everyday physical consumption component to it so anyway like when when we're in a ranging market and I'm in low conviction mode but I have like a structural long-term let's say long position that I think will matter in two to eight months I don't know when so let's say the market rallies a little bit I'll sell some live calls uh why because if the market suddenly proves me right way earlier than expected I'm still happy if the market and then when the market inevitably pukes back down I sell some live puts at at a strike where I'm kind of happy to be adding to my position if the market were to puke through my strike right and get that's like strikes where I'm willing to get longer like so the equivalent Bitcoin would be hey we just traded up to 68k I'm I'm huddling I'm bullish Bitcoin for a decade so I'm happy to sell some $73,000 short dated calls then we trade back down to 62,000 I'll sell some $60,000 calls and if it trades through my level uh I just got longer at $60,000 great I'm happy then it goes back up sell some more calls you leg into a strangle that way by selling live calls in either direction uh obviously in sizes that you can tolerate uh you know to the downside get longer to the upside getting taken out of your position and I think that's a really elegant way to sell VA as opposed to just like trying to trade live or sorry hedge strangles and Delta hedge like to me it's simpler just to sell the live options on as as the market ranges I I I actually I really I really like that what I would probably do in this particular scenario because I'm very bullish on eth BTC is I'd Express the you know I I I i' basically Express the upside with eth and downside with with BTC I mean if there's if there's a if there's a I think one one way to one way to do this is basically you're you know you could sell BTC calls to buy eth calls even though the Vault on eth is obviously elevated I think that that's I think that the spread is still underpriced based on the way that people are pricing in this ETF I think on every one of our markets podcasts I've been super bearish on the EF and now that we've sold out a lot I mean it was bearish higher and now that we're lower my view is that a lot of the ETF is basically being priced as that nothing is going to happen it might actually be negative at this point so now that we're on the lows of the range you could sell eth puts and then when we go back to the highs of the range at some point you sell Bitcoin calls that's one way to do it correct yeah right and that's yeah that that that's effectively what I'm thinking about right here is that I think that the ETF is now we're probably fairly priced if eth trades 3,100 then you're probably supposed to be buying as much eth as you could possibly get your hands on yeah because I think that that at 3100 it prices over the ETF is going to hurt eth that the same like that $3,100 eth in this environment has the same feel as like sub thousand eth did in 2022 where you're just like I know things are not the greatest they could be but [ __ ] like this is it's time you know gotta get in yes 100% 100% agree with that what's been you know really interesting to me is that even as Bitcoin has sold off alts have done okay ever since Bitcoin basically ever since 64k Bitcoin obviously alt had a massive draw down I think they've just washed out a lot of the sellers and so what I see is even if Bitcoin goes sideways there might be some opportunities for for for ALS for alts to outperform and if Bitcoin trades lower that's probably an opportunity for you to buy by alts I mean one thing that I've learned is sell the weak asset right you want to sell whatever is actually weak at the time so what I noticed and I've made this mistake I'll probably continue to make this mistake I see a lot of people make this mistake is okay Bitcoin is there's a lot of movement from the government or from German Germany or whatever right lot of supply of Bitcoin hitting the market and people go well if I short Bitcoin then maybe it only goes down 5% but I can short a bunch of alts and if bitcoin's down 5% then it'll go down you know 15 20% that's only true if there's no Catalyst for Bitcoin going down yeah or if there's exuberance in the alt Market Al are high relative to BTC at any given moment if the reason that the Market is going down is Bitcoin Supply sell Bitcoin right don't don't try to short if you try to short avac you'd be down if you try to short eth you're down you short Bitcoin you're basically flat from when that news came out right so so sell the asset that's actually being impacted by the news there there's a lot of what I you know there's a lot of beta chasing in crypto there's a lot of okay well if eth gets an ETF then I'm going to go go by all of the eth beta and I generally think that's a losing trade generally I think that it's almost always better to just buy the thing that's actually getting the flows because everything else is just being bid by Traders which means that you need to you need to get in and get out and you need to be better than everyone else trading that asset yeah like me meme coin style uh in out it's it's tough I you know it's very difficult I mean I have a slightly I don't know if I disagree with what you just said like I agree with some of it but not all of it basically the way that I think about alts in this market you are right for the past week alt have been rallying versus Bitcoin and it hasn't been like a like a they like a they stopped selling off and moved up in a little bit kind of rally it's been like kind of sharp um but I still think if you zoom out and look at the broader altcoin charts versus Bitcoin it's been pretty much down only for the entire year and and only in the last week have they perked up meaningfully so I don't know whether this altcoin strength that you refer to is part of the you know downtrend just like a little bit of a a you know one of those like rallies as that's part of a much bigger downtrend or whether it's like a turn and I I'm I think I'm much more bearish altcoins than you like I think that this time is in fact different I do not think that the alts like in in a proper Bitcoin and eth rally that the altcoin space as a whole not saying that like there will always be certain alts that just gas higher and you know you you know how to find those alts you do your you do your research you can pick them but like the altcoin space as a whole um I think is going to underperform a rally this time for a very specific reason which is that I think retail has been too burned on alt and I think after two cycles 20 17 and 2021 of everybody and their grandmother and their dentists talking about you know tezos or you know some random some random altcoin like now at this point crypto is mature enough that the participant base has dissociated itself from the idea that an altcoin associated with an interesting computational product uh but with actually no underlying value transfer mechanism m is going to uh you know Moon anymore like I think Luna was kind of the end of that perception and so I think this will be a very institutional Benchmark L rally this year I think that especially if Trump wins uh the market is not pricing the you know 10 out of 10 bearish to eight out of 10 bullish flip-flop that the SEC is going to do uh after he installs his people in there and I think that that will I think that you basically see that Translate to ones in Bitcoin first and then you'll get an altcoin rally later when there's a Securities framework for those things to actually like pass through genuine economic activity to token holders but until then if you're buying like like even even our favorite one if you're buying Ando like what are you hoping for like oh people will bid governance tokens like no I think I think the retail Community is just done getting burned on those things maybe maybe this is a mid curve take but I don't know uh I think mid curve for one reason no offense Jonah bring it on but it's it's uh I don't know if these things aren't going up well first of all everybody's still bidding meme coins mem coins are the best performers off the bottom uh people are still bidding Whi they're still biding bunk oh I'm not talking about memes by the way when I say alts I'm not referring to memes um I'm referring to like tokens associated with projects that are actually trying to do something yeah I think go governance tokens in general agreed like the like the lios of the world that don't pass back cash uh I will say that maker and a have been doing very well over the last week unfortunately maker going up is normally a sign of impending doom maybe that's maybe that's different maybe that's different this time but I do genely agree that that sector of the market will underperform until there's a framework to pass back cash to Holders yeah like the oh let me buy the curve curve token because curve is a cool product era is over that's all I'm saying 100% and that's kind of two reasons one is that retail this time genuinely feels less sophisticated like the the market participants that are coming in this cycle seem stupider and less sophisticated than the market participants that came in in 2021 I know that sounds crazy but you can just see it by where they put their money and what they talk about and what they do if you remember the CT timeline in 2021 everybody was talking about the crazy new D5 primitive new products like weird ways of structuring things everybody was talking about complicated stuff there all these like long tweet threads explaining how you know uh bries on butterfly work I mean how can you redirect yield to certain pools uh you know how how to play the game of defi how yeah how balancer is better for this or that than curve I remember it all like it was it was more sophisticated and today all you have is you have people that are like I'm going to for the next 10 days tweet out the 10 mem coins that I'm gonna buy well let me debate you on this I don't think it's that crypto crypto participants are less sophisticated than they were last time I think it's that all none of that sophistication made anybody any money everybody bought all the sophisticated stuff and it went down 99% like I I'll tell you when when I at Goldman Sachs when I was an oil Trader uh my business was Market making I was screaming all day I had two phones standing up I was the loudest guy on the on the you know fifth floor of Goldman Sachs because oil was so busy and I remember during that time I I you know fine I was in my mid 20s first making money and there was a little bit of a testosterone and ego High associated with that but like I thought that fundamentals didn't matter I thought that fundamentals didn't drive the price of oil and I was pretty arrogant about that right and I was like fundamentals don't matter what matters is the flows because that's how I made my money every time I tried to learn about West African differentials or some storage tank in in uh you know reram and it didn't impact my p&l so I ignored it because the money came from people trading with me and I think the same thing is going on right now in crypto where people are like you know what no matter how deep I dive into the um you know in into this into the microeconomics of n's AI ecosystem like none of it like like we just said the regulatory framework isn't there none of that computational genius creates value that passes through the token holders all they're getting is a governance token that's adjacent but not connected to the actual Tech that they're going to try and analyze so much like me thinking fundamentals didn't matter the current market like kind of accepts like hey that's not what's driving my my the size of of the wad in my wallet right now with driving the size of my wallet is like are other people other are greater fools going to lift my bunk at a higher price I paid for my bunk and that's fine I think that's economically in like rational Behavior if when when Securities legislation Ares such that we can connect the complex Tech and the fundamentals to the Token price I think all that sophistication will make people money and it'll come right back onto the timeline what do you think so basically what I'm hearing from you I mean I agree with you actually 100% it didn't make anybody money I mean all all of this sophistication it took a lot more brain power it took a lot more effort and at the end of the day you actually got similar returns to memec coins both to the upside and the downside so all the fun fun fundamentals Behind these things didn't make sense any anyway like why would you why would you spend time trying to figure out what the fundamentals of an asset are if it doesn't matter so that's fair uh what I'll say is that we're I think we're closer to that Securities regulation than people think I mean if Trump gets elected then we're there I'm going to make a bet that if you know we get to October and it looks like Trump is about to win then you probably want to buy a lot of a a lot of maker a lot of the fundamental assets because I think that that rate it's going to be easier uh for it's going to be a much better regulatory environment yeah you're front running the projects that will rally when the eventual regulatory pass through uh stuff happens correct and just lift lift all the andos and pendal of the world if that if that looks like it's going to be the case because it yeah there could be a return to to fundamentals I mean the way that you described it you talked a lot about retail retail you're right they aren't buying that because it doesn't matter but then also the institutions aren't buying it because when they look at it there's no real reason to buy these things and so the things that tend to perform the best are you know General narrative plays so for example AI probably going to have another Echo bubble for have have another bubble for that at some point you probably want some exposure there uh like if things start to sell off you want to lift AI I'm definitely going to be lifting rwa because I I'm making that bet as like a trump bet uh that that that that that's going to do well but I mean in the in in the meantime really the only like great trade that I see is just shorting the high fdv alts against the majors and that's that's it's been it's been a great trade I think it will continue to be a great trade I mean some of these things like worldcoin have $19 million a day on the horizon coming out I don't know who's buying that I think alt layer has a unlock that's 123 million on a market cap of two billion which is nuts so that's Alpha um but yeah I mean directionally punting BTC Neath not so much and so you know talking to you for these last 40 minutes what's kind of interesting to me is that we don't we have a lot of ideas that are far out we have a lot of ideas for how to make money in like three months but not too many ideas for right now I mean selling alts versus the majors is an idea that we've talked about on this podcast for months now and that is that is with the exception of the last week it's been it's been quite a smooth Trend so maybe this little pop is a chance to get into that trade or or add to that trade I'll clarify I don't know if it's selling it's not just selling alts it's selling the things that are bad High FTV Al with unlocks and no road map yeah exactly right I mean what I the there there are Pockets that are showing strength I mean for some reason avax refuses to sell off I don't know what's going on there kind of an interesting one another one that's been amazing which is actually a core holding of mine is ton ton has I mean I think people are sleeping on it especially in the west 800 million users yeah 800 million users the games on T if you've played hamster are going nuts I mean it's getting real usage and I genuinely think that in a year in two years this is going to be one of the major blockchains that people use and if you look at salana I mean like salana is great love salana but ton has the users ton has all the users which is why bitcoin's down 10% and T's up because I think people are starting to catch on to this a lot of that a lot of people are starting to reposition because they're like oh wow this thing could easily this thing could easily trade 100 billion in the right in the right Market environment let me just quickly check the market cap I mean ton is the it is the it is in the top 10 it is the ninth largest coin sandwich between Dogecoin which is number 10 and xrp which is number eight I'm actually pretty high confidence it goes to 100 at some point so if you want to just own that for the next year yeah I I like that trade I like that trade it's actually the thing is it it's never had an ecosystem before it's been around for a while over the last three to six months there's been a lot of building on T there have been a lot of new projects that are coming out actual defi that's that that's being built it's going to take some time to mature but the reality is it's being used and it will continue to be used and unless telegram dies as a as as as an application I think over time you just chip away and a lot of these people on on telegram they just end up using this this is how they're going to onboard onto crypto this probably I mean ton could easily turn into the ven venmo right PayPal you you're just sending usdt on ton yeah they're gonna make their wallet oped out instead of opt in unless you're in the US of course but um it's a good you know what's this hamster game describe it is it like uh is it is it fun is it like a super high fidelity like Halo like game do you turn your phone sideways for it no no it's a it's it's a game it's a game within the within the telegram app it's like a click to play so it's a shitty game all right all right so this this fits perfectly with my thesis like everybody said that web 3 gaming the triaa games everyone was talking about that in 2022 they like that's what's going to save crypto like axi Infinity but Call of Duty fun fun levels and and like uh you know graphics and stuff and what's funny is they were right gaming kind of did save crypto but the game was a meme coin casino on Solano where you buy like mother and whiff and anom puts it on the sphere a very different kind of game more like uh like for people that people that are as old as I am like the kinds of games that you would have played in Microsoft Doss uh you know rather than something that you would play on the lat like a PS5 right so I think I I think that may be the kind of like weird gambling addict type crypto game that attracts users and you know not surprised it's happening on telegram those guys are doing everything they can to bridge Web Two users into web 3 and by the way they have the slickest user experience of any app on my phone like telegram is awesome I I love the little dopamine kick you get when you can like uh put an emoji on a on a message and like little things fly around and you know it's cool I telegram might actually be the channel to onboard more users I love it you literally just click the hamster buddy it's not it's it's not that it's not that complicated it kind of sucks it's somebody should make a meme of this AI all that stuff that I just spewed about about telegram is the the mid curve take the [ __ ] click the hamster the the 60 IQ take is just click the hamster and the 150 IQ take is just click the hamster you know just [ __ ] click the hamster bro stop stop with all this hey I mean it's [ __ ] I mean yes [ __ ] hamster combat but I mean look the the the the bottom line is that there is this thing that exists on telegram that you can play play is kind of a you know what if clicking if you could to that playing it's no whatever but it's it's like the beginnings of something you know it's a beginning this is just just because it's dumb doesn't mean that it's not going to turn into you know billions of dollars of FTV like my fraking 13-year-old cousin when Pokemon go came out he was like he became real life Pac-Man and spent his days chasing ing like weird little apparitions around abandoned lot like people spend their time on like low Fidelity games as well as High Fidelity game so why why not hamster uh and why not the meme coin casino but yeah I think you're right I think you gotta you got to dismiss some of these governance tokens and altcoins like Lio and a and but those are the ones you want an Ando until like Trump's about to get an SEC in there that that links these things through to the real businesses underneath then they're going to literally just Gallop upwards it feels like I'm I'm here I'm here for it Jonah so just to recap take July off just look for Alpha stop worrying about trying to pick the bottom unless we trade 55 maybe 52 like don't don't worry about going all in don't worry about lever long and BTC just look for Alpha take a little bit of a you know take a little bit of a break and then depending on where we are a AUST mid August all right this [ __ ] this shit's going higher so make your Sho make make your shopping list of coins now all the alts that we've we've talked about all the things that we've gone back and forth on write down some of the lessons that you've learned how to psychologically prepare yourself to trade this type of market and I'll see you at 100K at the end of the year see you then obviously none of this is financial advice we don't know anything especially me I couldn't even read uh the fully diluted valuation of telegram coin off of coin gecko don't listen to anything we say just click the hamster and work on your process like Obby said just click the hamster well you keep racking up hamster coin right there look at that guy goty look at that every time you click it goes up by one God I need to I need to employ somebody to click this for me my hand's getting kind of getting tired I think it's useful activity like you could be spending that time doing something useless like reading the news or studying uh studying crypto instead you're getting hamster coin by clicking it like what that you're actually getting value out of this literally could not imagine reading the news when I could be clicking a hamster the crazy thing is this it doesn't even have a coin so I'm not really sure like there's kind of nothing to do with it other than click the hamster because it doesn't have a coin so while AI ai's clicking the hamster one thing I did want to say about it sounds like a sexual euphamism just click the hamster bro um you're not clicking the hamster right I feel disgusting um one of the things that I I did want to say like yeah okay fine so there's a lot of crazy complex Tech out there in crypto and I don't want to be dismissive of it I just think that those conversations about me extraction and the benefits of this club versus that Dex have kind of gone off of crypto Twitter and into private circles like my boys at urgonia or some of the onchain trading shops like they're they're busy making money off of Jupiter and and you know all these other like onchain exchanges um like there's money in there and the technical stuff does translate to value for some people but it's like a very quany um like kind of dark world it's not it's not going to be uh consumable by most of the retail users on crypto Twitter anymore most of the retail users on on crypto Twitter I I agree with you like I think this the sophisticated ones are watching and waiting but like Mo most of the money right now is made by clicking the hamster not by um set spinning up Bots look you you have to be really goddamn good to make money on me at this point like you have to be really really really good and I mean I would wager that all those threads about M people like yeah you can nobody actually did it except for 0.1% of the people because it's hard but those people crushed it and those people have yeah those people have maybe it's not me right now I think it's like there's basically there's latency Arbitrage between onchain activity and um centralized exchanges that you can you can scoop up there are pennies there to be to be vacuumed that's fair I'll let you vacuum the pennies I will stick to my I'm not smart enough if anybody out there on the thousand lik podcast is smart enough give me a shout yeah I'll be I'll be with you AI um just trying to spend some time away from the screen and uh waiting to buy a dip and if it doesn't happen happy days well enjoy the summer everybody we'll catch you on the next thousand X great great talking to you Obby thanks a lot as always Jonah it was a good one crushed it [Music]

Title: Is Arweave Crypto's Darkhorse L1? | 1000x
Published: 2024-06-19 12:00:29 UTC
Description:
In today's episode of 1000x Jonah and Avi are joined by Sam Williams, founder of Arweave, to dive deep into the decentralized data storage protocol that is quickly becoming the backbone of Web3. Sam explains Arweave's unique approach to permanent, low-cost storage, its scalability, and the new possibilities it enables. 

He discusses the evolution of the Arweave ecosystem, from NFT storage to decentralized social apps, composable data, and AI-driven smart contracts on the Arweave Operating System (AO). Sam also shares his vision for the "perm web", a revolutionized internet where users truly own their data, and the potential of an "agent economy" powered by autonomous, AI-based financial agents. Enjoy!

Transcript Text:
and you actually have to care about this stuff you can't just say oh well we've got several orders of magnitude left to go like whatever because you're you're legitimately trying to store information forever you have to worry about what'll happen in a thousand or 10,000 years it's it's interesting to think about 10,000 years in advance because Obi and I are usually worried about what happens this week in terms of price action and just you're you always think about the next the next five minutes this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance the onchain defi primitive redesigning derivatives for the defi native you'll hear more about perennial later in the [Music] show welcome everyone back to another THX podcast today we have a special guest Sam of arweave who's going to be talking to us about arweave crazy I know right it's it's a fun it's a fun conversation um you know we normally do markets podcasts and now we're doing a building podcast because when the market is slow we focus on the actual real stuff no we're chasing mem coins and we're talking about meme coins it's actually dive into something that is going to be useful for crypto so thank you Sam for joining us yeah thanks for having me on it sounds like a fun conversation um so I I wanted to start with just for the people that don't know what is our weave and then maybe you could tell us a little bit about the origin story you know how did it start yeah so aiv is a a a true protocol it is truly a protocol not a product at this point it doesn't have a core team per se it has many different organizations that that uh advocate for it of which I'm part of one but yeah it's a truly decentralized protocol that is just focused on permanent information storage so put simply the idea of onchain storage like you could have with Bitcoin but scaled to arbitrary sizes and then made economically rational for you know storing data for the maximum possible time period um we got started about 7 years ago yeah seven years ago next weekend uh and we launched mainnet six years ago and a weekend ago and um yeah now it now it's runs staban Productions used all over crypto it's kind of like the I jokingly call it maybe your audience will appreciate this more than the normal ours um casinos you know a casino there's like this huge industry for the seats in casinos right they they they try to optimize the hell out of them so that no one stands up well AR was built as a permanent store of uh hum's knowledge and history but the first use case people really found for it was being the seats in the casino so storing like ungodly numbers of nft files uh was the first use case and then it became the backbone of of storing many different chains because the blockchains basically if you have a scalable blockchain you have this problem um that it has arbitrary data constraints or sizes uh and the more scalable it gets the more data it has to replicate and so people started to put that on R and over time it's become this I would say one of the backbones of web 3 it's not talked about that much but it's used almost everywhere um like virtually top 85% of salana nft C something like this are all stored on awe um 20 or 30 different chains use AR to store their actual chain data so that people can sync it back to run nodes um yeah and it's just an extremely useful utility basically and then on top of that we built this system called AO that I'm sure we'll get into later I I just think it's so fascinating that you know as as somebody who's a little bit technical but not extraordinarily technical that basically now if you want to build something and have it truly be decentralized you can't do it without a product like R weave or pretty much R weave these days so you know you are you are truly the backbone of web 3 I agree with that statement what boggles my mind a little bit is how do you your fee system how is it possible that you're able to charge somebody just once that blows my mind doesn't offer a good explanation really oh interesting okay it does somewhere in there but but yeah um it's it's pretty simple actually so so this was one of the two major I would say advancements or technological innovations that led to the creation of awe so we realized as soon as you get to scalable onchain storage you have this problem you have an Ever growing Ledger how do you pay for it right um and the answer it turned out was relatively simple as all good answers are once you vot out what they are finding it takes some time uh it's just an endowment so you put in storage cost for 200 years worth at 20 replicas at today's prices and then as the cost of storage declines over time the amount of storage purchasing power you have in the endowment increases and there you go if the rate of storage cost declines are higher than 0.5% on average per year assuming a stable token price and that's one of the reasons there's such a massive safety margin in these calculations um yeah then you end up with more storage purchasing power at the end of Any Given year than you had at the start that's fundament of the system okay so that was the part that I guess I you know I I should have I should have I apologized It is Well documented on your website but this this decline in storage cost throughout time is that something that this is what I I I wanted to ask you does it is it something that follows Moore's Law is it something that you can bet your you know bet the farm on I guess you have um yes so it it is analogous to Moos law it's not Moos law uh it's called kar's law Kar rate was basically the person that uh proposed a similar similar sort of hypothesis for the declining cost of storage as the increase in compute power um I think yeah so over the last 50 years it's been about 38.5% approximately on average yearly declining storage cost and our expected rate is 0.5% so it's extremely conservative and that's also partially because it uses an unstable token price as part of that that mechanism so we like to have even more security uh buffer but but even before digital storage if you think back like the the task is is not well specified at that point right so it's it's best thought of is encoding information but humans have been trying to do that for since they were humans since we first created language and even before then with you know basically uh Stickman drawings of cows and stuff whatever it was that they felt was necessary to store um but if you think about it in terms of the amount of human effort or labor that went into encoding those symbols right to write on a cave wall is very very very costly in terms of time and so even before digital storage there's been this declining cost of information en coding over like many millennia probably into the tens of thousands of years if not yeah probably not 100 thousand years probably tens of thousands um and so so we see that basically where the where the trend comes from is robust the trend in the present day is robust and then the question becomes well will it happen in the future right and so to understand that you have to understand a few different things like first is it possible like do you reach a a theoretical limit somewhere um and and this is true of mlaw with thermodynamics basically you end up at a point where you're doing so much computation that the computation generates a certain minimum amount of heat and then to remove that heat from the uh the surface of the chip it require a certain amount of space and then you get to like a a computational density limit essentially um on the storage side you get to a data density Maxima at 10 to the I believe it's 6 68 bits per Cub uh yeah per cubic cm we're at about 10 13 right now something like that and even then you don't need it to be compressed like imagine we got to 10 to the 68 well you could just stack it next to each other right so so the the theoretical limits are really very very very far off and you actually have to care about this stuff you can't just say oh we've got several orders of magnitude left to go like whatever because you're you're legitimately trying to store information forever you have to worry about what'll happen in a thousand or 10,000 years yeah like the you know when I joke to the beginning about the casino seat things it's one of the most you know life is sometimes so ironic it can hardly believe to be true yet it is um yeah it's it's interesting to think about 10,000 years in advance because Avi and I are usually worried about what happens this week in terms of price action right you're you're always think about the next the next five minutes which brings me to to a question actually I mean how do you guys think about the approach to changing the protocol given that you're trying to last for 10,000 years I mean you obviously have the Bitcoin approach which is you want it to never change you want that's like you know strength that you know that in the future it's going to look like the past and you're storing data Maybe you want that or maybe you need there are challenges that might come up that you don't know about so you want it to be mutable like ethereum how do you guys think about yeah so that that's super interesting I spent two years of my life like obsessed with that question because basically we got it to the point where it was like scalable onchain storage like arbitrarily scalable you can fit you know the whole web in a single transaction like tens of thousands of times over or something like this um and then then we made the economics or actually we made the economics make sense before that and then it's like okay well what were the next risks on this Mission and yeah the very obvious one is well we can't predict what the protocol might need some some distance in time out like hundreds of years it's it's you know the way that it's currently structured I think is good for decades but realistically something will need to change on the centuries Horizon let Al alone Millennia and so we're trying to work out how to deal with this and the reason that we believe that crypto exists or the reason that I'm in it um is because it's a mechanism of providing users with immutable and guaranteed rights and like at the time we were starting to to really look into this problem uh the state-of-the-art was Dows which I just think like okay they are a 10x Improvement on companies but to be very clear in their current form they are just onchain companies they're publicly traded onchain companies there's nothing more to it and like I don't know about you but I could also buy some Amazon stock if I wanted an ungodly small amount of influence in what Amazon did it there's nothing really there um so that that wasn't a good idea because well the company would inevitably company a quotes uh the Dow stroke company would have inevitably be incentivized to extract value from its user base in the maximum possible way uh so so that that doesn't work very well forking like you have in Bitcoin is quite good because it allows basically people to disagree and to coales into groups and then have their own systems that maintain rights and so if you want to change the system you have to convince everyone that it's better but the problem with that is that there's no incentive for the innovator right like we we we did the math on this and really if you have less than $500 million worth of bitcoin the delta in bitcoin price after you're done with your Innovation is really very unlikely to be worth it for the cost of innovating and convincing everyone the marketing the pr that would be necessary to get everyone to agree that this was actually better than the original Bitcoin so it's virtually unworkable um so we we came up with a a different system which we call evolutionary forks and basically the idea is you can make a single adjustment to the protocol like in one go you don't say oh trust me bro I'm going to implement it later it's going to be really good you know no you just you have a single update to the to the codebase that triggers at a specific block height and you can create new tokens for yourself as a reward for doing so and then basically the market just decides and if your Innovation is actually worth the amount of dilution that it created for the protocol itself then then your tokens will be worth something and this allows permissionless Innovation so you incentivize entrepreneurs anywhere you know builders that think this is a good part of the protocol but we can make it better or there's this oncoming problem that's a few years out I can see it because I care about this protocol other people don't care yet but I can be right and make the right adjustment early and then the old one might fail but the new one succeeds and all of the value goes there and at the same time the data set is maintained between these um between these branches essentially of The evolutionary tree and that allows us to evolve around problems in the future uh and there's also an efficient market for Innovation that happens there so if you know you come along and you say hey I'm G to make this Innovation and it's going to make the protocol better but it's going to be 100% dilution or something well people can be like well that doesn't seem that hard I can make that too and I'll do it for like 3% dilution then people will go to the one that's less dilution um and so you should get an efficient market for improving the protocol over time there's a couple of other factors in it but it's it's written like a constit ution not in code it's just like 274 words something like that that just describes how look as a community if we want to have a permanent information storage system there there doesn't appear to be any other viable way to do this here are the basic rules you know go evolve it do do you think I'm I'm curious do you think or we could ever transition to also having semi-permanent data storage because you know the the the market for permanent data storage is huge but there's obviously also a market for data that isn't stored permanently right that's that's actually a large part of it as well yes although the question right now is is there a large market for decentralized temporary storage and I think the answer to that pretty clearly is not at this point now there is some market and we when's this podcast going out Juna Thursday Thursday well in the next few we'll have some news on that but exting the there's some Alpha for you all right but but there isn't like an enormous market for decentralized temporary storage at least at this point and we know this to be true because for a start I I invested in so I mined some Bitcoin in 2011 or something I put like 15 bucks worth into ethereum and then I took some of that and I took it into uh storage which was more or less the first decentralized storage Network and I thought it was a cool idea um and you know I put the money into ethereum just because I I wanted compute credits not because I thought it would go up in value um and they did the same with Storch storge did not go up in value that much uh because no matter all the attempts the people have put into it there just isn't a huge market for this and the reason is kind of obvious like what does decentralization actually get you right permanence trustless uh censorship resistance well when was the last time you heard of someone having their encrypted data on AWS or Google Cloud being censored I don't think I've ever heard a story like that right whereas permanent information storage is just not a model that a company could ever sell you because the company would change this model over time right so the whole idea is because the rules of the protocol are protocolized they they offer you guarantees so you can't get elsewhere um and we've seen this in in the most extreme degree with filecoin I think who had 70% of their token Supply approximately for mining rewards and now they they they can't give out storage like they have an extremely low utilization rate because they literally can't give it away for free they tried selling it at not kidding a thousandth of the cost of AWS no one want wanted to buy it then they gave it away for free then they started paying people to store it and all the while they are inflating the token Supply which is really horrendous to see like if you look at the market cap the market cap has recovered with the market but the price is just it's approximately one and a half times the price in 2017 because because they printed all these tokens to overly subsidize just a service that people fundamentally didn't want and so yeah we think there is a market for decentralized free storage but the way to do it is definitely not with extreme token incentives it should probably be actually token L this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance perennial is quickly becoming one of the go-to derivatives platforms and liquidity layers for all of defi so let me tell you a little bit about them there are kind of three things you need right when you're thinking about a place and a platform to trade on first one great trade execution second one low fees and third of course an onchain permissionless platform and perennial Nails all three of those buckets with the launch of perennial V2 they've made all of that possible by introducing a ton of new features such as faster oracles which reduce trade execution to seconds lower fees competing with major centralized exchanges and minimizing fees for both takers and makers fully modular markets which allow the protocol to support any price feed out there and fourth cash settled right the trades are cash settled in USD not in crypto perennial allows you the trader to gain access to deeper liquidity with only a fraction of the tvl how it works is that perennial enables a two-sided Market made up of both Traders and liquidity providers right Traders deposit the assets to get leverage exposure while liquidity providers provide these pools of capital to earn fees for taking the other side of the trader position rennial allows you to trade crypto pers FX and coming soon nfts and more backed by some of the best investors in the industry perennial is a must checkout platform if you're a crypto Trader go check them out by clicking the link in the description give thousand X some credit go check out perennial you're going to love them all right let's get back to the show you brought up something really interesting which is sort of permissionless innovation Constitution like uh founding principles that should allow you to endure I I agree that you know no piece of code is better than perhaps the United States Constitution for evolving with time um so on that note can you give the listeners maybe a concrete example of a small problem that that your uh structure helped you innovate around or helped your community innovate around has it has it been triggered recently tried yet hasn't been triggered yet okay so we're we're waiting um but I and I imagine it could be years if not a decade potentially before it ever needs to be used kind of like the Constitution was also not in question in the early days it's it's later on that like we've really tried to engineer arv so that it it is the the most optimal solution for the current state of affairs and the Affairs that we can see in the future like we're kind of interested in DNA storage right now which appears to be about half a decade to a decade away from commercially viable and that will be 10 to the 27 fits uh per cubic centimeter so huge huge Improvement we're just trying to make sure that the protocol is sufficiently flexible so you can mine on DNA as crazy as that sounds sounded slightly less crazy six years ago more are you talking about storing everybody's DNA or just oh no it's um it's it's just the DNA itself right is a is a sort of tangle of yeah Helix of um different components and and if you manufacture each component you can get them to stick together and you can encode any data you want basically and it's very very dense like crazy dance you're not talking about like just storing somebody's genome in an encrypted you're talking about actually Computing over the same mechanism that DNA is effectively formed with interesting yeah Al although many years ago we did kind of wonder whether you could make a self-replicating version of awe in viruses but don't worry we're not going to do that I promise it's just that if the DNA replicates then you know theoretically you might be able to here here comes the world's best transition like a virus R we has managed to survive several cycles of crypto Nuclear apocalypses So what I'm wondering is what is it you know feel like our our Traders and investors and and people who are interested in you know buying and selling tokens who listen to us they're some of them are extraordinarily um in the weeds and technically capable others are just you know hobbyists who aren't necessarily that technically knowledgeable can you can you help us understand in the bluntest possible terms and help our listeners understand what it is that that you did with your toomics to structure our weave such that it survived better than I call it storage J or you call it storage uh file coin ipfs I think is another one like any any of these other protocols that have just kind of faded away like what is it that what what are the Hallmarks of your product that have allowed it to endure these Cycles aside from just meeting yeah good product Market fit and what what should our listeners sort of look for in terms of tokenomics for other things that you think are important in the blockchain ecosystem like like our weave interesting um the first one that comes to mind is don't be hyperinflationary yes like don't print crazy numbers of tokens to subsidize Supply when you don't have any demand that's not a wise idea um yeah that that would that's the place to start uh the second part I think it it's just fundamentally useful to people like it it's grown in usage through both of those bare Market is it only two feels like more yeah three bull markets I guess and two bare markets I'm not sure if you call this a bull market I don't know two and a half so um yeah it it's just grown in utility for people and it's a cool thing because that's a compounding utility over time right like when when we first built it on day one I come to you and I say look at my shiny you know permanent information storage system it's got all these cool features and you're like okay but it like it's permanent and it's been a around for one day well it's six years now it's like non non-trivial part of bitcoin's History uh right there and it's been stable and mature and so more and more Builders trust it and I think that slowly compounds interest over time as people start to realize what it is I mean frankly the I think I's biggest problem at least until the start of this year was our marketing for it has always been very careful because we really are seriously trying to build a permanent information storage system we're conscious that the words that we say in the early years might have effects Downstream that we can't easily predict so we like to make our statements sort of accurate and tur if that makes sense like really just try and say that yes try try and stay on topic it's kind of ironic like I built it as a permanent Ledger of speech so that anyone can speak on the internet without having to have an intermediary between them and then I also found that my own personal speech was massively curtailed because I'm associated with a project and I don't want to do like an Elon Musk style hyperpolarization of the user base because many many years down the line it's going to be like oh that's that guy that I disagree with this thing he said about something completely unrelated and so but anyway yeah so so it's kind of in the background there being picked up by more and more Builders as time goes by doesn't have hyperinflationary tokenomics actually the tokenomics are super cool but that's a yeah and it's I mean I'd love to talk about just because I think your main competitor filecoin you whether you want to call them your main competitor or not at least in the mind of crypto they are uh and and they take kind of the complete opposite approach in terms of token inflation marketing uh basically you know uh almost everything so be kind of you know interesting to compare and contrast between between the two and then you know you can talk about the to token economics as well yeah well so I think the The Wider point is perhaps the yeah the one that that has more meat to it which is that most token designs really don't actually make any logical long-term sense without being uh extractive from the user base which kind of goes against that core principle of wiber roll here which is to build uh services in cyers space that users can trust in the same way they trust a constitution can't be swapped you know there's no Switcheroo um and with filecoin basically the token value acral mechanism is you pay for storage for a period of time you take those tokens out of circulation for that period okay that makes sense like mval PQ the equation of exchange you're just lowering the velocity of those tokens yeah makes some sense but you need a lot of storage in order to do that relative to the market cap um a we has the same effect but magnified approximately 100 fold something like that the maximum deal size on filecoin is 2 years but on a if you pay for 200 years worth of storage up front so you take those tokens out of circulation and there's an interesting argument to make as to whether you're essentially burning them or just lowering the velocity but it's kind of immaterial because You' lowering the velocity for hundreds of years at minimum so it may as well be uh they're just burnt um yeah and that that has a mechanism where you're not incentivized as the protocol to increase the cost to users because that would decrease the amount that they're actually going to store um and at the same time you're not being extractive there's that huge safety margin but it's there for a reason it might actually be used in the future we we can't predict what's going to happen in the storage markets 50 years from now um and so this mechanism allows you without being extractive to the user like literally you pay zero cents above what the the protocol truly believes the cost of storage is like the cost of Supply um and at the same time the token acrs value because you're just moving more and more tokens out of circulation proportionate to usage and it's very very hard to get a token design like that that actually makes sense and so that's one of the one of the things I think is underappreciated about the protocol but I I kind of like because I spent a long time working on it I suppose no that's that's really interesting and elegant um I want to dig into the tokenomics a little bit more because I think it's just so important we're in this you know phase of of the cycle where um altcoins have underperformed you know you have these Majors like Bitcoin eth salana performing so the infrastructure stru layer is performing then you have um you know unlike maybe the previous cycle where all altcoins were sort of viewed as uh you know bets on the future I think there's a little bit of apathy this cycle around you know the the middle of the risk curve as we Traders call it um tokens associated with projects like yours and then the uh you know let's call it a let's call it a casino the memec coin [ __ ] show is is you know volatile and interesting for some Traders but that sort of middle of the spectrum is very difficult for people to understand what uh I think I think what a lot of fatigued crypto Traders are wondering right now is if I buy a token um like R weave you know it's not a security it can't pass through dividends there's no value acral mechanism to that to that token in dollar space uh with Securities Law the way that it currently stands so what what's going to drive my upside other than you know new people buying into it and the interesting thing about our weave that I like so much is that you're literally paying for a product that has product Market Fit already in those tokens so you can kind of guarantee an inflow of Fiat into the r weave ecosystem unlike you know name name your 99% of other altcoins so I guess why hasn't the market can you think of reasons why the market hasn't sort of picked up on this and thought of R weave as as the type of protocol where unlike most there is this Con sort of inflow of Fiat for uh you know to buy the product well I think it has to some extent most in in recent months um but but I do think that the understanding of the utility lags behind where things are actually at like for a very long time uh when we spoke to people about a we they were just like oh it's it's storage it's like file coins not really um doing something you can only do with a blockchain uh that that Meme is spreading but it spreads kind of slowly and I and I also think that it it also goes in the same way that that a has found liquidity right so people have just discovered it on their own accord like we we spoke to many exchanges about aiv over the years but we only really ever signed you know agreements with or even ND with two or three and now it's on most major exchanges um because people find utility in it and I I think that that's what drives long-term value it's like just build something useful and make it complete and actually scalable so that it won't just stop working and then there's a crisis in the community um and then work to spread it as wide as you can like at this point are we the core protocol is mature enough that the tweaks we make to it are very minor we we try to unless there's like a fundamental problem and there hasn't been since like AR 2.0 which has been you know introduced the arbitrarily scalable mechanisms that was like four years ago at this point unless there's a fundamental problem we make the minimum viable nudge to the protocol and and it's kind of in line with Bitcoin nothing more than the Bitcoin Community would accept you literally stole that the next question out of my mouth which was this sounds like you're describing a benchmark L1 Bitcoin or I I would have said you know eth as well I think salana they're a little more Hands-On but so should should the market perceive are weave like you know proper L1 and not bucket it with other uh altcoins using airor quotes here yeah and I think it will over time it's just you know how markets go they're like eventually efficient but they can be quite inefficient in the in the meantime but at this point it is it's just like Bitcoin except for permanent storage at scale um and I actually think that I know ethereum to me seems way more hands on I'm curious what I don't know what the institutional bias is with you guys on ethereum but that's an interesting conversation if you want to have it I think you know e ethereum's generally deemed as very Hands-On yeah yeah I mean yeah there's there there's a lot there's a lot of change right and there are a few people that are effectively in charge of driving forward that change obviously there are a huge amount of people that whose opinions are voiced but then you know the actual process I think it's and and that generally I think is deemed okay because when you're bit Bitcoin is immutable because it's money and it's a lot less complicated uh than ethereum from that perspective right there are a lot less things that I think can go wrong with BTC uh and so when you're building a platform this is at least from the you know perspective of a lot of lot of invest ethereum investors talking from their perspective the idea is well we have to be responsive to the changes right we have to be responsive to changes and that I think is what drives the the Hands-On nature of ethereum do I necessarily agree with that perspective uh you know I i' I'd say that a lot of the reasons that people got into crypto in the first place is that they wanted to build on a platform that they know wouldn't change the rules on them and so I think that that obviously is not ethereum at this at this point in time uh but you know I'm just trying to make the argument from the perspective of the people that are changing the right and I think that what one question I have about this and you know I'd like to I'd like to hear hear responses there there does seem to be development around AR in terms of new projects that are building on on AR like like AO and how does this how does this sort of play into the r weave as a L1 narrative it was confusing to me because I'm not sure maybe Is AO GNA be competing with r weave but still built on R weave no because so again this is this is what I'm trying to trying to figure outbe you can start with what is AO right so AO is an actor oriented computer basically the idea is to build a decentralized supercomputer you kind of heard it before many times described as the world computer but this time it actually works um and is this like go no no no well so I I I mentioned before that the ethereum Ico right I I went to that website and in the middle of the website uh at least as far as my memory Serv maybe it's in a video potentially but in their marketing they said ethereum is the world computer ah okay that sounds cool I I want to be part of that that and what they delivered was really very very interesting and unlocked a huge amount of innovation on top but it it just doesn't scale it's like a world's most enormous calculator it's it's kind of absurd it's like you have 70,000 you it oscillates a lot but around 70,000 different nodes and it's doing the amount of computation that you would get in a literal desktop calculator that you would use in school um and and that I also think to the prior point which is why is ethereum so Hands-On I think the answer is simple it's like the the the protocol doesn't work right if the protocol worked then I I think the whole development of crypto over the last 10 years would have been completely different like if they shipped something that was that was more in line with what their sharding design was which actually could scale in theory um but has different tradeoffs then then we just wouldn't be in this yeah the whole thing would be much more like normal commodity protocols that would be the expectation whereas ethereum sort of sent the Benchmark and they sent it more or less as a company who has a product and um I think that took us Way Off Track Jonah you look like you yeah no no you're you're you're just blowing my mind like I I've never thought about it this way I mean yeah it's it's a world computer that's really slow but at least it's reliable right at least the calculator doesn't break and so that's true we can start there and then we can say we could go back and say like oh well in in the 1950s you know if um if only eniac had been able to process you know like Tera flops worth of computation than we'd be in this totally different world and yes I agree but um no I think your point stands like it's it's kind of shocking when you put it that way just how shitty ethereum is and I'm I wasn't dis ageing with you I was more like wow I've never philosophically thought about crypto this way and gosh maybe we could have avoided two bare markets if if only they had scaling Solutions or if if scaling Solutions weren't necessary because the main net was so fast wow right what a powerful statement and and I think it's it I don't want to trash talk them too much because their Innovation was truly incredible like being able to run um arbitary computation on a decentralized computer is unbelievably cool and it's the reason that you this whole industry exists but they they fell into a a trap that's very common in protocols which is Protocols are about communities right like there's there's no use my computer having a set of rules about how it should interact with other computers if there isn't another computer in the world for it to talk to that's going to speak the same rules uh the the problem that you get is you can't just scale it like a web 2 company right a web two company just pivots the product until they find something that people really like and then in the background they make it scale one way or another um but but a protocol doesn't work like that because each of the scaling Solutions has different tradeoffs right and if you build a really large community around something that doesn't work getting the necessary Buy in to change it to change your position in the tradeoff space basically is is just too hard and that's eventually what happened they they got too much adoption ironically at a time where they didn't have the protocol rules laid out in such a way that it would actually scale to you do what they wanted to do was build the world computer well you're in kind of the opposite situation right like you've you've built enough Lanes on the freeway and you're waiting for the traffic to show up I I'm just curious what is or maybe there's already a ton of traffic to to answer my question what what does your community look like how much data are they storing on our weave right now and what is the what does that look like is it still just a bunch of jpegs or are we looking at ER cooler stuff cooler stuff now fortunately well I mean the JBS are still there um but but there's about six billion pieces of information on AR at this point um and for some perspective when we had so we had the sixth anniversary of mainnet just a few weeks ago and um in the prior one of five years we were at just shy of a billion transactions so the usage is really skyrocketing and that speaks to people just find it useful and it just scales doesn't charge you more as more people use it it just charges you the what it calculates as the economically rational cost um but to that to that prior point for a second because I do think it's really interesting yeah if they'd have just got it to the point where it had scaled arbitrarily then they could do what we did which was and that was actually what we used the first bare market for as well like while everyone was depressed we just made our with scale um yeah then the focus just becomes well how do we get the largest number of people to adopt it as fast as possible and we we've done a bunch of things there recently like acquire Odyssey which is the largest web3 social app out there it has about 7 eight million monthly active users and we're decentralizing it and just making it an open public utility on top of awe that runs just like a protocol um and solarx as well a smaller social network uh and then also this effort to build AO which is basically it turns if you have arbitrarily scalable permanent storage you can imply the state of any computation right so like computation if you have a deterministic okay stop me if I'm going too like technical but yeah if you have a deterministic virtual machine that's a that's a computer if you will where you put the same inputs in you get the same outputs every time if you can store arbitrary amounts of the logs of computation then you can do arbitrary amounts of computation full stop and then infer the same state on top of it and with AO what we did is we we just built that system and um and a message passing layer that uses AR to to move information from one we call them processes you can think of them like smart contracts um yeah two other participants two other processes in the network and then you have an arbitrarily scalable World computer what you lose is what ethereum's sort of position in the trade-off space got stuck in which was Global shared State it's called the idea that every program has access to the memory of every other program right if you have that I don't believe it's possible to make it more scalable than salana salana is pretty efficient of that Niche whereas with AO we just said okay screw Global shared state it doesn't work it never worked in traditional computer science why would it suddenly work in in a decentralized world where everything is actually just harder let's go with what actually works which is message passing the whole internet is just a message passing machine and we just made that on chain essentially on that point though just a quick question and you know forgive me if this is a stupid one but you you've definitely exceeded my level of technical understanding by quite a lot already um if if you can use infinite storage to infer any state isn't the trade-off that you're making oh well let's let's just use an absolutely enormous amount of storage to uh arrive at some state does doesn't that if you do it incorrectly or if you use too much storage to arrive at that point like couldn't you just be stuck in a arriving at your state but in an infinite amount of time or or an extremely long period of time like your supercomputer has to be fast too right right that's actually a nice segue that's exactly what AO does so you've been able to store these logs of computation on rwe since about 2020 we first called it smart weave um but what we Advanced with AO is this idea that you can do you do your viewers watch or listen cuz I got like a diagram right behind me I could just point to it probably a little bit a little bit of both but little bit of both if you're listening to this why don't you switch to YouTube right now Spotify videoo well here we go this is how the system works so uh in AO and I don't know if my mic is pick up basically we have this we we break down a blockchain into its fundamental components a smart Contracting system into the components that are necessary to make it run so part of that is computation and part of it is settlement and uh data availability so for are we sorry for data availability we just poster AR and there's a certain node type that does that and they they sequence in E speak I guess and then there's this different subnet for computation where we basically build a peer-to-peer Network where anyone can plug in a node and they can stake against the correctness of um of State transitions so of computation and that computation might involve another message being sent around the system and so then we have these messaging units which are a different subnet moo yeah we call them moo C and S um and the moo they basically just push the data to the appropriate scheduling unit which does that sequencing and uploading to arwe and yeah like by split in the blockchain node up into its fundamental components and then solving each problem individually and making that arbitrarily scalable then you plug it all back together and you have an arbitrarily scalable decentralized supercomputer and it's not like it's no joke it's it's doing things like running uh llama 3 the llm the 7 billion parameter model running on chain inside a smart contract and making financial decisions so to bring back to mcoins um the day you're listening to this we're launching a a meme coin for the community it's not going to have any value but do with it what you will um and basically it's the first llm operated monetary policy so there's a llama model who runs the Llama fed and I I like to joke it's a Fiat simulator but some people don't get that basically you can go to it and you can petition it to print you some tokens and it will decide whether your petition is any good and it'll basically manage its own monetary policy and it can do that because it is a yeah an llm a real AI running inside a decentralized network have you tested this does it actually work or is it like every time we hear a crypto now we just glaze over but like this speaking to we're absolutely I'm I'm kind of blown away by this I want to see if it's like an AI this is this is an AI driven meme yes it's an AI monetary policy a meme coin called llama coin operated by the Llama fed of llama LMS is the chairman more like an AI vulker or an AI Greenspan yeah yeah we we gave them all different personalities so you get like randomly assigned to a a chairman and then they'll give you a uh they'll assess your petition you have to bend some while we' tokens to uh do the compute but so so how how do you how do you get access to this uh um the easiest way uh well it'll be on on dexi would be the easiest way to find it dxi dxi yeah. dev. any Al Gateway and it's actually a fully onchain uh deck screener that you can check out and then it'll point you to the places you know the mechanisms in the network where you can pick it up or just go to AO the computer on Twitter and I'm sure it'll be like one of the top tweets if you guys publishes on Thursday and so this is do do I how do I access AO does do I need a specific wallet AO wallet yeah you you would use an R wallet R connect is the typical one but there's actually this thing called oent now which allows you to do Google orth so Google in their KMS they have your key they can't access the key um in the same way that like if you have a ledger you can't get the the the private key out of it um but they could stop your access to it so it's an easy onboarding system but I wouldn't trust it with huge amounts of value I've had this thesis for a long time that the infrastructure layer is going to outperform pretty much every other part of the the stack for years in token space um and listening to you speak about your protocol I can't help but sit here and kick myself for not bucketing our weave into the like when I say infrastructure space I mean the the proper l1s but what you said earlier in the podcast about how what you say early on in in the history of something that's meant to be so lasting carries so much weight you know if you're if you're the George Washington or the Alexander Hamilton or the Thomas Jefferson of a web3 protocol you can't be out there Shilling your your thing like you're a you know this Cycle's protagonist on Twitter right so I kind of understand now and I I'm glad that our listeners are getting a chance to sort of see under the hood here because now I I can't you know I'd like to challenge you but I can't come up with a real counterargument for why our weave shouldn't be considered a benchmark L1 and if you're launching interesting meme coins on it uh with characteristics that are performant other than just like the pump. fun casino um wouldn't that be more fun than just buying something to see number go up only to crash back down in your face this is a very interesting concept well to be clear I don't think llama coin is a long-term store of value please don't buy for that purpose but but it it does demonstrate the the capabilities of the protocol and we think that it's also the start of something we call agent Finance which is basically AI um Financial activity on chain and most and I I hear you with the skepticism most crypto X AI is total PS that's definitely true um but if you can make it so that the AI runs inside smart contracts then you can make it such that the AI uh does Financial activity in the same way that llac coin has got its you know Federal Reserve right uh and have the trustless of smart contracts and that is actually the place where I think crypto plus AI makes sense imagine that you can have a a strategy uh that is an autonomous hedge fund basically or a portfolio balancer or whatever else it is you want uh but you can have now have it onchain trustless we think it's a huge huge Market oh massive I mean I'm I'm a Commodities Trader I I have a preference for systematic trading so I build not AI well I use a little bit of machine learning in my models to make them better uh at the very end of the the process but I am deploying agents that trade on my behalf in the crude oil market and I was just you know listening to you talk one other thing you you didn't mention just then that is I think an important marketing characteristic for your product is that in addition to the permissionless the permissionless and the uh you know the all the other benefits of web3 there's also the access um benefit which is you know if you're if you're not me and you don't have 20 years of Commodities trading experience very few institutions will let you spin up a robotic trading model and deploy it whereas you know on something like our weave you just you could do that from your bedroom with no prior experience yeah and then if your strategy does well that developer from the bedroom that no one knows the real name of even you can trust it to put more capital in your Capital right and then withdraw it at any time because it's a smart contract in the same way that you trust Unis swap yeah we think that's super cool it's it's I agree super cool uh what is the um I forgive this cliche phrase but I can't think of anything better what is the hockey stick moment for rwe like what obviously you've had a lot of success already but like where does where does our we just blast into mainstream user adoption onboarding users into crypto for the first time like a real dream scenario for you man there there's so many and there's so many different parallel threads of of adoption at this point like a we already is a hockey stick we're doing nearly a billion transactions a month and we did a billion slightly less than a billion in the first five years so that's pretty pretty extreme growth um but but outside of that what we at forward research are doing is pushing in two different directions we think there's some uh overlap but but will emerge at something that is genuinely useful to consumers in a short period of time um and that's first This decentralized Global supercomputer for lack of a better term right any computation you want can now have the characteristics of of smart contracts and and the cost should be very slightly above what you would actually just pay to AWS so that's pretty cool um we think that people will find uses for that computer in ways that you just don't use Smart contracts because like why would you use a calculator to run a desktop you know but you can run something like a desktop on top of AO you can have your little workstation you log in from anywhere in the world you're just trustly autonomously lives like inside the system and you can uh have it programmed to do whatever you want to react to the world around it while you're offline and it never goes offline like there's no such thing as offline for it um and at the same time we think on the consumer side now we didn't even get into this but basically uh we think that composable data is the big play in consumer crypto most likely right when you upload a piece of data to uh a social media platform at the moment you give away your rights to that data you sulic at minimum if not license uh the the content to the platform who then basically uses it to do whatever the hell they want and they can deplatform you a any time and when someone else wants to build a new version of a um of a a social experience they have to start again from an empty database well you can solve all that if you use awe you just upload the data to arwe it's a big open database shared between any number of participants um those participants being users or platforms and then basically when it comes to building Tik Tok you just build a a UI on top of the existing data set that says hey give me all of the videos that are ially oriented and less than 30 seconds long rather than starting with an empty database and doing all that Growth work and from the user's point of view when you upload your data you are the rights holder we built this thing called the universal data license that allows you to control those rights so you can tokenize it if you want you can say the person that owns the tokens gets the royalties and the royalties can be and know free for individual use paid for commercial or paid for AI training on top of the data like really whatever you want and so it's a a Creator now you upload your data once to the web you own it and control it and it can be reused everywhere that it is useful to people you get maximum distribution and maximum ownership rights and then underneath all of that that creates a Content economy right like there's all these different pieces of data and we're this is the direction we're going with Audy um yeah you have all these different pieces of data they acre value from royalties and well obviously you you can trade them right and you trade not just nfts the casino but actually something that's way more like a commodity it has real tangible utility that someone's going to want um it just generates Revenue based on the uh usage of the data itself and then you can build content funds that autonomously just go around and they offer to buy content from creators that they think are likely to make money in the future and that's instant liquidity for a Creator like you upload the tweet and you don't wait for Elon to pay you it's like 3 months from now you can sell 20% of that tweet today if you so desire and at the same time that obviously plays into this agent economy we're building anyway yeah I feel like I've rambled way too much here but that's kind of the big picture of where we see it going kind of reminds me of how Elon talks about turning cars into a productive asset through AI it's like well you have you know it's you had this depreciating asset that really is just a liability and through AI you can actually generate Revenue through it it's kind of what you guys are trying to do with content in a way you have this you have this content that's not really doing anything for you or and you can unlock a lot more value just by allowing it to move itself around in a trackable way it's kind of fun is cool for sure and you know there's a I think I think there's also a huge benefit if you can have content verification as well as we all know that's been a huge huge huge problem I mean to the point where if you actually listen to Trump I don't know if Biden has mentioned it but Trump has mentioned it a few times where he's talking about deep fakes yeah he goes well how do I how do how do how do you how do I make sure that people actually know it's me easy he said this at the the crypto event yeah totally interesting right and and here is that something that are we will be able to help with yeah for sure I mean so you upload that data to the the P web we call it um which is really a stack of all these protocols we're building that's what forward research my my organization that's what we see our mission as just build the Perma web that's why we build rwe that's why we build AO we acquired Odyssey it's all part of this same Mission and yeah like you you authenticate yourself with your cryptographic keys and you can store those on Google if you want but you can store them anywhere there's like a bunch of different ways and across all of the different applications on the P web you have the same identity like your identity moves in the same way the cont content moves it's just a big open data Lake basically I think that that's ites two really cre key problems which is I don't like that we live in a world where corporations control our ability to speak in the way that matters most to us like we we got the right to free speech when the the idea of transmission of information over large distances was was pretty remote and it was um you know only a very small number of people could do it if they owned a news paper basically now we live in a world where you we're all talking over the internet right but our ability to do so is at the uh at the behest of streamyard and they could just deplatform us if they want and when it becomes politically sensitive the major services do they have a track record of it we wanted to solve that and so when you own your own identity in the form of a key everyone can see who you are across any platform you're the same person and at the same time you get this flow data across all the different platforms and so you're not locked in anymore and from the developer perspective it's amazing because you don't have this cold sty problem where you have to like on day one you have an empty database and um and you have to go do growth for 10 years before you can even start to compete with YouTube which is like the story of Tik Tok instead you have the whole web's data on day one so let's say that you get there and you have Tik Tok and YouTube and Twitter and all of these Social Services um uh deploying data composability across all all of the different social graphs out there and it's this one big verifiable um core of valid censorship free information uh surrounded by a bunch of deep fakes and Bots but everybody knows what's real and what's not because you know politicians will publish their their public keys on their website and you can just go and verify that you're looking at the you know Donald Trump's Tik Tok well here's the here's the the question I had for you how can you reassure your your future users that R weave has the throughput to process what sounds like like half the internet worth of uh computation uh so my dad when I saw him recently he was commenting sometimes I I tweet the you know um the graph of the number of transactions on arweave to try and prove this point because there's one thing to tell people it's scalable it's like our industry is the industry that cried scalability and it was never true right well it actually is true this time the only way to show that to people though was literally actually demonstrated um and so sometimes I tweet these graphs we're going like 350 400 transactions a second something like this and my dad when I saw him next he said Sam are you ever worried that there'll be like a victim of your own success I was like that that is the least of my worries we got to push adoption of this thing um I'm way more concerned about that than um yeah than are we've not scaling the only way to do it is just show people and we're doing that like yeah so because your benchmark l1's right like ethereum doesn't go down but it's slow salana is super fast but it goes down from time to time um yeah I guess has has rwe ever had a major outage I haven't heard of one 14 minutes on day six of main net unusable unusable yeah um that was like six years ago but other than that yeah nodes have been online doing stuff consistently for six years um but to that Benchmark salana is where rwe's data throughput is at now right so so normally we get about 350 to 450 transactions per second on normal day uh Sal is sometimes up to like 500 600 but then it stops working um yeah and it won't be before we like double that or triple that AO itself is already causing 25% of the transactions on awe at this point we think that will be like 95% possibly within a year because agents will produce an ungodly amount of interactions right they they don't have the same concern as humans do for execution speed um and like the amount of intelligence if you will it has to go into a decision for a human is just way higher because the cost of operation is higher an agent can go like 10 times a second if it wants to and go do stuff in the market um so we think that will be a huge huge amount of transactions and then it's just a case of showing people rather than telling them because I can understand the skepticism I've been in this industry a long time too is there a Spam agent risk uh agent designed to DD your your network uh well with a you just have to pay for storage and the the network is completely agnostic as long as you pay the fee then it'll store your data or pay the fee upload the data and it'll store it um with AO right now it's a test net and so uh there's no payments on the edges apart from for that llm compute which is super super intensive so you have to have a way to um yeah at least make it cost something else you will get spam but but AO the main net will have a mechanism whereby you you just pay for the computation that you use yeah it's kind of interesting you pay for the um you pay for the security that you actually need for your transaction like I mentioned before that that ethereum and salana they have this really strange and Bitcoin too I don't think it matters so much there this strange model where the tokenomics just don't make sense like when you think about it carefully imagine ethereum without a block reward okay and infinite scalability just say they solve that problem and they got one thread and it goes any speed okay well then the the security of the network would diminish to virtually zero right because the incentive to to stake and to secure the network comes from um the block space scarcity and if you remove block space scarcity oh and the inflation reward which you can think of really like a tax on token holders right well yeah if you if you made it arbitrarily scalable there would be no there would be no fees and so the APR for staking would decline and so the number of people staking would drop to virtually zero and you actually see this in practice with salana like without the block reward salana would be absurdly insecure no they have a block reward and you might say that okay you know that's a that's a reasonable way to solve the problem it's just attacks on the people holding the token and that's one view of seeing the world but when we made AO you realize that because you can have any number of processes in parallel um you have arbitrary throughput of transactions and so you don't have block space scarcity so so how do you secure the network that pushed us down this track where essentially you just you ensure in the literal sense um by collateralization the message you want to transfer so you say hey I want a fraud detection time of 4 hours and this this transaction is worth like a million to the recipient to know that it's correct uh maybe they're moving $100,000 or 50,000 or something I want a million dollars worth of security and uh collateral that I can claim if they if the message is untrue and and that's how the system works you just buy access to that stake for that time period And so you sync stake time across the network um yeah rather than rather than having the system that just like it's basically like you're buying access to block space scarce block space in order to subsidize security like what you're what you're buying is not what you actually want and subsequently when you fix the problem of scalability then the system breaks whereas in AO we we had to do it the other way around because it was arbitrarily scalable so yeah wow this is crazy so sorry I just have so many questions um all right so let's say that I'm a financial institution and I am interested in doing what some Financial Forward Thinking institutions are doing which is uh replacing a bit of my back office with uh you know crypto web 3 blockchain technology uh so let's say that because my slow moving compliance department has approved ethereum I'm going to be settling my transactions on eth and then storing records of those transactions probably on R weave because there's no decent uh file storage mechanism built into eth um other than my compliance Department telling me hey eth is safe settle the transaction there and store the log on R weave is there any reason why eth should be part of that picture uh or should it all just go straight to our weave the reason that eth is part of the picture at all at this point I think is there two things is mimetic prominence so people just know the name brand Association but the other one sort of associated but but more sticky I which is liquidity right like why do why do projects found yeah why do people found projects on ethereum still even though it very evidently doesn't scale for a global you know globally shared address base basically that that niche of smart contracts as much as salana does and lots of them are going to salana um but why do they go to eth well it's liquidity right that's where the money is so if I'm going to build a financial application I want to do it where the money is that's why with AO we did this Fair launch mechanism like 100% of the token Supply is distributed to the community over time zero premine of any kind um and it follows bitcoin's model it goes to 21 million halfes every four years and a large chunk of that about 2/3 um slightly less than 2third is is given to people for bridging assets from other networks and the idea there is that basically you can take your your eth state eth you can Bridge it into AO and then you earn ownership of the protocol over time and when you use applications you you're essentially transferring the right to the AO that you receive to the process so that will become the recipient but that process can choose to share back with the user or share 50% or 100% what whatever they want and so this creates huge incentives for developers to build applications that attract liquidity because they just become owners of the protocol by doing so there's no grants Council it's just or you know VCS even it's just permissionless building and if you if you build something that attracts people to use it then you get paid in ownership of the protocol you're building on and as a user you earn ownership of the uh yeah of the protocol simply by using it and so we we want to turn that into like a liquidity magnet basically as soon as we realize that the technology was solved and we didn't start building AO until we actually had scalability solved because we didn't want to like you know do what basically everyone does which is build something that's kind of a bit more scalable for now and then you hit a brick roll and you have the problems ethereum has that we discussed earlier like we didn't want to do it unless we did it actually properly um yeah and so once we had the technical s solved it's very obvious that the second thing to address is liquidity right how do you make it so that there's a huge amount of value in the system to build against so that as a developer you're not always thinking I should just have done this in ethereum then there would be lots of users because there's lots of money there um and and what's nice about this model is that it scales with the market cap of the protocol so as the protocol becomes larger the market cap grows and so does that reward for people bringing in liquidity and that should be it's like been live for three or four days at this point it should be an incredible flywheel for bootstrapping the economy of a and so yeah you think you need those those connections to pull the liquidity into the system but in the ideal case that's about as much use as ethereum is longterm no offense to ethereum I really like you know they buil was incredible it just time for time for the next thing right super interesting I mean I guess wow I never thought about it that way I mean one thing near did back in the day that I thought was really cool was they um you know if you generated a lot of transactions on their Network you would get rewarded and near and that uh sort of appealed to me in in kind of an archaic sense because that's kind of how the the Petra dollar works like if you if you take your natural resources and you denominate them in this foreign entity called the United States's currency and you generate a lot of economic activity and in this foreign currency then you get to you know participate in the upswing and the value of that ecosystem and that you know that benefited one nation state uh actually several but you know just thinking about it from the Commodities perspective again geeking out but you know I think what you're doing with AO is very similar you're just doing it in a slightly more nuanced and intelligent way to try and attract value and then um kind of like I I guess redeliver that value back in spades to the people who who create successful applications with their value that they've bridged over super interesting and I think ultimately it will be successful right it's we we also thought about like you know rewarding people proportionate their transaction fees or something like this but as far as we can tell it's not possible to build a civil resistant mechanism of doing that um so so we went this other route which just says look put your economic residency there and you gain ownership of it it's also kind of cool because if you're a Trader you you kind of have to have some exposure to eth right because particularly if you're managing other people's funds like imagine you're a crypto fund and you don't have any eth and eth goes up a bunch then everyone's going to think you're an idiot well here you can get access to this new really cool Network while holding the exposure to ethereum at the same time and so we see that as and of course once you're in there it's like it's only a smaller step to be like oh well I'll just use you know Astro this uh over collateralized stable coin I'll borrow some and I'll go use this and that and the other and I'm still earning my AO while I'm doing so and then they get in the ecosystem and it's just a fly with yeah I I I will say I will I will say just from that perspective it's quite funny just running a running a crypto fund because you're you're always judged on whatever the best performing asset is at any given moment so if Bitcoins on the winning then people ask you why you're not beating Bitcoin if ethereum is the one that's wedding then they'll say well I could have just bought ethereum and then if salana rips a 10x they go well I could have just held 50% salana 50% BTC and I totally would have done that if it weren't for you guys yeah right it is it is pretty funny but you know I think uh I think I think your your point stands but at some point you know at some point you'll get away from the eth ecosystem right at some point you you you'll you'll remove yourself from that from that process especially as better as better toweling comes out I say that like what you're building and even you know when when salana came out you sell it at 8 and uh East East Market market share I'm curious because you've thought like so much about mechanism uh mechanism design um are there any other are there any other teams out there that you've you know drawn inspiration from or you know you you've you've seen uh be really be be really talented are very cool and you know you you like or because crypto is an experiment right nobody knows with 100% certainty that the design that they're building is the correct so it's kind of nice to to see other experiments I mean the first one is Bitcoin like satosi whoever that was I I have some theories but whoever they they were and I think a lot of it was kind of it worked a happy accident some of the components of it working was a happy accident but they were they said like it's kind of amazing like virtually nothing in ether sorry in the crypto ecosystem has reached proper decentralized commodity status apart from Bitcoin and Bitcoin did it first it's like they had zero zero knowledge to draw from and it just worked out okay it's pretty incredible and then ethereum as well like building you know the decentralized world calculator was seriously seriously Innovative and and they they came up with that idea um largely and executed on and built something truly incredible and then the other one I would say is salana um salana took the idea of a global shared State machine to its inst degree and and basically it would be hard to optimize much more out of that that niche in the design space but we just fundamentally don't believe that Global shared memory is necessary and there's very obvious evidence of this which is like the Global Financial system is not a shared Computer Guys where every program is accessing the memory of every other program it's a message passing machine um so yes you can of course build a Global Financial system in a in a decentralized system you just have to not have Global shared state which is which is where salana really pushed it to the limit so and they also executed very well on um adoption and growth like I remember two or three years ago listening to I won't name the podcast and also I forgotten the name so it makes it easy um this this podcast in like maybe it was the dying days of the last bull market something like that two years ago then I guess and there are these guys and you know the big eth Maxis and they were coming up with all of these amazing justifications for why eth is is definitely going to win when it was so obvious like look the best technology doesn't always win but when it's well packaged it tends to and that's what's happening with salana um and and they execute we we knew the team relatively well because when they um when they built metaplex which was the first real like takeoff use case of salana they they stored all the data on arwe and then there was there was a couple of moments where we were actually in that AR 2.0 transition making it scale properly like so we were doing it we were finishing the shipping of that live with them and that was a few intense weeks like working 16 18 hours a day getting it done and they were they were there alongside us for a bunch of that so we know them well and they they really execute like hell like they're really very very talented on that front in a way that ethereum was kind of lagging I think uh but those are the ones that I I look at and I'm you know really impressed with what they've done and there there are many others too I don't want to shut the door it's just those are the ones that come to mind wow I mean maybe there's Alpha in seeing what's blowing up on our weave uh some protocol or project is suddenly storing a bunch of valuable information in there May that means go up anyway I mean Sam you have you've Absolut I can't speak for Obby you have blown my mind on this podcast I uh I now fully place our weave into the L1 infrastructure necessary for crypto category obviously uh not you know none of this is financial advice we're not recommending that you go out there and um put all your eth on R weave and then create a Tic-Tac toe bot that plays against me and ai's Tic-Tac toe bot uh in a super high stakes automated semi-automated game but um man wow uh I think there's a lot of even even for uh by by contrast to you very stupid people like us a lot of opportunity to explore the r we ecosystem and and attempt to trade around it learn store data deploy Bots super cool thank you no I'm that that that's a plus one Sam you're absolute pleasure to listen to explained a lot of Concepts I think extremely well hard Concepts too this this is really fun well thank you for the opportunity it was fun to chat I hope it wasn't too much like text speak endless Tech speak good really really honestly good stuff I I am genuinely hoping that more somebody you know a few people listen to this and end up uh getting more involved in your community as a result this is super cool what you're building thank you that would be amazing yeah um check us out a to all right let's wrap it there [Music]

there's no winning there was this great quote that I'll read which is basically it ties into trading very well it's by saur and kard he says marry and you will regret it don't marry you will also regret it marry or don't marry you will regret it either way this gentleman is the essence of all philosophy I mean kind of which by the way that is the essence of trading this this this this this quote this is trading in a nutshell this this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance the onchain dii Primitive redesigning derivatives for the defi native you'll hear more about perennial later in the [Music] show uh welcome welcome back to another DX podcast it's been a wild ride since our last one EF approved ready to ready to roll eth basically doubled in price I hope at least some people managed to take on that trade I because you know it was funny when I was pitching that trade I really did think it was a six-month play like I had no idea that it was going to happen so quickly I I put the probability of it happening very quickly at 20% maybe but then it happened quickly I just knew that it was a good thing to hold because when you have you know when you have assets that are you you know are going to react to certain events that way you never know when the event's going to come so it's just good it's just good to own but it was uh it's good you know I I think we've done we we've we've had some pretty good calls so far yeah I mean why not do a Victory lap all of crypto Twitter does a victory lab in the most obnoxious possible ways so we can at least say hey we recommended obnoxious no I think I think eth is a great trade um I think that you know had you listened to this podcast you would have heard that word on a number of different episodes and hopefully hopefully it did something but if you didn't um the the market seems like it's setting up for a pretty extraordinary kind of second half I think there's going to be quite a lot of opportunity but also a lot of like danger and landmines if you're in the wrong tokens or if your book's too messy so this is kind of like a pretty critical Pivot Point don't you think Obi I think I think so I think the the issue the issue here is that the market hasn't reacted the way that I think most people would have hoped uh to the to the eth to the eth ETF move I mean yes we got yes we got a a nice candle it ripped it ripped hard and ether is a big asset so that was a that was a huge move but the reality is that we've stalled here and I think that's just people you know know people started panicking a little bit uh that it might I think the ETF launch might look a little bit similar to the to the BTC launch I think a lot of people deris on that cand and I also do think that there are a lot of people out there that just aren't in the market I think people were caught off guard by the strength and severity of the eth move the market clearly was not pricing the ETF in and so what's happening right here is we're just we're processing the information we're processing the the sales of the people who bought for for a quick flip because the reality is inflows aren't going to come probably you know for a month two months because the ETF isn't going to go live and that gives us the opportunity to probably range for a bit what I would assume is that you get a lot of drisking from people over the next over the next month is they're sort of waiting to see what happens with with the ETF flows and also the chart doesn't look amazing I mean we had the we had the ETF uh come in and we didn't actually push eth through the highs of March which is obviously a little concerning with all that said I think it's all just short-term noise I mean maybe eth goes down 8% but the the reality is that the this the market is structurally bullish right I think so too and I think what's more important than the eth ETF approval is the meta behind it the why right I so I was originally sort of hoping for a pullback where I could buy some $55,000 Bitcoin just on chop and apathy and you know lack of momentum leading to some sort of inertia selling and and whatever just kind of like the type of Summer where you maybe get the occasional shank to to add to your portfolio I'm I kind of losing faith that that's going to happen I think if anything we just start to push higher a lot higher very quickly from here and the reason why is like ask yourself why the EF got approved there seems to be this sea change going on in Washington where the Democrats you know are kind of giving up on their anti-crypto stance and now why would they do that um you know there's been a lot said about this so I'll try to keep it brief I just to me if you have you know however many tens of millions of crypto holders in the United States uh in an environment where you know wealth is getting inflated away and people have people have you know significant percentages of their net worth invested in this asset class why make single issue voters of them especially when the the election's going to get decided by a couple of counties and 20,000 votes Can Swing Swing the whole country one way or another in terms of red versus blue like I think the Democrats you know Trump popped on the crypto TR train uh came out pretty vocally in support of it um you know he there was that crypto dinner at Marl Lago that you were part of AI where he was you know with just offering full-throated support to crypto claiming Biden didn't understand it uh now he's like speaking to senior cryptocurrency Executives VC ramaswami and Elon Musk are like advising him on crypto policy meanwhile Biden has has reversed just flip-flopped thinking you know rationally why why would I why would I uh die on that Hill like who cares I'll I'll join the crypto train too so I think what this means Obi the whole ETF approval is a sign that the Elizabeth Warren Gary Gensler Democratic sort of anti- crypto uh obstacle has just been removed and what that means is institutions can start to get comfortable with crypto institutions of already gotten comfortable with Bitcoin and eth there's been a you know multi-year almost decade long onboarding process uh but you know institutions like Bank of New York melon can custody it now um you know that bill got passed in Congress ultimately where we're at is the floodgates are about to get opened in my opinion for institutions to settle on chain and the pathway has been cleared for um regulatory Clarity around whether or not these things are securities which in turn will lead to a world where companies can just issue tokens and pass through dollar or stable coin Revenue to token holders uh much like in you know equities pass through dividends and and then I think we're in like raging Euphoria mode again in crypto so I think that's basically why I'm so excited right now I I don't really understand why the market isn't just ripping on all of that but maybe it's just going to take some time to digest I think I think you're right I think all of that is true over a long period of time I think the issue is and the reason why the market isn't ripping is because while all of this is extremely good news it's not clear when these inflows are going to come in so for example all of the people that are scared off by the regulatory policy of the Biden admin well these are people that are very likely long-term allocators these are your Pension funds these are your big banks these are you know people that were looking at crypto they're evaluating it they're waiting for regulatory Clarity and and then they're going to come in and maybe their plan was a three-year plan and now this regulatory Clarity what's it done is it's cut down that three-year plan to a one-year plan but it's still a one-year plan they're still probably not coming in until January of next year because they're going to spend this entire year they're going to probably start dedicating more resources to it starting now why because I think a lot of people they viewed the election as the main decider how is crypto going to be treated and so they were hands off you know if Trump gets eled we'll start working we have four years under Trump to to get to get into crypto if Biden gets elected then we don't we shouldn't do anything with crypto so any time spent on it right now is a complete waste of time now that's changed as you've you know as as you pointed out correctly it's no matter who wins crypto's in a good spot it's you know actually quite quite nice I feel very comfy the thing is that these people are now only now going to start to allocate time to figuring this out and so when you talk to you know like say you talk to to talk to the people that are taking crypto Investments talk talk to big hedge funds talk ask them about their conversations with these guys they're always going to be slow moving so the re the the real issue is that we don't know when these inflows are coming and they could come in in a year what does that mean for the short term is that there's no real rush to front run that type of that type of acid in flow because if you don't know when the asset inflow is going to come then you can't really front run it now because there's so many things that going to happen in the meantime how do you isolate that risk what if macro starts to go to [ __ ] what if the world you know what if crypto in general what if liquidity gets sucked out of the system then what have you done you've youve front run for this event that's not even here yet and you have to sell your position because that event is too far off and you can't justify sticking in it what it does is it it creates stale Longs which is why I think that any movement that we got off of the back of this is it's kind of like a shitcoin pump it's like somebody tweeted about a coin that in you know it's like somebody tweeted hey by the way in one year I might buy some of this coin it's and it's a big name it's a great name maybe like you know anam's out there he's tweeted in a year I'm gonna buy some of this coin it gets a 20% pump and then it retraces immediately until he actually buys and that's that's the way that that's the way that I'm viewing this Market that's an interesting way to think about it I mean for those who have never been on an Institutional Market making desk um basically the thing that clients are most afraid of when they trade with an OTC desk like the one that I ran at um Cumberland or or the one that I ran in for oil at Goldman Sachs is they're worried that the market maker is going to front run you right like let's say that a producer comes in to hedge a bunch of oil production they're going to sell some oil Futures they're always very scared that as soon as um as soon as the guy at Goldman picks up the phone the price of oil is going to start to go down before uh before he gets his his hedge off right and so there there's rationale I'm getting somewhere with this but basically there's rationale for that and the rationale is the way that it used to work is a salesperson would receive the call from the oil producer stand up and start waving doing this like special sign language like frantically waving to the trader like the the Jonah or the Obi sitting there getting ready to quote and that depending on whether the wave was like a hand scooping air upwards or a hand pushing air downwards it would tell you whether to start clicking buy or clicking sell so indeed there was quite a lot of front running that used to go on inside of these Banks back in the day um then clients wised up the regulation tightened up and that stopped and if you were clicking ahead of a trade um you almost always lost money front running became nearly impossible because of the the way that information flows kind of tightened up and the the speed of trading increased and so there's still Traders out there trying to front run the flows but like you said it's literally impossible if you don't know when they're when they're going to come front running only works if there's going to be a big flow and you know exactly when it's hitting the market so to me looking at looking at the market you you have a point it's like okay institutions are going to buy a lot but you don't know when so I take your point there it's impossible to front run that because of the timing element but there is another flow that's looking pretty consistent that I think you know I think is a wave you can ride which is uh you know I'm just tracking the Bitcoin ETF grayscale rotation so grayscale outflows whoever was whoever was in grayscale and either liquidating it for cash or rotating it into ibid or rotating it into BTC they've stopped the Bitcoin Holdings of gbtc have basically leveled off um you know tweeted out some charts about this but ibit inflows are steadily continuing you know they're kind of averaging they're averaging you know 50 million a day is so that steady flow I think should keep a floor that that is flow that you can front run or if it's consistent just ride that that's going to keep a steady floor under the market it's going to prevent me from getting my dip to buy I think and then as the political climate turns you it's only been a week or two since this fast incredibly relevant political sea change has just occurred I think that booed by those flows you can sort of ride a a a gradual sentiment shift into a plus you know the having as well into a more bullish second half this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance perennial is quickly becoming one of the goto derivatives platforms and liquidity layers for all of defi so let me tell you a little bit about them kind of three things you need right when you're thinking about a place and a platform to trade on first one great trade execution second one low fees and third of course an onchain permissionless platform and perennial Nails all three of those buckets with the launch of perennial V2 they've made all of that possible by introducing a ton of new features such as faster oracles which reduce trade execution to seconds lower fees competing with major centralized exchanges and minimizing fees for both take and makers fully modular markets which allow the protocol to support any price feed out there and fourth cash settled right the trades are cash settled in USD not in crypto perennial allows you the trader to gain access to deeper liquidity with only a fraction of the TVO how it works is that perennial enables a two-sided Market made up of both Traders and liquidity providers right Traders deposit the assets to get leverage exposure while liquidity providers provide these pools of capital to earn fees for taking the other side of the trader position rennial allows you to trade crypto herps FX and coming soon nfts and more backed by some of the best investors in the industry perennial is a must checkout platform if you're a crypto Trader go check them out by clicking the link in the description give thousand XM credit go check out penal you're going to love them all right let's get back to the show I think that's I think I think that's actually spot on I mean you know there's we we have to we have to admit this has been a big shift in the market and it can't be disrespected now what that what that necessarily means is just be happy you know you you can probably be happier in your position with with BT with BTC and eath I also do think it goes It goes Downstream there are a lot of assets out there that were that were under SEC scrutiny that are now not going to be that you can probably you can probably pick up now the the question of do the inflows come now or later I think the answer is they it's still later it's not now 100 100% And so I don't think that necessarily we're going to blink our eyes and be at 100K in three seconds I think what's going to end up what's going to end up happening is it's going to it's there's going to be a floor in the market for a bit because I think that there people that you know on on a massive selloff will now feel more comfortable stepping in and actually picking up assets so I don't think you're going to get those you know crazy that sort of crazy sell-off anymore I don't know if we're heading we're heading for 52 to uh any any anymore at this point I think that it's it's it's actually very likely we just chop around for the next uh for the next month and I I also think that heading into heading into next year there's going to be a lot a lot of good news that comes out with respect to crypto so if you're not positioned by the end of the year you you probably should be and and so that sort of brings us to to to one to one question which is in in in a market environment uh where you have you you have this big Catalyst that you know is coming that these inflows are going to come at some point but you don't necessarily know when it's going to happen and you think that there's a floor in the market what's the best way to trade something like that right like what's the best what's the best structure to trade to trade something like that are you are you selling puts against your eth are you selling puts against your your BTC because you know that if it trades 60k you sell it against cash you want to accumulate or you you really don't think it's going to get to 50 so you're just selling you know basically you're selling Vol because we might go sideways for a bit maybe you're like what happens let's say we go into a low Vol period what what are you doing with your book yeah I mean I think the trade coming into this this whole thing has been coinbase right coinbase stock has been really performing on the back of this regulatory shift and I'm wondering if that's if that's going to continue you know like I'm wondering that the I don't want to Mid curve this too much but like like deregulation good for coinbase um and then the opposite argument that that's the that's the left curve take and then the the smart guy would be like deregulation is good for for coinbase what I'm worried about is if we go into an environment where suddenly like everybody just can all the all the flow shifts onto trafi exchanges like ibid on the New York Stock Exchange does coinbase lose a big ass chunk of its business I don't I don't know how many of you have traded on coinbase out there if you're all just like total onchain Deens but coinbase is not cheap to trade on you know it's not the best solution like even you know we we reviewed hyper liquid a while ago like there's there's any number of places to get better liquidity on any of this [ __ ] than coinbase so the more mainstream this becomes I'm I'd be worried about that one maybe maybe a like maybe like a total horse trade would be by coinbase puts that's actually kind of interesting uh by I mean yeah I I I I think that coinbase is kind of like it's it's bad it's bad to trade on but the question is if if let's say you know Meme coin Mania continues right or altcoins or altcoins continue well coins still represents that ability for more traditional folk that only have access to a brokerage to bet on the growth of well you know basically all coins right almost and base is [ __ ] exploding too that's a in a good way they're um L2 actually you know what I read today that was wild how much how much volume do you think Robin Hood did in meme coins over the last two weeks oh man um I when I was quoting Robin Hood we would like they were basically only listing uh Doge and shib I don't know what meme coins are on there now but let's say let's say uh 40 million a day dude they did $4.5 billion dollar whoa yeah $4.5 billion dollar in meme coins over the last two weeks Pepe Pepe oh last two weeks okay yeah but like how like come on no that's that's enormous what what memes can you trade on Robin Hood I don't have a Robin Hood account I know I know you can trade Pepe I know you can trade Doge um mes like crypto on Robin Hood is probably something that we should know yeah like what what types of what what we offer crypto let's see what what what do we got by the way 4.5 billion over two weeks is 321 million a day damn that's that's that's serious volume that's like 2021 type stuff and while you're looking this up you know I talked to some of the younger traders that I I've met just through my Commodities Network the guys that are like passionate you know oil gas gasoline jet fuel Traders these these sort of like Commodities guys I mean the average the average one he has like 30% of his or her net worth in crypto right now that's trades on Leverage it's it's crazy it's like people with any risk appetite in that generation just do not see a path to Financial Freedom through trafi uh stocks and bonds so I can I can understand why Robin Hood's churning you know 300 3 like mid nine figures a day in memes dude that's that's actually that's actually wild and one thing that I'll say is that if if this continues and maybe Robin Hood is is the play for like the traditional guys that have a brokerage if they if they want to bet on memes maybe you just buy Robin Hood and the chart actually looks quite good uh it's rallied it's it's rallied pretty aggressively over over the last month um so I just asked uh I asked grock on Robin Hood you can grock on Twitter is great for everything do shib whiff Bon Pepe and Flaky is is that is is gron is like grock [ __ ] with us I don't understand could be could be [ __ ] with us but that's pretty bananas it's a great mem coin proxy so it's actually it's actually possible that as people want to get access to meme coins but they can't actually get get on eth they can't actually go by you know go go get on salana they can't go get on all these on all these uh l1s because you're you're regulated buy buy some Hood because if that that $4.5 billion dollar number is pretty nuts know that is yeah so that's that's significant that that's significant appreciation for Robin Hood when I was quoting Robin Hood they were making 35 basis points on every dollar of notional that a user would trade on uh on their platform now I think they've since reduced that to like 20 basis points but if they're trading 350 million a day um that would be let's see that would be uh $700,000 a day of just meme coin Revenue yeah it's pretty [ __ ] bananas for a for a platform like that so yeah that's that's maybe a stock you buy as like meme coin beta because I don't think the equity analysts are paying attention to that you know the more the more that I think about it the more that I like it because we all we all know that these types of these types of assets that are basically e you know ETF lights or ways to access the crypto Market that nobody else can have they they actually tend to do they tend to do very well so I I actually like that I like that a lot maybe I need to go pick up some Hood man me too there's weird Alpha in some of these like like listed equities that touch crypto like e for example uh gbt DC was a [ __ ] Grand Slam now Hood in meme coin Mania yet for some master um for some reason trafi just doesn't pick up on this stuff there's like a a weird Chinese wall between the world of trafi and the world of shitcoins um what I'm concerned about though is okay as we go into the second half of this year we're all bullish on bitcoin eth and salana the bar for investing in something in a in a in a token that is not Bitcoin eth salana or something in the meme coin casino which isn't even an investment that's just fun right that's just that's craziness um is so high because the thesis and the risk reward Behind The Benchmark l1's Bitcoin e salana is just so good so like I'm getting really worried about two things I'm worried about one putting my money into an altcoin that just tanks or flatlines while the rest of the market rips and missing out on the huge rally with that capital or two um being risk averse and having all my money in Bitcoin Ethan salana and then like some [ __ ] name your sector summer occurs dpin do I don't know what AI ex crypto you know could be live Pier it could be too it could be any these [ __ ] things um and I miss out on a THX right so I'm it's it's dicey right now with the altcoin space there's there's no there's no winning I read uh there was there was this great quote that I'll read which is basically it it ties in it ties into trading very well it's by saur and kirkgard he says marry and you will regret it don't marry you will also regret it marry or don't marry you will regret it either way hang yourself you will regret it do not hang yourself you will regret that too hang yourself or didn't hang yourself you'll regret it either way this gentleman is the essence of all philosophy I mean kind of which by the way that is the essence of trading this this this this quote this is trading in a nutshell the way that I had it explained to me by one of my mentors who's this like legendary natural gas Trader guy he's like Jonah in natural gas Trading only two emotions shame and regret and it's basically what you just said shame shame when you uh when you miss out on a trade and regret when you [ __ ] buy the wrong thing and lose your shirt so I don't like think of all these think of all these sexy like Mega launches that just occurred right there's like there's been in the last couple years there's been apto suie say I don't know maybe you put World coin in there telegram ton whatever um are are we supposed to own any of that stuff going into this like new paradigm I am kind of thinking no you know you know what I think I think they're I think they're they're good for trades the what I've failed to see is any real traction and I would love if anyone in the comments you know one of my favorite things about doing this podcast Jonah is that anytime I like say well this isn't happening or that isn't happening or this sucks or that sucks we inevitably get comments that say you haven't looked at this so I'm hoping that we get this this time Avalanche Aptos SE suie all of these other platforms outside of Ethan outside of Ethan salana arbitr optimism nothing is H nothing is actually happening with these platforms anymore and I think that's one of the that's one of the reasons why meme coins have po so hard in my non professional opinion is that last cycle there was at least a facade of happening on l1s there all these Partnerships that they were now saying this that we're going to build this we're going to build that through all these you know the the game of well it's Unis swap on this protocol or you know balancer on this protocol or blah blah on this protocol so on and so forth that has disappeared from crypto you don't hear anything out of these l1s anymore pushing that they're actually doing real work or if they are pushing that it's not widely appreciated widely known or realistically at the core widely cared about because it's viewed as fake so my view on this is that these guys the reason is because these guys aren't actually doing anything and it's you know only so long that you can you can keep that facade up with that said uh it would be nice if somebody in the comments comes in and tells and tells me otherwise it's just I I haven't paid attention to that area of the world and maybe I should but I haven't because there was you know I was for a very long time and my takeaway was well there's kind of no reason to and that doesn't mean that they're not going to pump it doesn't mean that you're not going to get a good trade in right they're always they're always idiosyncratic buyers of any asset if you have you know if if you have a monitor of all these different l1s and you're tracking their volume and then one day you wake up and the volume is 5X what it normally is and price is not up that much then maybe you need to buy this thing however that doesn't mean anything for the long term ter right it's just a it's it's just a good trade and that's how I feel about a lot of these a lot of these assets right now unfortunately they're they're not good trades they're just you they're not good Investments they're just good trades which is fine right that's okay um you just have to sort of know what you're getting yourself into yeah I agree I think another thing that you can do to play these sort of like these downtrends right like what's if you think about just from a market structure perspective what's actually going on inside of a suie or a SE or an AP or a near or an avalanche um the reason why they sort of trade broadly correlated with the the you know Bitcoin and eth is because there are correlation algorithms um that you know let's say every time eth ticks up and near is unchanged the algorithm will like buy a little bit of near um these are like and vice versa right so these are called mid-frequency correlation algorithms sometimes they'll pair trade it versus e sometimes they won't um so like crypto there's sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy because of these correlation mid-frequency algorithms that keeps all of the major Benchmark Assets in line with each other but underneath the hood what's going on inside of an eth is like or a salana like there's actual [ __ ] going on there are developers there's an ecosystem there are new users coming in opening wallets buying tokens and then in these sort of like more dead Zoo ecosystems like uh I don't know polka dot there's um not much happening and so except inside and VCS unlocking and selling right so the pairs are where you can really read the Tea Leaves of what's what's going on you know obviously not withstanding a massive Catalyst event or an explosion in volume the dayto day in like the polka dot eth pair or the near eth pair will just be this like smooth downtrend and so one thing that you can do as a Trader if you're focused on this full-time is you can identify opportunities where it perps in these you know kind of dead ecosystems trade at a premium and then you can pairs pairs trade where you short the where you short the altel one and buy the The Benchmark L1 like ether salana because these smooth trends like the these things last for weeks um so you could pick up a little bit of funding and a little bit of smooth p&l I don't personally have time to do that sort of thing anymore but I used to yeah that's uh I remember seeing some of the some of the charts that you had shared in the past where you basically look at the the the distance from a moving average on these on these sort of pairs and when it had gotten to a point where it was like you know two standard deviations away from the average distance then you just buy it because these these pairs tend to also just be mean inverting in general yeah so I yeah I I I remember that and I think it's a good it's good probably good trading for right now especially because I mean actually the more that I think about it especially because if these assets don't have any real fundamentals behind them it's and and these pumps are just idiosyncratic buyers in the market that mean version happens probably very frequently now so if you have a if you if you want you can even set up a screener to say well you know look at you can go by each coin you can pick the most correlated coins for every coin like the top three correlated coins and then calculate the screener and then just find out when there's large standard deviation moves could could be could be could be a good exercise if you build that come come call me I'll I'll pay for your product another good one uh shout out to Josh Frank who built the tie doio um VC unlocks like imagine you're a VC locked into one of these just totally dead Mega cap Assets in crypto you're just literally Crossing off days on your calendar one by one until you can get the [ __ ] out and redeploy that Capital into something interesting and so I think that maybe not outright but in you know the these guys have gotten lucky right all of their shitcoins have rebounded massively since the collapse and a lot of them are locked up in saffs that were minted in the sort of 2021 2020 era these guys are gonna these guys are going to get out as soon as they can so those will that'll knock the pairs down the sort of like all L1 versus eth pairs um so maybe if you have the unlocks calendar you can you can get ahead of that and make some easy money that was something we did at uh Cumberland as well yeah it's uh I I I hope that doesn't get too widespread because some of these trades get really crowded um but that you know one of the not not to just like go down listing all the different trades that are kind of interesting but one of my favorite trades is uh is the is the aird drop trade so for example R weave is getting a massive airdrop over the over the coming uh over the coming weeks and right now I'm looking at the Futures curve and you can short are we Futures and they they're not backward a yet so you basically just get the free airdrop at some point that future will go backward at and you'll actually have made some good money on it uh so you can make it you can actually what's kind of interesting is you can actually make money both ways if you time if you time it right you can you can short the short the future by spot the future will go if you short it now the future will go backward at you can buy back uh you know you can you can buy back buy back the future and then actually go uh short on the on the per hm which is kind of nice interesting just looking at the speaking of aird drops I'm just looking at what happened to friend not so friendly price action there these aird drops when was the last time an air drop but at some point at some point Jonah everybody will forget that friend exists it'll bot him out all the sellers will be out and then it'll rip this is what happens you just the key is remembering to pay attention like that's genuinely the key because I I fall into this trap a lot like here's my problem unlike some people on crypto Twitter who are super popular I'm not really a cheerleader like I'm occasionally willing to just like throw in the towel on stuff forever and just be like this particular asset is [ __ ] I'm worried I'm not saying it's [ __ ] but I'm worried that friend Tech is just toast and the token is is is gone like oh no I man this is why people hate me out there but like yeah I mean you're kind of a hater just being honest well no I mean I I love I love Bitcoin eth and salana and certain memes but like what what is there to don't you let's not pick on friend Tech have you heard or or witnessed like examples in crypto of products that launch they're popular for like a month until people lose interest then they go silent then the airdrop happens around the airdrop people start farming and getting involved and being active to to claim their tokens and then [ __ ] just dies again um afterwards like aren't aren't you worried about buying airdrop tokens in because of that sort of price action and activity pattern I mean the the answer the answer is no mainly because I can't think of many other products in crypto that have like how many other products in crypto do you know that are like frch I guess there's farcaster but yeah not really not really many it's I guess telegram kind of competes with friend Tech and they're kind of in crypto there just not that many cryp like I just wouldn't say that there are crypto products that have come into favor and then fallen out that have actually you know achieved the the prevalence of something like a f Tech that are actual real I mean obviously 100% you see it with all the speculative things right you saw like GMX was huge for a bit uh you know roll bit was obviously very big for a bit and then fell out of relevance there there there these assets that were tied to speculative products that fell out of favor but and and frch is a speculative product but it's a different type right it's genuinely a social media platform and so I do have to give them some credit uh that they're you know that that they're going to be around they're going to figure out a way to uh you know to pump to pump their token for better word uh but you know I actually can't think of any like fch like platforms that have reached this you know reached this state yeah I'm I'm struggling I'm just throwing out things boor Apes was kind of a social network with a value attached to it uh I don't know I basically what I'm doing here is I'm just kind of trying to parse through the altcoin space with you and see if there's anything worth doing there against the backdrop of this like screamingly bullish amazing risk reward in the benchmarks um I mean I'm I'm I'm right now I'm a benchmark Maxi what can I what can I say yeah it's just the other stuff is just like the benchmarks are so obvious to anybody who's paying attention uh and the rest of it is like I just I can't get my head around it it's too dicey it's crypto still hasn't had its mainstream adoption moment you know the one thing the one thing I mean even with benchmarks it's been just a bit sad to see is for the last 3 days there's just been a consistent teawap out of eth BTC I think the market in general has been conditioned to fade eth BTC and so it's you know it's down it's down a percent percent and a it's down a percent and a half today um bit Bitcoin Bitcoin is up and and eth eth is eth is struggling I think that what's what's a bit what's a bit is even with all this all of these Tailwinds eth can't eth can't catch a break man this thing just like keeps getting slammed well who's slamming it it's people who are long eth taking profits I think that that the same thing happened to bitcoin after it gassed higher uh people were getting out right so yeah let's see let's see if they come back in well I mean they don't need to if an ETF gets approved which it kind of has right like um you have a new buyer base coming in or maybe TR I starts opening wallets and settling stuff you get the Black Rock Biddle fund expanding I I don't know um it's eth BTC is a tough one but I think if you're going to look at an all like a pairs trade that's steadily trending lower you don't look at eth BTC you look at one of these alt l1s versus Bitcoin or alt l1s versus eth actually maybe that's the way to structure it and ALT L1 versus Bitcoin if you can get that pair on I think that yeah you you just just risk I I think it's all about entry point for that it's like what you kind of want to wait for is you want to wait for one of these scam pumps on like a like an aptose you wanna you wna you want to see it go up like 15 20% in a day and then you're just like all right get me out get me out get me out go go go go go that's a good one to short apose that one has huge VC unlocks uh coming in the next year or two um although it's it's it's it [ __ ] died in March came off 50% it's been sideways the issue with with these trades right now is that a lot of them are already off so I'm I'm I'm of the mindset that I kind of want to wait to to short these things but we'll see what one thing we didn't um mention is that uh I don't know if you saw the headline come through that musk is working with Trump on crypto and then musk came out and said just kidding never mind the issue is that you're dealing with two of the biggest Liars that have ever existed on this planet and so you don't know which one is lying one of them lying but it's not like there's one trustworthy one and one not trustworthy one um but the whole uh the whole point of this was that if if it's true probably want to own more Doge yeah I mean when dotf right that's that could be that could be pretty wild I do do you think do you think our society has jumped the proverbial shark after the do gtf I think like Society in general I think it's already I think this is we're witnessing the decline of Western Civilization already for a number of reasons I I don't think societies jump the shark if we if we end up with a do gtf I think most zombie companies and most equities and crypto in general is already far crazier than an ETF or a popular meme coin I really do I think we're we're far beyond that point of wildness already yeah that's that's fair and there there are a lot of other things that are probably marking the top of the American Empire that I won't get into on this podcast because I'll probably get canceled for believing it but if you want to get canceled just say salana is in trouble and then it's going to go down then I'll get you canceled but if you don't say that I think you're good I think if you repeat Jonah salana is in trouble eight times then I'll buy salana and I'll actually find I think that would be if if you could do that for me that would be real nice much much appreciate it buddy H what what I mean is there even any point asking what else there is to buy besides Bitcoin eth and salana I just there has to be there has to be some process for for other than like selling coins that are slowly dying that that we can use to make money I mean I I'm sort of like the big the big red flag for me across all of this is watching what nfts are doing right nfts B basically show you that you know just because Bitcoin has pumped every cycle every bull market since its Inception does not mean that every crypto asset will pump every bull market right I I do believe in nfts I think they're going to skip a cycle and probably pump again later this decade but like what that goes to show you is just how spectacularly you can underperform like the the BTC board ape Yacht Club pair is just up only in all environments and I don't want to given that as a as a Trader you know for the listeners out there you're always trading a pair right you're trading Bitcoin versus USD if you're buying something a little more speculative you could consider it like speculative asset versus Bitcoin because that Capital would probably be in Bitcoin you know you the onus like the burden of proof is just so high to invest in anything right now and so I think Obi you hit the nail on the head we've just got to start actively trading catalysts actively like pairs trading yield farming uh collecting funding from perss against spot like doing all the little creative things that people need to do to eek out a profit but there is no real investment thesis for long-term hold holding beyond the benchmarks yeah I think that's I I I think I think that's God it's so depressing but fair well it's good for Traders it's good good obman it is it's good it's good for trading that that's for sure and which is which is what I'm doing I mean right now I'm like T tactically short the market um just because I think that you know we could uh I I I think that we could have the floor F out from under us in terms of like five five six percent move but also I'm recording this right before pce and so if equities and the rest of the market uh sell off a ton that actually makes it a really good buy because that means that the you know if if we get good data then there's there's there's a nice upside surprise um but yeah I mean I think in I think in general in in in general right now I'm I'm tra I'm trading pairs I'm being I'm being careful uh I think it's uh it's it's a yeah it's a it's G to be an interesting Market next next few weeks I think just because Mar there's just no real Direction these are the hardest markets because these are the ones where you lose focus do stupid [ __ ] put on a bunch of bad trades and then in six months you know you don't notice the pain in the beginning but then after six months you're just kicking yourself so this is where discipline comes in I mean one thing that I'm noticing Commodities broadly are rallying but um oil's puking right now and if we get a proper selloff in in transportation fuels I think that could help uh that that's something that the inflation people aren't necessarily laser focused on right now if this sell off continues which I think it probably will then maybe you get some cooler CPI ey prints and uh maybe the the rate cutting starts as we head into the election cycle and then assets overheat that could be a bullish Catalyst I think other than macro though there's nothing like there's nothing particularly crypto native to cause lip off at this point I why one one question that I had is why did why did natural gas rally so damn much I'm not really paying attention to natural gas as much as I should but I think I think that thing was related to some sort of like late winter um cold snap or something it's uh I forget exactly why but yeah I don't I don't have a good answer for you there maybe we should wrap it there then and uh let let the audience enjoy our confusion and feel uh less bad if if you're confused because so are we belong belong the benchmarks uh help us figure out the rest right now Jonah is a pleasure pleasure talking to you as always it's uh sorry for for losing focus towards the end the market was [ __ ] itself and I was covering my shorts Traders got to trade Traders got to trade but that's good you it's like you guys are on the trading floor with us you know you get to you get to experience what it what it's like you know the the Meandering conversations the uh actually can you shut up for a second while I make this trade yeah exactly it's good it's good we're just doing hard job great talking to you Obby obviously none of this is investment advice we clearly don't know anything um good luck out there don't know a goddamn thing so please me we're gonna try to do some more uh Creator uh Dev type type uh interviews pretty soon to get you some new content not just us rambling about sideways markets right all right later adios [Music]

the world the world changes if Bitcoin gets above 70k very simple because then you get animal spirits coming back in but the world changes if we're below 55k too then Animal Spirits start people start liquidating I mean you have NASDAQ at the highs you have S&P at the highs uh and BTC is not like you said there's dispersion going on there's chop this is a time to consolidate the portfolio right this is a time to like reduce line items that's that's what I'm 100% on board with is just reducing complexity in the book right now there are going to be things that are going to do that are going to do very well and you can you can trade those I think in aggregate you just want a more concentrated portfolio this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance the onchain dii Primitive redesigning derivatives for the defi native you'll hear more about perennial later in the [Music] show all right guys welcome back to another episode of 1 100x we have been chopping around for a while but today this morning had a very nice move from the from the crypto markets is the biggest candle we've seen in a while and we've finally gotten over that 65k hump and everything is up a lot today it's looking good how you feeling Jonah going good I'm long don't really know don't really know if I'm going to get my chance to buy a dip or not uh but I don't care I mean if this is the last time we if like if we're never going to hit 60k again in Bitcoin it's party time I'm not going to be complaining um I kind of lack conviction on a lot of the space right now uh if if everything nukes I want to go shopping as we talked about on the last podcast if everything rips I'm not going to do anything and frankly I just I feel like we're going to keep chopping for a while I don't I don't have like a outside of the the barbell portfolio that we talked about I don't have a lot of conviction right now yeah I I think so the one thing the one thing that was clear to me is that after we failed to break 60k again I mean we had we had a few shots there so last Friday we had that ridiculous selloff on on pretty low low liquidity low volume where we went straight from 63 to 61 in like half a second uh and then we reversed that entire move we bled out we bled out again and then we started we started moving up I mean we've we've attacked 60 a bunch of times at this point and we haven't we haven't been able to we haven't been able to get through but with the uh you know on on the same side we've attacked 65 a lot and we haven't really been able to get through so let's see what this this let's see how we sustain this move here my view is that we're still in that we're still in for Chop I mean alts during this time have bled out a reasonable amount eth BTC has bled out a reasonable amount memes haven't actually done particularly well except for you inciting the entirety of the internet to buy vat in yeah we got to talk about that but I I I do I I do think that while while BTC is still is still a good buy and there's some alts that I like like I was talking about you know I've been talking about R for a long time um there there definitely some select alts that I still that I still very like I think as as a general complex the alt complex doesn't really interest me other than for bounces right now uh until we get a sustained Rally from from BTC I'm sort of on the side of the of the duck that tweeted that memes are that memes are over for now I mean I don't think that they're over for the full cycle but I do think that on every you know move higher people get really excited and on every move lower people get very bearish and that what that what that tells me is is that we're probably just in for a little bit more chop through the summer and so I'm not chasing every move higher and and chasing every move lower at this point I think what I said is you know I was happy to buy around 55 56 on the last podcast and that we were due for a bounce um I still believe that you know I think some of my uh some of my some of my takes were some of my takes were taken on Twitter out of context you know when I was saying by really really people on Twitter didn't give you the benefit of the doubt and they they took things that you said and molded them in ways that would see make you seem stupid that's crazy yeah I know never happens it's it's honestly it's insane I I can't I can't believe that they did this to me but to articulate it what I was trying to say was that buying 55 56 57 that area that I was saying on last pod when I said this is a good place to buy it doesn't mean that we're never going to reach that level again it just means that I think if you buy there and you wait for an extended period of time like six months you're probably going to be very happy yeah I I completely agree I'm saying this even though we're at 66 I'm not saying this because oh we're back at my target like we're you know we've done very well since then but I think the that that got taken out of context because we traded back to 60 and everyone was freaking out they're like well what about you said buying at 56 was such a great idea and uh you know now you're like now now we're back in 60 and you're actually a little bit you know you're a bit nerv I think we were at 63 times like you're a bit bearish at 63 even though blah blah blah like well and look it's up now you must be you must be wrecked AI I I remember seeing a chart on Twitter of a few different um for for the record avi's just fine um I remember seeing a chart of all the different Twitter Personalities in crypto on these axis one axis was like um djen versus Normie and the other axis was like uh like perable versus Doomer and Avi you you got put like you're the most Doomer Deen on basically you are the lower right quadrant and according to some nobody on Twitter and I guess what I what I have to say about all this like people are doing the same thing to me I'm getting you know I'm getting said about Bowden which is interesting we'll get into that later but like here are a couple observations observation number one the market is chopping up and down the chart is red green red green that is undeniable observation number two last Friday when we nuked it wasn't just us in cryptoland that that nuked oil nuked the S&P nuked everything nuked today everything's ripping why because CPA CPI came in slightly less hot than uh expected this is super important because it detered hike Cycles or uh cut Cycles right it determines fed fed action and inflation is basically the most important economic issue in America right now so like everything gapped higher on a CPI print today including Bitcoin Bitcoin isn't like there's no fundamental narrative here nor was there a fundamental narrative to the sell off last Friday observation number three um if one thing that I noticed Junior Traders doing when they first join right is they chop themselves up they buy high they sell low that doesn't mean that like selling something that's going down is a bad idea or buying something that's going up is a bad idea it just means that if that's all you ever do you you're gonna you're gonna bleed out right and there's a lot of that type of Junior Trader sentiment on Twitter and in the crypto world right now because people aren't making money they're they're like when you when the thing is chopping sideways money is not really getting made like sure somebody caught the Pepe thing or maybe some crypto person had some GameStop in a like a brokerage account somewhere and is bragging about it but like for the most part the space isn't really making money if anything I would guess they're like buying highs and selling lows and chopping themselves up and losing money everybody's a little pissed off everybody's over interpreting everything basically let's let's so let's like break this down into time frames Obi you you convinced me of something on the last podcast you were like this thing is g to probably dip below 60k at some point at which point I'd like to start shopping pretty pretty heavily I I hadn't really thought about that I I was kind of in like blinders on bullish mode I agree with you and so I'm prepared to blow the rest of my watt if that happens because I'm I'm medium to longterm quite bullish but when we talk about like a potential pullback we're not we're not you know if it goes up without pulling back neither you nor I is going to be crying upset unable to to it's not like out of crypto right so yeah I think those are the sort of things that we need to observe going into this period of time and the sentiment in the space just to finish my thought like would you agree AI that it's people are losing a bit of money right now and kind of pissed off that's how it feels yeah I I think I think everyone's gotten chopped up like crazy right now and I think the other the other thing that's pissing people off is that there's a ton of dispersion in the market and so there are there are some people that are making money uh but the majority of people are not making money and that that's actually what tends to lead to these ranges is because people have probably stepped out of the market some amount and whenever we trade lower everybody goes okay well now's my chance now it's going to break let me Pile in let me actually finally make some money and cast this next move and everyone shorts the lows and then those shorts get taken out and then it's the opposite to the top side whenever we have a rally to the top side of the range he goes okay it's finally time to make some money I haven't made money in a while let me buy let me buy here we're gonna we're gonna go and we don't go anywhere and this is this is just classic range trading Behavior right now I think uh the the range will the range will resolve itself once people have detached themselves from the market I think we're probably going to lose more people throughout the summer and then that's when you know that this thing is finally going to finally going to start to start to pick a Direction I mean the the the issue is that the two things that stand out to me are still that stable coin balances are not going up and ETF flows are not really doing anything still uh you know so so I'm ETF flows did too much there's an amazing chart out there that uh I saw basically in terms of like AUM accumulation on the like AUM on the Y AIS and time on the x-axis basically these Bitcoin ETFs the Fidelity One and black rock accumulated assets Faster by like literally orders of magnitude 10 orders of magnitude than the second third and fourth fastest ETFs in history right so like yeah it's it's slowed down but if it had continued at this pace it would have been pretty unprecedented crazy [ __ ] so we're I we we're taking a breather jury's still out but yes I agree with you like in the short term um in the short term that's that's not going to be driving a big bull run in the medium to long term who knows I have the chart here so ibit in 49 days has accumulated 18 billion fbtc in 77 days has accumulated um 10 billion uh then like GLD in 817 days from when it was first issued dude accumulated 10 billion so same as like the Fidelity uh ETF accumulated in literally 10% as much time so basically that goes to show I'm GNA post this uh we're gonna we're GNA post this on the YouTube page so that everybody can see it like it's it's pretty crazy it it took 10 times as long for GLD the gold ETF to accumulate this much AUM accumulate as much AUM is the second biggest uh crypto ETF Bitcoin ETF gold is e harder to buy for the average person than Bitcoin is in my in my you know personal opinion so basically the only way to hold gold is through an ETF if you're an investor the only way to hold gold is through an ETF you can't really hold gold any other way you can go to Costco and buy like a gold bar but it's a pain in the ass yeah so I would I would I would wager that the percentage of people that are in you know the the percentage of people that are going to hold gold ETFs as a proportion of gold market cap is actually going to be higher in the long run than the proportion of people that hold BTC relative to the BTC Market Cap because you can hold BTC outside of the investor class yes but like the human race there are people in India holding gold that you know and and also their they central banks and yeah whatnot and and blah blah blah but all that all that being said what I'm trying to articulate is that we're probably close to the end on BTC ETF inflows like I would wager that there's probably 50 billion to 75 billion left in aggregate to come into BTC ETFs until BTC is priced reasonably fairly so if you think about how like how big should BTC be relative to gold is it par is it half is it a third I mean to me half would be like insane party time right yeah like that that that that that would be ridicul ul and I think another 50 billion in ETF flows probably gets Us close to there you get if you get another 50 billion 75 billion of demand you're probably looking at half the market cap of gold I mean the market cap of gold is $16 trillion okay and the market cap of Bitcoin right now is 1.3 trillion so you think $75 billion worth of inflows drives Bitcoin market cap from 1.3 to maybe maybe it would drive it up 3x I think another 50 billion to 75 would drive it up 3x oh man I mean what you said when you said that you think we're sort of nearing the end of the ETF inflows for now like that's kind of a spicy take I would take the other side of it but then you said another 50 to 75 billion yeah yeah I I I say I say I say it like the the uh the ETF is not going to drive Bitcoin to Infinity I'm not I'm not saying that what what I'm not trying to say that we're actually close in terms of price appreciation what I'm saying is that you know we're not in inning one of Bitcoin ETF we're not in inning two or probably inning five inning six of of Bitcoin ETF inflows I don't know I I I think the jury is out like I did you see that the Wisconsin uh I think it's like the state Wisconsin pension fund um for like government employees bought $160 Million worth of bitcoin ETFs like they just disclosed it if that sort of if if like that pool of capital is what we're talking about here if that's the type of person or institution that's interested in these ETFs they we could just be getting started like those Pension funds manage tens of trillions of dollars and if they're putting even a few basis points into ibit it's like aing is that that allocation is are they are they going to put more than a few basis points in not them but there's you know 49 other states that have Pension funds and then there's you know fire departments and fire teachers systems and you know these these Pension funds are just everywhere they're enormous yeah and that that'll account that'll account for the next 50 billion that's going to come in yeah maybe it's all that I think we're probably I think we're probably peing at 100 billion of of AUM that's my guess which at 100 billion of AUM you're probably you're probably not getting much more that's probably that's probably stable in terms of what's coming in and what's coming out of so and I think and so I think what happens is that's the main driver of BTC price action and I don't think that happen over the summer I think that happens in Q4 and so that's why I think that you probably get a summer of chop and then in Q3 you probably get the people that are front running those Q4 allocations Q4 q1 allocations into next year and then that's when you get that's when you get a crazy rally that's my you know mid mid Cur take I think actually a reasonable amount of people agree with that but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's wrong no I agree with it I don't think it's mid in that in that mean in that interim period before we get that I think that you get some dispersion in the altcoin space but because there's no there's not a ton of new net capital coming in you probably just get a bleed out from a lot of different assets especially because there's a lot of Supply coming online and so I actually don't think it's the worst time in the world to just take a you know take a break from trying to trade ridiculously actively and just wait for wait for the extremes and you can you can obviously take trades out like for example I think yesterday was a was a good example of a good trade that you had a macro event that was reasonably priced in and watched but you had a lot of people still shorting the lows like shorting that 60k level and so obviously they're going to get blown out but will this draw enough new capital in to get to New all-time highs I guess probably no but you know I could I can always be wrong this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance perennial is quick becoming one of the goto derivatives platforms and liquidity layers for all of defi so let me tell you a little bit about them there are kind of three things you need right when you're thinking about a place and a platform to trade on first one great trade execution second one low fees and third of course an onchain permissionless platform and perennial Nails all three of those buckets with the launch of perennial V2 they've made all of that possible by introducing a ton of new features such as faster oracles which reduce execution to seconds lower fees competing with major centralized exchanges and minimizing fees for both takers and makers fully modular markets which allow the protocol to support any price feed out there and fourth cash settled right the trades are cash settled in USD not in crypto perennial allows you the trader to gain access to deeper liquidity with only a fraction of the tvl how it works is that perennial enables a two-sided Market made up of both Traders and liquidity providers right Traders deposit the assets to get lever exposure while liquidity providers provide these pools of capital to earn fees for taking the other side of the trader position rennial allows you to trade crypto pers FX and coming soon nfts and more backed by some of the best investors in the industry perennial is a must checkout platform if you're a crypto Trader go check them out by clicking the link in the description give th000 XM credit go check out perennial you're going to love them all right let's get back to the show new capital is what's key right so posted this framework for investing in tokens on Twitter basically first thing is every token is a meme coin just accept it even Bitcoin is a meme coin right and where so you whenever you're holding something that doesn't fundamentally pass through earnings to you or isn't like a commodity that will be bought incessantly by some consumer to to produce buildings or Transportation fuels or you know wires or semiconductors like if if you're just holding something waiting for somebody else to buy it from you which is kind of the state of crypto since uh you know the regulatory picture is not so clear you sort of have to ask yourself who's the greater fool that's going to come take this off my hands well like you said it new capital so what I'm doing is I'm just going through my portfolio right now and asking myself like is there more money going to come in to buy this asset that I'm holding right for Bitcoin the answer is unequivocally yes like so yes for all of the geopolitical and macro reasons that we've discussed at nauseum on this podcast that it's not even worth like doing any further analysis for now especially with the having and less selling um and the prospect of ETFs te bottlenecking like pension fund flows like we just talked about for meme coins I also deeply believe in meme coins but uh when I see meme coins doing like down only instead of chopping with the rest of the space especially ones that I hold I'm like time I'm going to drisk ratably as they go down like I'm going to vwap sell as this thing is trending down because uh there's no like earnings report that's going to come out that's going to lift this token back up right there's no I'm just waiting for another Pool of capital to come in and if it's especially if it's like a cartoon coin um psychology can become pretty pretty significant and and Trends can accelerate so in the case of Bowden for example I've been you know all in on Bowden for a while I reduced about 75% of my position on the way down because I was just like this is not a chopping asset this is this is people like just getting out every single day um now uh it's rallied about it's rallied about 100% from the lows of like a day and a half ago so like my final fills of that vwap sell are way out of the money but I still think it's the right thing to do because as you lose conviction on something like I'm sitting in that money's in salana now it's not in Bowden and if Bowden goes to the moon I still have a little bit so don't I'm not gonna like kick myself but it just doesn't I I think that I for for Bowden at least and you you should ask this ask this of yourself for any meme coin like what are the catalysts to bring in entirely new participant bases that's question number one and question number two is how either lettuce handed or Diamond handed is the current participant base so with with Bowden there are two kind of catalysts right one is like um people just buy it whenever Joe Biden says something stupid that hasn't really played out in the past the other potential catalyst is like you start getting a major cultural influencer like Joe Rogan or Donald Trump like pounding the table on it to harm Joe Biden because he's an old man and that's an easy like dead horse to kick right those are the two big catalysts I'm getting like less optimistic that a Rogan or a trump will start will start parading this around but if so I still have a little bit of risk on and then in terms of the second question lettuce hands or Diamond hands um if you look at whiff for example like it kind of kind of chopped around it went sideways it didn't it like people are really hanging on to that one same with Doge um Bowden the community is like a little bit shaken and scared because uh it's kind of unclear how this coin is supposed to trade after the election you know and or even before don't you think don't you think people will be Diamond handed into the election because of that I mean that's that's that that's my take is that there's there's kind of no reason to sell this thing pre-election and there's a there's another potential 10x yeah definitely another potential 10x into the election especially you know at least from like 150k market cap or 150 mil market cap after the 100% move maybe maybe I mean 5x um but I I do I do think that it's it's kind of crossed over I was at the maral Lago event and somebody asked Trump what he thought of Bowden and he said 240 million bucks for a coin doesn't seem like a great investment and Bowden actually did quite well off of that I I I think that you're just gonna get went up and then people just sold straight into it and then it went down the straight line because I I think I think the I think the reaction there was a little bit mid curve which is oh Trump doesn't like it but the the reality is Trump knows about it now and that's that's that's a good thing but I do think a lot of these a lot of these secondary memes are just going to they're going to find it hard to hold on hold on to their audience in a in in a in a world of chop but with that look with with all with all that being said the world the world changes if Bitcoin gets above 70k it's very you know very very simple because then then you get then you get animal spirits Animal Spirits coming back in but you know my my answer the world changes if we're below 55k too then Animal Spirits start people start liquidating but my my my answer my answer to the question uh you know where are the new buyers of BTC going to come from is I'm not I'm not 100% sure right now at this stage I mean you have NASDAQ at the highs you have S&P at the highs uh and BTC is not and what that tells me is that they're you know B big whenever there's a Divergence in equities and and BTC I I view that as quite bearish for for for BTC it it BTC doesn't normally catch up in that case it it normally it actually normally goes down more I I agree with that Divergence is super important in crypto so like when when memes are down only and Bitcoin is unch or certain memes are down only that's a reason to be cautious of those memes and rotate into something a little bit more Benchmark I think like when like you said there's dispersion going on there's chop this is a time to consolidate the portfolio right this a time to like reduce line items that's that's what I'm 100% on board with is just reducing complexity in the book right now there are going to be things that are going to do that are going to do very well and you can you can trade those but I think I think in aggregate um you know you just you just want to con you just want to more concentrated portfolio I mean things and things that have a narrative behind them I mean all all the all the AI coins are doing extremely well like the nears of the world a ARS of the world uh live peers of the world they're all they're all doing they're doing very well whereas you look at something like a blur or like a link or any of the you file coin flow all you know all of these other coins madak hasn't done anything uh and and it's just because you're just not going to get you're not going to get flows to these coins I actually think a great way to trade this Market is to just you know if if you're worried about the downside because we're in a chop choppy Market you just short the things that don't really have a narrative or that have a lot of Supply unlock um you know you can probably you can probably get a good short on on suie and then long the AR and just carry that trade for a few months and and call and call it a day I I I do I do think though that that like General market fears are a little bit are are are a little bit over and you can see that there was a you know there there there was a nervousness permeating the market about a month ago about high high data prints about high high inflation and and that today has been flipped on its head a bit which is why we're which is why we're trading at the highs so I think General worry about the market is probably a bit a bit overblown which is why I'm not you know I was at some point in the past um you know when we were at 70k last time I was saying well I could see 52k I don't really see 52k in this particular environment anymore I mean that that's also why we were buying L last last podcast is because I think that th those fears are a little bit a little bit sful at this point but with that said um you know the way that I see this going higher and something that you can probably watch for is just if we're trading SE 67k 68k and funding is flat and people are you know the general the general consensus on the timeline is that we're still ranging or people are trying people are now trying to short range High that's a that's a good indicator that we're we're probably on our way up also like just zooming way out MV rvz is two right now it's 2.0 like dead ball FTX lows are like below one and euphoric Highs are like above seven so we're kind of toward the low end of the range of basically the best macro cycle indicator out there so yeah like stablecoin balances some of these shorter ter ETF flows some of these shorter term things aren't looking that great yet yet being the key term um but like broadly speaking the space is still underpriced and there's still a lot of capital that can flow into Bitcoin in ways that it couldn't you know pre ETF approval so yeah I'm not I'm not too optimistic about people like buying altcoin bags I'm very bullish on the idea that certain memes will perform including Bowden um but so here's here's here's here's a trade idea Jonah yeah we have the eth ETF decision on May 23rd that's when the SEC has to come out and either delay or deny or whatnot nobody no one thinks that this thing is getting approved there's not a single person in the world yeah and I think that a negative decision is already priced in and they probably a lot of people short eth because of that already and there are a lot of people under-allocated eth because of that but post that decision so there's sort of two things that you have to you you have to look for in in this decision if if it's denied so the first the you have to look why the SEC denied the application why did the SEC deny the the BT application for so long because they thought the Bitcoin spot Market was manipulated and this this was this was their take right and why do they have to acques on it is because the Futures Market is highly correlated to the to the spot Market in in the Bitcoin world and so it doesn't really make sense to have a Bitcoin Futures ETF and to allow Bitcoin Futures but not to allow a spot ETF now if they come out and make the same argument for eth then what that means is that as the bit as the eth Futures Market es and the Futures Market becomes more correlated to the spot Market that argument will go away eventually that argument leaves at some point in the future that argument leaves because you can't have eth Futures you know you can't have e Futures ETF you can't have anath you know e Futures product uh and not allow a spot ETF if the Futures product is perfectly correlated to the spot market right so if they only make that argument that's actually very bullish for ethereum because at some point you're going to get an ethereum F what would be very bearish for ethereum is if they come out and they say well we we're still litigating that you know it might be security we think that it's security we have to solve this issue and that's actually the biggest reason why we're not allowing this allowing the ETF that would be very bad for eth so on on the 23rd if you can get a sense for why they're denying it if they don't mention anything about eth being a security or investigations into eth or anything like that and it's just about the the market then I think I think you probably can get a pretty nice move from from eth I think people I think people should start buying it because that means at some point you get an eth ETF even if Trump doesn't get elected that's really interesting Nuance um like oh what if it's just the same argument as Bitcoin I I bet a denial would probably result in a small selloff and maybe the E discount widens a little bit on that headline but that's a that's a dip you buy I don't even know I don't even know if you get if you if you get us if you get a if you get the news that they're making the exact same argument that they did to deny the BTC ETF and no new arguments you think it would just immediately rally I think I think people would see denied and they would go down a little bit then you have like an hour or two that's my yes exactly that that's my bet is that you probably get a small selloff on that headline and then you just buy as much eth as you possibly can if the argument is the exact same as why they denied the you buy you buy eth e right because the discount would widen like you you rip you rip e like crazy you don't buy eth you buy e you buy e because I think the discount is 24 25% and that's right that thing is gonna close massively well first it first it probably sells off as e holders are like ah Shucks selling and then um yeah you scoop that dip I think that's how you're supposed to trade that I agree with you I think that if yeah if they go the it's a security route and they try to prove that like there are millions of Securities ET FS out there it doesn't mean that you can't have a have an ETF that references the security it's just will there be regulatory Clarity under another four years of you know a Democratic president in the White House and the answer is probably no right so yeah I think it's I think it's pretty I I think it's less clear if if they try to go after the security argument that's kind of an interesting Nuance you point out there the other thing that I'm wondering is like baked into that decision well be anything relevant to adjacent tokens like salana like let's say that they do go let's say that they mention staking and they say okay well part of the reason why uh we don't like this is because it's a yield bearing security blah blah blah like does that hurt do do you get like a mini selloff and other staking related ecosystems I think you don't I think that's mid curving but it's just something to be aware of like if you're about to load up on yield in coins or altcoins that rely on staking like if you're interested in buying Lio or Iain or any of this [ __ ] like maybe you want to wait until after that announcement before you go and lift I I would AG I would agree with that I think that there there could be there could be some good information in that decision as to how other assets might be treated in the future if there yeah if there's if look what if there's absolutely nothing about Tak it right what if there's absolutely nothing about it being a security that sort of opens the road for salani ETF in the future very bullish that would be great maybe salana trades 200 and we all get to retire again I these are these are these are these are important things to to to look out to look out for I mean if I if I'm you and you're sitting there and you're thinking man I wish there was a good trade like I wish there was something I could do to make money well the 23rd is going to be a great day for you to make money you just got to pay attention yeah and sometimes the way that you make money isn't like going into a big uncertain event like that with a position and then trading being right it's more like you go in kind of nimble and then buy stuff at good prices when it briefly trades there I buy stuff at good prices is a great way to articulate how to make money yeah like if your entry price on a meme coin is a and then at 100 x's and then you sell it up you know 50x or 20x or 70x you're still happy meanwhile if you're buying it for a dollar uh and it's this valueless thing and you're exit liquidity to the people who bought it you know for a penny then suddenly your life is so much more stressful and so yeah entry price in crypto really is king and a buddy of mine buddy of mine this this dude John Woo uh he says his saying about crypto is you have to be dumb the reason why most people don't make it in crypto is because you have to be dumb enough to buy the coin and smart enough to sell it and it's like it's so true the mentality that that you you have to employ in order to hang on to one of these Valu shitcoins and 500% something is exactly the opposite of the mentality that you need to take profit on it so realistically the only solution for any of this is to be early to stuff right then that that helps you avoid some of the the problems of overthinking things and knowing when to sell these parabolic rallies or or nuclear sell-offs um you just have to have a decent entry price and so maybe the best thing to do is to like like a V Catalyst like the ETF event you can like identify a list of tickers going into that um and just be sort of like instead of like positioned in all of them and then managing your shitty risk when you're wrong for reasons you didn't expect just like have a relatively clean slate and then just be the you know the super silent native warrior crouching on a branch of a tree with the blow dart like you know as soon as the as soon as the bomb goes off and you get some cheap tokens to buy on big sell-offs I think that's the the way to do it yeah I I'm I'm I'm I'm 100 perc with you um so let's just let's just wait that that's what we're doing now we're waiting hiding our time we're bu our time because there just doesn't see like especially on a day like today where everything's up 20% in a market where you see chop that's just almost always going to be a bad time to buy just generally like if if you're not if you're not in position now for this bounce chasing it here is almost always the wrong the wrong thing to do yeah if you're chasing it it's because everybody else is chasing it and so you know it's funny this the founder of aqr this guy Clifford asess has this you know legendary systematic Trader hedge fund manager he has this quote you know which is that if I'm right 52% of the time uh then I'm you know consistently winning and everything's great I'm paraphrasing here like basically you're doing very well in systematic trading if you write 52% of the time you're just placing tons of little bets but what he says is that means you're wrong 48% of the time and that doesn't make you know 48% of your fun to endure so I think we're just going through one of those times where you have to be a mature Trader can't Chop Chop around this this isn't fun right now this isn't like uh when we were just up only you know 100% what do you uh what do you make of all of the insanity that's been going on with gme and and the rest the rest of the market there have you been paying attention to this at all so I've been watching it but I feel no fomo I do not give a [ __ ] because it is not an area that I I consider myself to have an edge in and I don't have a lot my Edge tends to be long-term views and staying power like I can weather stuff so I don't know anything about roaring Kitty or redit I didn't watch the movie I don't care um so I don't feel I'm trying to avoid feeling fomo I think that in the absence of crypto like Benchmark price action people are looking at that feeling fomo and starting to didd around with it but I think that's a bad idea and I'm trying to avoid Temptation what are you what are you doing I I I think I think what it shows is it shows that there's still a tremendous amount of demand from retail investors they just don't know exactly what to do and they need to be G they need to be given Direction I think that's probably why meme coins are do doing well these people that there's a lot of money to pile into things like gme AMC but they need a leader they need need somebody to Shepherd them into the Wilderness and tell them exactly what to buy and how to buy it and when to buy it that's you Jonah that that that that could be that could be you I mean no way that's you man no it's that's really it's anom but yeah anom anom is the leader just what's what's sort of what's sort of interesting to me is that I I wasn't I wasn't actually clear on how much appetite there was for this type of you know for for this type of price action I mean how much money was there waiting on the sidelines to go buy gme to go create a short squeeze to go pile into AMC send these things up 100 150% uh the answer was holy crap a lot um so maybe M may maybe one thing that we're not t taking into account is that despite all of the headlines people still feel like they have enough money to gamble and that in itself is very good for crypto yeah that is a good sort of meta Point that's the that's not the mid curve take that's the the right curve take um it's funny also it also might be the the the left curve gme up last time was followed by BTC up gme up this time might also be followed by BTC up simple one toone correlation with one data point it's funny you you mentioned anom he's like the Roaring Kitty of crypto right um one of the ways that it just like having your finger on the pulse of sentiment in your space is important one thing that you and I have luckily is a bit of a like a small platform to gauge that sentiment that some random person with two followers wouldn't have you know I have a few thousand followers so I can like put stuff out there and see what happens like I did this with salana as well where I would Tweet bearish stuff and I learned from that experience like oh wow like the community cares it wasn't just crickets and with with Bowden I tweeted some bearish stuff and anom comes in 10 minutes later and he's like you're smoking crack it's not it's not going there it's going up only then like a 100,000 people are like anom anom has spoken and even me I've got a little bit of I'm a little star struck I'm like one of those War Boys in Mad Max I'm like oh my God he replied to me he looked at me you know I'm yes I'm going to Valhalla right and and so I'm kind of like uh I get it right like all right the community has spoken there is money to be gambled right now there is a leader like people are engaged and they're willing to they're willing to YOLO into random things so that degeneracy means that the space is still sitting on some [ __ ] gains and we're not totally like in December 2022 mode which in and of itself is bullish but it's not going to take us into a price band it's not going to take us to like it's not going to take us to $100,000 you need like fresh you need you need greater fools you need fresh capital for that yeah well I I can I can say this it's definitely been it's it's been a very fun Market I I do think that you can probably start to probably start to walk away for a bit at this point you know it I think there there was there was definitely a lot of money to be made you know in in the last in the last two three months I think that people can probably take a bit of a break right now I hope that doesn't come back to bite me in the ass but uh you know let's let's let's see let's see let's see if this gme rally leads to anything anything anything with Bitcoin I mean I think inflation has bitten people hard I think that if it costs $7 for a burger and a cocktail in Manhattan like you know maybe it's more fun to spend that $70 on GameStop gambling at home than uh than doing something that used to cost 10 bucks so yeah I I think I think you're right take take a break uh consolidate line items figure out your favorite bets and be ready to add new line items at great prices not buy the highs on on stuff that's rallying 100% and see if you can go buy some eth eth yeah e on uh on on on May on May 23rd take a look if we if we all make if we all make good money on this trade we'll we'll do a little celebration on next have a thousand X get together yeah we'll buy you all the burgers it's good stuff Jonah good stuff AI um maybe we wrap it there as always not Financial advice but uh great talking to you it's good speaking to you too always learn a lot till next time till next time [Music]

I see all the bearishness I see all the calling for freaking 30k and the only thing that I can think of is that everybody was so Giga bullish at 70 and nobody could conceptualize the idea that this thing would draw down I mean really not that much 20% and now that it's down 20% off the highs that we're entering into levels that you know we've been eyeing for a very long time everybody decides to get [ __ ] bearish I think the world has to get ready for over the next 3 months there's going to be a little bit of a shift in the market there going to be a lot of hated assets that probably do well in the next in the next two months and I think it's you know I think it's time to have some you know [ __ ] balls and BCE you know this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance the onchain defi primitive redesigning derivatives for the defi native you'll hear more about perennial later in the [Music] show we're live welcome back to another to another THX boys we are so close to my target I felt like I was I felt like I was going crazy Jonah so I've been telling everyone since 70k that we're going to reach 55 and now we're at 57 and everybody the funniest part is everybody's claiming that you've been bearish since forever you are you always like I've never no I F bearish in 70k now we're now we're at 57 and now I'm telling you it's time to be bullish so let let it you know let it be known that I'm not always a bear I just happen to be a bear for like the last two months but this is this is not this is not my natural state of being I'm obviously a bull like I'm a natural bull I want [ __ ] to go up I want things you you absolutely nailed it like you got you got bearish on the dead ball highs from the sounds of things it sounds like you actually acted on it like you you sold a fair amount of crypto which yeah you know I I didn't I I tried to get everyone else sell crypto too it's like guys listen like very very rarely in my entire life have I seen Bitcoin go sideways for so long in a bull market and then have that be not distribution I mean it's like almost every time right I mean the way that I mean what was gave me pause was like I I was concerned because last summer we chopped around 40K for like three months and if you lightened up there hoping for a a dip down to you know 20K you wouldn't have gotten it you would have missed this whole 2 Xing so I was afraid of missing a parabolic rally you mean 30k not 40K 30k apologies sorry misspoke I mean yeah we chopped around we chopped around 30 for a while but that was that was very different because that was that wasn't after a parabolic rally it wasn't after we broke alltime highs it was after a gigal long bar Market this is different I mean the way that I think about it it's always always just in risk reward terms and value in momentum terms so at 70k most people's targets were 100 which isn't that far away it's actually pretty close it's 50% move so what are you looking for you're looking for a 50% move higher and where do you stop out 50k basically I don't think Bitcoin was enticing enough at 70k to get a bunch of people to come plow into it with because a lot of people only had that 100K Target so it needed to go to an area where people felt like there was value so I mean there really only two ways to for Bitcoin to to run is that you just have crazy momentum and crazy fomo and people just keep piling in and that's how you know we get we get these all-time Highs but once you get to all-time highs if the momentum doesn't stick and you start to go sideways people start to get a little bit more rational and fearful in their allocation and so they kind of wait they're like okay well if we're going sideways and I don't need to fomo in right now and so a lot of the the fomo buyers drop out and then you you have to say Okay well if it's only a 50% higher move to your target then that's not super attractive but now okay we're we're 57 maybe 55 that's almost to 2x to your Target and so I think that that is a very good like these are much better levels for Value buyers to step in and so when momentum's gone the only thing that saves you is value and we're we're getting we're getting pretty close you know I eth you know I I'm buying here you know I'd definitely be buying here I'm buying eth here buying BTC I think I think you can buy some memes again I actually really like R weave it's a good one why are weave uh because they're they're go they're going live with a lot of stuff like their a their AO token is going to be their first major project launched on on the r weave Network which is kind of interesting they're they're sort of pivoting away from just being a file storage solution to having a broad-based network that that's more like an ethereum that you can actually go build things on top of and then I also you know I mean just looking around things like arbitrum are like today eth is down 4% arb's down 70 bips and it has collapsed by you know 60 70% from the dead highs actually I think from the dead high it's down yeah it's down 58% okay know there's there's certain things that are starting to actually look sort of appetizing and now is not the time to be fearful now is the time to accumulate that's my that's my personal view be greedy when others are fearful said great investor Obi Felman um so the way that I've looked at it uh you know I'm I'm not not as active as you as we all know so I try to kind of avoid overtrading I try to avoid chopping in and out of stuff because you know frankly I'm just not as good as you at that um however I am not fully allocated to crypto um I'm not you know 10 out of 10 Max long so basically the way that I view this pullback is you know for those of you out there who are in my shoes and you know you could you still have some cash available that you could deploy to crypto these are the types of levels where it might make sense to buy um and where you know you don't have to feel bad about not having top ticked it like Obby did you can you can kind of you can kind of say all right bust out the shopping bags start nibbling on interesting stuff maybe diversify into some new tokens and uh one of the things that you learn on a trading floor is you don't really learn how to trade something without skin in the game so I like the idea of buying you know some of these forgotten tokens like arweave and arbitrum that haven't gotten a lot of love recently uh amidst this boom and L1 kind of performant tokens so to me that's that's very that's a very good idea Obi I mean as you can see I'm kind of chilling right now touching a bit of grass uh are you are you are you touching that grass shonah where are you right now I can't quite reach it from here I'm in LA but um you have you have a nice Hollywood view in the background it's outdoor office um I think that I'm trying to I'm trying to New York is great too I'm trying to kind of stay cool throughout this sell off and not puke anything which when you're not fully allocated is extremely easy but what I read on crypto Twitter is just this like overwhelming Doom Scroll of panic and fear and and vomiting of tokens and I I you know personally I can't really identify with that because I don't really trade on Leverage I'm not as we recommend again again on this podcast like don't invest more than you can afford to to lose seems like people really invest more than they can afford to lose because on what should be a fairly routine bull market pullback it it seems like the community is just getting rinsed and that's not good so you know friendly reminder to the to the community don't invest more than you can afford to lose because this is there's nothing out of the ordinary about this during the 2021 bull market the thing pulled back like s % so this is this is nothing compared to that yeah I mean I think people just got really complacent Jonah and now now is not the time to be complacent anymore now is the time to go hunting in my personal opinion I think that there are a lot of very good trades out there I mean you look at e I'm doing more studying of crypto I have done in a long time that's good what are you what are you what are you studying I'm studying some of the newer the newer chains that are like obvious I'm not you know I I like your idea of revisiting R weave and you know we talked a little bit offline about blur um some of the ones that have been out for a while I'm I'm kind of trying to get myself a little bit more you know up to speed on bar chain um the drama around igen layer uh what telegram is doing with ton you know some of these some of these newer newer projects like for the longest time it was just like bare Market down only and then Bitcoin like best risk reward by a mile now we're starting to enter the phase of the what I still think is the bull market where it's getting dicey we could go down a lot or up a lot from here anded you're going to start to see real dispersion between the [ __ ] and the amazing stuff and I I think that like alts are starting to look tasty for the first time since maybe 20 late 2020 20 you say like every every your every alt I guess memec coins like ripped like 1,000 in the last iin mon I consider how about this I consider the mem coin space as a whole to be an ALT like a like a an alternative use case for crypto which is this onchain casino that salana kind of nailed right salana kind of dominated I I don't really view like whiff as an ALT I view it as like a like a chip in that casino you know yeah I guess that's I guess that's fair so I mean really really what you're saying is like the the alts like the actual projects that are building are starting to look tasty to you right now because you think in the second leg of this of this move maybe something like a blur which instead of you know basically keeping Pace with BTC and eth radically outperforms in the in the second half as people try to actually bid value I could see that I could see that happening I mean look there there there are all sorts of things that happen in this type of Market that make it you know that that that makes sense to try to look at I'll give an example of one eth is back I think to a 27 28% discount which is crazy if you're bullish eth BTC at all I think the best way to express this is just to buy eth it's it's a bit of an election play because I think if Trump gets elected then we almost 100% get MEF and if Biden gets elected then it's a little bit more dicey but I still think that just just get just given the fact that basically the same arguments apply for eth that apply for BTC and it doesn't seem like anyone's really supportive of the sec's mission to try to classify eth as a security I think it makes sense to allocate so that that that's an that's an interesting trade uh right there that I'm I'm definitely looking at and honestly I just I see all the despair I see all the bearishness I see all the calling for freaking 30k and the only thing that I can think of is that everybody was so Giga bullish at 70 and nobody could conceptualize the idea that this thing would draw down I mean really not that much 20% and now that it's down 20% off the highs that we're entering into levels that you know we've been eyeing for a very long time everybody decides to get [ __ ] bearish and not only that ebtc is up you know 1.93% I think the world has to get ready for over the next three months there's going to be a little bit of a shift in the market we're going to get things that are you know look at look at what's outperforming right now in this dump they're going to be things that start to do well that we doing very poorly before there going to be a lot of hated assets that probably do well in the next in the next two months and I think it's you know I think it's time to have some you know [ __ ] balls and buice you know this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance perennial is quickly becoming one of the go-to derivatives platforms and liquidity layers for all of defi so let me tell you a little bit about them there are kind of three things you need right when you're thinking about a place and a platform to trade on first one great trade execution second one low fees and third of course an onchain permissionless platform and perennial Nails all three of those buckets with the launch of perennial V2 they've made all of that possible by introducing a ton of new features such as faster oracles which reduce trade execution to seconds lower fees competing with major centralized exchanges and minimizing fees for both takers and makers fully modular markets which allow the produ call to support any price feed out there and fourth cash settled right the trades are cash settled in USD not in crypto perennial allows you the trader to gain access to deeper liquidity with only a fraction of the tvl how it works is that perennial enables a two-sided Market made up of both Traders and liquidity providers right Traders deposit the assets to get leverage exposure while liquidity providers provide these pools of capital to earn fees for taking the other side of the trader position rennial allows you to trade crypto herps FX and coming soon nfts and more backed by some of the best investors in the industry perennial is a must checkout platform if you're a crypto Trader go check them out by clicking the link in the description give thousand XM credit go check out perennial you're going to love them all right let's get back to the show I'm starting to get bullish the entire ethereum ecosystem like you and I had that protracted debate about salana and ethereum I I really continue to believe that the ethereum ecosystem is going to perform and I see a lot of thud on Twitter about eth like hey what is name one thing that eth does better than any of the other blockchains out there like I think that's kind of a stupid argument and I want to debunk it right now like Bitcoin doesn't do anything better than any other ecosystem anyway like you could you can move money around faster on you know on pretty much any alternative L1 than you can on bitcoin but that doesn't mean that bitcoin's irrelevant right like I think that I think that when you're talking about trade able software that's ultimately very complicated and difficult for most people to understand and difficult for even experts to trust right um uh battle tested code is a moe right and Bitcoin is battl tested ethereum is Battle tested um these are like and even salana like salana is becoming battle tested but the sort of the Pico top in salana the meme coin boom uh coincided with congestion issues that led to you know a little bit of doubt about the performanc of that chain and ultimately a selloff and suit I'm not saying that the two are related it was like more of a broader Market selloff but my point is that like eth for what it's worth is a decentralized computer that hasn't broken yet and that's really important to a lot of people that you know don't necessarily need their transactions settled in seconds or sorry in milliseconds maybe they need it settled in seconds right like Financial applications and so you know everybody goes back to Larry Fink and black rock but like let's take Fidelity another large institution if they want to settle something on chain um they probably don't mind if if it's on eth or L2 on eth in instead of uh instead of salana because they're just you know they're they don't require speed transaction settlement speeds to be faster than that faster than the speed of e so ultimately like what matters to them is security uh knowing that they're transactions will show up on the blockchain the way that they're supposed to and knowing that there won't be some sort of interference um from hackers or or just like breakdown of the code and to me like that's why I think we can start to expect um a longer tale of applications getting deployed on ethereum especially Financial applications in the near future which should lead to a bull run uh or outperformance of that chain just because because of the Moe that it does have which is the fact that it's battle tested does that kind of make sense to you I tend to agree with you because I think that you know I think there's there's a lot of value in eth being the the number two the biggest number two for a very long time but the reality is that the reason that I was so bearish for such a long time up until this moment at least in the short term is because it's like crypto natives don't care about this right and crypto natives have really drove the market besides for BTC right so you had all the you basically had the Boomers letting in Ohio buying a bunch of Bitcoin and in their brokerage accounts and then the Crypton native people doing everything else I that's why I really don't think it's going to change much until you get more institutional access to ethereum specifically but in the short term what I've realized is that the market also trades on narratives and so Bitcoin had the having moment it had its narrative it had you know rues tried few things uh Bitcoin you know Stacks Stacks had its Nakamoto upgrade all these things happened for BTC and now they're over there's really nothing else on the horizon for Bitcoin that can get people super excited about it but there are certain things for eth that will get people very excited for it I mean we can talk we can talk igen L I think that they messed up their airdrop I still think it creates a bit of a of a wealth effect and I also I also do think that look at the end of the day it's a new primitive just quickly before we go to igen L I do want to say I think there's geopol there's one point on what you said um sorry to interrupt I do think there there are major geopolitical catalysts for Bitcoin in the short run but there's no like blockchain native uh Catalyst I agree with you there I just wanted to make that very quick distinction go on yeah I I I I would agree with that there definitely are geopolitical catalysts I mean hopefully we don't experience them but but there are and you can see it you can see it and gold I think there's been a pretty there's been a pretty large dispersion between Bitcoin Bitcoin and gold but I think as you know if if the world heats up that that correlation will come back eventually which was strong previously but I think that the within the actual world of crypto the only thing that has any meaningful narrative or you know meaningful drivers for liquidity flows is eth and and eth ecosystems and then mcoins that's really it at the end of the the day right now and so my my my take is that it's probably time for people to start rotating from eth to BTC and I also think that the relative strength of eth in the downturn is going to draw people back into it I genuinely think that the reason that eth is going down less than BTC is very simple BTC went out more than eth and so they're less they're less sellers of eth but I think that psychologically what that does is it primes new buyers oh wow look it's outperforming to the downside maybe it'll outperform to the upside even if that you know there it's probably not because there's a substantial amount of buyers of ethereum it's probably more because there's a lack of sellers relative to BTC there are a lot more people willing to sell BTC than e right now because imagine imagine it does outperform to the upside let's say Bitcoin goes back to 100K that's like 70% let's say eth BTC rallies back to S like you've got a got a quick little two bagger there if you buy some eth right now you know on without that much risk and if you buy e probably even more yeah E I think is the trade couldn't agree with you more there I mean it's it's like we just saw this grayscale trade play out in Bitcoin like why on Earth wouldn't it play out in E and you can do this from your brokerage account you don't need to be like uh you don't need to be like three layers abstraction into some reaking protocol to capture this yeah it is kind of amazing how the market will just give you the same opportunity over and over and over again and you kind of just have to take it with the same [ __ ] narrative too it's like oh oh but uh Gary gendler denial blah come on we've seen this movie already we literally just saw this movie it had the same and it wasn't even like with different movie stars you had the same movie stars in the same movie I know like genuinely discount right now I don't have my Bloomberg in front of me it's like 25% last I looked I think it was 27 when I looked let's see but it's look it's just funny yeah I I guess 20 25% right now but it's funny because it was you know it was 8% two months ago now it's widened back out and if you're bullish on eth like what a what a great way to allocate I do think also I was super bearish on l2s but just watching their relative strength during during this draw down and then realizing that wow these things have just been absolutely nuked like they've been nuked to just everything if if eth BTC goes up 10% then these things are probably up 30 uh I think you could obviously just buy more eth and and that's that's more liquid but I I am I am noticing that I I think a lot of these coins because they didn't go up that much in the Run relative to BTC and eth there there's not that many people left to sell them right yeah I mean arbitrum had like a little it had like it had a pop and then it went straight back down and now it's trading where it was literally 2023 right in like the summer of 23 it's back it's B basically back below the highs of Summer of 23 like actually far below it's like back back in that range so I mean think about this BTC doubled in a time span where a lot of these things are flat and I think that just means they they're just really not that many people left to sell um you have a great point there and it and it dovetails with something that that I I heard when I was working at umberland that I wanted to share um so one thing that used to frustrate me I first got into crypto is that failed projects don't go to zero right like cardano polka dot like in my mind these things should be worthless crap but they aren't right they're still worth billions and let's say that some worthless project or seemingly worthless project were to go to zero or very close to it you know just a a few tens or single-digit millions in market cap and then there was some sort of promising development on the roadmap for that project your risk reward would be outstanding buying it at such a buying something that's already sort of proven and had a past at a low valuation uh close to zero but I found myself unable to do that with these tokens that like like you just mentioned um you know okay maybe they're not worthless but they're they've flatlined and underperformed but they're still worth billions or tens or even in certain cases you know more than a 100 billion so I was talking to Don Wilson about this my my former boss uh who you know he's the CEO and founder of drw and I was expressing frustration about the fact that I wanted to buy sort of like rebound narratives in in the altcoin space but I couldn't justify the existing valuation and he just looked at me and he was like Jonah tokens don't file for bankruptcy okay these things aren't going to go to zero they just sort of find equilibrium and stabilize when when all of the you know sellers with liquid Supply are out and what you have to you know sort of assess is whether whether there's going to be this ongoing Supply just whacking the market as you know maybe maybe the foundation structured in a way where it's just long a ton of tokens in escrow and they keep getting unlocked on some schedule or BC unlocks or whatever he's like just be careful you know avoid the freight trains but in certain instances where there isn't you know an avalanche of tokens that's about to hit the market no pun intended like um you know you can you can feel comfortable getting long stabilized you know like old stories at at what seems like high valuations and then they'll pump again when uh when the narrative comes back and and to me that's just like a light bulb went off I'm like oh god I've been in trafi for too long uh this makes sense right um You you can step in at what seems like a decent valuation for something that's been underperforming it's not going to go to zero tokens don't file for bankruptcy as long as the the future looks bright and there isn't a big VC bag about to get dumped on your face um you're kind of good to go and I you make a good point about arbitrum that might be one of those like maybe not polygon but arbitrum yeah I don't I don't I don't know because I haven't spent enough time digging into their future plans but I can tell you one thing team's still working right and if the team if the team is still doing things I think they all they had massive massive massive uh unlocks of Supply so once Supply runs out and you have you know an actual team that's dedicated to a project if you spy an adjacent narrative like eth BTC going up okay well maybe you should start looking looking for things like uh like optimism and ARB and I mean maybe maybe Lio I'm a little bit nervous about that one still uh just because uh you know I mean I think the supply issues are still pretty prevalent there I do think that overall what we're probably going to see is that new coins were good in the first part of this cycle but new coins probably start to be bad soon and the reason that new coins start to be bad soon is because there is a crazy crazy crazy amount of Supply that's coming online for a lot of these because they basically they were good because they launched with a low float and now that that is coming to an end and unlocks are starting to happen over the summer you know VCS are starting to um B basically what's happening is VCS are going to start to dump the early the Early investors are going to start to dump I think that a lot of these quote un new coins are probably going to be in trouble huh and by by new coins you're not just referring to like [ __ ] coins that people meant on pump. fun no I'm talking of like the suies the S the know all all of these you know the tias of the world that the or like the yeah like the these things maybe they're good projects maybe they're not it actually doesn't really matter what matters is that they have very very very low float and that it's going to be very difficult for people to get out of these positions right there's just going to be a ton of Supply that hits the market and these are probably very good shorts right so one thing you might be able to do is go long things that don't have supply issues go long a Salona go short an Aptos or or short aie run run that pair trade right that that's actually kind of interesting to me right and I think what you're looking for is you're just looking for things that already have that don't really have Supply issues and you're trying to find the massive the massive unlocks and over the next little bit salana has the opposite of a supply issue it has like a deficit of tokens because FTX swallowed up so much of the liquid Supply that people thought they had now it's being like recycled the form of like multi-year locked salana that people want to hold on to for for long-term reasons anyway like in terms of like bag reloading at current levels like you're just you're just reing stuff that you sold higher uh so you'd be bag reloading for me it's just like bag adding I would say e uh salana or locked salana if you can get it and um you know I'd say a few ethereum ecosystem plays and some some meme coins that have staying power like that's that's already starting to look like a pretty decent Little Nugget that you might be able to to earn a decent return on yeah I would I would agree with that wholeheartedly I mean the what was kind of inter about the salana deal is that is it's it's a great deal because you can hedge out some of it through through perss but also let's say you buy you you you buy Salon I think it cleared at what $64 and then it it's trading at 123 you're actually getting double the yield on your Capital committed so if salana yields 7% you're getting 14% yield if salana goes to you know 600 like in a crazy in a crazy world you're getting you know 70% on yield cuz even though these tokens are are locked they you can still stake them you still get you still get a mission and that's that's one of the secrets of VCS and these lock deals is that you're really just you lower the cost basis there there like a lot of people will run these deals sort of behind the scenes um you know maybe I shouldn't be voicing this too publicly I hope the VCS don't send any Hitman Hitman after me but like you know you'll have your big l1s go to somebody and they say hey we'll sell you like $50 million of this token or $20 million of this token at a at a 70% discount and but then you get to stake it and then you get all the yield from the staking it uh and so it like really reduces your cost basis even even even more and the reason that they do that is uh um basically just to get you know funel funnel funnel more cash in and then you distribute on your average person that doesn't know that this is happening it's not so if you're if you're an average person who isn't really in the in the you know the Smoke Filled back room one thing that you can do to avoid some of the delerious impact of this on your on your net worth is stake your tokens right like don't just hold spot stake your tokens and the reason why is like one thing that we used to say at Cumberland is that staking tokens isn't really earning yield it's just avoiding it's like a avoiding the inflation that you would experience if you didn't stake right it's like a form of uh inflation avoidance not like some sort of it's it's not like uh well you get it I mean the point my point here is like the the other thing I'd say is that if you wanna if you if you really want to avoid it um you know be be very wary of high yields uh from from l1s and then also make sure that the l1s that you're looking at don't have super super concentrated uh nodes because don't don't just state thoughtlessly if there's a high yield there's a catch but equally like if there's a a normal yield in sort of like the 5 to 10% range if you're not staking you're getting diluted and if you're staking then you're just sort of Treading Water uh and ultimately I think what's important about staking as well is that it prevents you from overtrading right like it makes you think twice it adds an extra layer of complication before you go churn in and out of tokens and again unless you're Obi Felman uh active trading is really hard at best like really wasteful at worst so I I like staking because it makes me just think a little bit more before I go and do something I I think that's I think that's good I think that's very reasonable um Jonah I have a question for you so when you look at when you look at when you look at the market today obviously crypto is doing poorly but it's not just crypto that's doing poorly the traditional markets are also doing poorly right and I'm curious does does a General market pullback does does that seem likely in the future are you are you worried about that are you worried about you know the fed the FED [ __ ] things up right now what the FED has done to [ __ ] things up is already priced in um I'm not worried about them like hiking more so that would be a real [ __ ] and I'm not worried about that um but yeah this is a yet again a sell and May and go away type scenario where everything from oil to bitcoin to the S&P to NASDAQ has has you know come decently off highs and I think what worries me the most about markets right now is the the threat of sort of a supply side inflationary shock right the the threat of some sort of like like let's say that well there's two things right there's the there's the threat that you get a geopolitical event that spikes oil and gas similar to like 2022 Ukraine war alternatively there's like a chance that let's say that Trump decides let's say that Trump's way ahead in the polls and he starts announcing stuff like I'm gonna you know I'm G to forcibly I'm have the Army Deport 15 million people from the labor force right or I'm gonna hike tariffs on China by 30% right then suddenly like you you know you become Supply constrained there's INF inflation in labor costs inflation in the you know unfinished and finished goods that that we import from from China and then suddenly like the FED has to start reacting and Hiking rates and then the economy gets all gunked up equally I'm worried about a demand side inflationary shock where Biden is ahead in the polls and says hey capital gains tax is going to be hikes to 45% so if you live in a high tax state or city or area your your Allin is going to be like 60% on capital gains so then markets new um ultimately like I'm worried that there's going to be some sort of shock to the system coming out of like policy not the actual economy like absent absent our geriatric leadership which I I find personally frustrating on both the left and the right doing unpredictable like kind of stupid things the economy looks good to me like I think the effect of AI as a tool like these chat Bots is like massively deflationary um structurally commodity markets are very healthy uh robust Supply robust demand growth um you don't there's nothing like there's nothing like really structural about the world economy to be worried about except for humans like erratic old [ __ ] doing stupid [ __ ] right and and uh forgive my you know my language that's literally what what's stressing me out right now is that we're in this peaceful time and then some you know obese guy in a dictatorship somewhere is going to wake up and start like firing artillery at South Korea you know like it's it's just it's just people man people are crazy and uh that is that that is definitely a take Jonah people are people are for sure crazy yeah I don't um that's what worries me is iranic political and policy Behavior does that make sense yeah I understand that I do I do I do understand that deeply um I I I do I do think though that it's possible that we get stuck in the Trap of if like let's say let's say let's say for example the FED starts to starts to cut and inflation comes back I think people right now they're worried about hot prints already and if the FED starts to cut too soon and inflation does start creeping up again then people start to worry that stuck we're stuck in a cycle of how do we how do we control this thing I'm not really sure how else to I you know I'm not I'm not really sure how else to take the fact that the market is is coming off now because everything else looks strong I mean companies look strong earnings looks strong everything else looks okay I think you're supposed to be long everything in most markets into this dip it's hard to close your eyes and catch the a falling knife but like I think I think across all markets that is the right trade um you know if you look at it through a Commodities lens the world is growing quickly that like we're we're in the midst of a boom and the big question mark is will one of the relevant geopolitical actors do something horrendous to [ __ ] it up kind of like Vlad did in 20122 and I think the answer is no I think you have to underwrite that possibility and sell that put and you know buy your Bitcoin with confidence and your your Nvidia stock and your ethereum l2s and your salana and your your Joe Bowden um not Financial advice with uh with confidence and in a size where you aren't like Doom scrolling and doom posting on Twitter if you're down 20% like maybe maybe this isn't a time to be levered up maybe it's a time to just nibble uh with spot or or uh you know smart plays like eth I think the nibbling nibbling makes sense I mean look I I I'm bullish I like these levels I think they're good however I am cognizant that the sell-offs tend to end in a bang they don't tend to end in a grind so they tend to end in a down 10 down 15% day they don't tend to just okay we're down 5% 5% 5% 5% oh and then suddenly we're going back up and so despite the fact that I like these levels I think that in a year from now if you buy here you're probably quite happy I do caution that you should probably wait for something crazy to happen like if you really if you really want to blow the nut right now you should probably be waiting for something crazy to happen and then stepping in when you see all those liquidations and then what you're doing is you're supposed to be buying all the things that you think are going to that you think are going to have a narrative over the next six months and then concentrating your positions that's that that's how that's I'm trading this market right now so some people do that with limit or I think that's very smart and I think that some people do that with limit orders um I don't like doing that I don't like sticking I don't like adding risk with a limit order that's passive I I think that a limit order is a great way to reduce risk uh like take profit like I would you know I haven't done this because I'm lazy but I would I should happily submit like some 150k limit orders in Bitcoin um but if you put a passive limit order in to buy you know you're like okay hey you know I I think that I think that if BTC trades 42k I'd like to be getting hit there right I think that that's kind of I think that that's kind of a bad idea because adding risk involves more thought and Nuance than reducing risk and there is a scenario where you could be delighted to add risk at 42k on like a crazy fat finger style crash uh that rebounds very quickly um equally if it's trading 42 UK because there was a 51% attack that was successful um you're like kicking yourself right and I'm just using extreme examples say illustrate my point I I don't actually expect that to happen but I think that um what you just said Avi is definitely correct you should wait for a crash to add but you shouldn't be passive about it you should be like this is the time to be checking checking Twitter frequently you know using actually I found that grock on Twitter is a great tool for getting smart on protocols because it's uh really yes how do you uh how do you you actually use Gro I did for the first time recently because I was like frustrated that I I love the way that chatbots explain um complex topics to me in ways that I can understand without having to in ways you can grock it easily funny that yeah um but the problem with like your GPT 4S and uh Claude 3es of the world is that they you know they don't that they're not really up to date right they're not like they don't drink from the Twitter fire host so if you use Gro like the model is shittier and you can tell that you're get you're talking to like a gpt2 level intelligence or somewhere between two and three but at least you're getting like synthesized spoonfed English paragraphs about the the latest and greatest in crypto it references the tweets if you want to go and do further research on your own and I find that that's much better than like like digging through mountains of docs and logs frankly so now is the time to be doing [ __ ] like that maybe grock is is a good hack for um studying like all coins in this market I I got to start trying this out I mean this I I will say that the the market has really it just moved so fasty days it's actually quite difficult to keep up with everything and you know you you'll see you'll see something new basically every 30 you know you'll still see something new every 30 seconds and I used to be able to go deep and now I go broad so maybe this is a faster way to go deep this this kind of interesting I'm actually looking at this give me the latest on this layer debate social consensus versus ABS security look the issue is I don't know if this is true but I mean at least I can see the I can see all the tweets and references too this pretty good this actually yeah that's the point like I was struggling with just like I was like I can't keep up with crypto this is this is way too hard um I need I need like little shortcuts and hacks and what grock gave me you know shout out to Elon Musk is that there's like an incredible source of information and news and Twitter you are the the funny thing about it is like with gp4 when you ask it questions about igen layer it's clearly hallucinating right but when you ask Rock questions about igen layer you know that it's referencing the latest the latest news about igen layer it cogently expl coherently explained to me like igen layer is a is a protocol where you you put in staked eth and it restates it in other sort of applications and uh protocols across the ethereum ecosystem and uses Ste or you know the other types of uh locked eth is collateral and like and here's why there was a problem recently there was uh you know some Kur fuffle about with you know people trying to withdraw their Ste and getting charged large fees um because whatever reaking was going on you know had some sort of penalty for early withdrawal plus like gas and all this all these like hidden little ways that people got dinged for pulling their their Ste and their other staked collateral off of igen layer like oh that's a you know a coherently explained I did a bad job paraphrasing it but like a a quick paragraph or two on what's going on there it's way faster than like trying to dig into you know what the devs are saying about it and and complaining at each other and the great thing about great thing about grock is that Twitter's so real time that you don't really know if it's all true anyway but you kind of have a have a gut feel for what to trust and what what not to trust and uh that that sort of like perception that sort of like um that c Chasm between like what you know is ground truth and what you sort of see on Twitter uh it persists across grock so you still you can evaluate what you're reading with the same framework as as how you evaluate tweets and it makes sense I like it I'm going to start using this we should create like a repository of all the things that we use to look at the market and share with our thousand X guys what do you think actually think that would be yeah that' be kind of fun maybe maybe we can do a show and tell go back to kindergarten and I feel like hey look at so this is how I use should what what if we what if we took the transcripts of all of our podcasts and then had an AI agent create like like talk about the markets like in in in our voices using wait so what you're saying is that we we wouldn't actually have to podcast anymore we wouldn't have to do anything yeah exactly I mean honestly that sounds sounds pretty nice like I mean hon these podcasts are these podcasts are great because we just show up here with zero preparation and just kind of [ __ ] post with each other so I I can't really you know I I I can't really say it's like I can't really say it's like quite difficult to do so but it could be kind of fun to try we could also get AI to create the videos you know what's funny we say it's not difficult to do we're we're both you know seasoned trading veterans I love talking markets with you um I don't like talking markets with a lot of people and I find you know it's funny I I watch certain podcasts where to you know people kind of like us try to have a conversation like what we're having and it kind of goes in one ear and out the other like oftentimes two Traders talking to each other just sucks but like occasionally you just find your mojo with the with somebody when you when you shoot the [ __ ] and talk markets and yeah I'm glad I found you Obby this is H this is definitely this is definitely a a valuable dialogue for me hope it is for well it's it's it's for sure it's for sure entertaining I don't know you can you can leave a comment telling us if you actually find us valuable or not or you just listen to us for the banter of which you know every now and then there is some oh no what else what else you want to talk about I was gonna say you know one of the things that I experienced early in my career at Leman Brothers uh you get banter on trading floors a lot of noise not a lot of signal but there was this one guy not going to name him but he was just basically the best Trader in my product on the floor best credit Trader you you [ __ ] worked at Leman crazy yeah I know so so long ago um and back basically the way the phone systems worked at a bank back then I don't know how they work anymore is everybody would have this giant like kind of high-tech phone with like 64 different phone lines on it and uh people could have conversations that they could basically like make private so if you tried to click into somebody's line you wouldn't be able to hear it or they could make it public where you could literally just click on you could see that the light was lit up you click on the button pick up your headset and you could you could hear what the person was saying and who they were talking to you just listening on their phone conversation and this guy uh this amazing credit Trader um he now you know works at Citadel he's a Legend um he used to talk to this guy at Fortress every day about markets about macro about credit and one of the fastest ways that I was able to educate myself when I was you know 21 years old on a trading floor uh was I would just listen to his line he would leave it public on purpose to try and you know get other people involved in the conversation and it's funny that was like an early form of podcasting right no podcast didn't exist back then so if you wanted to get smart on trading and how to think about markets like listening in on a on somebody's phone conversation about a market was basically the best you could do and OB I feel like you and I like I kind of recreated that but thanks to you know block works and streaming we can we can share with more people than just a couple of other randos on on our trading floor yeah that's fair that's I that's actually it's good I mean that's why I like being on this trading you know that's why I like being on a trading desk in general is that you just get to hear things that you wouldn't necessarily hear otherwise you just hear a snippet of information you hear people screaming at each other about a trade that they're trying to get done or a deal or some flow or you know whatever whatever it is you get Snippets of information that you can use to make money and I think that's that's yeah this is why I've never worked at a hedge fund right I've never worked at a hedge fund I work at Onyx now I've worked at Goldman Sachs worked at Vall you know Cumberland drw like when like you say like like right now for example when I'm on my trading floor um and I hear like an explosion of noise going on behind me based on the location of the the noise I'm like oh um something's happening in Napa which is a product that you use to make plastic right okay so the prochemical space is kicking off for some reason or at Vall when there'd be like a big Kur fuffle down the floor like oh you know that's those are the fuel guys like I wonder what's going on and then you dig into it and you're like oh [ __ ] like some Freight Lane just got shut off by a bunch of rebels right like oh interesting and same same at uh same at Cumberland but like I I don't understand how people work at these hedge funds that are and they just sit in cubicles with no information flow or shouting or business or anything and they just make money happen out of thin air I'm I'm personally better at monetizing information flow than it like just doing like super rigorously structured analysis I do that too but it's it's nice to have that trading floor Vibe and podcasts give you a little bit of it I you know that's why crypto is a little bit more of a democratic asset class than oil because you can you can download a lot of information from the internet about what's going on in crypto but you you really can't most our our quote unquote trading floor is crypto Twitter you know yeah yeah it's kind of uh you got to you just got to curate your feed so you don't have too many there too much nonsense but yeah anyway Jonah you got a grock [ __ ] got a Gro [ __ ] think that was good uh Jonah's always I love talking to you likewise zi uh we'll do it we'll do it again in do it again in two weeks speak to you soon buddy [Music]

from the perspective of an oil Trader I I'm just so bullish Bitcoin based on the fact that like if you were to tell me the world pumps 13 million barrels of oil every single day starting next week that number is going to be 51 a. half million barrels I would be like out of my mind like begging to buy every oil future off of anybody that would sell it to me doing everything I could to get long Bitcoin people like ah you know like Bitcoin tends to go up after having like what the [ __ ] it [ __ ] goes up 10x after every having like this is to me this is setting up for a crazy crazy rally the question is has already happened right with with the having so no yes yes people yes people get should probably get bullish because of the supply reduction but the question is has that already been front run this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance the onchain defi primitive redesigning derivatives for the defi native you'll hear more about perennial later in the show [Music] okay welcome back to another THX podcast we've had a lot happen in the last two weeks and I do have to say that it's [Music] sorry okay she just get told to move yeah so for those who don't know uh we're recording this THX podcast well I'm in my usual location the studio uh in London Avi is in San Trope in a restaurant because there's no Wi-Fi anywhere in France correct before 900 am except hotels we should we should honestly leave that part in just because it was so funny I think he told me to get my feet off the table he didn't tell me to move oh dude come on have some respect for the French yeah anyway um it's like it's like a little uh it's like a little small foot table it's not a big table it's it's the table for for handbags it's like where women Place their handbags not where you put your feet look I'm an American what can I say you know there are a few times where being older actually like helps this is one of them I could have coached you on that yeah you you definitely could have coached me on that that's okay look I needed to get comfortable so I could talk to the people about everything that they need to be talked to about you know so I mean bitcoin's nuked each TF flows have stopped we're in a pretty dicey Place geopolitically uh what I mean and eth eth is eth is nuke and to I mean basically ever since the so people like to always ascribe price action to news now my view which has been consistent I think over the last few podcasts even when we were trading 70k is that it's very rare for Bitcoin to go sideways for this period of time in a bull market and not have broken through do you remember the last time we were trading around 70k I was saying guys it's very rare that this type of price action happens and then what immediately happened is we sold off 10% and then we went straight back up and then I think people got a little bit more bullish based on that price action but the reality is that that 70k level 72k level has proven to be a very strong one there's proven to be a lot of Supply activation and whenever you see a pattern like this after a 2X runup I mean come on you got saw last summer we saw we saw it last summer during the um during the first phase of the bull market where the like prices kind of just stabilized for what was it four months in the middle of the bull market like we were we were trading [ __ ] wa let pull it up here we were trading what was the level it was like 29k 30k for the better part of half a year and then we rocketed and I think this something similar is going on here right you used a great phrase activation of Supply so we hit all-time highs or or thereabouts and long-term Bitcoin holders including the US government start sending their coin to exchanges to sell um great takeprofit level everybody's in the money um now we're getting hit with geopolitical headlines that I think are creating headwinds which wouldn't have been there otherwise like I think we would have broken through 70k I think we' trading adk right now if it weren't for this Israel Iran stuff and as an oil Trader I have some opinions on on all of that but you know I think what we can't ignore about Bitcoin is that during crazy crazy times uh where uncertainty is is high and the world is going into um you know uncharted waters like with the Russia Ukraine war as bullish as I like to be Bitcoin objectively nukes first right like down with other risk assets like the P this is my this is my just simple take which differs a little bit ever since 2021 every time we've reached an all-time high we've actually puked shortly thereafter we only make a five six% gain on the previous alltime high and then we nuke so if you look at 20 March and April of 2021 we got up to 60k then November of 21 we got up to 69 now we get up to 74 I mean basically because of the type of Market participant in this market alltime highs tend to be a very good thing to sell as opposed to previously alltime Highs are a very good thing to buy so when you have a lot of retail in the market those people tend to buy all-time highs when you have a lot of you know slower money more institutional money those people tend to sell alltime highs yeah so I think what's happening is that we're just getting a dampening effect which makes me think we're probably due for a pullback to 52k at this point uh let's take geopolitic like geopolitics out of it I think if the Israel Iran issue weren't present in our lives I'd probably start bidding here but it is and so that adds a little bit more worry I mean we don't know what escalation could look like what we're seeing right now is if there are reasonable reasons to believe that escalation will occur and I know the oil Market disagrees but at least based on the information that's being reported in the press and based on what I know about Israeli politics it's going to be very hard for there not to be a response it's going to be very hard for for Israel to just take this line down so from my perspective that's a huge risk to the market uh and I do think that it's good for Bitcoin in a on a six-month time period but it's not so great for Bitcoin on a shorter time period just purely because you've already had so much allocation and we're not really tracking gold anymore gold used to track Bitcoin Bitcoin used to track gold and now you don't you don't really see that anymore yeah they've disconnected for those who aren't paying attention gold is rocketing to all-time highs it just well through them at this point uh it's just up only so here is yeah so here's my take on all this uh risk assets and apparently Bitcoin and crypto is is a risk asset now risk assets like the S&P crypto um that they're they're telegraphing a big economic shock coming out of the Middle East right they're they're going down pretty pretty quickly right now because of fears of escalation in this Israel Iran conflict um oil on the other hand is also going down which is very unusual right normally when geopolitical risk kicks off um the risk you know especially in the Middle East where enormous percentage of the world's oil is pumped out of the ground normally you would expect that a shortage of Supply or projected shortage of Supply leads to higher oil oil's going down quite a lot everybody everybody in the oil Market is consensus you know Max long and getting uh rinsed right now why is that well so let's talk about it's easy to say oh Israel Iran could create an economic shock that hurts risk assets and spikes the price of raw inputs like oil but let's dig into like just a layer below what what could actually create that shock so let's say that Israel does something really extreme let's say they bomb Tran right let's say they just indiscriminately carpet bomb and level entire neighborhoods and diplomatic uh and and like government buildings in the capital city what then what does that actually do well Iran like nothing right Iran's economy in and of itself is not a contributor to the world economy it's not really it's not a factor in global GDP No One's Gonna say oh [ __ ] I can't do business with Iran anymore they're already sanctioned up the wazu that doesn't actually hurt earnings or anything what that triggers is a fear of an Iranian response that will hurt the global economy and Iran can do only one thing to hurt the global economy they can shut the straight of Hormuz which is a choke point in the Arabian Gulf well they call it the Persian Gulf because they're Persians but Saudis call it the Arabian Gulf anyway 30% of the world's oil comes out of the Arabian Gulf Into You know open open Waters via this relatively narrow straight called the straight of Hormuz um 30 35% Iran could shut that right they could just launch a bunch of cruise missiles at cargo ships that are going through there and then suddenly you're looking at $4500 oil and the econ entire economy shuts down so the way their lever to shut down the world is oil and oil is telling you they're not going to do that because if they were to do that if they were to even take out a single cargo with a cruise missile um every single major Western Country uh would start a kinetic war against Iran that is not something that any country can stomach is a quintupling or a 10 Xing of the price of the most important Transportation fuel in the world to quote Dune right the people who lead Iran their plans are measured in centuries I've read books about this they're really they're playing the long game they don't want to force themselves into hiding or regime change or you know getting dragged out of a hole in the ground and hung in public like Saddam Hussein was over this right so I think Israel will respond I think that Iran will probably try to avoid escalation because they want to stay in power and they're weaker than than their nuclear opponents and frankly the oil Market is telling you just [Music] that so there is there a world though in which Israel and Iran do end up in a wider scale conflict but oil prices don't aren't massively affected right Iran just keeps pumping Israel obviously doesn't have access to really any any any oil or doesn't have impact on the market so is there a world in which yes there's a broader escalation let's say there is hits on bases there's hits on Direct territory in Iran but Iran production doesn't go down for example if Israel is just hitting nuclear facilities or hitting military bases and Iran is retaliating Israel and this goes on for a few months but they don't close the straights of HS right is that is that a possibility I mean if you see like a like Israel the thing that all the security people are talking about is that Israel is going to take out fordo which is their nuclear facility like drop some crazy bunker Busters and get through it's it's a hundred meters underground but there are like modern bombs that could do it it's crazy like if that were to happen if Israel were to take out Iran's nuclear capabilities and set them back 10 years um Iran would probably strike back at Israel military bases and fail so if Iran wants to just like like if they if these two countries want to go tit fortat against each other's like military installations Israel will dominate Iran will not really be able to do much and if Iran does manage to take out Israel's military capabilities in some respect Israel will go back 10x because we know how they operate right and that like it's impossible to see a scenario where this it's just m remains somewhat contained it either Fizzles or it explodes and if it explodes and these two countries are going after each other's population centers then it's hard to see how oil doesn't get involved in in in the equation I mean even if even if Iran doesn't shut the Straits of Hormuz right they pump 3.1 million barrels a day out of the ground every single day they consume 1.8 of those uh domestically so that leaves 1.3 million barrels per day that they're like you know I use air quotes here illegally exporting to the world um it really it's just India and China buying them uh outside of the US sanction regime which the Biden Administration is effectively like allowing to happen they're turning their back on it because they don't want gas prices to go up too much during an election year so like that that could come off the market there's no there's no unless the actual capabilities unless the whatever the refineries are struck or the oil fields are struck which may or may not occur I would assume that the US would be very against Israel Israel hitting them those and it doesn't really make too much sense for Israel to hit those in in context yeah Israel wouldn't want to hit um their production because that would hurt Israel is a consumer of hydrocarbons they would want exactly so so they wouldn't they wouldn't want to actually ENC encourage that so they want they basically they want Iran to pump oil and not make nuclear weapons so they would hit the nuclear stuff exactly so basically the way that I'm thinking about this is that that market of China and India isn't going to go away right there's no there there's no reason reason for that demand to go away and so if we think that the supply is going to stay the same and the demand the demand is going to stay the same even if a war breaks out then the only way that they're going to actually hurt or have the price of oil impacted by this specific war is one a gut reaction by the market to any attack by people that don't necessarily understand what's going on which is kind of what happened with Russia if you remember yeah like oil ripped and then nothing happened well that was real that was real Russ is like in in a top three oil producer and top two oil exporter um because basically black you know uh Black Market shipping took over the entire market and yeah it took a few months though like the world legit lost you know millions of barrels per day of export oil off the and that's why everything nuked but like longer term these fears and basically what's going on between Iran and Israel accentuate the need for alternative payment rails and alternative value movement rails as sanctions kick off so long-term this geopolitical stuff I think is bullish Bitcoin it could be bearish alts and other speculative like web 3 Tech um it's definitely specul it's definitely for speculative Tech it's not good because it's just a riskof market at that point yeah and you don't want a riskof market no you don't um if you want if you want things like salana or link to go up you can't really have a riskof market I mean bitco and even even ethereum right but Bitcoin can and it's possible that if sanctions get stepped up so the EU is threatening even more sanctions against against Iran uh it's possible that we actually weaponize our financial system even at an even greater way over the coming six seven months and that would be a very big Boon for BTC I mean that would be as two people that don't necessarily support Iran you know our bullishness on bitcoin is probably helpful for Iran but at the at the end of the day it's it's a tech and you can't control it this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance perennial is quickly becoming one of the go to derivatives platforms and liquidity layers for all of defi so let me tell you a little bit about them there are kind of three things you need right when you're thinking about a place and a platform to trade on first one great trade execution second one low fees and third of course an onchain permissionless platform and perennial Nails all three of those buckets with the launch of perennial V2 they've made all of that possible by introducing a ton of new features such as faster oracles which reduce trade execution to seconds lower fees competing with major centralized exchanges and minimizing fees for both takers and makers fully modular markets which allow the protocol to support any price feed out there and fourth cash settled right the trades are cash settled in USD not in crypto prenal allows you the trader to gain access to deeper liquidity with only a fraction of the tvl how it works is that perennial enables a two-sided Market made up of both Traders and liquidity providers right Traders deposit the assets to get lever exposure while liquidity providers provide these pools of capital to earn fees for taking the other side of the trader position brenal allows you to trade crypto herps FX and coming soon nfts and more backed by some of the best investors in the industry perennial is a must checkout platform if you're a crypto Trader go check them out by clicking the link in the description givex some credit go check out perennial you're going to love him all right let's get back to the show yeah exactly I mean I think that geopolitical strife and increasing sort of like division in global trade increasing barriers and problems and sanctions all that's very long-term bullish Bitcoin which is you know stateless internet money that can't be really hacked um I think the other thing while we're talking about oil that's so bullish Bitcoin for the second half of this year is like everyone's ignoring the having it happens in what a couple of days hours I forget exactly but like as of this recording it's it's imminent and one thing that I I want to say about that is from the perspective of an oil Trader I I'm just so bullish Bitcoin based on the fact that like if you were to tell me hey Jonah uh the world pumps 103 million barrels of oil every single day to keep the human race moving starting next week that number is going to be 51 A5 million barrels because the the the you know the other 51 a half million barrels are just like they just disappeared like I would be I would be like out of my mind like begging to buy every oil future off of anybody that would sell it to me like I would be I would be going crazy I would be maxing out my my VAR doing everything I could to get long Bitcoin people like ah you know like Bitcoin tends to go up after having like what the [ __ ] it [ __ ] goes up 10x after every having like this to me this is setting up for a crazy crazy rally the question is the question is has already happened right with with the having so no yes yes people yes people get should probably get bullish because of the supply reduction but the question is has that already been front run and the the Bitcoin having is the most telegraphed event in the entire world for you to tell me that people are going to start buying the day after right I mean there has to be some level that the market is able to price in the fact that they know exactly for years in advance when the supply is going to come offline right there has to be there has to be some acknowledgement that the market is at least moderately efficient so the real the real question is um what is what what does this look like because what you have now is you have a slightly different you have a slightly different Dynamic you have these you have the outflows from the miners that are going to be cut that are basically going to be cut in half but you also have these offsetting inflows inflows from the ETF right and so if at the same time you have this Supply reduction from the miners but the inflows from the ETF are now down by 50% then it doesn't actually you you've you've nett it out to nothing yeah so my my view is that inflows into this asset class are what's going to drive it more than anything else and the supply reduction while helpful doesn't matter unless we continue to get these these large these large and these inflows seem to have stopped Supply reduction is an in so okay let's be clear about two things here I I agree with you on on the fact that flows matter I think that a supply reduction is a form of inflow and the ETF flows have stopped you right about that I agree there so kind of kind of I mean it depends right so Supply reduction is is a partial inflow how is it a partial inflow well miners don't sell 100% of every BTC that they mine so let's say they get their they get their income cut by half that doesn't necessarily equate to that level of inflow what it equates to is whatever percent of Bitcoin that they sell every time they get that they get that income that that counts as info right yeah so if they sell only 50% then you're actually getting a 25% okay so let's let's assume they only sell half their Bitcoin it's three and an eighth of a is the new BTC reward per block so three and an eth BTC per block times four blocks an hour times 24 uh hours a day times the price of Bitcoin which is $660,000 that gets us to something like 18 20 million 1520 million a day worth of bitcoin mind so let's just say that seven to 10 a day get sold okay so you're right like $10 million a day is it's not really meaningful flow for now but into perpetuity it adds up meanwhile the ETF flows have stopped for now but they have not stopped into perpetuity right so um in the short run it's it's not helpful so maybe maybe the conclusion is that the having isn't going to create a short-term Rip but over the long run like there isn't enough capital in Bitcoin right now or in the space to front run that amount of Supply loss forever yeah look my my view on this is that the numbers that you mentioned are just too small to matter for the for the so yes over the long run what it does is it makes Bitcoin a more attractive asset to buy but it doesn't necessarily mean we're going to 80k any anytime soon it doesn't mean we're going to 100K anytime soon because it's not it's not going to be a main driver of this now what I think the the way to make money on this specific narrative I think is that it brings attention to bitcoin and the Bitcoin ecosystem and so you have all these different things that are building on Bitcoin now that I I think people should start to start to pay attention to basically any any of the nfts that are built on BTC any projects that that are being built on uh on on BTC those are probably going to get an increased amount of attention because of the having and therefore are probably good buys so like the you know the the Bitcoin monkey nfts yeah probably do well hups um the meme coin yeah I mean I I don't necessarily know if I agree with that because and again I I don't have a Nuance take on this I just I don't think that Bitcoin is an L1 that's designed or optimized for like a good user experience for anything except Bitcoin right so um I'm not sure that there will be this like vibrant ecosystem of stuff that thrives on bitcoin that because it's it's a Nar token just just to be explicitly clear I don't think that this is going to be a long-term play I this is a you get in it two weeks later you're out okay no no that that I agree with um that that I completely agree with so we agree there I guess you did mention attention which is an important segue into kind of like like what what you know we we've we've taken some heat on the podcast for basically focusing on bitcoin and on memecoins which is this barbell trade um you know because in in effect that kind of ignores a lot of the Innovation and Technology development that's going on in the middle of the barbell with you know web 3 apps and decentralized finance dpin all this other stuff um however like attention is really on bitcoin and memes and that's that's where the returns are right now like you know governance tokens and all the complicated stuff in the middle of the barbell it's it's not really performing but you know this could be a buying opportunity so both both you and I kind of tweeted like hey crypto Twitter what should we be talking about what should we be paying attention to um you know maybe we get to that later in the podcast but like why Obby right now why is all the attention on the memes and what memes are you you focusing on and why is nothing else performing so what's kind of interesting is that the the memes the memes that are doing well are just are just the low caps uh right now um and the ones that are new and have sort of broken through like Mew I don't know if you guys you guys have seen I guess although M Mew is down 25% today but it was doing it was doing well before I think uh I I I think what's happening is that obviously if you had the barbell strategy you did very well on the way up and you do very poorly on the way down which is why I think it's very important if you're trading and operating in the memec coin space you you you have to just take profits when when anything crazy happens you have to take profits I mean yes we've all heard the stories of the people turning the $10 and the 30 million but the reality is it's probably not going to be you and the best way to do this is to scale out uh of of meem coins basically once if you if you get into meme coin and it hits 100 million you just start out I think that's just generally gen generally the case because it's very difficult to actually generate an edge on these things um I think they're very specific cases where maybe you can so for example I think that Jonah you actually did generate some Edge on and you played that very well but I think I think I think in general what what we're trying to what we're trying to do right now is the whole Market has just been trying to pump meme coins pump mem coins left and right and we're going to find out over the next three months which ones have staying power and which ones don't and the ones that have staying power are probably the ones that have a lasting brand the ones that always be will will have something that will always be appealing to a certain group of people at any moment that are not just flash in the pan type things right yeah I mean like the way I see it uh is that you know first of all let me just say that I am not optimized for meme investing I I've spent 20 years in Trad F and I'm you know to to me I would never have invested in a mem coin until recently when it kind of clicked for me uh with Bowden but like I think I think the deal with memes and the reason why they're garnering so much attention and generating such spectacular returns and and frankly they are some of them the The Benchmark memes of this cycle are outperforming alts during this sell-off quite meaningfully right like that deserves attention as well um not not the shitty ones that no one cares about but like the your whiffs and Bowens of the world like they're definitely outperforming a lot of altcoins um I think the reason why is that like if you're G to invest in a token right Bitcoin is digital gold it's internet money eth there's a real narrative there salana there's a real narrative there so the L1 like Benchmark l1s have their their role um but out the risk curve like why would you want to invest in a governance token that gives you a vote and some Dow you don't care about or that doesn't really ACR earnings of a web 3 protocol that's kind of a business and kind of not when you could invest in something that is literally just an attention token at a at a low valuation when when you think it's going to go up it's kind of like investing in the Nike Swoosh uh as you know if you're one of the first people to discover it right and to me like I think that gambling like the casino meme experience uh is so much better than anything that Las Vegas offers that you know it it will eat into that gambling Market uh or create new gambling markets that didn't exist before and meanwhile like gambling on tokens that that are linked like very Loosely to web 3 businesses that you know may be gaining traction like that's that's less fun to gamble on and you can't value it in a in a like with a DCF model especially during a selloff so like I I still I still believe in the barbell strategy and I think that it's you want to wait to buy the middle of the barbell wait to buy some of these alts because I think they're going to go a lot lower however with memes you know I'm not not Financial advice nothing nothing crazy here do your own research this is you know this is gambling that we're talking about here it's not investing don't you know don't take any of this as as a reason to buy something but like I I do believe that if you have a reasonable expectation that attention will be directed towards Your Meme um relative to the you know valuation dependent it makes sense to buy Bowden is one of those things like for me I I think that people will increasingly focus on this guy's age and his you know inability to deliver uh coherent speeches which is like basically job number one of a leader espec especially the leader of Free World um I think that it it plays into like embarrassment about the state of America embarrassment about this the age of Global Leadership like I think as attention focuses on that Meme which kind of captures the Zeitgeist of our era people will buy the token for a laugh equally like there you know that that memes valued what four 500 million 300 million something like that you know that you can if you're going to speculate on a meme uh it also pays to pay attention to things like under 10 million doar like I I recently saw dollar sign Jew you know you and I are two Jews who podcast about crypto cryp crypto and Jews or mimetic things right now they they get a lot of attention on Twitter why not right um these are all things that these are all things that I think yeah work you know I I I agree I agree wholeheartedly 100% the dollar sign je uh you know you know I'm in that with you we talked about it earlier but it's just it's just funny because I would have expected there to be a much larger Jew coin in the past but the fact that there wasn't kind of just kind of just cracked me up because like I twed out Jews are a very mimetic force in general yeah I I think that throughout human history they've been a mind virus and people just can't stop thinking about them it's kind of crazy like at any given moment people will just blame the Jews for things like stubbing their toe or weather or Global World conspiracies or you know siphoning off money from the banking system I mean it's like it's it's honestly like unbelievable the amount of things like Jews are basically a war Shack chest to individuals so I think that you can see whatever the hell you want to see which makes it a pretty powerful meme I don't think this coin is ever going to get listed on an exchange uh you know Joe Bowden might but it's still uh still kind of a funny a funny little thing that they got going on there but yeah I think when it comes when it comes to meme coins it's what has Everlasting potential what in if you can imagine this thing in 10 years are people still going to care which is why you know I did sell most of my zen because I don't know if people are going to care about Zen in five years in fact they're probably not but are people going to care about cats and dogs and you know are people going to remember the the days of Joe Bowden yeah people are going to remember the days of Joe Biden in five years yeah I agree espe especially if he you know if he wins again um if he doesn't win that's a very bullish Catalyst for crypto uh crypto is currently trading like he's gonna win and you know it's it's amazing so going back to our our topic of doing some research on a few projects that are in the middle of the Bel you know the barbell um just educating ourselves on web 3 and dii um I was amazed when I was browsing through some of these prot protols just how difficult it is to access if you're a us or UK user you know like the regulation is is really a massive lid on the price of crypto like I guess the three the three coins three projects that came up the most in our Twitter call out it was Ando Athena and Hyper liquid and like you just can't touch that stuff if you're an America it's pretty crazy yeah it's it's really it's really sad honestly I mean once once that gets solved I mean these types of assets can go up a ton because I think one thing that we've proven is that the US bid matters more than anything else and the only types of people that are really able to use this easily Are People Are People offshore I mean obviously I think people probably in the US use vpns obviously I don't but you know I think if if you were to dig into it you'd probably find you'd probably find that's what people what people are doing I also think that that you know things like things like Ando make a lot of sense in terms of where the future of crypto is going yeah we all agree that tokenization is a future we all agree that what what we need to have is we need to have more assets represented natively in on chain from from the beginning and Ando and Ando is doing that and they genuinely are building some pretty cool Financial infrastructure I think that they're going to face a lot of pressure out of the United States unless they can get all the big institutions on board because obviously they're very dangerous for these guys but they're they are a good product right they're a good product they're going to make money um you know it's just it's a very it's a very simple simple simple way to make money they just have to start expanding their expanding their offerings I mean as as I browse these three protocols and just dug into the docs and tried to learn about them I think Ando was the most exciting to me um of the Ando Athena hyper liquid Trio that we got recommended to me like what so what does Ando do basically they turn right now they turn short-term us treasury notes into tokenized form right and you can't touch that if you're if you're in the United States but like the Silver Lining here is if you live in America you can just go open a brokerage account and buy some T bills and you're good you don't need this stuff meanwhile if you live in Argentina and you want us stable coin yield you can't really do that you can't really buy t- bills easily if you're retail in some you know developing country so Ando provides that solution it basically allows you to own a dollariz it's like tether but with yield with with actual High savings account yield and I think that's brilliant and obviously that's that's just the first step along a long journey eventually you know it'll be tokenized S&P uh for you know people in Africa or tokenized you know to tokenized uh hedge funds or tokenized whatever like I think Ando has tremendous potential I'm very excited about it the Ono token clearly these guys just did it because they they need a way to monetize their their efforts and like I don't believe in the Ando token I don't think you need the Ando token I think that Ando should make money the way tether makes money by like shaving shaving a few bips off the top uh this is why I don't believe in token investing in these projects because these tokens are meme coins effectively they offer nothing other than uh kind of like attention and you can do better with other meme coins or probably do better with Bitcoin so I don't believe in the Ando token I believe deeply in in the Ando offering yeah I look I I can't really say whether I believe in Ono token or not because I think it really just depends at the end of the day on Securities laws and what they're able to do with that token if this if this token just ends up being a way to distribute profits among oh then then I believe in it then then obviously then obviously this thing this thing has value I mean it that's right now it's just a governance token that's not it today and therefore it doesn't really make a ton of sense but in the future what I'm hopeful for once we get rid of Mr gendler that we find out we find some Frameworks where we can take these good products like Ando and have a token that actually you know has value associated with it from the cash flows from the cash flows of this platform I mean think about it it doesn't make sense if let's say one day Ando wants to go public why would they ever go public by issuing actual stock why wouldn't they just issue a token that they can direct cash flows to it just makes so much more sense based on their whole platform based on the the the premise that they're trying to bring in everybody into crypto right and so at some point they're going to have a token let's say they get big enough because they they they go public in a world let's say in a world where they didn't have a token today at some point in the future they're going to have they're going to need to have a token so they're going to need to figure out how to generate value for those for those token holders and the only answer really is that they need to they they need to pass back some some of the cash that they some of the cash that they generate I think you hit the nail on the head if if Securities laws change and you can issue a token that allows you to pass cash flows from your real business through to token holders then Ando is probably the token you want to hold um you know the defi tokens will just like literally be Limit Up um but yeah until then and that's a long journey until then man I think you're going to get Spectacular outperformance from Bitcoin or the memes um because it is like people people got excited about a a governance vote during the 2021 cycle and then they just ulated value on those tokens so I I don't think people give a [ __ ] this time about governance uh tokens the the other two projects weren't particularly let's put it like this they weren't particularly exciting to me I mean hyper liquid is just an exchange like I don't see how it differs from all of the other exchanges that have ever been launched it know yeah I didn't get it either like I I thought it was a really slick user experience yeah good by the way it's good I mean I I I I really like it it's just not it doesn't get me buil onchain yeah it's like but it's like why dydx is already doing that like I don't understand differentiation so hyper liqu was a bit I mean even though that was mentioned a ton maybe somebody in the comments can explain to me why people love this thing maybe is they have a good referral program and people are trying to refer us to it but I don't know and then Athena Athena is interesting only because it's the first example of a Perpetual stable you know a per based stable coin that's actually managed to take off I mean this idea has been around forever back back in the bitm days in 2019 people would just consistently if they wanted to go to cash they would just short the one expert they would just short the Perpetual future against their Bitcoin balance because you actually couldn't hold usdc or usdt on bitmex you could only hold BTC they only accepted BTC and so the only way to go to cash would be to actually short the perpetual and you would generate some sort of yield so basically anyone that's been trading in this world for more than a year hopefully knows that they can do this and there have been a bunch of different projects that came out uh in the past on salana mostly where this was attempted but Athena seems to be the only one where where it's really taken off and it just seems to be because of the names the names behind it I think that the biggest issue with all of these products at the end of the day is always going to be their collateral management and if they can work with exchanges to say hey we we need a non- liquidable account then perhaps this can this can take off but other than that it's it's a it's a centralized product obviously because there has to be some like there there has to be some access to these Perpetual products maybe in the future it'll all be decentralized but um yeah I mean I I was reading their through their docs and I do I think I came into it very bullish on the project and after doing my research I feel very uncomfortable with it for a couple of reasons the first is that they build themselves as the world's first sort of like fully decentralized uh stable coin that and that's what you know internet money needs is this it's it's very centralized they if you dig into their docs like we have a 247 team of people with experience from places like Tower drw jump Jane like managing the the system and and watching for liquidations um also they're taking an assload of exchange risk like if binance and okx get in trouble like your your usde is just gone right now another problem is that there short they're short gamma effectively so like yes in a Raging Bull Market you earn decent yield on usde uh just like in a Raging Bull Market you could earn 100% apy loaning out your stables and eth on FTX when when that was a feature that that Sam created but like what in a in a bare Market what happens the first thing that happens is the collateral which is which in this case is Ste staked eth like staked eth will deeg versus eth like I think it got as low as 90 2 cents on the dollar during the last bare market so that happens at the same time as per funding goes like wildly negative and so if you have like 10 billion locked in Athena earning bull market you know like lazy yield and then funding goes negative at the same time as the collateral deegs for whatever reason um this this portfolio just gets like liquidated like crazy steth is not high quality collateral eth is high quality collateral so ultimately like one thing I started my career in credit trading one thing you learn if the yield is too high like there's a catch and to me I think that this is just one of those lazy places to earn yield like anchor protocol was before the the music just stops this is not decentralized you're taking a tremendous amount of exchange risk and if you price in like the yes okay there's a custodian it's copper right but like if you price in binance rug risk and the impact on collateral and your ability to get your money out um I I don't think that that the yields you're collecting compensate you for the risk that you're taking yep I think you nailed everything actually I don't really even have any any anything to add to that that was that was effectively my reaction to every one of these projects before and this one it's even worse because it's so large now yeah you know and and the bigger the bigger it is the worse it be the worse the problem becomes in time in times of dress and so yeah is is is this going to be the next Luna probably not because I don't think it's going to have systemic impact but is it going to blow up you know I think given given enough time if they get large enough the answer is yes there's actually something interesting about Luna right if Luna hadn't grown as much as it did it wouldn't have taken down the industry and it would probably never have blown up so if they had just capped themselves at issuing you know five billion uh of their stable coin they probably would have never blown up but 20 billion was just too much yeah and ethena is going to go the same way if they stay you know in you know manageably size they're going to be fine but if$ 20 billion do worth of value is in there earning 20% that it's like if if lots of people bid up a shitty junk bond the yield goes down right and if lots of people put their money in this thing the yield will go down because that's just more per selling so the basis will collapse stay closer to Flat instead of like Trend you know always being a little bit positive it'll be you know kind of like marginally negative the yield will go away and then there's rug risk when when uh if steth deegs during a crazy you know crypto rinse which almost feels inevitable to me at some point so if I were if I were looking to earn yield and and I do earn yield this way I I just stake my eth on Lio like I I think that a decentralized solution is better than you know sort of like centralized points of failure also who knows how copper is going to perform during during a real stress test like they haven't been through one yet yeah I agree agree with all points although I on on copper the the only stress test is just their their relationship to bance but everything everything is held off exchange on copper and so copper is just not exposed they could get into a lawsuit but there's no actual mechanism to take those assets as far as I understand it well that's that's the risk is the lawsuit like a 2021 style um binance like FTX style uh you know disappearance of like if binance if binance dies the way FTX died right Copper's assets are safe right assets within copper are safe but no crisis is the same as the previous crisis I think you know it what could happen is Bitcoin runs up to a million dollars a token and then the United States just says uh you know sorry copper that's that's our Bitcoin now right it's it's legal risk you know not sure keys not your crypto right so ultimately I uh I question this it's a shame honestly so out of the three projects that we looked at we'll do another three next next episode uh that we'll that we'll review but out of the three projects that we looked at Ando definitely the most interesting yeah like Ando aligns with my sort of like understanding of web three at this point which is financial tools and Banking and access for developing countries it is this is not a US developed Market product crypto so Ando providing these things like it's okay if us users can't get tokenized 5% yield on Ando us users can get that you know by having usdc on coinbase and frankly they don't need it anyway right it's people literally everywhere else that that need this stuff and I think Ando is actually doing a great job uh bringing bringing you know B Banking and uh brokerage to the masses of people who JP Morgan and Bank of America and Schwab and Fidelity won't provide it to makes sense Jonah as always speak to you was a pleasure go have a go have a coffee in a quason at sen or Cafe Dior you're living Dolce Vita out there yeah it's it's not as sweet as you might think but it is a it ain't bad um have a blast man great talking to you thank you as always it's a pleasure [Music]

not to make this comparison but I'm going to make the comparison because why not it was consensus that Ripple sucked four years ago and five years ago and six years ago and then it was true it just sucked it just never got adoption it never got picked up it never it never worked and so it's not improbable that eth becomes the Ripple of this cycle where everybody thinks it's going to pump because it pumped really hard last cycle I mean Ripple pumped so hard in 2017 it ripped everybody's face off and then in 202 want it literally did nothing when you have all these people that have made that have made money on salana I don't know why they would come back to you this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance the onchain defi primitive redesigning derivatives for the defi native you'll hear more about perennial later in the [Music] show welcome back to another episode of 000x we are back online after our in-person discussion at gas which was really fun honestly John I really enjoyed speaking with you in front of that audience that was a good was a good test of our ability to perform in front of a couple hundred people it was awesome it was uh thank you everybody who came uh the room kind of filled up early into our conversation and we had some good vibes in there it it was good to it was good to see people actually showing up for a crypto conference feeling bullish um feeling excited to be in the space for a change after a very painful bare Market yeah I thought that was a really nice indication of where we're at it was also very institutional just in general the quality of the people that I talk to the quality of the builders the quality of the investors everybody seemed to really understand and know what's going on in the space more than they have in the past the market is definitely getting a little bit smarter which is either a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it I it's always always nice to be trading against a stupid market so I think it's a little bit of a double-edged sword but it was good to see at least the industry itself seems to have grown up a non-trip non-trivial amount over the last two years I think we've learned a lot of lessons I didn't see too many shorts in the audience or on stage always good one thing that struck me about the conference AI was that you had people in there who were you know it it feels like the last couple of bare markets have filtered out grifters filtered out you know the get-rich quick scammer type and This Crew seemed like a genuinely curious more more institutional crowd because it that's the nature of this conference it's uh it's for you know I think Trad F it's like the bridge between trafi and crypto but the people there were you know not like hard core Anarchist Bitcoin class of 2011 crypto enthusiasts but more like you know maybe they they got they got their feet wet in 2021 uh and stuck with it kind of enthusiasts and a mixture of tech people and also you know Finance guys who are trying to you know basically Bridge capital from trafi into crypto which I thought was pretty interesting I I actually we were talking about this just before the podcast um you know a after after the conference was over we went to the ethereum dinner there was an ethereum dinner and a salana dinner and you know maybe it's because I fed salana $180 ago but we didn't get the look on the salana dinner I'm sorry about that AI I'm sorry you got dragged into my uh my [ __ ] show there look we uh you you you fixed it you got in at 30 I did I did not enough Never Enough unfortunately but um I think the the ethereum dinner was interesting because you know correct me if I'm wrong here but it feels like there's a lot going on on that chain and a lot of hatred and fud and fear going on inside of crypto about eth like eth should be performing right now and it's not we got a little look behind the scenes at what's coming at the dinner it's it's pretty interesting yeah I I do think that eth has been really destroyed I mean I it's not a think I know I can see it on the chart you can just see it from the community you can see it across the board mean you have all these l2s that are struggling really hard to get to get any uptick obviously you have arbitrum optimism ZK sync but but people have really just forgotten about eth I think in I think in a big way and my personal view on this is that it's really hard for that to change unless you get an eth ETF approved I was unfortunately incorrect on my last calls I thought that post Bitcoin ETF The Narrative would switch very quickly to the e ETF which it did for about six days and then everybody decided that the eth ETF wasn't going to get approved and so eth just started trading really poorly again I think the issue is right now eth has always been the chain where the real projects build and the real projects go the defi projects of the world the uh you know the rwa projects of the world they all like ethereum because ethereum signals a little bit of institutional B it has a little bit of an Institutional bent to it it has a little bit more of a grounded less Pie in the Sky bent because it's been around so long and it's it's the number two and the reality is that that's just not what's interesting to people right now that's not what's interesting to investors there just nobody putting their money on things that are being built on eth and that's making it really hard for eth to succeed it's also one of those things where the risk profile of eth is way too similar to bitcoin coin right now it's you're looking if you can imagine Bitcoin at 150k and eth at 10K the difference in return Isn't that big between those two in the eyes of crypto people the difference between a 2X and a 3X kind of well you know how much does this really matter now when you have meme coins popping off 100x everywhere that's going to dampen your interest in like eth and so I'm I'm getting increasingly nervous about about eth I you know I was I was bullish I was bullish for a bit in the in the beginning there as the EF narrative went away I stepped away and now I'm thinking I don't even know when I would step back in at this point I don't know if you have a different take yeah I have a slightly different take I mean I'm a longterm eth bag holder uh I got in at a good price and I I just haven't really sold it's pretty much the only token I've done right uh for for the Long Haul um I would say you know I've had some short-term wins and other things and Bitcoin I've done right as well but eth I did really right and I think the reason why I've held eth through this cycle there's a bit of laziness attached to just holding something and never selling it um but also because I believe it was good diversification from Bitcoin I'm bullish as I'm bullish as ever Bitcoin for all the reasons we've hammered ad nauseum in this podcast but eth I thought you know it's sort of like the deao L1 where serious people build serious projects just like you said um salana has really shown up and become a performant place to deploy a decentralized application uh and serious people are building there for sure and that's I guess it's kind of scary for eth but at the same time I think maximalism is stupid like when I Bull poost eth on Twitter the salana people like the say really nasty things but I think it's possible to Envision a scenario where both tokens drastically outperform Bitcoin but you know both of them are not not they haven't breached their all-time highs from the previous cycle yet Bitcoin has you know both of these altel ones can definitely go up quite a lot from here I think there's a scenario where Bitcoin rallies Bitcoin does a 2X and eth does a 5x and here's that scenario for you AI the scenario is um you devel a mecoin mcoin ecosystem on base that attracts people it's already kind of happening so you have two casinos now like it the win isn't the only show in Vegas right like there's a couple of places where you can go gamble it doesn't have to all be on salana forever right so you get your meme coin casino then uh something that nobody's talking about right now is games and you get like anom shilled us the parallel trading card game back in November what if one of the those things just lands on eth and you know all those projects are kind of distributed across different L ones but I think eth has a couple interesting ones including that one uh that could pop off those are kind of call options ultimately I think the big one is trafi settling stuff on chain tokenized funds uh you and I both agree that crypto is a better way to move value and spend value than trafy rails and I think that tokenized funds are a massive use case that nobody's really paying attention to Black Rock's Biddle fund I think it's at 300 million in Assets Now and Then the final thing is uh the eth ETF like Black Rock filed an application for an eth ETF the final approval is due from the SEC this may their record for ETF approvals is like 800 yes one no they know what they're [ __ ] doing and you like you make the biggest returns when you buy stuff that everyone hates and you're right um you don't make the biggest returns when you lift like like hyped amazing narratives after they've just 10x I don't know so I think this might be a good contrarian opportunity um yeah look at the end at the end of the day the issue is that there's just no narrative for ethereum and so you have all these potential narratives that you just outlined I think very well that could materialize so you could have the rwa narrative come up which is is very is very reasonable because I do think that if institutions are going to work with a chain it's very likely going to be eth first then everything else second but that's just not what people are interested in right now and it's not it's not driving any any real value to the chain so I think this is this is more of a slow burn and then again when you step back it just goes back to the risk reward at the end of the day everything in trading is risk reward what's the upside versus versus what's the downside and the issue is that there's no Pie in the Sky case for eth so the way that I think about this is thought I just named a couple Pie in the Sky cases I I but I don't in terms of price right I think 10,000 15,000 that's not that's not enough to people interested so the way that I view this is if you want eth exposure the best way to do it is two two things one you either buy really high-end nfts that are doing that are doing well or two you're buying the l2s on top of eth that you think are going to benefit so for example Bas could be a catalyst for eth if Bas really picks up then then it could be a catalyst but what we're seeing is that salana is doing such a good job at recapturing flows so over the last two weeks there were a lot of flows that went out to base but then over the last five days a lot of those flows left Bas and went right back to salana so there's no there's no stickiness right now among the E l2s and the concept of decentralization just doesn't seem to be entering as people's minds in the same way that it did in 2021 there's a lot less idealism this time around in this market than there was four years ago I think four years ago you still had a little bit I mean not a little bit four years ago you had a much larger libertarian bent to crypto now you don't really have anything so if I'm thinking about constructing a portfolio if you are bullish on eth I still don't think you buy eth outright you buy eth beta that can do well in in a in a in a couple of different in a couple of different scenarios and you just have to avoid the Trap of getting stuck in eth because what's possible is that all of this stuff comes together in two years but if bitcoin's going down when rwas are taking off on eth I don't think that's enough to keep eth High that's the issue totally agree you touched on something in the middle of that though that I think is valuable to dissect which is that um they the e e bag holders the eth ecosystem people they're getting it's not just that they aren't in the right Nightclub at the right party right now which is salana right it's more that that's happening and they're getting decimated on their nfts their boor apes are going to zero they're pudgy Penguins their squiggles all of this like the meme coins the the the moonshots of the previous cycle the moon Birds uh as it were right they're all they're all just either getting rugged or getting blurred down to zero and I think the only reason why the ether rocks and the crypto punks have survived this Onslaught is because the token standard for those projects predates erc721 which is what blur effectively prices right so you have this engine for effectively flooring nfts that's just destroying value across the eth ecosystem at the very same time as like people are thousand Xing their cash on shark cat cat face handsome cat moon dog dog moon on salana and that's great but again I I feel like the best time to get into these narratives is on the lows not on the highs and you know eth is hated maybe this is the time where you should be looking to add equally like all of this me like meme money that's theoretically getting made on salana um you know I'm I'm I'm heavily invested now in in Joe Bowden and I am I am over invested and I need to get out over over invested in Joe Bowen and I have this little little uh allocation to some monkey haircut some shark cat and a few others it it's kind of like it's cool to watch those coins go up but I haven't sold anything and I I if I if everybody went to go take profit we'd see very quickly that these 100x or thousand x's on paper actually more like two to three X's for the early people and negative 50% for the late people so it's a we're in a tricky part of the cycle here the volatility is picking up it's unclear what the next narrative is going to be and if you're right Avi if all of these big eth winds land in the middle of like like after another bare market then who cares but if they land in the next year while we're still pumping then it could be ridiculous I I I just don't know this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance brenal is quickly becoming one of the go-to derivatives platforms and liquidity layers for all of defi so let me tell you a little bit about them there are kind of three things you need right when you're thinking about a place and a platform to trade on first one great trade execution second one low fees and third of course an onchain permissionless platform and perennial Nails all three of those buckets with the launch of perennial V2 they've made all of that possible by introducing a ton of new features such as B oracles which reduce trade execution to seconds lower fees competing with major centralized exchanges and minimizing fees for both takers and makers fully modular markets which allow the protocol to support any price feed out there and fourth cash settled right the trades are cash settled in USD not in crypto perennial allows you the trader to gain access to deeper liquidity with only a fraction of the tvl how it works is that perennial enables a two-sided Market made up of both Traders and liquidity providers right Traders deposit the assets to get leverage exposure while liquidity providers provide these pools of capital to earn fees for taking the other side of the trader position brenal allows you to trade crypto hers FX and coming soon nfts and more backed by some of the best investors in the industry perennial is a must checkout platform if you're a crypto Trader go check them out by clicking the link in the description give thousand XM credit go check out for any you're going to love them all right let's get back to the show yeah and I think it's I think it's hard to hard hard to say because the the reality is that now when you have all these people that have made that have made money on salana I don't know why they would come back to e at have they crystallized it though but even if they crystallize it maybe they just take it out or they wait for some for something else right there's no reason especially now because it's it's not like you're stuck on salana in the same way that you were back in the day I mean there's so many off amps you just go straight straight to any exchange and you can deposit your salana usdc that you've that you've minted they'll that that value will leave salana if there's something to buy on eth there just isn't right now like half of the value in salana is probably wealth that came in from eth and Bitcoin you know that yeah that that that that that for sure the question is has it been lost has it been lost forever and my bet is that it's non-trivial percentage of it is yes we just really we just need Black Rock to file the CTF M and I mean approved the CTF that that that's it at the end of the day that's the only thing that's going to save the eth BTC ratio right now unfortunately because what you have what what what you just have is you just have no meaningful adoption of anything that's being built that's being built on E except for all the [ __ ] going on Bas um but I I take your point right like I'm not going to for the for everyone listening I'm not denying that it's bad right now on eth the eth dinner was a little bit gloomy um even at an otherwise very happy conference but like I'm just going to say here uh let's say that like it's consensus that eth sucks it's consensus that the ETF is going to get denied it's consensus that salana is the the new layer one where you build where serious people build serious stuff and serious people build fun stuff like what if what if the SEC just gets dadded by Larry fin again and an ETF for eth gets approved well no one expects it or is paying attention like and then a bunch of retail that that isn't on crypto Twitter that doesn't know any of this stuff or care about crypto natives like native narratives it's just like ah let's buy some eth that's you don't want to be short ahead of that like it's it's a contr yeah I I I I agree I agree you don't you don't want to be short you probably don't want to don't want to short eth and I also think that spread trades are really mid curve in this market right now just because I think there's a lot of althing in directional in in just pick pick picking a direction and sticking with it I think my my hesitation with it just comes from the fact that even if we do get a pop from the ETF it's probably going to be a short-lived one because there there's only there's only so much allocation I I also do think that there you know a lot of people in the trafi world are very comfortable with BTC and they're still less they're just less comfortable with the idea with with the idea of eth still to this say and not to make a bad I mean not not not not to make this comparison but I'm going to make the comparison because why not it was consensus that Ripple sucked four years ago and five years ago and six years ago and then it was true it just sucked it just never got adoption it never got picked up it never it never worked and so it's not improbable that eth becomes the Ripple of this cycle where everybody thinks it's going to pump because it pumped really hard last cycle I mean Ripple pumped so hard in 2017 it ripped everybody's face off and then in 2021 it literally did nothing yeah it went to like $3 didn't it yeah but it went from I mean it basically 10x and that's it which is nothing and you know I mean I I I I just personally think that you have a scenario where eth is eth is sort of caught between this rock in a hard place the only thing that can save it I think is a really really really pH phenomenal user experience on an L2 so you need arbitrum optimism ZK to just have the best user experience by far you have to have it beat salana you have to have people come back over and the other thing is that salana has now proven that you one of the biggest Moes just to take a step back what was one of the biggest Moes for eth it was the fact that you had to program in solidity and the vast majority of people in crypto knew how to program in solidity and they weren't programming and mov and they weren't you know programming in in in other languages now that doesn't matter so many people know how to program on salana so many people know how to program with different with different languages that are in crypto there are a lot of people coming into this space that are developers that never need you never need to learn solidity anymore you don't need to learn it anymore if you want to launch a project you can just stick with a language that's more that's more common right and so that moat has been eroded and then also the moat for the evm has been eroded because so so much volume is happening off of off of ethereum so it no longer has the Moes that it used to have which makes me think that it's a now just a trading asset I mean you can long it when you're bullish on E for the next two weeks for the next four weeks but I'm just long-term more bearish on ethereum than I am on salana and this is what I actually said I said this on the panel and that was maybe the most talked about statement I mean everybody else came up to me after and said why are you so bullish on salon and you're not you're not so bullish on eth this is coming from somebody I mean I was never I was never a salana guy I was not somebody out there from the beginning that said oh salana salana salana salana but what I've Just Seen is that eth has had an inability to execute and the l2s that are building on eth also haven't been executing particularly well no M no matter what they say and so you kind of have to re-evaluate your opinion at a certain point and realize look these guys haven't been able to bring over real volumes and real people to their platforms salana seems to be doing a better job at this and it's captured the Zeitgeist of retail and the reality is at the end of the day institutions go where retail is because that's where the money is made do you really think like I salana is definitely doing an amazing job right now not going to debate that do you really think eth isn't bringing over real volumes and real people I I think like if you look at D5 volumes let's talk D5 for a second so here's another way just very quickly how you know some of my friends are onchain Traders like serious professional Ro robot onchain Traders here's some anecdotes from the onchain world of providing liquidity and defi um apparently the whole me sandwich party on ethereum ended uh when a major let's call it a major on and offchain Market maker decided to just lay off their risk on chain at mids right they're just sort of like showing up at every Market that used to be super wide and they've tightened it up they're just like well we're we're long Doge from this centralized trade we did so we're just GNA offer Doge and mids on chain and apparently that's just killing a lot of the fat and The Edge on ethereum meanwhile salana is just this like crazy money party right now uh if you're if you're there to like make uh whiff and boat and all this fun stuff um so part of me thinks that but that that says nothing about like the volumes or the people like volumes on Unis swap are enormous I I haven't I don't have this committed to memory but I think they're outpacing any other decks I'm not saying there's no volume but if you look for example if you look at the tvl of ethereum and then you look at the volume on ethereum it still pales in comparison to 21 just despite the fact that bitcoin's passed you know Bitcoin passed all-time highs you're just not seeing the activity that you would expect and things like Salona are seeing much higher volumes and activities than you saw in 21 you know not not not not much higher but it's it's trending it's trending up it's trending up nicely and I I think that what you're what you're left with today is you're you're you're you're left with this bad this bad taste in your mouth of okay well eth just isn't is is not doing as well as it was doing three four years ago in terms of projects in terms of volume in terms of activity when you would think that in a crazy market like today in an insane market like today you would think that it would have spread more now maybe maybe you know to S us that back maybe I'm wrong about why and it's just that we still haven't seen retail come in in in in full force so it's just it's just that crypto people aren't interested in using in using ethereum but once retail starts to come back in which I think probably you would need Bitcoin closer to 100K flirting with 100K to bring to bring people back in then maybe you know you you see you see volume volume come back come back to eth but what's what's kind of interesting to me is that even today with prices at at all-time highs and people really excited and things happening in the in the crypto world the your average Market partic you know your average Market participant that was around in 2021 isn't here right now they're still they're still not here and I can't really put a finger on why and I don't really know if they're going to come back but I do think it boils down to if I had to take a guess the fact that it's very very very difficult to replicate a CO effect it's just super difficult to replicate that effect where everybody's inside nobody has anything to do everybody's on online 247 it's going to be hard to get back to where we were where where we were in 2021 so you have to at least think about the idea that it's there might not actually be retail coming back this cycle and so if that's the case then what do you want to what do you want to focus on at least until we get to 100K and you know things things get absolutely absolutely nuts is you're just you're focusing on the Crypt native stuff and you're focusing on bitcoin and I think this has been said at nauseum but I still think that this is true because you you actually at this point you can't really make a strong bet on when retail is and when retail is going to come back in yeah I mean you can you can front run meme coins and that's just onchain degeneracy but you can't make a bet on it's harder to make a bet on nfts games some of the more serious stuff I mean to your point about Bitcoin though I am hearing some interesting anecdotes from the oil Market they're not they're not going away these anecdotes the recent one and I heard this from a very credible source is that pavesa which is the um let's just call it a major Venezuelan state-owned oil entity is offering and refining as well uh offering discounts on export caros if the buyer pays in Bitcoin instead of in dollars seriously yeah I mean I mean they're sanctioned right that's why yeah that's right they're sanctioned um but like they can't they basically can't get banked with dollars anymore the venez the sanctioned oil trade like half of the [ __ ] oil that that's an exaggeration at least 20% of the world's oil comes from sanctioned countries so that's more than 20 million barrels a day barrels 42 gallons like it's a it's a it's an ocean of oil every day comes from sanction entities they have no dollar banking the the US is just the wazu so if you want to have if you're Venezuela and you want to sell your oil and you want to receive dollars you have to wait 17 business days for those dollars to hit a shell company owned by a shell company owned by a shell company or you can get your Bitcoin in 15 minutes right so okay maybe retail is not coming back to [ __ ] around on Aptos um or play games on Avalanche but you know there is money coming into this it's just different money you know but I mean that sounds like it's just all Bitcoin money no yeah exactly Bitcoin money okay so I think that that's that's probably that's probably the main difference right is that this this money is very unlikely to go travel to other sectors correct and the the Black Rock ETF the Bitcoin ETF money isn't going to go travel to eth either but then you know you were the one shouting at me saying that eventually it it does move over so I don't know I think maybe the eth community is just just too wounded from the nft Carnage and the the lack of Sandwich fun and all this other stuff to to really get excited about degeneracy and the salana mafia is on a High um you know for obvious reasons that's I I was sort of screaming that it was going to rotate over to altcoins in general from the people that already that already hold BTC but what's clear to me is that it's it just rotates crypto natives are just going to rotate to me right I mean or or Crypton is going to buy defi now the the one thing that is maybe changing my mind a little bit kind of happened today I mean we'll see what happens with the airdrop from uh Wormhole and the airdrop from Athena was was really good and so you are going to have these large events where real products that are building real stuff actually is you know it's generating interest now and so I am watching this closely because if atheno really takes off of form hole really takes off and it does well and it's sustained then it might cat catalyze and move towards real projects and I mean you look you look at maker Maker's done Maker's done very well so what could happen and what we could see just as a you know play Devil's Advocate against myself is that people T take profits in meme coins into these more interesting assets and then that catalyzes a run on Meme coins and a booming of cap capital in projects that actually might do well right might do might might do good might do good for crypto so there potentially one thing that could happen is dog with hat sells off by 80 80% but it sells off by 80% because all of that capital is moving into quote unquote safer assets which you would probably expect at some point I mean also question for you Obby does an airdrop actually Kickstart an Eco system like will Wormhole take off because of because of the air drop I mean yeah it's possible I mean I think more more importantly for Wormhole is that if you're not allocated to salana right now you probably should be allocated to salana right now because it's going to create a lot of wealth for people and everybody's going to take that Wormhole money and they're going to buy monkey getting haircut or whatever and that's probably going to be a very big Boon for the salono ecosystem it's kind of the same way that when avac announced that they were going to have a fund dedicated to buying mem coins on AAC everybody rote it off and then all the M coin on Ax did really well that's how I feel about Wormhole it's telegraphed everybody sort of knows this but I genuinely don't think people are there there H there hasn't been enough front running flows yet H when's the Wormhole air drop uh that's a good good question while we're talking about salana one of my favorite analysts on the salana sort of ecosystem is this guy ZX gumo you should should go check out ZX gum SHO Twitter account he or she or whoever did an interesting analysis of airdrop price action um basically what you're supposed to do is Farm those aird drops that you know are coming slash a bunch of money around in those in those systems Wormhole whatever get your aird drop sell it immediately and then Reby down like 80% um that's a good trade so don't don't hang on and get caught holding the bag uh go to zerox gum shoes account and learn how to trade an airdrop I wish I had that last cycle okay that's uh it's yeah it's it's interesting and and fair I'll go uh go go check that out zerx G what a good good shout out Jonah see I follow salana Twitter I like it I got some salana it's fun the one thing that that I was kind of curious about though is like it in this in this environment where you know you talked about the barbell strategy OB where you just hold Bitcoin for obvious reason and then you play the meme coin casino for obvious reasons like do you are you starting to lose hope that any of the stuff in between those two extremes is going to start to emerge and and generate value and if it seems to are we going to be too late like is it is it going to be the 2028 cycle where where real [ __ ] starts to take off I'm kind of I'm getting worried I don't necessarily think that it's going to be that long I think that we are going to see real things take off off I just don't know if you're going to be able to make money on them in the you know that's why people are so interested in meme coins is because that that's where that's where the money's made I mean for example an rwa platform that tokenizes a bunch of assets and that it enables enables the trading of all these assets I mean how much does a platform that issues tokenized products how much is that actually going to be worth is a question just the platform for facilit because it's be very very little but the Sorry by platform you mean the the application or the L2 I think L1 is what benefits I think the like I believe in the fat protocol thesis I don't think it's been disproven if anything I think it's been proven and if you have if you have these tokenization rails getting built then that just means like millions of new eth wallets getting lit up and funded with eth and millions of Institutions having to buy eth to support all of this pay gas yeah yeah look I I I disagree just because I think that a lot of these applications are going to happen on l2s and there's just G not going to be that much demand for eth that's generated because these l2s are going to have very very low fees and so then I then I go one step further and I think about the applications themselves are the applications going to generate any value I mean how much is a supposed to be worth how much is compound supposed to be worth how much are these platforms supposed to be worth and the answer is when you can value it like a real business not very much so I'm still look I'm still stuck on the idea that you can make a lot of money investing in good products in crypto if you invest at good valuations obviously this is super obvious if you can do precede if you can do angel if you can get your money in or get into a fair launch early early product with a great team then you can make a lot of money if it's a good product and it's probably it's a safe it's a safer BET right so the way that I think about is if you can invest at a Cutting Edge lending protocol at a 25 million valuation or you know 50 million valuation as it comes out then yeah maybe it'll get to 500 million maybe it'll get to 600 million and you're probably not going to lose that much money on it if it's run by a good team in the same way that it doesn't matter how good a team is for mecoin you can easily lose money on it if there's just no appetite for it the upside just isn't isn't there the same way and so that's why the crypto native people aren't aren't going for it but I still think it's a you know slow and steady wins the race you know if you want to build wealth over time you still you're supposed to invest good products in crypto and just sit on them and not not think about them and then you can have some sort of some sort of meme allocation but I think in aggregate what what's happening right now is that you know there's just the the interest just isn't there I mean but look at the end of the day we'll see I mean right now we're talking about this is Bitcoin Bitcoin sold off 5% today uh which is you know pretty it's pretty pretty uh pretty good move for BTC we we tried to get through that 73k level then we tried to get through the 72k level and now we're back at now we're back at 66 and I think we've both been we're both we've both been bullish but a little bit more cautious around these levels in the short term just because I think things did get very overheated and there is a lot of open interest in the market however at this at this point I'm seeing I'm seeing so many indications that are bullish for BTC I mean just the geopolitics in General is is phenomenal for for for Bitcoin the world the world is becoming a much more dangerous place today and so more than more than ever I want to hold on to BTC for the long run I I agree um uh you know we were chatting about this offline everybody who's holding BTC on a on a cold wallet should educate themselves on downloading the private key and spending it if Ledger disappears or treasure disappears like you should you should really learn the mechanics of what you're holding because increasingly it looks like we live in a world where you you may just need to pack up stuff in your little go bag and move you know um prob about how Iran is looking at potentially locking launching rockets at Israel yeah no nobody wants that like even if you don't care about the Middle East at all and just not part of your reality like that that's just that's just going to draw in a lot of problems so yeah I think it's it the the like the geopolitical aspect of Bitcoin it has never been more relevant especially in especially in the developing World um the meme coin thing it's the best casino in the history of the world your odds are better than betting it all on double zero like I get I get that and yeah you know we don't need to beat a dead horse but everything else in between is a bit of head scratcher maybe Obi I you know both of us tweeted out both of us tweeted out like what should we talk about this week should we do a lightning round where like I ask you questions that people replied to yours and you ask me questions that people replied to mine and we try to answer in like short short little sound bites yeah let's do it okay so Jonah what do you think about the death of nfts why aren't nft is doing well I think that that blur just brought in you know how like cardano doesn't go to zero right I think blur made the bad nft project go to zero the fads go to zero like they brought some liquidity in there uh some selling they made it possible right and so anything that's blurble got blurred uh you know that obviously didn't hurt the best projects or the Grails like [ __ ] Crypt Punk traded for $16 million two weeks ago but I think that's why they're getting torched because finally somebody figured out a way to devalue worthless things um I don't know what do you think yeah I I also think that memecoins just took the wind out of the sales I think the me meane points are the nfts of this cycle right they offer they offer you community they offer you outsize returns they are highly correlated to the performance of the base asset all these things are reasons why people bought nfts in the first place and people were using nfts to just Mass massively speculate on them and then I think what ended up what end up happening is that mcoins just took the wind out of the sales for these guys and so even the nft projects that are doing really good work I mean pudy Penguins is actually building a real brand yeah I saw them in a I saw them in a like a department store for S they're building they're building a real brand and I think that they're going to be around for a very long time but the the issue is that the the Crypton native people just aren't aren't buying them and those are the only people that are that that are interested right now so I I do think that there's probably going to be a Renaissance at some point in the next six months that would be my at least that that would be my guess and so I like holding on to lart you know good nfts you know squiggles budgies obviously I love my rock I think Crypt punks are gonna are going to do well I think that we are going to capture the culture again at some point in the future it's just it's just a matter of time but for now you know they're not going to give you so they're not going to give you crazy returns I I really don't think blur hurt nfts as much as the market says that they did I think they did at the margin by providing liquidity as you said but I think the prices would have been reached anyway people would have sold anyway yeah it just would have taken a it would have been like a slow bleed instead of like a quick price Discovery followed by equilibrium type thing um here I got one for you uh price targets for potential dips uh to buy and levels for take profit well they these these people they just want to plan huh so one thing I I mean I actually think this is the 66k level is a good level to play to play for a bounce I think that it's very likely that we range between 60 and 70k for a bit um and so my my my my view here is you probably you know I hope you drisk a little bit around 70k because what you see in the chart right now and what you see in the market is that when we first we first hit you know 73 we sold off really hard back down to 60 we came back up and now we've rejected again at that 70 at that 70k level normally what you want to what you want to do is if you go to the daily chart uh look at starting on Monday March 25th you see a green candle and there's a wick and the next day there's a wick and then the next day there's a wick and then the next day there's a wick so you get four different days in a row where you can't break through a certain Supply level and that should tell you okay maybe there isn't enough buying pressure to get through this particular level and that the crazy bid that occurred before isn't here anymore and so I should you should start to think about drisking in those types of situations and so now you have an even greater reason to drisk so the reason that I think that it's possible we could you know trade down to 52k from here and that would be my you know if we trade 52k that's my I'm I'm [ __ ] buying this [ __ ] and I'm going I'm going in I'm going ham going shopping uh I'm going I'm going shopping at 52k is we have a few things happening one is we finally have our first lower lower high so if you just look at the if you just look at the chart you'll you'll see that you'll see that pretty pretty simply and then the second thing is we're in the process of breaking the trend line that's been active since since 40K so we've just been steadily climbing and what these two things are telling me is that we finally reached a point where people are willing to offload enough Supply to counteract to counteract the inflows and that Bitcoin can get very reflexive on the way down there are a lot of people sitting on unrealized profits right now when you look at a market like this and you think to yourself well it's going to be pretty hard to get over 73k that makes the risk reward really bad uh for holding and so you generally tend tend to drift towards places where it's difficult to figure out a risk reward and right now it's easy because look you have really the next support level is at 50 as at 53k you kind of have one at at 62 but it's been tested too many times and I think a lot of people a lot of people bought those levels already and so the the area that makes the most sense that is quote unquote tough to determine what you know uh tough tough to determine whether it's good or bad risk reward is just smack dab smack dab in the middle you know at that at that 61k level you know then you have that 73k top and the 52k bottom and so I think that's probably where we just end up for a bit we probably get stuck there for a while I I have a slightly different take than you I think that's super interesting um I I just I you you were the voice of reason when we hit alltime highs you were like it it probably makes sense to take a little off trade around the position I was just euphorically bullish I I didn't expect this um but what I would say is I I think to the downside yeah if we trade down to 50K it's time to go shopping like you close your eyes and you buy with both hands around here I think you're supposed to look for you know also if we're down at 50k maybe you try to buy some salana if it's you know if it's around 150 or something um I don't know about eth Bitcoin and salana are probably what you buy uh to the upside I thought you were Mr ethbull what happened don't want to buy any eth I don't know I ver you too hard you you may have dude I I'm long enough like I'm I'm [ __ ] you've scared me I don't want to buy more at this point definitely not selling any eat though just hanging on to that one I think salana I'm under alloc so how about this you buy Bitcoin and you buy things that you're under allocated to like in my case salana if you're like long to your ears in salana and you don't have any eth maybe you buy some eth on a on a pullback to 50K as well as Bitcoin um to the upside uh I just think it's insane to sell before the having and like I I think we've you know you're talking about these Wicks the go like we we got our answer on why it's why it's wicking the government has shown up with their Silk Road Bitcoin and they're just you know funding funding America's operations paying for bridges that fell into the water and government salaries and stuff like the the Silk Road Bitcoin is hitting the market here it seems so they're sending it to coinbase so ultimately like you've got a big seller you've also got lots of buying the Market's kind of between a rock and a hard place and then the having's coming up and the miners are going to have literally half as much selling to do so stock and flow Dynamics I think think should bring us to higher levels I don't really see I don't have a takeprofit level in price space I have it in mvrv Z space uh MV rvz for those of you who aren't aware is a z-scored ie like number of standard like standard deviation striated like metric where you look at the market cap of Bitcoin divided by the realized cap which is defined as like the price at which all the utxos were spent uh volume volume weighted like real ized price and go look up the blog post I I don't really know how to articulate it this is like a mathematical equation it's it's really a really good predictor of cycle lows and cycle highs um when mvrv Z gets to seven that's when I'm going to be selling ass loads of Bitcoin um I see no reason to like pick a price ahead of that you sort of have to watch where the transactions get spent so you can determine that realized value um so that's kind of how I'm thinking about it yeah it's it's definitely definitely a good long-term approach I think these metrics are good are good for trying to time cycle tops and I'm not by no means calling the top of the cycle but I am saying that the next three weeks are going to be pretty shitty dicey yeah they're gonna they're gonna they they're they're not going to be good so if if I'm you I'm consolidating my gains so that brings me to a great lightning round question some guy uh tweeted at you where are we in the cycle we are in inning seven that's my guess I think you know sorry in in inning six what I would say is that we probably don't get we probably don't get past 100K until the end of the year uh so I think what what what ends up what ends up happening is that we have the selloff this probably lasts for a month or two uh then we make a run up to you know 80 80 to 95k I don't think that we break 100K the first time that we get close I think that too many people come in sell off then we get another few months of then we get another few months of sideways and then some point next year we break through that that 100K level we have a crazy run maybe up to 120 130 140 and then that's it and then we're done that's my bet do the memes participate uh once we break through 80k I think I think memes just continue to run for the next six months but with multiple 80% draw Downs in between right so for example if if Bitcoin if Bitcoin trades 52k which I think there's a reasonable chance it does in the next two months every meme is going to be absolutely destroyed and that's actually probably a really good time to start buying them interesting and where where does all the money get made which Innings does all the money get made like let's let's say dude a lot of the money was made already I think I I don't think it's crystallized I think it's it's it's still sitting in there but we still need we still need our we still need our crazy AI bubble like we need our first AI coin to hit 50 billion as as people think it's you know as people think it's a future and I think we need Doge to probably hit 50 to 75 billion we we need do to test alltime highs uh and then and then I'll start to think about taking off a lot yeah I I'm just I'm like heavily fixated on MBR VZ but I I'm sure they're better ways to do this and and you probably know what they are I mean this this has been a weird cycle like the selloff was so ferocious and all-encompassing and terrifying and like sprinkled with regulatory jalapenos that [ __ ] burn your face off if you try to take a bite um and then it just came roaring the [ __ ] back like so quickly I can't help a wonder if this isn't going to conform to the normal psychologic of having in four years two of which are be to Wier bull like this one this one feels like it could be a little runt cycle characterized by crazy meme coins then another like selloff of apathy followed by like a plateau of Enlightenment where real world use cases start to take off I think that's I I I think that's probably right actually I mean I I tend to agree with you that we're probably past the idea of Cycles yeah we've gotten we've we've graduated from this and that what we're going to see is we're just going to see a slow consistent growth from Bitcoin over the next five years with a lot of minus 40% draw Downs in between Long and Strong it's the way to play it long and strong buy 52k with me boys maybe we could close on a brief anecdote um my I I my one sort of like artwork Splurge there's this guy bran Simonson he's like an ex British marine guy who got shot with an AK-47 Afghanistan and now he's an artist he um he covers weapons and butterflies they're pretty awesome um check them out brand Simonson anyway he was asking me for crypto trading advice and my advice to him was stick to what you what you know like don't try to develop a side hustle like day trading meme coins or or um you know attempting to hop onto this or that technology narrative and it got me thinking like how do we develop an edge as traders of this Market market and ultimately what I got him on to was memes because that's something that as an artist he can understand and he can also sell his artwork for eth or Bitcoin or whatever and and just uh like stay long because he understands price appreciation from developing artwork uh the all of the software heavy stuff in the middle l2s like arbitrum optimism polygon like he's not I I advised him away from that and I was just thinking like maybe as crypto Traders we should all try to find like something we can relate to to trade because it's often there's so many little pockets of this space that are just a bit spooky and hard to understand I I my brain starts to melt with the AI and the software stuff I don't get it but holding on for dear life and the Commodities angles like I I can totally get that and memes like you know as a podcaster learning from you Obby like we we are starting to understand virality a bit so meme coins make sense I don't know what area ever ever I don't I don't know if I can follow it up follow it up with uh with with with much but I mean for for me look at the uh at the end of the day I got into this because I think that crypto has the opportunity to change the world and so I do spend a lot of time thinking about the actual real applications of this space I'm just a Trader and I'm cognizant that my job is to make money and I need to go where the money is so I pay attention I research I look I invest but at the end of the day right now I'm a Trader and so that's why I'm not super invested well stay safe out there everybody it's getting choppy none of this is investment advice be careful do your own research and Obi great talking to you man pleasure talking to you too Jonah take [Music] care

alts or Bitcoin which does better this cycle risk adjusted sharp sortino no just give me straight which a basket Bitcoin Bitcoin don't talk any of that stuff I don't understand what you just said okay well you know Al you know they're high high Beta And I think uh I think that's that's going to do well but I think the the optimal portfolio is a is a barbell Bitcoin mcoin portfolio you know like 8 85% Bitcoin 5% slurf 5% Zin you know 5% dog with hat or you know whatever how do you pronounce that with whiff whiff not wh whiff I like Joe Bowden that's mine no need to get political no no no this is not political statement you know Joe Bowden is very different from Joe Biden yeah this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance the onchain defi primitive redesigning derivatives for the defi native you'll hear more about perennial later on the [Music] show all right guys um really excited to do this because this is a panel ad Des but this is also the first live episode of the 1000x podcast I am very lucky to be crashing this episode with host Obi and Jonah BS could you give a little introduction for yourselves yeah sure hey everybody uh you know I've been uh recording this thousand next podcast with Jonah for the last half a year courtesy of blockworks putting it all together for the six years before that I was investing professionally in cryptocurrency and digital assets first at way Financial then I ran the liquid book over at block tower for about two years and then I had the amazing experience of actually being able to start up the crypto division at a traditional fund called golden tree uh which is a distress debt asset manager but made the forway into uh into cryptocurrency and I worked there for about two years helping them start up and through my Journeys met Jonah and we decided to start a podcast where we could just talk at each other for 45 minutes to an hour because we were doing that anyway so now we're here on stage talking to you guys yes um it's very hard to get AI on the phone unless uh it's it's a recorded podcast he's a he's a podcasting type of person so but if there's alcohol involved it's easier for him that's what I a little bit there might have been one or two missed podcasts because we were out for both of us um I'm Jonah uh I've been a Trader for 18 years I ran the oil derivative book at Goldman Sachs then I was a partner at Vall for seven years it's the world's largest oil Trading Company then after that I had the privilege of running trading at Cumberland which is the cryptocurrency arm of drw and that's where I met AI uh we were at crypto Bahamas together bit of a ill- fated moment in crypto's crypto's history but you know happy to be back on the conference what happened in the Bahamas youh first I just want to say I'm very happy to see at this conference a lack of shorts cuz like Crypt bomas there were probably far too many know people seem like they're put together this is an indication that our industry has grown up a little bit which is always nice to see said absolutely no flipflops allowed um man should never show his bare toes that's just that should be unsaid um fellas I'm I'm really lucky to have you here um I'm going to resist for as long as I can to ask you guys about meme coins which is of course what we all want to talk about right um but why don't we just start with this sort of classic uh question that people tend to ask themselves around this time which is where are we in the market cycle right so we've had these Bitcoin ETFs we've had some price appreciation we're looking at altz run a little bit but maybe it feels a little bit different than you know previous all-time high breaks what do you guys think I think that in all markets not just crypto uh we you know you tend to start the bull market when things get volatile so I you know I I could characterize the last year and a half as a bull market just sort of a steady grind upwards but I would say that was more of a recovery phase from the extremely painful bare cycle of 2022 I wouldn't really call that the bull market I would I would say you know in keeping with the title of this panel how to trade the upcoming bull market I think we're just getting started as markets really start to enter price Discovery phase especially to the upside they get very volatile um I think we're out of the high sharp steady grind upwards into a phase where we start to get some Savage pullbacks some bull traps some bear traps and and uh the type of price action that you might have seen in you know maybe the NASDAQ in 1999 or crude oil in 2008 or you know crypto in 2021 where uh Obi Felman was trading some of those all-time highs followed by 70% pullbacks followed by all-time highs yeah it's kind it's kind of interesting so for the first time ever we have a different setup for the bull market so basically all previous Cycles what you had is you had a bare Market that came that was really solved by the having which brought interest back in and generally what you'd find is that four to six months after the having is when Bitcoin managed to reach previous alltime highs this time is different this time we actually got to the previous alltime highs and surpassed them after the having or before the having and what that tells me is that this time is is a bit different there are different factors at play the environment is different the industry is M more mature than it was previously and also is very unlikely to follow the same predictable patterns that it had for the last three cycles and so where do I see us today well the ETF was obviously the big Catalyst and it brought in a lot of inflows very early in the beginning but we're still early in the process of Bitcoin as an Institutional asset penetrating right most of these asset issuers most of these ETF issuers are still in the process right now of ramping up their marketing of ramping up their Outreach I'd say if I were to guess they're about 20% deployed so we still have 80% to go now with that being said Bitcoin it it doesn't take in the grand scheme of things that much money to move this asset 10 billion makes an incredible impact on price and so for the last 10 years people have had this crazy outlandish Target in their Minds Bitcoin at 100K you know couldn't we get to 100K can we get to 100K and this sort of sticks in people's minds and so now that we're at 60 70 75 we're almost there and so I think what we've done is we've completed the first phase of the cycle where we've had the Catalyst we've had the interest we've had the explosion but now the hard work begins now there's probably a little bit of a slog it's will we break 100K will we get past 100K what happens after and if you actually look back this started back in 2021 so since $20,000 that broke in December of 2020 every time Bitcoin has made a new all-time high it hasn't gone parabolic so in 2021 every time it would make a new alltime high it would actually pull back a little bit it would chop around it would gry they would have these pullbacks You' have these issues and the reason is because people are happy to sell when they tar Target is within sight and so what I think is we're sort of done with the first half we're in for a little bit of churn right now and then over the next 6 to 12 to 18 months is when we get the inevitable ratcheting up of the marketing from all these ETF issuers a tremendous amount of new capital will come into the market and we'll be Off to the Races and it's probably going to look a little bit more stable than previous Cycles I don't necessarily think we're going to get another 85% draw down maybe a 50 60% all right that was a really helpful framing for me because one thing that's been confusing me a little bit this is my mental framework going into this all-time high break is I remember watching the price in December of 2020 when and you can actually if you go back and looked at that fractal it was like hovering around 19k and then it just blew through and doubled went to 40 in like a month or something and that was the time where it felt like I just remember how I felt at that time which was like oh my God it's on you know and that's when I feel like retail came back to the market we felt that our business it picked back up uh and it just didn't really feel like that this time so you think that basically there's kind of like some not like a triple top type thing but this is we did the easy gains people are more willing to sell at this point and there's a lot of actual work that needs to go in to take us on that next like higher yeah I I think I think the key here is that the market is comprised of a very different type of individual than it was in 2020 so in 2020 it was a lot of retail it was a lot of Fast Money types and when you break an all-time high in that particular scenario you just generate fomo right people are kind of okay I need to get in this thing it's going to run away for me it's going to do this it's going to do that and ever since Bitcoin you know became more institutional which I'd say actually happened in mid 2021 you saw a lot of these larger buyers come in a lot of these more High net worth family office type people come in these are guys that are going to sell at plus 100% you know and they're going to buy at minus 25 and they're going to sort of dampen the volatility of this asset class so you're probably not going to see an all-time high break and then a boom crazy Parabola because the type of person that is in the market is exponentially more willing to sell an all-time high break than they have ever have been in the past so it kind of just makes sense to me that it wouldn't go crazy parabolic right after see this is something that I'm struggling with what you can't see behind the ETF flows is who's buying you don't know whether it's hedge funds massive retire systems reallocating a piece of their portfolio you don't know whether it's commodity you know issuers or producers Sovereign governments it's confusing right with crypto you can kind of track oh you know this is a whale wallet that has been in for a long time it's been here since the beginning everything on chain is a bit more well at least you can you can follow the breadcrumb trail to some sort of truth about who's buying and who's selling and you know you could see right now whether it's the grayscale trust or just long-term holders is selling Bitcoin to effectively Black Rock I bit that's what's going on right now what I can't figure out is who's behind all this ETF buying is it little retail people buying $10 worth of crypto and then you know they're going to sell it out 3% higher and chop around or these new whales new family offices new major institutions and you know corporations I'm struggling with that and so I'm watching price action very closely right now um my hypothesis is that it's a new long-term holder base it's either long-term holders who are in gbtc because it was effectively discounted Bitcoin rotating into something with lower fees to hold on for the next $100,000 of price action uh your mom your dentist people just stowing it away in an IRA or a 401k or some some retirement account uh that's my thesis I think these are long-term holders what's scary to me is the idea as a long-term holder myself what's scary is the idea that this is these are weak hands that this is fast money right if we see three five 10 20 days of consecutive outflows at 10% you know below the the new all-time highs that that we hit recently I I think we're going to be in for some of that insane bull market volatility that's going to shake a lot of uh Shake A lot of people out of this uh in kind of an unfortunate uh worst possible time kind of way so I'm doing my best to hang on I think that as we analyze the nature of these ETF inflows which ultimately not only are they a you know flows flows aren't a use case but they are effectively the validation of Bitcoin as a store of value which is the ultimate use case for crypto right now you know as we analyze how these new participants come in and treat this Market I think it'll it'll determine a lot about how much volatility we're going to see over the course of the next 12 months actually I'm curious of this audience how many people here raise your hand actually own the Bitcoin ETF is anybody I own grayscale is that count yeah gra gray gr grayscale grayscale counts uh how many people here own any crypto at all wow so proud of this audience this is a beautiful representation of who the ETF buyers are it's new money okay right cuz look at all the people that own crypto and none of them except for a few you know we've got some Champions out there that bought the Bitcoin ETF but I think I think that actually perfectly encapsulates who's buying the Bitcoin ETF it's it's firsttime buyers of crypto it's new it's new capital that's coming in and look they're here for they're here for the roller coaster I think my general take on this is that if you're buying the Bitcoin ETF it's not necessarily because you want to buy Bitcoin now for the quick pump for the quick win because if that was your incentive you probably would have figured out how to buy Bitcoin on coinbase it's really not that hard so I think a lot of these people are just you know your your dentists your raas your Slow Money your people that aren't going to sell minus 15% aren't going to sell minus 20% because they're buying Bitcoin the same way they buy the S&P it's drilled into people that buy the S&P don't sell when it's down just hold for 30 years well if that's the case pfolio that's insanely bullish and you know you're your structural seller the miners they're going to have you know 50% less selling to do in in a month um stock and flow it doesn't matter whether you're talking about Bitcoin or bananas you know more buying less selling a banan is higher price does the having still matter is it still relevant I think so I again I'm a Commodities Trader uh in the way that I think it you deal with producer flow every day as a Commodities Trader these these people they extract oil from the ground they sell oil derivatives pushes the price of oil lower uh they're locking in their cash flows miners do exactly the same thing I I'm struggling to understand how it is that if you were to go and literally tell every single producer of crude oil in the world your wells just depleted by 50% you've got 50% less crude oil and they do less selling how that wouldn't lead to some sort of crazy rally that's how I'm thinking about it maybe it's the wrong mental model I I think you're right and also to preempt a question that a lot of people ask which is well the minor flows how are the minor flows matter because they're not that large of an aggregate percentage of the volume of Bitcoin there Bitcoin exists the price of Bitcoin is based on their marginal buyer and marginal seller and miners basically have to sell to fund their operations so you know this flow is coming in and when people know that flows are coming in you know that impacts the way that the market the market trades and so I think even a marginal amount of reduction in known choreographed flow into the market will change the way the market reacts and will be bullish for the market so even if it's not you know a large percentage it it is Meaningful and the second thing is that the having always brings attention and crypto For Better or For Worse thrives on attention that is the key driver of crypto across every asset that you've ever looked at is just how many people are looking at it at any given time I mean Bitcoin is one of those funny assets where it just gets more value as it goes up because the more people accept it the more other people are convinced to accept it that's just the nature of the asset uh so as attention is paid to bitcoin the fundamentals go up this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance perennial is quickly becoming one of the go-to derivatives platforms and liquidity layers for all of defi so let me tell you a little bit about them there are kind of three things you need right when you're thinking about a place and a platform to trade on first one great trade execution second one low fees and third of course an onchain permissionless platform and perennial Nails all three of those buckets with the launch of perennial V2 they've made all of that possible by introducing a ton of new features such as faster oracles which reduce trade execution to seconds lower fees competing with major centralized exchanges and minimizing fees for both takers and makers fully modular markets which allow the protocol to support any price feed out there and fourth cash settled right the trades are cash settled in USD not in crypto perennial allows you the trader to gain access to deeper liquidity with only a fraction of the tvl how it works is that perennial enables a two-sided Market made up of both Traders and liquidity providers right Traders deposit the assets to get leverage exposure while liquidity providers provide these pools of capital to earn fees for taking the other side of the trader position rennial allows you to trade crypto hers FX and coming soon nfts and more backed by some of the best investors in the industry perennial is a must checkout platform if you're a crypto Trader go check them out by clicking the link in the description give thousand XM credit go check out perennial you're going to love them all right let's get back to the show you you made a good point about the marginal buyer and where does the marginal token exchange hands right as these ETFs drink up more and more of the available supply of coin uh there's a smaller and smaller subset of tokens available for transfers so it's possible that the first you know 10 billion of ETF inflows drove the price up by roughly 30k the next 10 billion could drive the price up by 60k there are fewer tokens available for sale it's just you know they're sitting in an ETF instead of in somebody's uh laptop at the bottom of a landfill this time slightly different Dynamic so what do you guys think about this idea I've heard this a couple of times now it actually came up on uh the Bitcoin ETF panel this morning uh so you guys like the traditional way that these Cycles tend to play out Bitcoin tends to move first strong spotl rally rotation to eth rotation to alts and whatever jpeg meme coin duure end of cycle this usually takes about a year and a half and one Theory that's being talked about quite a bit right now is that maybe this Cycle's a little bit different because hey before you put your Bitcoin on a crypto exchange then you could like very easily transition into eth altcoins whatever now this different because these things are locked up in an ETF these are being hel held in Charles Schwab or Fidelity or whatever um and maybe some of that capital is just going to be stickier there what do you guys think about that yeah I I've I've always wondered about this just because it is a new Dynamic and I think the reality is that even though the new money coming in is unlikely to rotate out of Bitcoin because it's held on the exchange it's held in the ETF itself and not on the exchanges you still get a rotation from the crypto native individuals that have already owned Bitcoin that have already owned these assets and they're going to rotate but that's actually what's creating the dynamic right now yeah which is that you're not seeing movement from things that are fundamental right you're not seeing a a lot of a lot of the older older l1s a lot of the dii applications a lot of the things that people last cycle would have looked at and said hey this is a good project it produces cash flows it's kind of interesting maybe I should buy it maybe maybe it'll go up the reason that that happened last cycle is cuz no idea had nobody had any idea what they were doing right these are all like new people in the in in in the in the crypto world now what you have is you actually don't have a tremendous amount of retail you just have a lot of crypto Natives and so what crypto natives know is that the things that go up the most and everybody's just trying to maximize their p&l the things that go up the most in Bull markets are mcoins and so basically free Revenue pure plays yeah you you you don't have the flows into the fundamental projects from the more conservative buyers because the conservative buyers are now in the ETF and then the people that are really willing to go down the risk curve are the people that already owned crypto and so they're just rotating into these meme coins that are going to a billion dollars in two days which obviously will end in tears but you know it's fun for the time being and so then the middle section is kind of left out to dry until you either get more retail coming back in or enough people get burned on mem coins and then decide that they want to be allocated to this industry but you know maybe I should actually buy something that works um I I was one of those people who got kind of toasted on the LA in the last bull market trying to play the altcoin space on the basis of what I perceive to be fundamental value like oh wow look at this blockchain it's it's got sharding and that's so much better than where eth is right now it's like two years ahead of eth and so let me buy that and you know I I underperformed eth by 99% doing you know with that with that mentality and you know just ulated p&l until finally I decided I'm going to collapse everything claps the whole book into gbtc because if there's one thing that I deeply believe in it's Bitcoin and this is just deeply discounted Bitcoin and I can do legal analysis and talk to lawyers and conclude that you know in the foreseeable future this will convert to an ETF and I'll get the discount back and just hold on to this in a way that I don't get stopped out so that worked so on the way back up uh I then became one of those people who just dismissed alt coins altogether and Avi thankfully one of the benefits of podcasting with this guy is that you learn stuff right and he's been through a few of these Cycles he's a veteran and he he absolutely nailed this there was one of our podcast where I tried to say this is this is just a a pure play hold on for dear life type asset class you know bitcoin's going to a million dollars of token why should we worry about anything else and Obby just started shouting at me and literally shouting he was he was absolutely right like there are ultimately this asset class if I had to you know consolidate The View into a nutshell here would be that the the asset class will be taken to higher Heights by proper use cases by people adopting the technology which is ultimately far better than tradire rails for moving money and I can attest to this from from my career um however in the meantime uh you know know it's less important to try and come up with Trad five uh compartmentalizations of value or earnings per token or any tokenomics or any of that and try to basically try to follow the flows and right now you have ETF flows driving Bitcoin you have uh you know cultural excitement and Zeitgeist driving other elements of the space meme coins and you you have an AI theme that's driving the tech sector and elements of the tech sector do Drive elements of the crypto sector because ultimately much like oil was at its early days crypto is tradable technology so uh you you know you follow those narratives and there there are shortterm profits to extract for sure so I I put put on my meme coin hat and just just went over the rails recently and it's a little tough to focus but yeah um I I I tend to agree with you AI I think I think while ultimately we will be validated by a use case um perhaps that use case will come about as a result of higher prices and we should stop tearing our hair out in the meantime there's something funny about mem coins I I'm also on the Rope about this where they're they're fun are they positive I don't know it's TBD but they I think they have like at least 25 or 30% of something which is pretty true um which it feels a little bit like kind of a middle finger to the people that are the fundamentalists and doing this type of analysis doesn't it feel like that a little bit it's kind of like Nvidia Nvidia is a great company right it's trading at like 50 times Revenue you know I mean is it a great business is nvidia's business real but are we all kind of sitting around wondering like is this really trading on fundamentals or not I feel like that's what meme coins are kind of putting their finger on just honestly no sorry but I'll say that this is infinitely better than it was six seven years ago because seven years ago what would happen is there'd be some guy sitting in his basement and he'd launch an Ico and he'd say this Ico is going to revolutionize everything from your fridge to airplanes to your shoes there's going to be iot and everything your whole life is going to it's going to be incredible you talking about off here like you buy this and you're going to become super rich and you're going to live on Mars and now you buy something called slurf because it's funny and they both accomplish the same thing which is that they go up but at least one is telling you the truth you're buying it because it's funny I mean they don't always go up right you know so there's like a there's like a little bit of a a little bit of a difference I actually view this as a more uh straightforward more honest version of crypto than it was before because the way that I view crypto are they sort of right there is genuine real Tech here that is going to change the world now how that's going to be implemented right how are stocks going to be represented as tokens are they going to trade trade on blockchains and my my bet is 100% yes in the next 10 years there's going to be tremendous amount of revolution on backend infrastructure and you guys are already getting bored right so it's this is this this is the thing that is going to be amazing Tech but it's going to be very hard to speculate on that because what's going to happen is it's going to be built out by these large institutions they may or may not actually need a token your life will be better things will be more interoperable you'll be able to send money overseas more easily but is there a way to necessarily make money on that other than betting on the companies that are building that out maybe there's no token actually associated with that form Tech and then you have the crypto world right and there going to be some some tokens that provide critical infrastructure to l1s right so for example the liquid staking tokens might actually be very beneficial and acrew a ton of value over the next over the next 5 to 10 years and then you have Bitcoin and then you have some l1s that will capture some value but in my personal view the reality is that a lot of these tokens won't necessarily generate value and I think that's actually what the market is voicing to it that that hey there's going to be a lot of institutional interest because this technology is real but most of these tokens are actually not going to be valuable in the future Bitcoin is going to be super valuable some L1 some L2 some infrastructure layer stuff is going to be super valuable and then what is the rest of crypto but a wonderful massive casino and look don't get me wrong the casino Casino World generates a hundred billion dollars of year in Revenue so that's obviously going to be a big sector but I think that's what the market is sort of voicing now that's why a lot of these things that we view as fundamentals aren't picking up because does a borrow you know does a borrow lend platform really need a token no you know maybe maybe not um in my personal opinion I mean I think that you you strike on a really valuable point there which is that the casino industry has some value to it we shouldn't dismiss it and I think what's refreshing about this cycle you know is that people in the institutional space people who wear suits and ties work will admit even if they work in crypto hey you know there's it's a little bit more fun to light up a phantom wallet and gamble on some of these zeitgeisty memes than it is to go to go to some depressing casino and and pull the arm of a slot machine right so that's okay and we've accepted that as an industry now I think that the future of crypto you know to to your point Mike it might be a little distracting or upsetting to the builders in the space who are you know in the trenches writing codes trying to build difficult products and complex services that use this amazing technology called blockchain might be a little Annoying to them that Meme coins called slur for thousand Xing overnight but I think you know one of the one of the powerful things about learning from the success of others and the success of things going on around you is that um you know I would hope that builders in crypto gamify more elements of the products that they build and make them more exciting to use than our current infrastructure which is you know slow boring um and not necessarily that rewarding uh from the perspective of the user experience so one of the reasons why I'm so bullish aside from the having and the the geopolitical tinfoil hat stuff that I could bore you with for hours is um just the fact that we have sort of broken through that barrier of good user experience in crypto recently and did I expect it to be meme coins no we were all expecting it to be games decentralized physical infrastructure rwa you know we all thought hey this is going to be the the cycle where Uber drivers are using Hive mapper to build a real-time you know visual representation of planet Earth and this is so exciting that will probably happen but hey meme coins happen first and the user experience is amazing so let's just celebrate that I guess the first step and certainly bullish the price yeah and and this conversation is actually very important for investing because you have to understand what you're investing in right when you when you put money when you put money in the crypto like what are you what are you actually truly truly betting on so for example you look at all these AI AIX crypto applications that that that are popping off well there're actually non- crypto versions of this that are doing 10x 20x the revenue of oh decentralized I'm going to rent your GPU for this for this for this right now that doesn't necessarily mean that these things won't go up because if you look at the broad swath of investing in AI there's actually really no way to invest in AI except for NVIDIA unless you're investing in private companies which is why a lot of these AI coins are popping off so heavily because people are desperately searching for a way to bet on what they perceive is going to be the future which is AI and I agree with that but are these projects really going to be it I mean maybe some of them maybe not but you know you have to understand a lot of these things 51x because there was no other place to go put that capital and sometimes that happens in crypto a lot is crypto it's so easy to attach a token it's so easy to attach crypto to whatever hot industry exists at the time and then if you know game you're playing fine you can play that game you can invest in it but don't get suckered by it right understand that you know it might not be real or not but then there are real things out there right because I think that a lot of the infrastructure that's going to be built that we're going to use is going to be built on platforms like ethereum like salana like Avalanche there are going to be real real applications deployed on these on these layers and that means that they are going to generate value right so there are real things in crypto but sometimes it's very easy to get you know confused as to what is real what is not because some things might sound real and then it turns out they're not and then some things you know are real a great Point why you where where else other than a highquality L1 like ethereum or salana would have you know would you try to launch a global decentralized GPU rental project um I know Stanford did it in the 90s with the protein folding thing but they didn't you know these days how how would you do it yeah there's a there's a lot of real stuff that that's going on it just takes so much time and one thing to bring it back to you know your question that you asked JN about weak hands versus Str strong hands one like unlock for me was looking at a lot of these tokens some many of which will not be around in many in a couple years some of which will is the underlying driver what's making Bitcoin go up versus your favorite meme coin is the same thing right this is currency to basement in my perspective there's too much money chasing too few things people want to speculate um and actually avota to show an episode of a THX you had this great example of okay once to identify what the driver of a trade is you you have to figure out what structure right so you had this example of a guy who goes to Japan and he figures out how to structure this very clever trade and at least for me I think you could look at these things and very uh logically and pragmatically say if I think what's driving everything right now is this overwhelming currency to basement maybe Bitcoin is the safer thing but I could take a little bit of risk and punt on some of this other stuff as well I think I think the the guy that structured the Bitcoin trade the best in the entire world was Michael sailor I mean what he's done is just this beautiful feat of financial engineering the fact that now he has this Perpetual debt printing machine that he can buy more Bitcoin with is just it really is it's a testament to his financial engineering honestly more than anything else and there's still a huge premium on the stock as well relative to the Bitcoin they hold which is I thought that would go away after the uh ETFs launch but it's hung on which is pretty crazy but it's 100% true the first thing that you said which is that this is a response to currency debasement and we saw this in Nigeria um few weeks ago where they actually are now trying to completely ban crypto because the first the first three months of the year has been very bad for the naira which is a Nigerian currency it's basically you know inflated a ton I think it it basically went from 900 to, 1500 per per dollar and they're they're in trouble and they realized that crypto was actually exacerbating the problem so that says two things one like people genuinely do flee to crypto during times of stress in some and when you see it in some places I think it's actually pretty easy to say well if so many people are doing this in Nigeria then the next country that this happens to people tend to look for examples of what should I do and then it becomes mimetic and it actually might reinforce itself and then the second thing is that governments actually recognize this and they know that it's going to be a problem and they're worried about it and so when I see Bitcoin and crypto and memecoins and all this all this stuff going up I mean I I do think it's in no small part because of those fears I think you know not to get too grandiose about where we are in the world but it's it's a weird we're in a weird spot there a lot of weird things going on a lot of D you know a lot of dangerous flas points right now and I think that's a that's one reason why Bitcoin and cryptocurrency has been doing so well and I think that's one reason why there was an urgency to get a Bitcoin ETF approved is because the people that were pushing it understand this that this is a this is a time in the world that is we're going into to unprecedented times it it belongs in an Institutional Bitcoin belongs in an Institutional portfolio because while it may not be a good inflation hedge or even a good levered NASDAQ proxy it is certainly a debasement hedge and in countries like Nigeria where I used to deal with physical crude oil or you know Istanbul uh when the actually not this would have been anara wherever their central bank is in Turkey when they started uh cutting interest rates to combat inflation insane policy like that or or in Argentina where you know you have hyperinflation if you're just a an ordinary person trying to store value um you know there's not even a debate that bitcoin's a better or ethereum is a better place to to hold value than uh the local currency and so my thesis is that crypto Bitcoin specifically is a monetary economic system in a box that ultimately is better than at least 50% of the world's Fiat currencies in so far as a store of value and probably a means of exchange too um you know if you're a Turkish person living in Turkey when uh erdogan is instructing the central bank to cut rates to combat inflation and there's hyperinflation in a Black Market Per exchange rates in a a you know an artificial government approved Market um you know you can't just put your money in dollars in a JP Morgan Chase checking account or HSBC tether it's a great place right or uh you know Bitcoin so ultimately I do think that this is a threat to governments uh because it it basically runs in the face of uh Fiat money as an experiment which ultimately started in what 1971 when Nixon took the world off the gold standard effectively and it went well for starters but then during covid uh they kind of started to abuse it I don't know pull up M1 money supply the FED has a great chart thing thing went kind of parabolic and uh I think Bitcoin should too as a result we've got only a couple minutes left here I want to do a quick lightning round with you guys ask you some questions all right three years from now what is your price pred where's Bitcoin at exactly three years from now sure 59,87290 250 all right big discrepancy there alts or Bitcoin which does better this cycle risk adjusted sharp stino no just give me straight which which one a basket Bitcoin Bitcoin don't talk any of that stuff I don't understand what you just said okay well you know alts you know they're high high Beta And I think uh I think that's that's going to do well but I think the the optimal portfolio is a is a barbell Bitcoin meme coin portfolio you know like 8 85% % Bitcoin 5% slurf 5% Zin you know 5% dog with hat or you know whatever how do you pronounce that whiff whiff whiff not with whiff I like Joe Bowden that's mine no need to get political no no no this is not political statement you know Joe Bowden is very different from Joe Biden yeah all right Jonah what do you think alter Bitcoin this cycle I'm a AI I think uh I think you hold Bitcoin that's where you get steady gains and I think one thing I've learned from 18 years of professional trading is uh it's really hard to learn without skin in the game so I would say smart people want to take some of their gains from Bitcoin and diversify and try to learn and keep their fingers on the pulse of a few different alt markets alt1 trade is it dead or still alive no it's it's alive and kicking in well ex except that it's just all new l1s now indeed because new the the thesis is new coin good if new it's good if old it's bad all right so we like new new all ones General I I wrote the all L1 thesis off for dead and I just couldn't have been more wrong salana has done really well despite my best predictions um yeah I think uh some alt l1s will Eclipse maybe even ethereum just 5 seconds on this the user experience of all l1s has gone through the roof everywhere except for ethereum and so think that is what's actually going to drive it is that it's just genuinely fun to use salana it's a genuinely good experience now uh in the long run salana or theum both of them can we say that both is yes but I'm GNA make you pick I'm I'm I'm pretty bearish on ethereum to be completely honest and this is coming from somebody that doesn't even particularly like salana I'm just more bearish on ethereum than I am bullish on salana so I guess salana I I wish I wish I could call a friend here pull the audience uh I would say I'm bearish on ethereum too only because I'm scared but uh I would think you know institutions if they're going to settle assets somewhere they're probably going to start on ethereum rather than salana if you're you know Black Rock trying to put something on chain so I I think there's life in that one and it'll come through and become visible later in this cycle all right in 15 seconds each you have advice to give to people who are investing in crypto for the first time what do you think keep it simple don't get freaked out don't invest in anything that you don't know and don't over leverage yourself uh my advice having gone through the institutional crypto trading uh apparatus I would say that no asset class in history has been better optimized for your personal account um you don't need to work at an institution to generate asymmetric incredible returns in crypto the data is practically free a lot of the providers sponsor this conference um spin up a few podcast pass and you know spend hundred or $200 a year on data and trading View and you're good to go you don't need to you don't necessarily need to rely on this bucking bronco of a of a space for cash flow you can play with it personally and extract value elsewhere I will second that just for a second some of the smartest most well-rounded and wealthiest people that I know in crypto never worked for an institution never traded for anyone else they just figured this out the themselves because everything is available for you to learn out there online and if you're intelligent enough and hardworking enough to go figure it out you can go figure it out that's the beauty there's very very little barriers to entry for your average individual to come into this if they're you know dedicated enough yeah if you're if you're a Commodities Trader and you want to trade um you know Asian propane versus US Gulf Coast propane you can't even get started without you know a million a year sunk cost for data and exchange access and lines and everything uh meanwhile crypto you could start with a very small amount that and you can't put a Bitcoin and mem coin barbell on at an institution that's the real output all right guys this is all the time we have give him a round of [Music] applause

we're in adoption phase and we finally enabled Bitcoin to be adopted it's just getting started this is a year many years in the making it's so much pent up demand uh which also means so much of that wealth um spills over into aloins and and mcoins so it's like you like it or not this is the way of the market this is Euphoria levels this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance the onchain defi primitive redesigning derivatives for the def native you'll hear more about perennial later in the [Music] show all right guys welcome to another episode of a THX today we have a special guest that a lot of you probably already know but we're super excited to chat with because he's always got spicy interesting takes for those of you who aren't watching us on YouTube and you're just listening Alex Krueger is literally joining us from inside the Matrix you've got one hell of a setup back there dude that is a that is a lot of screen chart yeah and and to to be honest I have so I have 10 screens right this the whole thing is plastered and uh I'm feeling that I need more screens because to trade something or if I have something on my book that is not like like dust I need to see the chart and just that kind of person right I just need to see the chart all the time and there is some room anymore um D do you have how many things at any moment do you have in your book that you're trading that you need that many charts um I have a hundred right now a lot yeah damn it's now it's like a like Peak like 21 was uh it got to like 70 so how are you managing you know you were saying you had 70 line items during the bare market now you have 100 no no in 21 not the bare Market bare Market bare Market are going to come almost entirely out okay so how do you how do you think about expanding risk in Bull markets and consolidating it and cleaning things up or getting out in bare markets like just broad framework and then we can drill into this particular when things start getting frenzy and I start getting concerned I start consolidating that's simple start consolidating into into into things that are liquid and hedgeable um that I can manage more more quickly without having to scramble around uh I don't think the time is here yet did you have a so in the 22 bare Market were you trading other macro assets as well were you you know hedging crypto length with oil length were you do do you think cross asset or all crypto no I haven't traded oil since uh 2020 um it was still mostly crypto uh since it's been mostly crypto since 2020 and uh it was uh it was mostly Bitcoin and eth basically trying to to like like trading trading trading the the was more short-term trading right uh 21 22 basically to be honest it's like uh I uh I called the bottom a little bit too early uh in uh in in basically end of May so I was away I Was Wrong by uh three weeks uh that was uh that was a very memorable trading experience because I did manage to turn around uh and and uh and trade the dump but it was very hectic and difficult and it did at the beginning cost me a lot of money um I like I remember going into uh into the big dump that started a Friday on on CPI Friday uh I was long to the tits uh on e on top of that um so uh like I spent the rest of the year trying to basically get the bottom and when when failing getting out like like literally like I was like this is it this is it where where we're here and eventually it worked and it paid off but it was very very difficult what are your metrics to determine like why did you think that this this was the bottom I we're talking I assume about May 20 22 post Luna crash yeah exactly was was the Luna crash is it's with the crash was uh people died usually when people die at at such a such a large magnitude uh it's the bottom it's almost always the way it happens we what what we didn't know or I didn't know was that 3ac was about to blow up uh which by the way some people predicted it and if if uh it was a big uh mistake I think from side was not being well informed because you could have known that it was that was that was likely to happen same thing as people were talking when that happened alamaa alamida is is bust people were talking about it yeah remember those rumors but I mean thinking thinking back to then it was it was so hard to to verify those rumors you have you'd have some people say that no yeah there's rumors that they're bust but there's no way that would happen there's no way there's no way there away um was kind kind of it was like being in the fog of War at the time very very hard to very hard to see and understand and get the information that you you wanted but I mean what what you know what were you doing at that time to try to to try to assess the market you know when when you're when you're in when you're when you're in that type of situation here's what were you doing but but what I was doing is talking to people what I what I always do talk to as many people as possible and uh the uh the the the alamida FTX insiders I talk to Insiders on the good term people that work for them um they didn't they didn't know uh they didn't think that was going to happen they thought it was everything was fine so clearly my sources were not right uh I failed to get to the right sources would have made uh quite a bit of uh would have been worth quite a few Millions uh uh getting that right but you know we know how went what about you guys yeah I mean for for me it was it was very very similar you try you try to talk to people but nobody nobody will ever give you information straight up unless they really really really like you you have a very good relationship with them so what I do is when I when I talk to as many people as possible I try to cross reference as many stories as possible are right you know are the people that I think are going to say the same thing saying similar things or are they saying different things uh and then normally in crypto where there's smoke there's fire and so if there just too many occurrences where the people are where the stories don't match up or people are saying slightly different things or there there seems to be some nervousness in the air then you just you just start to start to step away I mean I remember with with I did not in any way shape or form predict or get the FTX B because in my mind at the time time my thought process was hey even if Alam blows up there's no way that Sam would have put FTX at risk it just wouldn't have happened um so I I was just completely caught blinded by that but the the 3ac C issue was the moment they started going around trying to raise money for the gbtc trade again that was that was a huge red flag hey why are you doing this who are you raising it from what the what the hell what the hell is going on do you just need Capital why do you why why are you being so pushy that that was that was a weird one for sure so maybe that's a good sign when you're getting close to a you know a major blowup that's about to occur when you see people who are supposed to be the strong hands in the market doing sketchy weak-handed type stuff um yeah that that's one signal of a bottom Alex I actually uh after the Luna crash I thought I navigated the Luna crash quite well I I sold Luna near the highs it looked ponque got out of that redu risk so I missed that I didn't really get hurt on that dump or only got hurt a little bit that that's like you when I I thought okay there's so much blood on the street now it's it's over like it's time to buy and like you I had to get out of the way of yet another freight train in order in order to stay alive that that was crazy that selloff like it was weird because normally in these things like you know I'm sure you you like I did we we've traded through the 2008 crisis when The Dominoes start to fall they fall pretty quickly just one after another but in this one Luna blew up then 3ac like things just puked funding went insane then everything kind of calmed down we flatlined then like bizarrely out of nowhere 3ac blew up and then there was another month or two of like nothingness and calm when when you could have said all right this is it this is the bottom and then FTX just emulated itself so yeah that was that was tough so basically if if I could paraphrase what you're saying you your your process is to consolidate risk in from many line items into few or zero when things get shaky and volatile and you that's when you start picking up the phone that that's probably good for our listeners to know and when every now and then when things get bad I just get the [ __ ] out like I start scrumbled about this on the pot a little bit just like a toxic risk framework when you look at your book and you're like I'm not I'm not going to try to wait for 10% higher levels like I'm just going to get out of this bad risk it's toxic right now yep like like a good example is FTX like we didn't we didn't need to to we and I didn't need to actually predict it predicting it would have been worth uh [ __ ] out of money uh but uh once it started uh we had so much time to react because we it started at uh it got panicky with Ethan 1500 uh that's that's when it started like it actually I think it started with Ethan like upper 15 so I want to like put the daily uh but uh like he he got bad like Panic at 15s and just kept on going down for it was so so much time to react and and short or hch so uh that's the thing with black swans is is we don't need to actually predicted Black Swan we just need to have it wired as Traders have a like like our our system has to be wired in a way that we can extinctive to react very very fast in a good way just like a tennis player reacts to a to a tough ball in you know in certain places I think that's objective is training ourselves yeah come comes with comes with a lot of a lot of time and practice you know it's hard to it's hard to predict out a month in advance two months in advance three months in advance but once once you see the direction it's heading understanding that switch in the market I mean I I I want to ask I mean speaking of switches in the markets we've got BTC at 73 eth at 4K meme coins are ripping all over the place you have 100 positions in your book I probably have more than I've had in you know a year how how how are you thinking about this in terms of in terms of fro because I mean honestly to me it seems like we're we're getting there to the point where I probably want to start thinking about taking off leg we are at it's same levels I think um there's a cabat that makes it a little bit less insane which is basically if we're looking at funding rates like the the three month annualized fatures basis right now at 25 uh it 25 is crashing levels but if you think about it uh risk-free rates are at five so it's it's actually a it's 20 not 25 or or 21 so it's not as froy as we but it's still really crazy froy Moses are going insane um the thing is the ETF flows are so large and in my opinion they're just beginning that sustains and enables this level of absolute insane degeneracy that's what's happening here um like if you are concerned this this is actually a good place to to take uh uh to basically hedge uh your your spot Holdings using futures or burbs uh to to un hedge uh once it flashes and you know hedging part of it not not not the entire book small percentage actually but uh that being said I think it makes a lot of sense to keep on running uh into the housing at least so yeah things are crazy but things can get crazier and and we make the most money in the in the part where it gets really really [ __ ] crazy so if we're just going Russian of just getting out to protect profits yeah that works but you you you leave most of the money on the table um what do you guys think I so I normally run a very clean crypto book um I don't like to have a lot of line items like you I like to keep it super concentrated and tidy um I have started diversifying like you so I'm just just talk about Bitcoin for a second I am so bullish I can't see straight I think that these ETF flows like you have just begun and I think if you look at some of the metrics on glass node like coin days destroyed or just the far side investors ETF dashboard what you're seeing right now is long-term hodlers of tokens taking some profit at you know all-time highs and they're effectively passing their tokens to the Black Rock ETF which is new long-term holders like people in their retirement accounts who are not going to turn around and sell if we rally another 10 or20 thousand in in Bitcoin so ultimately I think that once you work your way through that you know kind of like hodler selling on the offer which from the CDD metric I just described like you we are doing that like it's it's happening already you're getting through that Supply the next like the really the only seller left is Miners and they're about to get their block rewards cut in half next month so I think that you know we've had 11 billion worth of ETF buying right now the next 11 you know we rallied $30,000 a token on that on that inflow the next 11 billion worth of ETF buying I think could send us up much more than $30,000 a token specifically to your point about how when markets get crazy and parabolic you make most of your money toward the end of that kind of like quadratic looking move and so I've decided that while while the music is playing before it stops and while these ETF inflows continue I am going to be a degenerate and so like I'm I'm I lit up my Phantom wallet which I hadn't touched in a while funded it with like some random like I I had some e flying around from friend Tech I had some Stellar that you know I just cleaned all that [ __ ] up put it into Joe Bowden a couple of days ago um because I thought that that was the the political sort of CounterPoint meme to the Trump uh token which had gone up to you know whatever $400 million market cap like and this thing was trading at 15 million market cap I was like all right I'm just going to go as big as I can on this little shitcoin and I'm just kind of playing around with those things this is the first time I've actively traded crypto in in over a 12 million vol yeah1 12 cents now like I'm getting degenerate which is a sign of how how ripe the opportunity set is like I'm a [ __ ] terrible Trader crypto Trader compared to you guys and uh I think I even I see opportunity at this point I don't know Obby what do you think I I tend to agree with you but I mean that the two simple numbers are that there's six billion of open interest on bance and four billion of open interest on viit and that is short-term capital and that will leave at some point and so once once we stop seeing momentum you will get some level of closing and you will get this to reverse and so what while while I do agree with you that I'm that I'm very bullish I think we're we're we're pretty we're pretty overdue for a 10 15% pullback at this point may maybe maybe more maybe a 20 30% pullback you get these not you know pretty frequently in B markets and so I think it's just important to remember not to get too not to get too over levered uh you know I I think at this point I I'm just playing in spot bags I wouldn't I wouldn't have any leverage on Leverage on my book other than you know what I think of this synthetic leverage through coins um because I'm I am I am nervous I mean basically we have a tremendous amount of uh tremendous amount of build up but that being said I'm conflicted because normally when you break through alltime highs it's a it's a rip Fest and after the yeah the having normally takes a bit though normally takes normally takes one to two months um yep but yeah I mean in in general I'm you know I'm I'm very I'm still I'm still bullish but I'm not you know over over the top I'm I'm definitely very bullish on a bunch of shitcoins though that that that is where I am bullish so Alex you you know you told us about how you trade craziness and and how you trade when shit's hitting the fan in a bare Market how do you trade like pico bull markets where [ __ ] is hitting the fan and we're getting crazy volatile and 30% pullbacks like Obby was just talking about followed by 100% rallies how do you trade that I have no leverage at the moment Leverage is gone uh it's too expensive to to keep to have leverage on the book and uh I'm very worried that a little push uh can drive a very large crash I'm surprised for example yesterday we didn't push further um and um and uh we had uh 13 BTC that minus 133% on on BTC minus 18% uh exactly as eight days ago I was intraday it was insane um I fully agree that we're going to see at some point the thing is it's impossible to to predict when this is going to happen but at some point inflow is going to slow down they may reverse a little bit and then with this build up we get a very large flush um 20% at least um you know I think 35% makes sense because things are really insane wait hang on I have a question for you about that um my way of playing that is like like you guys I'm not levered right now so I'm just going to sit there and take it and hopefully buy a little bit more on a crash um I'm not going to like sell and then try to Reby and dance between the rain drops how are you going to play it i' I've been uh done it in two occasions uh in the last uh uh I hedge X percentage of my book uh basically uh 20 30% um not more because if in case I'm wrong it's too costly to get completely out and uh and then I I rebi on the dip so it's happened twice in the last uh month uh one was uh before uh like right before the uh the 18% flash anath uh eight days ago uh I was waiting specifically to reload at in the 58s or equivalent to another coins uh and uh it didn't hit my bits so I I manually redeployed everything I actually led up and then got the leverage out uh you know in the in the next couple of days and what's what's your signal to Reby is it just when funding collapses back to sort of flattish I'm I'm looking at uh quite a few funding metrics um um funding is too slow I'm not I'm not looking at funding actually because funding resets uh every hour or every eight hours so uh I'm looking at basis that reacts on on I'm looking at second actually uh second chart CME basis uh no buy this because it's more liquidity there I mean that's the main one also C but the main one is vas um then another example is uh on uh Monday night I took off 25% I basically hedged 25% and uh I uh reloaded at the top because it didn't get to where I wanted uh and I was expecting continuation it didn't happen I reloaded at the top so yeah sometimes I buy the top I yeah I bought the top of saan as well so it's working out this episode is brought to you by perennial Finance perennial is quickly becoming one of the go-to derivatives platforms and liquidity layers for all of defi so let me tell you a little bit about them there are kind of three things you need right when you're thinking about a place and a platform to trade on first one great trade execution second one low fees and third of course an onchain permissionless platform and perennial Nails all three of those buckets with the launch of perennial V2 they've made all of that possible by introducing a ton of new features such as faster oracles which reduce trade execution to seconds lower fees competing with major centralized exchanges and minimizing fees for both takers and makers fully modular markets which allow the protocol to support any price feed out there and fourth cash settled right the trades are cash settled in USD not in crypto prenal allows you the trader to gain access to deeper liquidity with only a fraction of the TV how it works is that perennial enables a two-sided Market made up of both Traders and liquidity providers right Traders deposit the assets to get levered exposure while liquidity providers provide these pools of capital to earn fees for taking the other side of the trader position brenal allows you to trade crypto hers FX and coming soon nfts and more backed by some of the best investors in the industry perennial is a must checkout platform if you're a crypto Trader go check them out by clicking the link in in the description give thousand XM credit go check out foren you're going to love them all right let's get back to the show what's your uh what's what what's your view on on the on the cycle now I mean we've had Bitcoin basically lead everything for a while but now on on a day like today where bitcoin's up 2% we seeing Solana up six you know mat mad mad is fin finally doing something do you have do you have you have a view on whether the sto to being a Bitcoin lead rally at at any point in the future no I don't think it's going to happen and I think is going to continue being Bitcoin lead that just spiles onto the other [ __ ] um I also think that if we're going for uh for Red Flags uh we will have already beat out of the market by uh end of January or early February uh because the red flag started long ago and if you want to make an analogy you look at 21 the red flags also started in January so we had a full year of red flags and yeah people all remember is Matt d right uh fortune favors a brave and that crap at the end the cycle and uh remembers the November 21 insane dock run but that was not the first it was a was a dodge run before right so um it's it's tough like it's really tough going in and out based on based on uh like metrics and and and flags and uh so I think it's it's better to to spread it uh one thing I wanted to talk about is which because it's very related is on the ETF side why we're early uh the reason why we're early is that the institutional sales machine is not yet fully deployed it's According to some estimates it's deployed up to 20% only and they're looking to basically rump it up viig time into year end what does that mean uh the the sales machine it's if we think about it like how does the plumbing work on the ETF side uh you have ETF buyers are basically retail and discount platforms you have institutional guys and you have Wealth Advisors right the wealth advisors they are divided in basically two or three tranches depending how you look at it uh you have what is called the warehouses merly HS uh and and those and Morgan stally and those guys and then you have the RAS which then are split into the uh the the independent ones and the non-independent ones uh like the non-independent ones are like Edward Jones Wells Fargo advisors um and um the um the uh what happens there is these these guys are they're very slow they're very slow in in starting to to promote uh an an ETF to to their people so they need to see track record uh they need to see minimum a they need time this is needs to get approved so uh yeah we've seen a headlines of basically for example in the last two weeks of mar leech and UBS uh they're saying they will start offering the uh the ETF to their clients this is just starting uh so we're we're very far off from on the warehouse side for basically the the the the entire sales institutional Sales Machine to be in place and pushing ETFs to the people that actually want is not they're shoving it up their throats people actually want it people are calling Mar and say hey do you have the ATF the Bitcoin Bitcoin I want Bitcoin what do you think the Bitcoin is it a good investment like that kind of stuff um I think I think there are $30 trillion of client assets under management across all of the different wealth manager verticals you just you just mentioned there the wirehouses the like semi-independent shops then the like the little Boutique places uh like a a guy will just hang a shingle and like manage manage other people's money from home like $30 trillion you said you think we're 20% of the way through that like I I would have put us at like less than what I think is what I no it's not on it's not on a basis it's on um Machinery how oh okay what what percentage of the Salesforce of people that push ETFs is already enabled have has the the tech and the materials and the and the approval from from risk to actually push it so it's not my estimate actually it's an estimate I just heard uh and I had it from a couple sources that we are 20% there and uh the the the ETF guys are thinking we going to be at 80% by year at wow so if that's true which I believe it to be true uh that means that when we get get the leverage flush that is going to happen at some point uh uh like minus 20 minus 35 we'll see you go balls in uh and uh hopefully if you're a Trader you manage to hedge some of it so you can you can deploy extra uh the risk for those of us who are already in the market is if it happens too fast and we can't hatch you know because if you're if you're really bullish beyond the immediate term I it's already dropped 10% while you were asleep what do you do yeah you just wake up to a down 15% candle you're not going to be like well let me sell now to Reby it yeah 10% lower yeah it's it's very difficult and as markets melt up like the NASDAQ in 1999 or you know Bitcoin in 2024 things get very volatile so it's sort of becomes both easier and harder to to spot trading opportunities um I would say how how are you positioning in the meme coins right now I think that's like the the summer that we're going to have it's going to be a meme summer there's going to be a hat on the sphere in Vegas maybe that's a red flag for you maybe that's a bullish signal curious to hear what you think about about that sort of I have a large Dodge position which I wish it were whiff to be honest but it's Dodge and uh I have I have a few shits you know guys if you can like I I can uh I don't know have puff um on Mel uh I'm on uh Jensen I just tweeted about replying to one of your tweets uh uh I'm thinking of Jensen as it's like a Bowen play right it's Oh you mean uh Jensen hung yeah it's the envidia CIO oh dude I I this this happened to me so I bought it's funny story for you guys I bought some slug of Joe Bowden like a day after it came out and then as a result of me buying that the creator of that Jensen hung coin just aird dropped gifted me some Jensen hung he Dr aird dropped me like 15,000 units and it was worth I don't know 10 15 20 cents I was like wow this is funny it's you know Jensen hang's face on that giant uh well hung covid meme dude uh that's funny haha whatever I forgot about it and I checked my Phantom wallet a couple days ago and it was worth $15 so it literally 100x in a week like this is just happening left and right this is the craziest Market I've ever [ __ ] seen um it's it's it's wild the zin the Zin position that I bought two months ago on the recommendation of a friend I put in 1K and I checked my wallet just ripped and now people are sending me things like monkey getting haircut on Sal like honestly it's kind of funny this is called the Thousand X podcast and bitcoin's not in a thousand X come rocket is what's going to thousand X so we're in that kind of Market I guess I just put just put monkey monkey get a haircut in the in the chat you guys want to take a look at this thing it's it's got It's got potential we're we're all we're all dumbing ourselves down but that's where the money is it's it's also I I don't think we're dumbing our elves down like here's how I thought about it I was like all right it's time to mess around in meme coins like let's just give this a try so I saw that Trump had gone to you know multi- hundreds of millions market cap and I thought all right you know it's like a casino it's like a form of betting on something it's not just a dogcoin or a frog coin I didn't really get those in the previous cycle I'm not I'm not a doge Master like you guys but I was like okay political things so then there was a Biden token which was trading at you know tiny market cap relative to Trump and I'm like well this seems undervalued so I bought it and then I saw Joe Bowden come out and I just burst out laughing because it was the funniest meme I'd ever seen I'm like all right I get it now basically the uh the people in crypto hate Joe Biden because he's part of the party that you know tried to regulate crypto out of existence and this is like the Counterpoint to the Trump token that clowns on him and so there's going to be a community around that and it's a form of of political gambling and so I sold all my Biden swapped it into Bowden added other stuff into Bowden and now that I've actually used Phantom to trade meme coins on Solano I'm like I I don't want to dumb I don't want to treat this as dumbing myself down like this is the best casino I've ever played it's way better than roulet or Blackjack it's way more fun there's more to it things 100x your odds are better like I think there's some this might actually be a real use case which is just like hyper like F1 speed uh gambling on stuff you know yeah I agree my framework is I only uh I only buy uh meme coins where I can talk to the founders or the team sometimes it's not a Founder it's just a team um because it's it's too easy for insiders to basically um Take the Money and Run um so it's it's actually it's been costly uh because of like passing on most meme coins but my framework is starts the beginning it's like that's the fil if I don't have access to talk to whoever is the team or whoever is controls most of the supply controls the social media I don't want to touch it uh then there are exceptions once things get very large I mean do doesn't count anymore with is is beyond it uh Pepe is beyond it so then then that's different so it's kind of like separating between the large caps and uh and the small caps interesting this this can be very complicated like like study who is who is holding when they bought uh are there snipers in uh is can you look at the holder analysis like how many snipers are there holding um um who is is it old money or is it new money is it people that are sitting on on a on a 300X or is it people that sitting on a 2X uh how do you do this analysis are you just sitting there with like ether scan and an abacus like moving Beats around or using some nanson Pro or something a little bit more advanced it's uh it's ether scan you don't you don't need nanson for that okay yeah um I would think that it's like when I look at a dogcoin with a multi-billion dollar market cap I think of it as just random noise and I I've never figured out how to trade the mega caps but I do feel like if you get into something early enough it's just a pretty excellent call option um yeah I agree now now now most most of these coins go to zero like like 99 over 99% they they retraced in full so it it is a fun casino but it's it's not easy so do you have do you build in like a ratchet type mechanism where for example you buy a meme coin then it 3x's do you like take your initial investment out so that if it goes to zero you're protected or do you you like to go all in well the thing is if I get to a mcoin I get in early usually um so is there a level where you take anything out um it's no no usually I just write to valala uh on that side it's I treat it as a as a lottery ticket uh so often round trip them also the thing is when you are uh when you are are getting into coins where you know the founders it's hard to sell because you're you're just [ __ ] with people you know uh it's uh you know it's some somebody launches a coin and then uh you get in because uh you know you get in early because you're a friend and they know you and then uh you know it goes up 10x and you just dump it all it's not nice so it's it's a matter of relationships right so yeah I I I most more often than not I roundt trip all my mimon games that's a sad reality so so what percentage of your 70 line items would you say are memes right now um there's 100 line items sorry uh F uh four five let's see one two three four I I've I used to look at this type of trading and [ __ ] on it and now I'm like having so much fun that it just reacts your coin just reacts since since we started recording and it's not live otherwise I would think that it's actually the the listeners that are pumping it no no I mean not Financial advice all this [ __ ] is going to zero probably but um I mean to be completely honest I can't remember a time where mean Co have done this just across across the board I mean normally you have you you have you have specific concentrations right so you you used to have the meme coins pop off for each ecosystem and then the dexes pop off for each ecosystem and the you know so for example when avac said that they were going to be investing uh you know they were going to raise an ecosystem fund that their coins would pop off that it would be the salonic coins and the coins and blah blah blah and it would sort of go in this ecosystem cycle now it's a little bit of just a free-for-all it's just you you just launch a accin with a funny name and it just goes up you know the the concept of a Joe Bowden didn't really it wasn't really there in 2020 2021 as much as it is today I mean this is definitely you know in the grand scheme of things of golden ER of meme coins we're going to look back on this time as you know the Canam rate explosion but if so so so I gu I guess what I'll say is that normally in historic cycles and I don't know whether it's the right thing to compare this but in historic Cycles things tend to get crazier after the alltime high break not not into the alltime high break that's not when they're the craziest so I in theory we have a lot more to go will this cycle be I'm question for both you guys will this this cycle be a meme coin summer or will we have will we be over mem coin soon and we'll be on to like The Narrative summer like AI coins or something I think we just continue we we already had an AI summer um winter whatever what I call it I think we're going to have another one uh I think U main coins will cool down and then we're going to have another one I'm I'm in more on the uh I'm on the super cycle uh uh thing that basically this just keeps them going we're in adoption phase and we finally enabled uh Bitcoin to be adopted it's just getting started this is a year many years in the making it's so much pent up demand uh which also means so much one of so much of that wealth um spills over into altcoins and and mincoin so it's like you like it or not this is the way of the market and also it's like launching wcoins is so easy so do you consider some other alternative l1s like near or salana or eth to be the next thing that's going to go best risk for W for you it's is not no for me is okay I missed near near already run uh near kind of like re re re labeled as the AI chain um so uh it's already run I I want to buy a poolback uh not here by the way it's something I wanted to say it's like I'm here is and I I'm not buying new [ __ ] I'm like redeploying from some [ __ ] to other [ __ ] Market is too hot to to be putting new money like the thing is I got I got here all the way from the bottom to the top full long if you didn't if that's not you you don't put money here I think here is you you wait for that pullback and just eat it up and be patient otherwise you're going to get [ __ ] it's a matter of basically having a framework is uh this is Euphoria levels yeah I would I would agree with that pretty pretty wholeheartedly we're we're at the kind the kind of interesting thing though is that for for a lot of a lot of coins were not at Euphoria levels yet it's sort of just BTC so I think there's a reasonable scenario where you know BTC can sell up to 65k and Dogecoin can double in that time as as people as people rotate I mean I I it's it's sort of hard to say like I think Bitcoin the RR for BTC is tough but the r for everything else is it's okay I mean do is up less than Etc uh you know since since October it looks like so kind of nuts H would wouldn't have expected that that's for sure I mean it makes sense when when retail like I I just read that um um it may have been something you post Jonah that um volume on C on crypto exchanges are 25% from 2021 levels so yeah yeah there is a lot of Leverage coming in we are all like a lot of people in crypto lever to the tit but the the old the there's so many people that are still haven't come back and they will come back and when they come back they're going to look out and uh they going they not going to buy Bitcoin they're going to buy whiff and bong and Dogecoin on coinbase yeah Alex is there is there a price level where you look at it and you just say all right after this I'm out I'm selling half myself um I was thinking uh to sell 40% at 75 uh was pretty close no no but that was that was before the price action made me change my mind because every time we flash we just buy back up so that tells me that we we continue uh so yeah it's it's my my targets are really they they change um uh right now I'm thinking uh also like possibly at 85 um yeah the answer is I don't have I I don't operate with with levels like that do you generally generally yes just for the simple reason of it helps enforce discipline but I I always have the right to Reser my you know CH change my mind what I what I try to do is I try I try to just check my bias of when I set the level and I've revised it upwards two or three times yeah you know that that that's that's generally a danger zone um so so right now I mean basically what I'm thinking is any anywhere from 90k to 100K I'm scaling out substantial amounts but other than that just both times for the [ __ ] ride in um in crude oil when I'm super bullish or super bearish usually I don't set price levels to get in or out I set levels of uh levels associated with fundamental data that drives crude oil so like I'll say all right I'm going to exit my crude oil length when Refinery margins drop below a certain level or I'm going to buy as much oil as I can when I see XYZ happening at OPEC like external fundamental data in crypto I'm attempting to monitor this this this is like my first time getting a a crazy bull swing right in crypto and I would say I'm gonna I'm trying to apply the Commodities framework uh and I'm not going to look at bitcoin's price as a signal for when to get out I'm going to look at metrics onchain metrics like mvrv Z or um you know maybe a little bit something a little bit more uh qualitative um like the Matt Damon Brave commercial when that [ __ ] starts coming back maybe it's time to get out I'm not going to try to set price levels because that feels kind of arbitrary um you know for the reasons you just mentioned Alex I don't know what do you think of that on on on that two things one is crew doesn't have that dry tail because it doesn't move enough for for returns to be truly exponential I mean that's um so it makes more sense to use fundamentals and on top of that is kind of like varying extreme circumstances it just ranges it's a wide range but it's been ranging for 20 well in for 15 years right uh we leave aside that that 2014 dump and we leave side the 2020 and it's a ranging asset so it makes more so like getting out when things uh when when fundamental metrics tell you to get out it's okay because you don't you're not going to miss uh uh 400% right uh and um on the other uh a way to to tackle this uncertainty around where to get out uh I think better than that is using fun rates and just matter of feeling the market and when regularly you go and you take off a little bit just a little bit off the table either by selling or by hedging so when that correction comes you are psychologically in a very good place to manage risk and decide if you sell more or you buy back or you buy back and put leverage on so that also takes away the need for for picking the the top we don't know the thing is we don't know if if that's going to be a local top or a global Top This is that it we have no [ __ ] idea um we can have exceptions when very very extraordinary things happen such as the FED changing dramatically their view on the market or say uh there is uh like a major war like like Russia and Ukraine things like that are really extreme and then you go like [ __ ] it I'm out of this or FTX you know you you start hearing about FTX it's like like I don't care if it's local top Global what I'm out so G given that uncertainty just by applying that is kind the way I think about it is like playing an accordion so the accordion always has air inside and you're just playing and you inflate and deflate and inflate and deflate and you always keep in a bull market x amount of air in there at way know and then you take it out and then you put it back in and just keep comp play so you're trading around your position trading around positions yeah very very constantly yeah definitely a smart way of doing it requires a lot of energy and focus uh which we know you have I guess one one question for you Market structure-- wise why is basis and funding so extreme right now you would think that now that the ETF exists any pool of capital in the world like 20% IR is an amazing percentage to earn if if you're you know a fund manager or just anyone running money so why wouldn't somebody just go and buy the Black Rock ETF sell the CME future in infinite size and collect that that basis like why why does that exist now that there's no barriers to entry and the ETFs have debottleneck access to the sort of the long Bitcoin leg of the basis trade well we have we have ass basically if it's it's us getting getting te levered except none of us are running leverage it must not be us but people like no but people like us like our circles uh you know it's the uh uh the crypto natives the people who've been around for a long time um that basically also most of them I'm pretty sure they miss the bottom and uh they miss the beginning and they miss the middle and they they they're getting in there's a lot of people getting in with size uh levered up uh starting on the 50s you know out of homo uh what you're saying why I mean it's a good question I think the um I don't have uh the D answer but I think it's it's a matter of it takes time to put those traes on in infinite size uh you need to go and raise funds uh put the legal structure uh get the approvals and eventually you go and you start putting it on now let's put it this way if everybody was thinking that basis was going to compress down to zero well what do you do well you don't try to put a legal structure or you don't you you're not prepared to put the trade on because you don't expect the trade to to be available now that trade is available well we have to be thinking there is people who are working behind the scenes to put that trade in an infinite size and it's going to happen eventually it's going to happen that makes sense I I I agree with your point I think a lot of on on the on the first part of that is uh a lot of people missed this run up a a a lot of people W weren't weren't allocated as fully as they you know were supposed to and I think uh that that stems from the fact that there was a lot of you know there's just a lot of fear during the bare market and it sort of to changeed Something in people's minds where in 2021 people would be 100 to 150% exposed and they would feel normal and after the bare Market I think a lot of Crypton natives especially given the wealth that they had wanted to preserve it so they were 30 to 50% allocated to the market 60% allocated to the market and only it recently has that shift in the mind again okay 150% I need to be there I need to go back so that that that that that's why I do get a little bit worried yeah and and also it's like why is all this meme thing happening as well it's not only because it's easy now right Solana makes it so easy but at the same time is you miss most of the move but you still have significant wealth sitting on your crypto so sadly you feel rich at the same time you feel formal you're like [ __ ] I missed both of it what the [ __ ] do I do okay let's long Avalanche you know I think we're seeing that now I mean this is this is this is this is when Majors catch up you know when when people really do have that fumo they go [ __ ] why that's why M madic actually looks pretty nice just just from that from that trade from that structure barely up off the bottom everybody you know people are people are going to Pile in then they're going to start rotating to the things that they know they they missed the memes they miss BTC now it's time for the majors um also sold it's uh I think as as soon as this FTX uh uh deal the the FTX lock Soul deal it's it's closer to getting done Soul flies all the way up to their alltime highs straight line yeah when do you think that selling is finished um I understand they started about three weeks ago and they're done they're 50% done that's my understanding I I may be wrong but that's my understanding so a few more weeks yeah I mean if you take away selling pressure on salana right now there's some explosive upside potential there that's something that I've been underp positioned on this entire rally and I feel that's where I feel fomo I feel stupid especially now that I'm using it and I realize how good the experience is although like I what I still can't wrap my head around is how like like basically zero gas fees translates toonomic wise to to you know market cap and value but I think I'm midc curving it when I when I go up that mental pathway because it's a MCO at the end if we're doing a if we're valuing Solana on on a a PE basis it's insanely overvalued like I I stopped checking but it must be a p on the thousands right now yeah so me meanwhile Joe bodic solid fundamentals solid PE no I'm joking um do you have do you think at some point there's been one notable underperformer this whole rally it's been ethereum the ethereum ecosystem the high gas fees the absence of meme coinery there and the nfts going on inside of of uh ethereum do you think that an e ETF is going to be like a big sort of catapult event for that ecosystem and that token price or do you think that it's gonna lag this whole rally well I don't expect that ETF until next year MH um when that happens yeah uh the question is when does the market start FR running it I don't know when that's going to happen um but yeah once once once that happens uh it should outperform massively but uh yeah like also it's uh I don't expect it that the market has been changing its odds uh from basically 60% uh uh or a little bit higher at the end of the year at the beginning of the year uh to like more like uh 40% right now uh maybe even 30 uh it's tough to look at those those metrics um because they are those implied odds they're basically that we taken from poly Market which is a tiny tiny tiny tiny Market so determining the odds of a massive multi-billion dollar market based on the odds of a tiny one it's kind of like uh maybe better to to be using options for that which is something I haven't done use options to try to to determine what are the the true implied odds of the ETF now if somebody's doing that I would love to see the analysis we uh we we we we appreciate you coming on for for the part this is a fun one uh cool guys yeah I think we covered oh yeah [Music] basically

Transcript Text:
welcome back to the first THX podcast recorded with Bitcoin above $50,000 y because the last time we recorded Bitcoin was hovering I think it was hovering right below like right below like 49 979 and that it broke and that as we talked about it broke you actually had a little bit of time you know solid amount of time once it broke realize and it broke sat there and then you go buy it which I advocated for because I think that's generally the best s adjusted way to to play these things if you're a Trader now Jonah on the other hand is just an absolute gigachad with balls of steel and so has just been sitting massively long Bitcoin for the entire time and telling everybody not to sell because why would anybody sell with this many flows are coming into this asset and as always Jon was Vindicated he was right not not as always so n you like I I had to I had to give you something Jonah thank you listen I am this this this is this is a big this is a big win we're sitting at 63k right now um Bitcoin is obviously leading the charge eth is eth is catching up I think this has been an amazing amazing amazing run I think for the first time I'm exercising a bit of caution just because it's been so insane and you have alltime high Bitcoin Futures open interest you have a tremendous amount of fro in the market you have a long money flowing into alts I think if there were any point to at least if you're 100% long get to 90 is a good point to start taking off some length in my humble opinion especially as we approach alltime highs so I'm For the First Time really thinking hey this has been a crazy run maybe it's time to cut back go to the barbell strategy instead of being super Bitcoin heavy you're alt heavy and cash heavy Jon what do you think about that um I don't want to be cash heavy I'm still all in on this uh but I trade less actively than you so I think if we're going to try and if we're going to try and monetize like some of the chop around here because you know as markets it doesn't matter whether you're talking about crude oil crypto or the price of bananas right when markets start to melt up uh they get really volatile and the pullbacks get severe now I'm not watching crypto tick for tick every day anymore like I used to I think you're right like if you are watching it tick for tick might pay to lighten up and then buy one of the inevitable Savage dips that happens amidst this sort of upside volatility um but in terms of being cash heavy I I I wouldn't want to be cash heavy like I'm still so bullish I I can't see straight and I think this thing is going to 100K do you think that it's it's going to 100 100K promptly I mean what what's your what what's your view here I mean how do you think yes these ETF inflows are sustainable we've had crazy crazy crazy crazy inflows they're Mega you you go to The Far Side investors ETF tracker page it's like 500 mil a day and it just isn't stopping and you know it's like it's just like your dentist your you know your grandpa your your doctor they're all just buying it uh because now they can and we talked about this on the podcast you know six months ago we talked about how the ETF launch was not a front runnable event because there wasn't enough capital in this Niche weird you know self- custody little token space to front run what would get de bottlenecked by ETFs and institutional asset flows and and you know broader retail and so far we're being proven right and to me it's like the having hasn't even happened yet like the minor selling is going to is has to slow down um it's maybe the minors are hanging on to BTC right now now to sell after the having after some expected melt up so maybe it doesn't melt up as fast as you expect but like come on that's you know what three and an eth BTC per block less forever I I just I can't I can't imagine lightening up before that unless the plan is literally to you know trade around the volatility I do think you know if you're 100% long you should take a bit of a bit of profit but not I mean Jonah Jonah thre Monon Futures are now paying out 20 % on BTC I think 177% on eth yeah that is massive and generally historically even if you've had a tremendous amount of interest in this in this asset class that has been the start of the end because when there's that much leverage and that much Euphoria what you tend to get is you tend to get reflexivity towards the downside so no matter how many inflows are coming in no matter how much is unlocked when you have that amount of leverage in the system you get these nasty pullbacks and it scares people off from buying and I think what I'm what I'm trying to say is one you can't put yourself in a position to be carded out right now because this is a this is this is a more likely time than ever to experience a 30% pullback and so you have to manage your risk super tightly here like ridiculously tightly and I think the best way to do that is to be allocated to alts that you think can run or that you're comfortable with long term because I do think capital is going to rotate out of BTC but being a 150% long BTC here is no longer The Right Move we're at actually a 40K you can make an argument for it at 25k obvious I think it was a simple argument at 40K a little bit harder now I don't think you can make an argument for it I don't think there's an argument even to be 100% allocated right now the BTC I think the argument is to be 80% right and that's by the way that's still super bullish that's still ridiculously bullish from my perspective no no it's you're you're absolutely right I agree with you what what I was saying I think we're we agree but maybe I I didn't express my point clearly enough I think it if you're running like tons of Leverage here yeah you should start to get careful because the the V is about to get insane and you there will be some big draw downs but if you're just long 100% Max long allocated cash only no l average you can wear you can wear a 50% draw down I mean look on on crypto Twitter everybody everybody is so like insanely bullish gloating Victory lapping right now it the fear and greed index is Max greed um hasn't been here since 21 you know in 2021 when we hit these prices in in May uh the first thing that happened obvious is a 50% pullback right just a Savage brutal 50% sell off to 30k followed by a rip roaring explosion to all-time highs my personal trading strategy because I don't use leverage um I if it goes to 30k I'm just GNA buy more um especially if it happens before the habing and I'm I'm not going to panic but if you're 150% long and you're going to panic if if that happens yeah you better be lightening up right now and to your second point about the rotation to alts I'm seeing some really compelling arguments on Twitter that we're not going to get that rotation into all this cycle you would know better than me you've seen multiple Cycles this is still kind of my first one um but this cycle we're not going to see rotation to alt because this is just ETF money coming in and it's not dgen money trying to play frog coins you're you're on mute by the way that is a lie that is such a degenerate stupid lie I cannot stand it when people say this I will actually whoever tweets this you have the brain of a monkey and like one of those small tiny monkeys not like a gorilla because gorillas can get to 70 IQ you are like a negative IQ human and I will explain this in the most simple terms it doesn't matter because it if Bitcoin goes up the people that held bit there are a lot of Crypton native people that have held Bitcoin and those people will rotate out of Bitcoin they will rotate out of Bitcoin and Retail will come back in it is just a matter of time meme coins will pump chit coins will pump of course alts are going to go up now the question is what alts now historically the answer was it would go from Bitcoin to large cap alts to midcap alts to small cap alts now here's why you know these monkeys have some point but they're still incorrect that type of rotation might not happen as much because there is less capital that is just coming directly into crypto rails that is buying Bitcoin and so they're less likely to filter down the risk curve indiscriminately what's most likely to happen is that the people that are already allocated the original the original crypto ns are going to take their money that they made on bitcoin and they're going to rotate out into the smaller caps and into the quality stuff that they like so the crypto Insider coins crypto native coins are probably going to do well as people rotate out your average midcap and you're kind of seeing this madic has been a bit disappointing avac post the M major Rally's been disappointing salana after the major rally has been disappointing while Bitcoin has ripped and but what hasn't been disappointing are the meme coins and the AI coins and the reason is because you nailed that by the way you called for the AI coins to Rally you you nailed that one so Props Jonah speaking of nailing things what did we talk what was the one literally the one specific thing that we talked about on the previous podcast is the SEC getting blown the out and then coins related to SEC judgments doing well guess what's doing well all of defi coinbase stock like the coins that the SEC were trying to strangle now are ripping and that's going to continue and so again the these are the types of things that I'm looking for I'm not looking to buy your madx of the world I'm not looking to buy your salanas I'm not looking to buy your I mean for sure never a cosmos but basically the large caps oh I'm going to rotate down the rist curve I think that I'm GNA put aside and I'm GNA say the key is to find what the crypto natives are going to get into AI obviously a huge bucket defi I think a a good bucket especially now with the the uh the talk about turning on fees and the lack of the SEC coming down and then in the crypto uh in in the in the ETF world it's possible that people go and rotate from the ETFs down the risk curve maybe they're going to go buy e maybe they're going to go buy coinbase stock the one thing that I cannot explain that I would love for anybody listening to this to comment on if they have some sort of explanation on this why is mstr ripping it doesn't I was under MST is trading right now at a 50% premium to its Bitcoin holding I was always under the impression that after the ETF got launched that that premium would collapse because people were only buying MCR to replicate Bitcoin exposure but for some reason msdr is still ripping that's a weird one no yeah I think it's weird too honestly I think that's that's an anomaly another one is I didn't expect CME Futures to trade at a 20% premium uh to spot after the ETF launch because now any trafi guy can show up Buy you know I bit the Black Rock ETF short the CME future and collect basically risk-free Arbitrage money I I do I do not for the life of me know why that money is there leverage capital is not that expensive leverage shouldn't trade at that kind of a premium to what is now like totally trafi railed Bitcoin and it it that doesn't make sense to me the mstr thing doesn't make sense to me um and in terms of your your thesis about uh your thesis about all I agree with it I was looking at I rarely do this but I I actually felt stupid looking at dollar sign magga the Trump coin like how the did I not see that one coming you know like it's dude of course so one thing that I did by the way is but but I bought a bunch of the Trump nfts because one you get to have dinner with the Donald and obviously I want to get dinner with the Donald that's that's just a meme in itself I'm going to whisper in his ear to buy all my shitcoins the second thing is you can resell them and they're such a good play on the Trump presidency which I'm particularly bullish on so I think he's win and I think it's going to be very Pro crypto and I think it's going to get very Mimi and pep Bay and all this I just my like my theory to your point Obby is my favorite altcoin is like crypto punks I think that I'm mulling buying another Punk and I think the reason why is um you just watch punks and apes start gassing higher on this it the longer crypto sustains this rally the more being invested in crypto is going to become a cool symbol of social status again like uh there are rumors out there that um Bernard Arno the ltmh Tycoon his son who runs Tiffany's is bidding one of the alien punks like it's if you show up to a date in New York with a a salana saga phone like it's not necessarily guaranteed that you're going home without getting laate anymore right like these these sort of crypto status symbols are are kind of I think they're going to start coming back and it's going to be okay to be invested in crypto again Jonah you ever you ever seduce your wife in the punk that's the TW for you no no definitely not but um I I think that I I think that for many people there there will be some status attached to crypto again if this like let's say that Bitcoin slingshots past 100K sure it may go to 30k first but if it sling shots past 100K before the end of next year like you're you're cool if you've got if you've got crypto you're not you're not a pariah anymore you're not getting laughed out of the room so yeah the the the the nft flux is coming back in a large way and I'm actually pretty excited to see it happen I think that it's going to be I think that's going to be a very very good investment I mean you know me and my ether rocks I love my ether rocks I think they're an amazing Flex super expensive nft not everybody can afford them the group chat is lit you get access to all these all the all these people but the reality of the situations that what's a rock cost I love that they're all floors they're they're all just as shitty as each other um what what what is it no no no no no no no they're they're they're they're different there's regular rocks and then there are blue rocks and Red Rocks so there are slightly there there are variations on the Rock Jonah please you know educate yourself before talking otherwise you just sound dumb I I'm I'm not afraid to sound dumb so that other people who listen to us can become smarter like I will sacrifice myself on Twitter or on it's very that's very kind of you you know it really comes from a selfless place in your heart what what's what's the floor what's the basic Rock cost underneath 200 200th is a floor damn right now that's an auto glyph to get in yeah to get into the Rock Club because they are 100 it's the second ever nft created get you access to an exclusive club and the reality is go to some private island and make out with each other or how does it work look I can't comment on that there's you know there are a lot of Nas that have been signed so no no ability all I'll say is if you go to my Twitter profile and you check the dner it's accurate it's accurate that's what we do the war room now it's the yeah it's the War Room exactly so what I'll say about the rocks are that they are just a pure form of flex and the pure nft flexes I think will do well and the art I think will do well the squiggles the auto autog glyphs the fenzza the punks that stuff is going to do well I do think there's going to re there's going to be a boom again of people trying to Launch nfts I think that that's probably not going to go so well I think what you're going to see is you're going to see more established actual artists release nfts you're going to see Brands release nfts and that's going to be where a lot of the a lot of the value cruise I mean even Trump right Trump's releasing nfts and that there's actually some interest in these things and I think that shows you the direction of the of the nft market so if I'm allocating right now I definitely want my I definitely want nft exposure because I'm bullish on eth but I'm not so bullish on eth that I want to hold a ton of eth directly so I like nfts because they have two Tailwinds if eth goes up they prob they probably go up in aggregate because all the nfts I'm talking about are effectively issued on eth they're the older ones and then the second thing is that they do have like that that that Tailwind it's basically the eth tailwind and then the nft tailwind and I think that's I think that's good and I like the E Tailwind but I'm not super confident on the E Tailwind it's very possible at this point Ethan e ETF gets denied or gets punted or the comes up with some ridiculous argument as to why eth is a security and therefore blah blah blah there needs to be litigation and this and this and this and that and we have to well if xrp isn't a security how how sorry if xrp isn't a security how could eth be a security I I don't know if you're asking such amazing logical questions but it's the same question as hey I mean look the SEC jumped the shark when they made the argument that we can't allow a Bitcoin spot ETF because the Bitcoin spot markets are manipulated but we can allow a Bitcoin Futures ETF that settles to a spot reference rate because we can monitor the right they just completely jumped the shark with that argument it's so obvious logically flawed that I wouldn't I I just don't put anything past them the only thing that gives me hope as we've talked about in the past is that these guys have just been blown out so many times trying to come after crypto obious not okay so my opinion on the SEC like Gary gendler has gotten so dadded it's embarrassing they've filed like a 100 lawsuits that are nearly identical lost the first 10 of them the other 90 are going straight down the toilet like they should be ashamed of themselves but here's the thing Obby like this is why I think we're only in phase one of the triple whammy here the hat trick of crypto 2024 first thing that happens is the B BTC ETFs lands second thing is the having third thing Trump's gonna win right and then what is what happens when Gensler and the entire SEC gets sent packing and we go back to this like low or no regulatory regime with a crypto friendly nft issuing like Maniac president like I think it could get pretty degenerate up in here and I don't even know if they have time to start denying ETFs because they're probably all looking for other jobs right now because they're about to get sent home out of Washington DC so like that that's the bullish that's the most honestly more bullish than the having and more bullish than the ETFs the thing that nobody is talking about is the single greatest headwind to crypto the headwind that with both you and me in our in our you know recent crypto careers is about to get rinsed they're about to get they're literally about to take their own medicine the these guys at the SEC even even if Biden wins re-election like they've they've been so chastened by all of these losses and if if Trump wins like they're all just gone and so to me I think that's that's the most bullish kind of like medium-term Catalyst for crypto and and I don't think they have bullets to like start these new like two to threee campaigns against eth or anything else I I think the regulatory headwinds are just kind of like waning for now and it's it's underpriced that is such a bullish rant Jona I and I 100% agree with you and I'm so excited to see this see this play out which is why again basically anything that's been attacked by the SEC such a good buy right now because I think it's I think it's very I think it's still even now underpriced like look at the per look at look at the perk Platforms in objective look at dydx snx Uni all these guys underpriced I still think so because they're no longer under Target of SEC now here's here's what I'll say is that doesn't mean that the EF is a gim it doesn't and that I think is a big risk to the market still and that would hurt alt in alt in the short term I think you know there there needs to be some investigation on what the timelines are for this because because I I do think it's important at the same time my personal view is that we're coming up close to the end of the Bitcoin rally relative to the alt rally so if you look back at 2020 2021 when Bitcoin first breaks all on high it tends to rip and then after the first blowoff after the alltime high break is when the alts come out to play but you don't necessarily want to try to time that perfectly you kind of want to get out slowly from Bitcoin into alt because you can never get it perfectly so if you're for example in a hypothetical portfolio 100% btz 0% alss at alltime highs you probably want to be a80 BTC 20 Al every 10% after that 5% 10% you're shuffling more into alts shuffling more shuffling more shuffling more then on the blowoff if you can trade that fine but generally what tends to happen is that blowoff BTC does badly but what you'll see is you'll see alts actually do okay that's your sign when there's a blowoff on BTC and Al actually do okay post alltime High break boom alt season shove in watch watch BC pairs yeah by the way you're only you're probably in for like two to three weeks and no more no more on that two to three weeks take it and then get out uh and that's that's sort of my plan right now when it comes to when it comes to True when it comes to trading this Market it's I think now is a very difficult time to be a passive investor in this market so my uh my general take is it's actually okay to be very passive during bare markets because you're just accumulating and you're finding you know the right allocation and generally what you want to do is you slow right you're just just dodging now it's the bull market you you can you can lose a lot of money very quickly if you're not clipping profits and so you have to just the way to do this in my opinion without blowing up your whole portfolio and roundt tripping everything because at some point we will have another 80% draw down it's just a matter of time is to just set levels to take profit and then set aside that cash and then just don't get back into the market with that cash right and that's how I've outperformed over the last three Cycles is when Bitcoin is 80k or 90k 100K what's the probability that we're 30 40 50 60% below that price again at some point in the future it's actually pretty high my personal opinion thein trades 100K I'm not going to be more than 50% exposed to the market it's I'm just going to be slowly chipping out because the reality is you have to detach yourself from this you can't get caught up in the Euphoria you can't get caught up in the craziness just right now take out a book a notebook and write down your targets whatever your portfolio is worth write down your targets write down your targets for your for your coins and that is your guide book and you just pay attention to it just pay attention to it and don't get CAU up in the and the worst thing that you and I see this happen over and over your one coin hits your target you sell out what do you do you buy another coin don't do that no no no cash so let me ask you a question Obby I we've got our thesis on bitcoin we've got our thesis on alss and when to rotate in and out um eth is a weird one it's kind of in the middle of that sandwich right and my investment thesis for eth is that at worst even if some other L1 like salana just kills it once and for all it's always going to kind of stick around as like the Legacy artwork chain with cultural significance and relevance and like the Zeitgeist of the the early 2020s so I think that use case alone just sort of preserving these important cultural artifacts is worth you know after another bull cycle or two like over the long run half a trillion dollars right but then man I'm just I'm just not interested in eth no no no but but let me finish let me finish so that's the worst case scenario over the medium to long term for me then there's let's let's talk about the use cases for crypto if even one of these lands on eth you're looking at10 to $50,000 eth so decentralized games and social networks payments a global decentralized Casino industry like meme meme coins on on eth right nfts certificates of authenticity or ownership or tickets decentralized physical infrastructure and networks like helium and hyp mapper that looks like it's going to salana but you know if it goes to eth it goes to eth tokenized funds assets and other Financial products like global settlement basically near instant transaction settlement smart contract is a replacement for legal documents proof of identity like there's there's like 10 to 20 use cases if one of them lands on eth you you hit the jackpot over the medium to long term and it's easy right now to be like ah e is still finding its footing there's Bitcoin and there's Al barbell blah blah but like I still believe in eth because I think you're kind of long this extremely cheap call option and your downside is Capp by the fact that it already has found a use case if in fact the only use case for a non-bitcoin L1 which is sort of cultural artifact preservation am I am I off the Mark here Ami what do you think you're on mute so I think you're off the mark but not because of what you said as wrong so just just take a step back whenever you whenever you see a trade presented in front of you your first question should be what is the best way to take advantage of this trade how how can I how can I take advantage of this trade there's this uh famous story that there was a guy that wanted to bet on the Japanese real estate on Japan on Japan in general right and so he goes and flies to Japan and he wants to meet a bunch of people and figure out well what's the best way to bet on Japan how do I bet on Japan so he goes around he meets people he's looking at real estate he's looking at the stock market tech companies car companies everything and he goes and he meets one real estate agent the real estate agent is taking taking him around and she says well you can look at currently built Apartments but why don't you also look at the apartments that are coming in five in four years in three to four years and he says okay uh what's the deposit look like on on these Department she says 5% and he looks goes so wait you're telling me that I can put down 5% for the right to purchase this apartment at this current price in four years when it's built but I don't actually have to it's just the right to buy the apartment and so what he ends up doing is he ends up basically buying like 50 of these apartments right he puts out his 5% deposit he's just got a massive call option on the real estate market right right and this is the best way you could you he ended up 20 Xing his money you know like 30 Xing his money because of the way that he structured the trade whereas if he had just put all of his money and bought a current apartment there's no way he would have 20x right but he he got really smart leverage on the market that's how I feel about eth I think eth is going up I think eth is going to do well but in even in my best case scenario the way that eth goes up is it goes up to x3x so I don't want to own any e because that's just not a great return relative to the rest of the market to me personally you get way I Bitcoin um with less risk the way exactly with less risk so the way that I would like to own e is through nfts I would like to own eth if I wanted long long Daya call nfts defi things built on top of eth I would much rather own those things which I think have similar risk to eth actually I think if you buy a punk you're taking you're you're basically just taking e risk because I I really don't think that punks are going to go down that much in eth terms I I Really they didn't through the lows I you know I I bought my punk near the highs and then watched you know kind of with baited breath through the bare Market didn't really nuke that hard it's kind of back like it's it's pretty amazing those things held in like for for like something with 16 pixels in it like they really hung in there it's impressive so I guess what I'm trying to say is that well I like eth and I agree with all of your points I just don't think buying eth and holding eth is the best way to express that view okay way to do it so you like let's say that one of the use cases for crypto that I just mentioned lands um I think there's a you know 25 to 50 Delta that it lands on eth and by the time it lands and catches on like it's already too late right so that's that's why I think eth could I don't think it's a two to three xer if one of those lands I think it's a 10xer nice solid 10 bagger um so maybe we sort of disagree about like our our potential bullishness but I I'm not going to lie I'm getting caught up in the froth like I'm I'm a bit star eyed here so I you know I think the nft thesis couldn't agree more with you in terms of like ways to play crypto finding an actual use case a new use case uh outside of Bitcoin as a store of value and you know nfts like any of use cases I mentioned like I think your odds are as good as any on bitcoin or on Ethan salana uh you're supposed to just hold some of that because that then you could get a 10 bagger in there if if if they actually become useful to the broader population but yeah um it it's not an easy trade right now at the very least I think ebtc could continue to run upwards for a little bit while we get hyped about the E ETF but you don't want to hang on to that one hoping for like 0.008 like it's it's it's not worth it's not worth riding it that high it's a trade it's not I just I I think it's I think it's a trade and and I think Sue Zoo for all this Felts had a hilariously good tweet he like dude just don't don't directionally buy eth BTC just don't just don't do it don't don't put don't put that spread trade on man uh it's just you know it's kind of it's kind of a nothing it's kind of a nothing trade you're you know you're taking crypto risk and you're basically getting probably getting no return for it yeah um so you know my my my view yeah go ahead I was going to say say but in terms of like good solid crypto risk like to me all of this ETF bullishness and froth is a confirmation of crypto's major use case thus far just Bitcoin is a store of value there are Rumors in the oil market right now Obi that uh the Saudi government is buying Bitcoin as a reserve asset dollarization is a major narrative in the physical commodi space you can't sling a cargo AC crude in exchange of bars for bars of gold but Bitcoin like no problem right and they only so much there's only so much utility to some of these countries like how how much Chinese wand does India want to hold how many Russian rubles does uh does China want right like the Bitcoin is the only bulletproof fungible internet money that has any sort of Hope of competing with the dollar the rest of these currencies are Fubar for global trade so I I am I am getting I'm getting excited about the dollarization narrative and that's that's happening and and and there's some geopolitical events that I think are are furthering this this acceptance I mean you're starting to see the nervousness look at Nigeria so the Nigerian currency nirra is inflating like crazy right now and what are one of the steps that the Nigerian government has just taken to stop that is Banning crypto currency because so many people are using Bitcoin to get their money out look I've had conversations about this even right people are trying to get their money out of this out of this country and crypto is an Avenue that people are looking at and explore so I think what is happening right now is that with the ETF there's been this truly amazing legitimization of the market that we've all decided to spend our Collective mind power on and people are taking it very seriously government in Nigeria is cracking down you know I got a story for you about the government of Nigeria uh if you're if you're finished with that thought or I can let you finish sorry there there there two there just two more things here and then please I want to hear this the second is that there are now discussions about SE not only seizing for freezing the Russian reserves but seizing them and giving Ukraine yeah insanity that would be such an unbelievable death blow to our current Financial system nobody would trust it ever get no government could ever possibly trust again yeah yeah just like very quickly on that point like the web three thesis of like own your own data when face when you post your cat pick on Facebook they own your cat pick not you who cares about the picture of your cat and who owns it but if you don't own your dollars holy crap right so that's why that's why Bitcoin is you know like theed United States the the ECB and the SNB when they took Russia's money that was Financial nuclear warfare no one expected that I certainly didn't but now if they going give it to their enemies like China and Russia will certainly be letting the rest of their Petro dollars and Petro dollar denominated Securities roll off and they're gonna have to replace it with something and Bitcoin is like kind of the best thing to to replace it with it's not gold yeah is a completely unacceptable risk if you a government of a country that is not 100% fully aligned with America and even if you are 100% fully aligned with America if it is possible to not only take your money but give it to your enemies you you have to find alternative Solutions you have to yeah it would be it would be completely irresponsible not to and so I think we're heading into this world now where not only do we have geopolitical Tailwinds for this ass class we have the institutional Tailwinds the headwinds are abating and it's just it's just a truly phenomenal time to be in in crypto and I think the so I was talking about this with a few of my friends also in the space earlier this week I really do think that this is still the only use case that's been pan that that is panned out for crypto I mean I've been in this industry now for God eight long years casinos and people prefer Doge to the slot machine can't it's just it's it's just moving money around but it's such a such a good use case J it's such a good use case so you know I'm still very bullish on BTC I'm still very bullish um you know long longterm on it I just think that uh you know we're we're we are heading into the and then the governments will try to fight as we're seeing with Nigeria and that will that will create problems that will create fud it will probably create the next major buying opportunity the way that I think about this is every cycle it gets harder and harder and harder to buy the bottom my prediction is that Bitcoin will probably bottom around the time that the not not the maybe not the US government but some reasonable country Outlaws the private use of Bitcoin you know whether it's Korea whether it's you know the UK Spain Italy one of these countries will Outlaw it and there will be fear I I have a more Nuance you on on that last one and I I want to pair with an anecdote so you mentioned Nigeria um I when I worked at ball you know we used to ship a lot of Nigerian crude oil and one day one of our big streams of crude oil we couldn't access it anymore because this Rebel group called The Night Delta Avengers like Google them these are the scariest looking people you've ever seen on the internet right they said they basically set up a Twitter account and they they tweeted like you are not getting any more of this forcado stream of crude oil from you know an area called The Creeks it's like an ecological disaster in Southwestern Nigeria where uh Southeastern Nigeria where there's like a bunch of oil coming into creeks and then they ship it to an offshore platform anyway these guys they Dove like 60 MERS under the ocean Atlantic Ocean like completely vaporized this Pipeline and then mined the area with undersea mines like real scuba special op and these guys came from like Villages right like this is not this is like insane technological sophistication for a group of Warlords uh in the middle of the Jungle and what I'll say here Obby they did it because they were upset with the Nigerian government for not giving them enough of a kickback from the petroleum Revenue that they were reaping from the oil they wanted more because the price of oil had gone up and their their basically their bribes had stayed the same and so Avi if you or I come from you know a rich country like the United States and we want to be successful we go to good schools highly ranked universities we go into TR Jord these guys J I'm just looking at these guys are like these guys are insane these these photos dude everybody should Google the Niger Delta so anyway I had this all explained to me at this like one of these sort of evil James Bond villain offsites that Vall had and chatau in the in the black forest near Frankfurt anyway like the the the guy who dealt with West Africa was talking about the sophistication of their operation what I realized is if you are an entrepreneurial young man in America you go to a good school you get a good degree and you go into you know some high-paying job and that's how you fulfill your ambition if you're a smart hardworking talented guy and you're from The Creeks this is how you make your money right and to me what like zooming back out to our our conversation no matter what the Nigerian government does or the Argent Ian government or the Turkish government to ban Bitcoin or Stell you know quell inflation in their countries or try and control it like there's always going to be a black market they're always going to be Niger Delta Avengers out there hoarding what they need to hoard to make their buck and I don't think you can hold this movement back because this is literally stateless money and I think I I continue to think that Bitcoin is a better store of value than to be generous the world's bottom 50% of currencies um but probably more like 60 to 75% of them Bitcoin is just a better place to hold your money than the Nigerian naira or the Argentinian peso like it's it's there's not even a debate anymore about this so I I do think that even though governments May ban it you know the United States has made it as hard as possible to trade and own crypto and it's still roaring the us could have killed it I think it's too late even for that I don't think a Consortium of developing economies can ban this stuff and and make it make it uh make it go away or even make it sell off because for every Nigerian ban you have like an El Salvadorian president tweeting like hey cop parter Peter Schiff you idiot Economist right like it's it's crazy what's going on right now I I I 100% agree with you should we create a Discord group chat called the Thousand X Delta Avengers that's what we have to call our um our our community the Del the Thousand THX Delta Avers yes people people people are going to think it's about the Marvel no no no no no eventually how that story ended was the Nigerian government paid them off they they went back underground under under the ocean repaired the pipeline laid down their arms demed the area and they deleted their Twitter account or maybe the woke Twitter um Jack dorsy Twitter took it down who knows but yeah THX Delta Avengers can't wait to drink with you somewhere we should we should have Bo meetups actually both janah and I are in the Holy Land right now so for Shabbat we will be hanging out which is gonna be great anyone's in Jerusalem come say hi yeah if if anybody wants to go visit the cotel with us please give give us give us a shout but do it but do it before Sundown because otherwise Jonah won't respond love you guys as I've as I've unfortunately learned too many times he disappears until the night don't even try to pretend you don't vanish sometimes too Obby yeah you know but I I vanished for unrelated reasons such as learning how to play roulette and Monaco I I want to I still want to go to one of these like ether Rock outings um like it sounds like now you got me under the idea jono jono we don't have outings I don't know what you're talking about stop bringing I imagine it's like the uh the commercial for the fire Festival you know like what it was supposed to be you can imagine whatever you want because it's correct it is imaginary because it doesn't exist Fair please let your let let your imagination run wild because it'll be more interesting than whatever we're up to I'll tell I'll tell you that that I agree with your general take that it's Unstoppable this Tech is Unstoppable but if I'm thinking about hey what could cause a bare Market what could cause this to spiral we're I don't think enough people paid attention to the fact that Nigeria is legitimately Banning cryptocurrency Chang I mean guys I think that what we just saw is the seed of where the bare Market begins now I don't think the bare Market Begins for some time but just keep an eye out because it black markets take time to form Bitcoin will take time to recover I mean China banned Mining and it tanked Bitcoin a ton a bunch of people started started selling in May of 2021 again it meant nothing zero for the long-term prospects of this asset however it did lead to a short-term depression and so all I'm saying is that this little sliver of information that we just got that everybody's ignoring because Bitcoin is rallying I think holds the key to how to get out of this Market at the right time without suffering 80% draw down which is why I care so much about it and I care so much about how they came to the decision and I care so much about what other countries might come to that similar conclusion and I just want to make sure that even if it doesn't happen I know what the warning signs look like because I think that is how we end up in the next bare Market that my own personal opinion that's how we end up in which just like 50 countries come out and ban it basically exactly exactly and that or or 50 countries come out add it to their balance sheet and start trading Commodities denominated in it and then you get the opposite price action it's kind of binary or they do nothing which is what they've been doing so this is this is the we're teetering on the edge and like you said you have to be very very careful if they all if there's a Cascade of Bitcoin Banning around the world like yeah get get the out of the way of that tra that's for sure yeah but you just got to pay attention to pay attention to the warning signs right I mean look if three countries come out and ban it I'm probably taking my exposure down yeah even if it's like even if it's Nigeria Kenya and the DRC Zer DRC is actually the second country besides El Salvador to San like legalize it as money right or is that the other Central African Republic I'm sorry not uh not DRC I mean 100 million people live in Nigeria it's Africa's most popul country and Bitcoin is super popular there so yeah I'd imagine and and I know I know why right if if you are born there that is not necessarily like the most lucky place to be born especially the more rural parts of the country so I can see why people are storing their money there it's a path to you know Financial Independence for for a lot of people um it is it's got to be crazy if you live in a country where it gets banned yeah I mean I think it's going to be Bitcoin is really becoming the global asset right now which is so satisfying for somebody that has watched this thing grow from you know $500 a coin when nobody took nobody took it seriously yeah I I just have always thought that this is this this was sort of the end game and I will say you know there there are people out there like na buelli who is just an absolute gigachad and by Giga Chad I mean you know he I think how much did he buy he bought a few million bucks but he's he's a giga chat in terms of his rhetoric whenn when it comes to BTC and I do think that there is a genuine Gulf between look El Salvador is a very unique country they have proven themselves willing to do things that the rest of the world doesn't have the stomach for the rest of the world doesn't have the stomach for cracking down on crime the way that El Salvador does the rest of the world doesn't have the stomach for offering their you know offering economic freedom through cryptocurrency to to their people because they want the control right and so I think that it takes these Renegade leaders to actually do that which is why maybe Saudi Arabia will do it maybe the UAE will do it it's possible that Argentina does it with jaier Malay now in charge who I really like H you know so I I think I think the world is trending in towards towards that direction of uh you know you you're seeing that in one half of the in one half of the hemisphere and then the rest of the you know the rest of the world that currently has the power is sort of in ing themselves yeah so it's this battle between the entrenched powers and and and the new found but at least in the US those entrenched combatants are losing like Jamie Diamond looks like an ass Gary Gensler is like o openly ridiculed you know now and I think you know not not to not to sort of like pretend that that the SEC can't be threatening to crypto in the future it's certainly can especially if Biden wins reelection it's more you know it's it's more just like like put it this way you just said that you've been following Bitcoin since it was $500 and you know you you've loved to watch it grow and and flourish the way that it has I've been watching it too but I didn't understand it until I one day the light bulb went off because I saw it through the lens of Commodities trading and what it offered to people in emerging e like sort of Petro economies that that was where it clicked for me through that lens I was able to see what it offers in economy Beyond just a you know sort of a speculative um you know penny stock type Casino outcome that then I was like oh this is money and this is like money that can can move across the globe way easier than than bank money Bank dollars Petra dollars so I hope our listeners you know I hope everybody comes up with their own framework for which uh Bitcoin just clicks for them because you need a framework to trade effectively otherwise you're kind of untethered and buying high and selling low and acting like a you know unprofitable Trader so I I really hope we can all kind of come up with these interesting Frameworks and monitor the either the confirmation signs or uh you know be sort of sober and honest when we see things happening that that aren't aren't necessarily in in accord with our thesis and maybe that's a time to lighten up or get out or get short I would agree with that and I think the sober the sober and honest is the most important piece here about it right I think when you're when you're in when you're in a BM Market it's so easy to get carried away it's so easy to get you know to smell to you know to smell your own for lack of a better term and just believe the things that you convince yourself of which is why it's you know the these conversations that people you might be you might be listening to this podcast you know on on YouTube or on Spotify you you might hear a new thought you might have had these thoughts before you might have discuss things with your friends writing them down and just referring to them and being sober and honest with your assessment of the situation is so is so important and trying to predict the future and then seeing how your predictions do is also extremely important especially now in the bll market because it's very very very very easy to get carried away I do recommend that everybody take the time to go touch grass I touched a lot of grass today touch some oranges too I touched some oranges I I harvested some oranges outside of Tel Aviv now I didn't did not look at the marcet once because I'm positioned and I think I Jon I think I picked like 10 kilos of oranges well how how long does that take about five hours damn and does it feel good at the end do you feel like a sense of accomplishment do you do you see do you see these scars you want you want to know how I got these you want to know how I got these scars Jonah for everyone listening Audio Only Abi Abi has some little red lines on his arm from touch in a tree tiny red lines from touching a tree one thing I found uh like there have been times where I've earned a lot of money doing something at work and I haven't felt a thing or maybe even felt a little shitty about it there are other times where like I I planted a tree once and it felt amazing you know like the the amount of money you make is not necessarily correlated with your level of enjoyment for an activity that's it's a weird like absolutely not I mean I generated more dopamine from picking 10 kilos of oranges with a bunch of retirees from Baton every everybody that's volunteering is coming from abroad right now actually there was a really cute Japanese couple uh that was also that was also volunteering with us and I asked him I said how did how did you guys end up in Israel picking oranges they look at me and they go we just really like you guys we really like them too a little too much sometimes we eat their Sushi we marry their women yeah yeah well but it was it was really it was really really heartwarming and sweet but I mean the amount of like the amount of happiness that you I generated from just being out there not looking at my phone picking picking some oranges my friend was with me at the time it's a it's a really great feeling all of this to say whoever's listening if you haven't touched grass in a long time I highly suggest you go touch grass it can be anything any amount of grass at any point anywhere just go touch it what what a great note to to end the podcast on I uh I couldn't agree more you've inspired me Obby I'm gonna go outside and touch a pine of beer um just to that that that used to be grass specifically wheat yeah no but it is no longer so awesome all right Jonah as always a pleasure chatting with you pleasure chatting with you too AI none of this is investment advice we don't know anything don't don't do what we say do your own research and uh yeah J Jonah knows some things I know absolutely nothing great talking to you man till next [Music] week

Transcript Text:
this is now the fourth or fifth time that Bitcoin is having this just like rip roaring rally and you just can't write it off anymore it's survived low interest rates it survived the period of apathy it survived the SEC Onslaught survived all these things like it's just it's becoming obvious to the world looking at these ETF flows like how you're literally just hoping they stop in order if you want to buy a [Music] dip okay welcome back to the much delayed second third second episode of the year of the second episode we were supposed to record a record an episode but then instead we went out and got drunk um oh yeah we we did do that which by the way that was a hell of a that was a hell of a night it's awesome we just rocked back whiskies at churn yeah for I don't know how for I don't know how long we basically had a I wish we could have recorded that podcast I think you you guys would have really appreciated it but um I don't think it would have gone past our sensors unfortunately which is great next time next time we're we're both in London maybe we'll invite a few people out you know we'll post a picture if you can find us you can you can come hang out with us we should start having like Community thousand X get togethers where we repeat our unwaveringly bullish thesis like you didn't miss much the Thousand X podcast that happened at the bar was basically us talking about how we were bullish which we talk about on Twitter and every podcast because the reality is how could you not be bullish at this moment in time it's just right so so let's let's go through what the let's go through what happen so post post approval of the [Music] ETF this is something that we've been talking about for a long time is that gbtc held a ton of stale capital and that there was very likely a lot of directional Capital held within that product that was not able to exit for many years right because you remember from the time if I'm getting my dates right February 2021 the discount on the product went negative so a bunch of people just started buying it to replicate their Bitcoin exposure and so at some point a bunch of people just end up directionally along this thing and so they're going to start redeeming because one of the biggest reasons that they were directionally long is well there was a massive discount right out a 50% discount you're making a 100% return once that discount goes back to Flat everybody knows the story I don't need to rehash it but there was there were going to be outflows people saw the outflows and took that to mean that there would not be any inflows which is the opposite there are been there we are currently experiencing some pretty insane inflows I mean this ETF is breaking a lot of Records right now and we knew it would because you have people like Larry thinkink getting on TV telling everybody that it's time to actually make room for digital Assets in your portfolio I was blown away by the fud when the ETFs first launched I mean I gbtc is not a hard product to understand it's before it became an ETF it was a trust that held Bitcoin and you couldn't redeem the trust and take your Bitcoin out until it eventually one day hopefully became an ETF when that happened trust shares or I guess subsequently ETF shares were redeemed and Bitcoin was pulled out so in the day or three after the ETF approvals first were sort of processed by the market everybody looked at those outflows and panicked and looked at the inflows in the other ETFs and panicked oh my God they said that there were going to be billions and billions and billions of dollars worth of inflows and it's only a few hundred million going into ibit and a few others and you know larger than that coming out of gbtc and you you know you look at the Panic merchants on crypto Twitter everybody's like everybody takes like markets move based on the second derivative of the news not not what's actually happening at the time so if you see outflows that is not necessarily in and of itself bearish you have to ask yourself are those outflows going to accelerate or decelerate in Reverse that's what moves the market I mean yeah 100% agree with that statement it's it's always the the issue that people make is they they do the for first order deductive they say okay well outflows bearish but it's already priced and that and that and that's and that's that's by the way that's true point in time right obviously if you know that they outflows the question is over a period of time are those outflows larger or smaller than expected and then what is that how is that expectation shifting over time so I'll give you I'll sort of give you an example of this right when bitcoin's trading 48k my initial estimation of the outflows were two billion now the pace of outflows changed on gbtc they changed from you know what if they would be on track for two billion actually looking at the pace you're actually on track for three 3.54 so moment in time you have to realize okay my priors are incorrect let me shift my opinion this is actually this is actually bearish but then you constantly have to be taking in new data so what are you doing you're surveying and you're saying well what what do people think the outflows are going to be tomorrow day after day after day after at some point what ended up happening in this market was the outflows got priced to five billion six billion 7 billion when in reality they were still on track for three to four because people were putting it into you know an exponential curve instead of what should have been a log you know more logarithmic okay now it's now now it's priced the other way 40K BTC very good level for people to come back in outflows are happening but this is all look at the end of the day this is all hindsight talk yeah so what's useful today is that the second part of the thesis which is that post this particular ETF there's going to be tremendous speculation on every other ETF down the line that should be coming into play So at the moment the ratio eth BTC is trading at 0.052 75 that is a very good level in my opinion you start scaling it because the reality is eth is the next product is the next thing that's going to get productized in ETF form you might see out you might continue to see inflows into the spot BTC produ maybe the ratio goes to 048 10% but it's I think some point in the next two to four months you're going to see this ratio at 665 I agree and and so now it's just a really it's it's a really interesting time to start coming in personally well and and what everybody out there should be doing agree like hindsight is hindsight we can do our Victory lap we can talk about gbtc all we want but what matters is the future now not the past um go on go on to Google Google Far Side investors Bitcoin ETF flow fars side. co.uk it's just like one of 60 different dashboards out there that show you the inflows and outflows basically the net flows into every single ETF just bookmark it look at it every day you can see you know last Friday there were $542 Million worth of inflows the Thursday before that 45 million just just keep your finger on the pulse of what's going on in terms of these flows and to me this is this year is going to be the story of flow right you have minor selling getting cut in half pretty soon in April um you have this Bitcoin ETF flow that everybody was panicking because it wasn't big enough supposedly everyone was expecting billions on day one that's not how ETFs work it's just going to be this steady Tailwind throughout the year and if you if you if your ETF dashboard shows that the inflows are slowing down you know maybe if you're if you're a little bit levered or you're holding more Bitcoin than you're comfortable with maybe you should lighten up but for the most part like I expect this to be steady inflows and a reduction of outflows mainly because of reduced minor selling uh other ETFs like you know an EF now that's on the table does that open the door for um you know thing non Bitcoin tokens to be put into ETF form across the board is that is that going to Telegraph uh sort of Securities or legislation and intentions of the SEC like all these things are going to become narratives over the course of the next nine months but one thing that you know this again I just just to close the thought out flows are the story I I'm still there's one thing that's bothering me about crypto right now and one reason why you know I I would I would be longer if I if it weren't for this particular discomfort flows are a great story but you also need fundamentals to to make a market really go into a super cycle and aside from the already proven use cases I'm perhaps disenchanted with the lack of new ones maybe farcaster is going to blow up but I just I don't know I'm I'm not I'm not feeling the the fundamentals as much yeah I mean I I think the reality of the situation is twofold uh one you have the S&P above 5K you have NASDAQ you have NASDAQ ripping uh you have what seems to be a very robust economy in the United States uh you know the rest of the world I'm not I'm not waiting with baited breath I mean I think China's under a lot of pressure right now I think Europe's stagnating a bit but the US is the us is going and the US is what matters because that's where all the money is that's flowing into the space and so as long as you have strong fundamentals from the equity side and from the tech side then inflows into BTC keep going and I think we all know that at some point people get greedy that's the reality of this Market and there are a lot of people that the I think the the balance of holders people that own Bitcoin it used to be a lot less Crypton native actually but I think because of the ETF speculation you've seen a reallocation to bitcoin and so people's portfolios are more comprised to BTC now than they have been in the past and so you still are going to get that wealth effect and it's going to flow down to different assets and then the fundamental just follow right so we'll take nfts for example pudy penguin's doing very well and that's I that what a ridiculous name I can't believe I have to say that out loud um but you know they're they're not trading at $40,000 because they've managed to actually transform themselves into a TV show right they managed to transform themselves into this TV show for adults I I actually don't know the detail but you know they they're they're actually putting out products right um my view view on this is that as wealth grows what you're going to see is you're still going to you are going to see the redistribution um and that's going to cause certain sectors to do extremely well and then that's going to cause fundamentals to to actually improve in those sectors I mean blur for example right ffty volumes go up because people are resp speculating on on nfts then the value of blur is going to then the value of blur is going to go up right um I think that right now so Tao is another example of this in the AI space Tao has managed to start uh raising for sub you know uh B basically they've started raising for products building on top of to they're becoming a platform and that wasn't true six months ago it wasn't true eight months ago but it's true today purely because there's more money in the space and people are willing you know you're will willing to go out and do this I mean go going back to for a second is the same with blast right they've introduced a new L2 people are willing to deploy Capital into Building Products on these on these on these you're saying that the fundamentals will follow the flows and I I have this sort of antiquated um Commodities mindset that fundamentals lead the flows and create them may maybe in crypto it's different you might be right I hav thought about it that way I think I think that's I think that's what we're going to see happening and so what I'm focused on right now is figuring out where exactly the flows are going to go in the beginning uh you know so things e is my no-brainer like how is that so far behind I I couldn't agree with you more on eth BTC that is a crazy one I think the only issue with eth is that have you used say or have you used any of these other platforms no i' I've written them off entirely which is which is lazy but I mean they're very easy to use and they're very consumer friendly and the applications are smooth and the applications are easy and when you go back to eth what you realize is that it's just not a great user experience now I think that doesn't matter as much because the thesis around eth is more concentrated around institutional flows than anything else in the same way that you know you can't really use stuff on bitcoin you know it doesn't matter yeah exactly I think it doesn't I mean just to interject quickly like well I'm not going to you know digress too far I want you to continue on this point but let me just say that let's not forget that centralized databases centralized infrastructure Amazon web services and you know all all of the things that crypto kind of stands in the face of have a much better user experience than even SE or Aptos right so at the end of the day um it it's about a decentralized set settlement layer that has a network effect and has economies of scale and has sort of a first mover advantage AG that's that's sort of why I'm bullish eth I I don't think anyone's going to flock to near or you know maybe salana because they've done something special but any of these other alt L ones further out the risk Spectrum just because of a user experience what matters is the security and the decentralization otherwise you just go centralized I think I'd agree with that um just talking about uh price action for a second year where do you if you're trading this market right if you're thinking about okay let's say you're 50% deployed you're 40% deployed you want to get more deployed are you are you buying are you buying here are you buying 50k um or is this is this shortterm long term in your in your view extended okay um so let me just preface this by saying that with the way that I form a view in in my trading kind of mindset I start by Tes testing the absolute extremes and so it's like what do I want to have on this second what do I want to have on for 10 years I don't usually have much conviction in the super short term so I I like to start at the other end of the Spectrum in terms of what do I want to have on for 10 years I have never had more conviction in my life over any 10-year period in any asset class um beyond the conviction that I currently have inin you can't give people 10year advice no but hear me out I'm working my way backwards so if you're creating a like if you're if you're trying to not Chop yourself up okay all right you're not you're trying to not buy high and sell low not not like sell $38,000 Bitcoin after the ETF comes out because some crypto Twitter Bears said it looks bearish right and then buy it back at 45k if you're trying to not Chop yourself up it starts it like it helps to have a very long-term thesis that you can cling to when you're losing money right so with my very long-term thesis I think that Bitcoin is a no-brainer that most of crypto probably is going to zero but some of crypto will probably take over large swabs of technology and finance so coming back to the the your question in terms of what I would be doing now if I were 50% allocated I would be allocating myself probably 80 to 90 I would take what the 50% that was UN like sort of allocated for crypto but undeployed and I would I would put maybe 70 or 80% of that into Bitcoin which is sort of the the most secure crypto asset that has the lowest volatility and then what I would do is I would save the remainder of that dry powder to either add Bitcoin on dips or to selectively bet on alts with no leverage that I saw kind of emerging in in various ecosystems with some sort of potential right maybe I would be paying close attention I know same same question back at you what would you be doing oh wow great question I'm glad you asked it um my spicy my view on this uh just as you know as somebody that trades a little bit more short-term than than 10y year um look I'm in Monaco right now I'm feeling a little bit spicy um I'm a gambler at heart uh I've seen this I've seen this price action play out a lot you're wearing a black turtleneck like all the French people there is that what do you mean do French people wear black turtlenecks is that a thing of course it is watch every French movie they're all wearing black turtlenecks what do you mean name Jona name one French movie Leon that guy um that that took uh child Natalie Portman and turned her into a killer okay name another French movie that that one's that one's that one's easy name another French movie am there's definitely a guy with a a fck gear bicycle and a black turtleneck in there okay I'll uh I'll go watch Amal I'll go uh see if I can find any turtlenecks I forgot you married a French woman yeah yeah dude I'm I'm up to my up to my turtleneck in French frenchness we were talking about something serious before you distracted me with this we were talking about like let's say that you're under so here so here's here's here's the thing here's the thing uh when you when you're looking at this uh type of price action so this reminds me a lot of the 20K um the you know any any round any round number breaks uh you tend in the third and the 30k break you tend to get this type of type of price action where you have to test the liquidity first right so at any at any moment there are a ton of people for psychological reasons that will sell round numbers now it doesn't there's no actual expected value to selling round number where you're selling 40K 30k whatever there's no reason to do it other than people are psychologically wired to go sell round numers because they like to say I sold 50k right fine so when that happens the first time you hit that number you tend to get a lot of people that will come in and just sell almost always The Prudent move is to not buy the first time uh that number almost always now when do you know if that's different you generally tend to know if that's different if you get a large liquidation through that number it comes back down and then it stays above that number for more than 24 to 48 hours so basically the way that I would think about trading this is all my Longs I'm on the sidelines now I'm waiting because I think there's better EV to wait to see that break to try to catch it to buy 51 52 and then what you're doing is you're actually betting for all-time highs you're betting for the 70k then to try to buy here in the 50k when you know that there's a ton of cells there there a ton of people that have been underwater for an extremely long time that have been waiting for a while to sell 50k so you've taken your crypto off the table waiting to I I just sorry if I know you haven't done this but I just to clarify for the listeners you're saying if you're [Music] what makes round numbers important why would you just buy Here expecting a break in the future I I don't understand maybe I'm stupid but because generally what what you tend to do is you get to get those like 10 15% sell-offs once it doesn't break a around number you're not saying to buy the dip you're saying to buy the break no no you can buy buy the dip or buy the break so so the the first this is the first part of the statement is you buy the break the second part is the I don't think the inflows are stopping any time soon and so I think any amount of selling by the people that already own this asset whether they're you know miners in China uh whether they're people in the US that have been holding for a long time uh there's no other there's not going to be enough Supply to take this thing lower to overwhelm the inflows because you have to remember you have to remember we're just getting started yeah I mean that's why I'm not trying to buy a dip like the price of ibit the ETF that most most normies are buying is $284 a share there's no round number there and those inflows are unstoppable like to me the idea of trying to get cute with it and dance Between The Raindrops like you might you're probably right and it is probably a great way to extract extra Alpha out of this Market but I'm not good enough to do that so I don't even look we're we're tra we're Traders at the end of the day you can talk longterm I'll talk shortterm but when I when I see situations like this what I see is is I see opportunity and my job is to exploit that opportunity yeah now that that being said I think q1 is going to be q1 is an interesting one because the only people that are buying now are the people that actually decided uh you know a lot of the a lot of the bigger bigger players that are willing to get into this Market they either decided in Q4 of last year or they expedited some processes uh to buy I think the most amount of people that are going to come into this Market are going to come in Q2 because the ETF got approved in q1 and that's galvanized a lot of people to take this more seriously and so starting in Q2 you're finally going to get those people to get their boards to sign off on it and you're gonna right and the Have and the having happens so I've been talking to a lot of exchanges uh I think that the the best way to evaluate this Market is to see who new is coming into this market and as far as I can tell there are tremendous tremendous amount of new people that are coming in both from the retail side and from the institutional side I'm seeing the same a lot of the investment Banks I mean a lot of the a lot of the hedge funds that stepped away post FTX they're not coming back in full force because they've realized that this isn't you know this isn't going away now that that's going to make life a little bit harder to trade uh especially especially the large caps which I think you're you're seeing this in in in the market whether it's conscious or not a lot of the natives have moved away from Lever trading large caps anything in the top 30 people just the the the amount and the preponderance of people that are trading on Leverage in those large caps as far as I see on Twitter are moving away they're moving towards on chain metrics shitcoins all all this all this other stuff uh because I think that that area has and will continue to get more more competitive over time as these new people as these new people come in but it's going to provide it's going to provide a boost in liquidity it's going to provide a boost in in inflows it's going to provide a boost in value to a lot of these a lot of these uh you know the top 10 top top 20 um so so one thing one thing I'm looking for is that there there might there are a lot of there are a lot of midcaps and large caps that have actually underperformed I mean if you look at salana relative to BTC uh you look at mtic in a huge way versus versus BTC maybe around Q2 I have this half formed thesis that the new allocators that are coming in are going to pump some of these some of these assets and even if they don't like the rising tide that you describe will lift All Ships and that's that's no excuse for bad investing but what it does do is it allows you to be wrong for a little bit longer when you're trying to time some really difficult kind of like speculative thesis on alts um um you know interestingly enough it's funny you mention that you're talking to new people getting into the space uh I I am too actually like you know I spend most of my days now sort of dancing Between The Raindrops actively trading and systematically trading things like you know gasoline NAFTA other random parts of crude oil that most people don't like the AL the alt coins of crude oil but in my world of Commodities Traders pretty much everybody's now asked me they're all coming in saying like hey is this is this a good time to buy crypto and so in your in your Commodities world people are coming back I mean coming for the first coming to me talk about crypto for the first time ever for the first time so this didn't even happen in 21 no it didn't it didn't I mean in 21 I I was like absolutely laughed out of the room for pursuing a career in crypto and now what do you think what do you think changed in these people's minds I mean these are obviously very commodity focused oil focused Traders I I think it just I mean it's not like I'm some Visionary like I kind of the light bulb sort of went off for me uh toward the highs but you know similarly this is now the fourth or fifth time that Bitcoin is having this just like RI roaring rally and you just can't write it off anymore it survived low interest rates it survived the period of apathy it survived the SEC Onslaught survived all these things and I think the light bulb that's going off for the Commodities Community is the same light bulb that went off for me like this is a digital commodity it is something that governments citizens um non-state actors and all sorts of other types of entities will need and want to hold on balance sheet in order to facilitate very important functions of uh wealth preservation value transfer and um occasionally like a medium of exchange for hard Goods like it it's just it's becoming obvious to the world um also eth as a settlement layer I think is is a topic that a lot of people in Commodities are focused on because settlement layers and commodities are notoriously tricky and problematic um so they're they're asking like hey is now a good time it's funny that you sort of asked the same question you know maybe maybe rhetorically I was saying like if you're 0% allocated to crypto which you know still a lot of people are now's now's as good a time as ever uh the 10year thesis is so bullish that you should allocate something and if you're 50% allocated or or more looking to add um I I even if I were still actively trading bit coin I don't know if I would wait because I just don't like looking at these ETF flows like how you're literally just hoping they stop in order to if you want to buy a dip you know I just want to go back to the Commodities point for a second so you're inside um right you're you're trading oil all day every day what do you what do you see is I know a year ago you talked to me a little bit about the overlap between the two the two industries right not just that Bitcoin is a digital commodity but also that there might be some overlap that you've seen some exploration in actually s settling deals yes using tether using Bitcoin right what whatever it is has that progressed in any meaningful way um like functionally no uh other than you could say that you know the redenomination of hydrocarbon trade certain trade Lanes like I you know China China and Russia trade crude oil denominated in Remy B now some of it India trades some crude oil India buys some crude oil denominated in non- US dollar uh terms like aside from that little baby step towards a world where there's a new Global Reserve currency that everyone even if they hate each other can kind of get get their heads around like Bitcoin like that little baby step has taken place but I think what's like where crypto and commodities will eventually merge um there are a few different strands of that rope and I could describe them to you now if you're interested but I think the baby step that needs to be taken other than red denominating global trade away from the dollar which is already taking place is just Commodities Traders getting their heads around a digital asset which is like it belatedly starting to happen in a big way and then then what will follow is crypto will replace uh commodi back office uh which is a way bigger mess than five back office Commodities back office is like like settling an oil transaction between Nigeria and China like you wouldn't even believe how many nodes and pieces of paper and faxes and whatever like that needs a decentralized uh database then it needs a decentralized denominator or some of it does not all of it the dollar is great but like it's not perfect for everybody well it's definitely not now I mean you're seeing it you saw it two years ago when we first froze the the asset reserves of of Russia and that 800 billion got got locked up all now it's getting worse know if you've seen the recent headlines but they're actually thinking of there there's there's agitation because of the aid slowdown to to Ukraine to actually take those reserves and give them to Ukraine and that would be that would be a death blow no it wouldn't be instantaneous obviously it would never be instantaneous but in my opinion that would be the you know the the crossing of the danu that would be the point of no return I I thought the crossing of the danu that was the point of no return or maybe the Rubicon was um yeah when uh the danub is a nice River too I like it um but you know what it's just I was just in Serbia it's it was it was stuck in my head you're a Bohemian guy so basically what can I say the um I thought the crossing of the Rubicon was when they took the Assets in the first place but yeah if they just Fork them over to Ukraine to buy weapons oh my God yeah it's crazy I mean the final thing that that I think crypto could be useful for in in the world of Commodities and we're getting there fast is like most Commodities that are relevant to most of the world are not just opaque they're impossible to trade like the types of oil and corn and wheat and things that like you can sort of see on screen if you're an institution they they constitute like a couple basis points worth of global consumption like if you imagine imagine there's a market for West Coast you know jet fuel or Indonesian rice right but the exchanges don't have time to spin these up for institutional counterparties meanwhile like one thing FTX actually did a good job of was just like tokenizing new markets and throwing them out there sure half of it was probably illegal but like at some point in the future I think um to the the nature of tokenized assets uh will make it such that most Commodities trading will be tokenized and take place either on or off chain but in tokenized form and and I think that's like a real Innovation for Value transfer and uh you know basically the in hedging speculation all the things that make Commodities markets tick yeah somebody somebody needs to start to take that step I mean it's it's been I think that's been prognosticated for a long time across all markets and it is slowly happening in the tral markets I mean you're seeing tokenized money market funds pop up uh left left and right Franklin templon was leading uh I mean I don't know they pick sell for some God knows what reason but they did they did attempt to tokenize their money market fund and so this this is coming at a at a certain point and then once it's tokenized I think a lot of people make the argument well well you know that's not really good for crypto no it's amazing it's amazing because it's now interoperable with all all all the networks right so whether whether that specific asset or that specific product actually delivers any bottom line to any network it doesn't really matter because it's now part and parcel of being able to interact with that world and so now now when you're able to interact with a whole new world that's going going to bring value to that world it's going to drag it away from your traditional architecture so I can see that I can see that happening with uh with commodities in in in the long run dude even dog with hat is good for crypto like any use is good for crypto even if it's you said it wrong it's it's whiff it's whiff sorry even dog whiff hat is good for crypto even the casino stuff is good it's just you use cases are good even if they're not necessarily the most like um uh let's call them blue label use cases you know what I think is interesting like something that's cooking in crypto aside from just a a broader Resurgence of interest and the ETFs bringing inflows and and all that good stuff is The Regulators have gone kind of quiet haven't they like this is an election year and I was expecting them to start banging the the fraking drum but they I think they're just like TR kind of hoping that people will forget the war they just lost with taxpayer money against crypto I don't know I well I mean it's I mean look I mean it's a political issue at the end of the day it's such a bad look for them they spent so many resources and so much time coming after this space and they have absolutely nothing to show for it in fact they only have taken massive L's one of the best trades that we've done was we bought Ripple Equity because Ripple Equity was trading at a 99.5% discount to the actual balance sheet of the company now why was it trading at such a massive discount because they were in an embroiled battle with the regulators and it was entirely possible that these guys actually ended up losing their battle but after we saw the SEC lose and lose and lose and lose and lose and lose and lose starts to make you pretty bullish and so actually before that before that uh Arrangement or the the the decision the SEC came to with W with with xrp that they absolved them of a lot of the different a lot of the different issues obviously there's an appeal or whatnot we started buying a lot because you could buy the equity for one to 1.5 billion and they had about 25 to30 billion dollar worth of a variety of different things on their balance sheet mostly in Ripple token but also cash also their Venture Investments a lot of a lot of different things I'm telling you this anecdote now because there are a lot of other opportunities like that that are exist today because The Regulators are taking their foot off the pedal in my opinion that's really and so if you if if you look at what historically in this industry has been priced poorly because Regulators have been so aggressive with these types of assets and these types of products now you know that The Regulators are not going to be as aggressive especially in election year it's not going to happen so what do you do you start to identify those pockets of opportunity and you start to bid them up and let me tell you if Trump gets elected you're going to make a lot of money even if Biden gets elected again or you know and Status Quo they they they have lost the political will to come after this industry in a big way like what's your worst case scenario politically for crypto is it like Biden steps steps out because he's too old or in firm or something and like Elizabeth no are you kidding by oh well yeah okay I was gonna I was I'm trying to for a second if Biden if Biden stepped down it would probably be a good thing for crypto um I mean obviously yeah if Elizabeth Warren comes up then that's basically that's it it's just Elizabeth Warr the only one I'd underwrite nobody else nobody else cares about this industry like nobody else cares and and B Biden probably cared or Biden's Lackey probably cared more than anybody about trying to kill crypto and they just got ironed out they're done like they can't anymore so they got completely nuked basically they they hollowed out the American Trading industry they definitely made it harder for some American firms to trade crypto they spent a ton of money like slowing down Pro progression in the space and um probably sent a lot of talent offshore probably bankrupted a lot of startups who ran out of Runway a lot of projects didn't get traction prolong the winter but it's over now like it's over everybody ended up moving to London because of this so many people so many people London Dubai Dubai yeah and it would be an amazing thing if you know look politics aside uh if a reasonable person got elected on this issue or let's say you know somebody somebody on the right got elected I think it would be a wonderful thing to see all those people come back because I think they would yeah and it would be you know the the the American invention historically has been the ability to pursue success that's always that's always been the case we've done such a poor job with it in this particular industry it would be an amazing thing to get it back and I think we can and I think we have the opportunity to I think that we're getting I think I will say Jonah I am so proud of the American court system I am so proud yeah of the of of the American court system that when you have government overreach you had the the checks and balances they worked they they genuinely worked you had bad arguments by bad people and those arguments got you did and the industry one and that is what we need that we need more of this and you know again I think I've outlined a little bit of how to how to make money on it I mean one thing that I'd love to hear from anybody that's listening is what do you think that most targeted sectors have been I mean my my mind is around things like dydx snx a lot of defi products but I think that they I think that there are a lot of opportunities out there to start picking up things at The Regulators tried to stomp on and they haven't necessarily been repriced yet I think that's really good advice and one one thing I'd like to add on to it for the listeners um what you know just anecdotally what I'm doing in my career right now is I'm Drilling in really deep into a sector that I know really well which is um petroleum and refined products and building trading strategies and sort of day trading my way around that market and then taking the gains and sort of investing them into Bitcoin on a more passive basis a you're trading crypto a little a little bit or maybe a lot more actively than than I am but I think the broader lesson for the listeners from what the two of us are doing is like pick your pick your Niche dive into it learn it really well get in the telegram channels read the Publications that that matter get on Twitter and follow the the accounts that that tweet important and philosophy about about your your narrow niche trade that Niche but don't spread yourself too thin trying to like day trade a 100 things or 50 things so day trade your Niche get good at it and then take your profits and sort of defease them back into uh into your broader like more passive Longs that you have like a 10-year thesis on that you don't need to trade actively and I think that could be something uh that could be something that turns into a real lucrative process for people hopefully well I think that's great advice Jonah as always look uh you know at the at at the at the end of the day it's always a good time talking to you I think this was a you know this was this this this was this was a fun one you know I I apologize because I've been in Monaco trying to learn roulette for the last week trying to learn roulette yesl you say black or red no no no no no listen listen and rou but no no no no listen listen listen listen you know there's many things to learn apparently I look I I don't know I'm I'm being told that there many things to learn I'm going I'm probably going to stick to Blackjack and poker though but well I I stayed up all night watching the 49ers lose um that that was what I did with my life so yeah I'd rather be in Monaco gambling with you you you really think that they were going to let the for you really think they were gonna let the 49ers win you realize it was scripted right they they have to do it for you know my favorite by the way just just my last point there has nothing with crypto nothing do with anything else completely out of left F but my favorite argument that I now see is that it was scripted specifically because they're trying to encourage Neo natalism who's that which is the lizard people or exactly the lizard like the the the you know the power Jonah the powers to be are trying illism and they're trying to Showcase you know a powerful couple together and that encourage people to you know get together and have babies it's like the most like people writing like pages about this I had a different how do you how do you have the time I had a different thesis I thought that like basically my working hypothesis is that Joe Biden died in 2021 and that the Deep State reanimated his corpse with alien technology from Area 51 and I figured that whoever reanimated him would probably want to promote the city that like will reelect him with a 90% margin it's called San Francisco I grew up there they love him or love love whatever how did you how did you grow up in San Francisco and end up a well adjusted human um back then it was a really interesting well adjusted place there are artists musicians counterculture like like good writing like all kinds of it was like a really multifaceted place with the whole spectrum of of uh professions and you know you know my my parents on government salaries could afford a house and a nice life there in the American dream now it's uh it's turned into something pretty ridiculous and Sinister I I wouldn't go back it's not it's not my kind of place but um it uh it used to be freaking awesome used to be absolutely incredible it's I mean like physically it take take you know the the problems that it has like with Urban blight right now aside um like just in terms of like layout the most I think it's the most beautiful city in America with the hills and the skyline kind of rolling around koit Tower and the Golden Gate Bridge it's awesome when uh when BTC hits 100K I'm expecting you to try to take over SF and turn it you know make make SF great again well that's the problem when BTC hits 100K that'll get me into like lower middle class in San Francisco right like you need to be a a plutocrat to own a single family home there it's crazy yeah that's nuts man well maybe one of our listeners will get there eventually they'll invest it you know may maybe somebody put some money in tab at $1 it's now 586 Jonah San Francisco back one last thing if you know any good French movies let me know because Jonah didn't know a single one despite being married to a French one Robbie Jacob watch that one okay thank you all right guys we'll see you soon great talking to you Obi not investment advice love you all do research and uh yeah don't if if you lose your money it's not my fault it's J's fault h no please good talking to Y ABI see you next [Music] time

people have to buy their sports cars or you know what whatever their you know chalets or whatever the hell you want to you want to spend your money on looks like Dan's rocking a pelaton back there or uh oh yeah probably is that is that where the money went the pelaton yeah and then then actually I have a dinosaur in a crate wait is is that like a real like a bones or like what are we talking about oh yeah it's a fossil it's like a fish we were debating before the show we were like Dan's a real OG like does he have a Tungsten Cube does he have a Lambo but you have a [ __ ] dinosaur fossil that's pretty [Music] dope all right sweet welcome back everyone to the first THX podcast of the new year we have a great guest Dan mazuski one of the longest tened crypto Traders around someone who's managed to weather the highs and the lows and stick around despite all of the ridiculous fatigue and silly things that happen in this space we're recording right after the SEC about a day after the sec's Twitter got hacked and we had some crazy moves in the market then is that like top five stupidest thing you've seen in crypto top 10 top 20 like I think it's top five I mean it's to it's top five because I mean like I like we're finally on the big stage right like dude every news or well at least every financial news organization on the planet like the headlines were just about it right like I don't know you got Senators tweeting at him and like I don't think that any of that stuff will matter but we just as an industry look like clowns for basically for I mean the looks bad too but like also like of course we would not be able to like go through this like adults as an industry like I would argue we we've looked like clowns for some time now uh with you know FTX turning into you know just like the greatest scam since Bernie made off and all the other horrible things that have happened how have you how have you managed to we these crazy cycles and keep your head screwed on right I think all the all the Traders out there want to learn how you how you don't you know burn out basically amidst all this craziness yeah um so the FTX one in particular that that one I think was just we had learned a lot of lessons a lot of years ago um so nowadays people don't think about exchange exposure as much as well on the back of FTX they do but really you got into a low probably I don't know starting like 2020 um on we're like people kind of stopped worrying about the venue risk um there was that that little brief period where okx like froze withdrawals and people like got a little spooked again but that didn't really affect us people as much um so anyway like there hadn't been like a big exchange failure in a while um and people got complacent but really like back in the day when we first started doing this like when I first started trading this thing exchanges like would go down every six months like they weren't really sticking around so you you definitely didn't keep more on there than you like had to um so one of the things that we just like as a best practices thing like over the years is we try to diversify exchange venues um as much as possible like that you can and like really just like keep an amount of money there that you like won't get obliterated if you lose um so like we had money on fpx we got popped like we more likely than not like any major venue would ever go down like we would have some exposure to it but it was all like an amount of money we were able to lose um and like continue to like operate right and like it actually ended up I mean dollar turns ended up being find like whatever like the wrist sort of angle that people are complaining about now like I mean everything went up and like you sort of got blown out at the lows but anyway like the long story the short is like we picked up habits just sort of from like doing this for so long that like we're able to sort of keep going um even when like stuff gets like pretty dark and sort of you have exposure to it um so the the counter to that is you have if you like if you diversify your exchanges a lot you always take a hit sort of when one goes down right like so you do sort of have this like tail risk of you're always getting clipped a little bit sort of whenever these things blow like we even we use some like mid- tier exchanges sometimes um and like they go down more like we've lost a couple of those probably since we started CMS um and like they were just like a figure that we like were always willing to sort of lose like it sucks like I didn't want it to happen but like it is what it is there's like a cost of doing business with the counterparty exposure and this um I I think that like makes the Returns on the liquid side sometimes like look Rosier than they are because like people don't price that risk sort of in it and I think like a lot of people learned that who were LPS and funds that were liquid like sort of this last cycle when like funds just got toasted because like their exposures were so high on some of the venues and whatnot so anyway like that that in particular is sort of help it's one of these things where like you just do this long enough like you start running up against like all these scenarios and like hopefully you survive them and then you sort of keep going through it all so I think I had the the fortune starting when the money didn't matter as much and the numbers were small so like there was nothing like really like you couldn't really hurt yourself enough to like be out of the game and like when did you start I started like trading this thing professionally like 2013 I was like messing around with it in late 2012 and then I that first run in I don't know if it was like q1 but or into Q2 it ran up to like a th in 2013 I was like all right I'm gonna I'm gonna give this a go and I went to work at Kraken actually even way back then they like just gone um like live on the whole thing Jesse started that in 2011 but it took him a bit to like get it going um and that was like my first waray of taking a job in crypto did you have a finance background before that or or yeah I was working I was actually working at a hedge fund I was trading um I was well I was doing more of the programming side of some of the automated trading to hedge the Deltas for like an option book that I was attached to anyway it wasn't it was in mostly a ball um fund that was a little like south of Boston but I mean I was pretty Junior there so I I didn't have like a ton of responsibility on it but I had learned enough from like the guys being there I was there for probably three years um so I I knew enough about about like markets to like understand that aspect of it um and I had a technical background which helped a little bit but not a ton back back back then there was basically you were going into a market that had negative infrastructure there was nothing right in terms of in terms of actually accessing the market it like would just not be there in three months or like it would just I mean like the the methods for like transferring money were weird slightly gray area if they were even like allowed to be operating there was like all these like odd payment processors that would like take the action like scrill and like local till and like I don't know like it was definitely it was a weird it was a weird Market it was and like I it was a little more nefarious probably at that time I mean Silk Road was big and it was like definitely huge as a function of like the Agri get sort of volume going on the stuff so it was a little seedier than it obviously is now um and like as the industry's gotten bigger like that's like sort of changed but yeah it was and the characters were way more colorful back then because like people people were like if you you were really into it you were definitely a little more like further on like the belief Spectrum in like a lot of different ways so those people have like kind of gotten like watched in sort of like the whole crowd as like time's gone on yeah I mean we we've definitely professionalized the industry a lot over the last six seven years but it's still I think cisf had a hilarious [ __ ] it's like this is still not a serious industry in in many in many meaningful which just like the the people the characters what we do I mean you look at half the things that people get up to in this market it's what shitcoin is going to pump I'm going to buy it before everybody else and then sell it back to them and this thing's probably not going to exist in two years anyway yeah I mean but but part of that is like value right like I think like people knock it but I think a lot of the like look this industry is like does have some entertainment value and I think it has like a way of sucking you in and you don't leave because it is like a little addicting just like the information flow like the communic like it is fun and I think that like that matters a lot is like that's like some of the value it like has is that like it it maintains and keeps like a pretty wide large group of people like involved in it at all time oh yeah cryp crypto is like the best video game that's ever existed in the history of video games I mean it's it's amazing and now you have all these tools to play to play the video game I mean you spend all your time in deck screener poke poking around or you're looking at order books you're looking at flows and it's just yeah there's there's a huge addictive addictive quality to it and at the same time we're in an industry that we think is going to change the world over the next 10 10 to 15 years which is which is super nice but yeah I mean what being on CT is just like watching a movie day day day in and day out right it's just really neurotic movie and it's B like you you can like you could start poking on different like you can like go look at like one like aspect of it and just be down the hole for days and then just like pop like you can never consume the entire like Universe of information at this point that was actually that was actually the thing that was kind of the a hard transition for me I mean I felt back in 2017 2018 I could cover basically the whole industry myself I mean there were obviously like there were a ton of things that were going on but you could sort of get a handle on most things and now when I'm on CT or I'm looking at new stuff or my analysts are bringing me things like H I've never seen this before in my life I have no idea what this is I don't even understand it at all then you have to really spend time to time to get in I mean the industry is definitely grown in terms of width like the ability to for one person to manage and trade effectively I mean you kind of need a team now in many ways if you want to cover the the whole breath of it yeah you can't you can't possibly like absorb all that's going on like it's just there's too many aspects like maybe in like the depths of the bare Market when it's like slow like you can like grasp it but like definitely not now when stuff's flying around how how active are you Dan do you have a whole team or you just constantly actively trading every single crypto sector or you uh you running at lean and more trying to you know things and and get in and out more slowly um I think we'll probably skew towards the more active side of the house like as like me personally but then also like our firm like compared to others um how many are we now total I think we're 11 total um spread between like couple of different cities um mostly New York and Boston then a bunch of guys remote um we we do we definitely do like a fair bit of stuff like in the defi angle of things too um whatever you like want to call like we're we're always like banging around on sort of like new stuff and trying to get yield for assets we have um but we're we're pretty active on the liquid side we're less active than when we started but we still like we trade every day for sure um and we pump out a lot of liquidity um into some of these like newer like specifically like the defi um decks like deriv protocols like we try to like do a lot there where we can like we run a fair bit of one trading we keep a we keep a lot of In-House like um like programming and like Tech Talent um and like we have guys who just like do dedicated devops like like running nodes and like keeping on all that stuff so like I don't know like we're we're pretty active on that front um and then we have a couple guys that just like do the Venture so we like run the gamut of it but I tend to focus like purely just on like the liquid side of things I mean this is the first time I've ever met you um you know I've heard about youever ever since I got into professional crypto trading you guys you and Bobby Cho uh you know you have a reputation for having started a spray and prey fund at basically the best possible time and then have basically rode that massive 2021 wave and somehow didn't get blown out by the selloff uh probably just by active actively trading risk management using some of the techniques you just mentioned um you know we got lucky too I I want to be proba completely F there like I mean like the this the history is always told by the survivors but like it was we zigged and zagged in a couple of the right spots in 2022 which like very much helped tell us some stories like that you guys threaded the [ __ ] needle that was almost nobody managed to do that all all you know you were in that sort of top five top three fund category in 21 and literally everybody in the top 20 I think except you got ulated spectacularly like what were you doing tell us some stories yeah so we got a little lucky first off because um the way we're structured we like have like a pretty gross like tax burden um because like it's all past their income and we like live in places that are like very high tax regam and most of our stuff is short-term cap GS so like we we basically have to sell half our p&l in any given year um just to like cover the tax B in in a good year right and like that that changes depending on like the breakdown but that's like sort of the rough math um 21 was such a like phenomenal sort of run that we started prepping for the 2022 tax hit like because like we would make estimated payments but not like huge and like you don't know what your p is going to be so like it's pretty much all going out q122 so we started like basically drisking and taking a bunch of money off the table at the end of 21 just because we had to right like because we got to have to pay that money um which we we did end so that was lucky really because we we just like knew I had seen enough people get obliterated in 28 2018 from like not having their tax money together in 2017 to know that like look if q1 is bad um in the following like a good year like you have like a real problem because your fire selling assets like maybe at sort of the level like you can just like make your tax but n so anyway that was like the first lucky thing that we had so we just like had the cash on hand and we had sold the money for bonuses too just to get that ahead so we were we could make our payments um that we needed to make like in the Q so like that was all right and then like that didn't forc us to do like a ton of stuff in the beginning we also just like we had taken some risk off the table from some like larger positions um via using the borrow lendes um that was just like lucky that we structured them as term um so that they didn't get called in open so like we just like we just were kind of Lucky um in some of like the structuring that we had with some of this stuff that we were like able to like we didn't do well like we took a lot of Deltas down and like a lot of our book just got smooshed but we had taken enough risk off the table that we had bullets on the way down and we were also able to just like keep paying and operating everything um like there was no disruption of payroll like we let a couple people go that I mean like you you get aggressive like hiring in the bull and like you got to like clean it up in the bear but for the most part like we kept the team through um I will say the one thing like I didn't anticipate which I Learned was that like we were very active with most of the bilateral lending desks um so Celsius grayscale um blockfi like we had done an equity investment in blackf even like we we were big players with all these guys um I didn't really think about it which I should have is that like if one lender dies like they all die um I didn't like I knew it was very Daisy chained and I knew there was really like only like 10 people maybe that were like 90% of the borrow um but I guess I just didn't factor in how bad that would be unwinding so like part of the problem we ran into in 2022 was like we would a lender would blow up we would have to like close all of our open term loans with them but by the time we were done with that like the next Peg was falling and like that was getting called in so like we were just constantly paying back borrow and like having to close things so like that sucked and like in retrospect like that was like the biggest thing that we could have thought a little bit more about that we just didn't at the time I mean like in the bull market like you get sloppy and lazy and you don't like think about like if it goes bad but that was like a real headache that was going on behind the scenes that I don't think people really understood was that everything was like at some you had like a four Monon window or like every dollar of like open term borrow got called and like it was hard like it was hard for people to like get all that together and a lot of that money had been like fired out into like Venture and like people just kind of like assume they'd always be able to borrow it from somewhere and you just couldn't like the market went to zero like the credit like crunch that happened was wild like it just went to nothing overnight um and by overnight I mean like three or four months but like it just happened and it never came back it still really hasn't come back so that was like a big b that we didn't really think about on the way down yeah the the thing the thing you said at the beginning I think is actually a huge source of huge source of alpha you said I mean a lot of people are in that position where when they make a ton of money in in a given year they have to cover their they have to cover their taxes which I think is why you see crypto so and top in January and February as people as people are pay paying out their taxes everybody you know sort of sort of calls out a meme but after the Cycles I mean that's that's just what we see I know that in 2021 you had I mean that money's got go but like it's got to go like it's got it's got It's go to it's got to exit and PE people people have to buy people have to buy their sports cars or you know what whatever their you know chalets or whatever the hell you wanna you want to spend your money on looks like Dan's rocking a pelaton back there or uh oh yeah probably is that is that where the money went the cycle yeah and then then actually I have a dinosaur in a crate wait is is that like a real like a bones or like what are we talking about oh yeah it's a fossil it's like a fish yeah oh wow see we we were debating before the show we were like Dan's a real OG like does he have a Tungsten Cube does he have a Lambo but you have [ __ ] dinosaur fossil I know I got do I have a big Tusk in the base and the guys are downstairs on that like where on the m in the main floor like we have like everybody like in a ring this is like we we took an old townhouse and we like turned it into like an office um so like I'm in the upstairs room but so this remember remember you remember this we went to like go buy that dinosaur in France this was like do remember this at all this is the peak of 2021 this was like November like you could Mark the calendar High to like the like with a pen to like the exact top we sent so there anyway like that's to get to in the weed we a bunch of people got together like and we sort of organized it to try to buy this dinosaur um but we ended up getting smoked on it it ended up going like way higher than we thought it was but we sent a guy to France and like we had to pay a deposit um in Euro to like be able to bid right so like we had to send like I forget what it was it was like a couple hundred thousand Euro to like be able to like actually participate like that was how you could prove your real and then the guy we sent Jack was our CFO um to do it was there and he gets like smoked right like the goes way higher than we thought it was going to go like we don't have stand a chance but at the time I was like look like you're there like I don't even want to like figure out how to get this money back just burn the deposit because like they have other stuff they're selling so he got like a bunch of like random fossils that we like have but this this thing is like 10 feet long which we didn't realize and it's like 800 lbs so like we have nowhere to put it we were like oh we'll put on the wall and it's so [ __ ] it's rock like it's a big rock like it's in the Rock though it's so it's way to it so it's just been sitting in the crates here for like a year and this and this is this what is it this like a this a fish you said what it's a it's a 10- foot like prehistoric fish that's that's that's incredible we we gota we we got to get a picture of this thing once you actually put it together to be fair I haven't opened it so like I don't even know if it's in there but like it should be yeah it's but I don't have anywhere I don't have a single piece of like wall that's like will hold it or even like I don't know if I could even like structurally hold it so anyway that's like sitting in the case this is why crypto sells off crypto sells off because people take their money to buy prehistoric fish and so and pay taxes and so I think I think we maybe we can maybe we can build an index for this yeah and and Credit Credit crises I mean we should be able to build an I mean I I see this happen over and over in crypto there's so when you have just like a complete amount of froth in the market and people are just doing absurd things with their money that they never thought that they would do otherwise that's probably that that's always such a good signal well Dan's on cycle number four now so I think by then he he's earned the license to do some to buy some prehistoric dinosaur fish I mean I guess Dan's a fossil himself in the crypto industry so might as well have some fossils what do you think we're in froth mode right now Dan or do you think that uh this thing is just going to send after the ETF launches this one's hard because um so I'm gonna say this I don't I don't have a great Insight of what's gonna happen like the next couple weeks um look I'll say this if they reject it it's going down but like assuming that like it's going through right and like everything that seems to be the consensus like people smarter than me in that world like think that um I I think it's going to be kind of noisy for a bit um like a like just because this thing exists doesn't mean like people are going to be like immediately like oh now I can like finally you know like tread fight moves at like a speed that's a little bit slower so I do think like even if people want to put that position on like it's not just like oh day one boom get me there'll be some of that and like that will matter and like retail is like a like a force so like they can like come in like rip this thing but I I think you're going to need a couple weeks to a month to you like get a good idea of what like Baseline flows are going to be but like the the back of that is there's going to be sustained inflow and it's going to matter and it's gonna be good and it's gonna be like net like sort of like cash sort of like moving into the industry as a whole so I think it's going to be a big tailwind and you also have a having which matters um so I think both those things are going to be like I think it's going to get Wilder the end of the year but like in in the next couple weeks like I don't know I don't I don't I don't have a bet like I don't really like have like I If anything like we'll probably just like if it gets like smos like we'll try to grab some but like I don't have like a good plan other than that so that's like kind of it just it's like way out of my wheelhouse of how this stuff's gonna move I don't have like real conversations with people that would be like putting money in this thing I just like I I'm guessing but do do you think so I mean one thing one thing that the market was talking about a ton is just right after the fake tweet from Mr Gary eth BTC just ripped it it ripped it ripped super hard and it seems like people are just very very underp positioned for that in general are you are you thinking of getting long long eth after the ETF or what what are you thinking in terms of rotation play yeah I think there should be some like reversion there right like these bitcoin's just gotten so shellacked um so like I think it's a pretty easy one to be also do you remember when the seei Futures launched and then like the next month like e Bitcoin like tripled it like that was like the bottom to the second so I think a little people are looking at it like sort of the same way I I think that's probably like if you put a gun in my head like e Bitcoin trades higher like on the back this thing and just like sort of like drifts up that'd be my guess why why do you think eth is so cursed I think it's the easiest most liquid thing that you've been able to sell against Bitcoin for a while so like people that like want to get long R have probably done so I think that's like just like the simple on it like it's harder to sell like the other basket of BS and you also would have gotten carried out in it um just like a stuff like bounce I just think like if you were like I need to I want to get like longer Bitcoin like selling eth against it was probably like the trade for the last six months um I I think we're see we're seeing that market Dynamic shift a bit I mean if you remember back in the last three four months every time eth BTC would rip the entire alt complex would sell off because it was super clear that everyone was long the alts against short eth and this is actually the first time that I'm seeing look eth BC's up you know two and a half percent and alts are actually doing okay relative and so I think people are it seems like people are starting to work work out of that position and that should in theory be helpful helpful for ebtc so like load up on your lios your arbs your your optimism of the world just sort of close your eyes and wait but I don't know the the the tough part is that if if this is quote unquote priced in and BTC tops out I mean how how long do we get do we get a rally right I think that that's sort that's sort of the tough part yeah I don't know i' probably guess it's like a couple months I don't know I don't think it's GNA be like the whole year unless there's like some like real change like unless like activity on eth just like goes through a roof and like your burn just gets so high and the thre thing just starts to feed on itself are you is that something that you act you you you actively trade so are you are you are you put putting on putting on these positions to try to to try to capture these moves we I mean we'll trade like eth out right we don't trade the like spreads of like stuff like like Soul eth or like avac solar like they I we just don't don't do a lot of like the pair trading like I do I've said this a bunch like I wish there was like a real index product for like the top 50 that was I don't know I don't know how you'd like do the waiting so it wasn't just like Bitcoin but like that you could use as just like a generic like hedge of like exposure but um like absent that like I mean sometimes we'll go long alt and we'll like sell Bitcoin e against it sort of like Bas probably 50-50 is like most of the times like or whatever we got like lying around that doesn't have like great yield um but for the most part like we're not like sort of taking exotic PA trade bets so like as e Bitcoin is like across itself like we don't really trade yeah what's up you you mentioned earlier that you know just the combin a of the Tailwind from ETF inflows plus the having is is just absolutely massive and you're expecting you know a bullish second half of the year or Q4 like so am I I I I'm so so ludicrously bullish that I can't see straight and what I what I can't figure out against that backdrop is that if you have this steadily rallying you know benchmark asset what are you supposed to rotate into for the beta plays like I I'm I'm so bad at this and you guys with more experience than me who are more plugged into the market than I am you know Dan I I want to ask you like what what what sectors are you looking to to play for you know the bull market that you see coming what are you rotating risk into or are you just waiting for now and you're going to try to get into that higher beta stuff later yeah so like I mean the way we generally try to play this stuff is like it used to be just like you own Bitcoin and E when they rip and then Flatline then you spray out sort of into like the most liquid sort of alt I mean that's most the other l1s like that's kind of been or now like the l2s you definitely put in that bucket um so like I don't know call the top five other l1s and like ARB and op and I don't know pick a couple others if you want but like basically stuff that's pretty liquid but like it's definitely like higher beta um the thing was like this time like eth just didn't do that right like you really just like Bitcoin just like ripped up with Flatline and then the rest of the alss would rally um but that's generally how we look at it is like you see the cash move in and like real money come through in the majors which has just been Bitcoin eth and then you like wait to the stuff that's going to spray out like the longer longer tale of stuff will rip too but like there's capacity issues like once you start getting outside the other l1s like in depending on like how far you like want to go out also weirdly like the inflows that are about to come in are going to come in on trafi Rails and you can't like take your black rock Bitcoin ETF and diversify it into bunk right like there's no mechanism to do that so maybe Bitcoin will just outperform everything else this cycle I I I don't know know how to think about it yeah but if you think about it like that Bitcoin is getting bought on a cash exchange somewhere from a crypto native person who's now getting cash right and then they're going to take those bullets and do something with them I think that's like the way I generally try to think of like how it moves through the system yeah maybe I mean at least some percentage of of the Bitcoin that's getting bought will indeed go go rotate into something else that's a good way of thinking about it I was kind of assuming that in the past when there were big Bitcoin inflows they were going on to you know just random exchanges and then eventually the people the holders of of those Bitcoins get bored and rotated out the risk curve but no you're right you're absolutely right yeah I mean what is actually going to be super useful is um the ETF becomes like a marginable asset inside like brokerages as opposed to gbtc which is a little like I think there's only a couple people that like lend against it so like that's actually super useful um for people that can like actually use their Bitcoin as like a lending product again right like you can borrow against that pretty easily yeah it becomes becomes a much more useful asset just like o over overnight Bitcoin becomes a you know becomes so so much better to buy because you're not tying up tying up Capital that you can't can't do anything else with so I mean that that that could actually lead to another yeah could could lead to just another credit credit boom cycle like Schwab or Fidelity will give Grandma leverage to buy the bit the Black Rock Bitcoin ETF too so you don't you don't need to try too hard to imagine some scenarios where people get pretty pretty levered long or you could just like you could have a 100 Bitcoin worth of shares of the ETF and now you can like use that to get a margin loan to buy like a house like you could think the it's so useful having that thing like not like as grayscale's version of it yeah grayscales version absolutely carded out some of your competitors I can't believe the wrecking ball that that thing C I mean we got hurt with it too right like when that bar was getting called in like we had like some of that spread on and it like just torched us like there was nothing you could do about it too like that's what I was saying like that stuff like that like there wasn't a ton you could do to avoid it because the thought was always like all right like if block fight falls down I'll just go like borrow it from Celsius or I'll go borrow it from Genesis the problem was like everybody was dead so you're like [ __ ] like there's nothing like there's nobody to go to anymore like unless you could go find something bilateral but then nobody wanted to face anybody anyway so it didn't matter I don't know after honestly after that like after hearing that how do you how do you keep your head in the game I mean this this is something that I I I I work I work on a ton with myself and I don't I don't really have a great a great answer but this Market just sometimes just Tes takes you out and just slaps you around and just being able to keep your head in the game I mean so many people they you know they make they make a few million bucks they check out it's like how do you keep your head in the aim you're like all right I'm gonna get back on I'm G to keep keep attacking this bull markets around the corner like let let let me stay on top of it I mean you do you take vacations I got nothing else to do so that helps um no I mean I say this I say this a lot I say definitely to like guys who are younger is like there's going to be periods where it's like terrible just like take that time and do something like else like because there's there is 100% in the bull market you just start letting other aspects of your life like fa as [ __ ] right like you like don't keep up with friends like you're like not talking to your family like your health is like like use the down periods where like there's nothing going on and like the chart's terrible like everything's just getting carded and like you have a position just like don't like use that time and be like get your life in order because like you're you're not you're not going to get it when it turns so you have to like be really good about your time management I think like that's something you like take a couple Cycles to like figure out um is like when it's slow and bad and like all 22 you could basically like have gone away and like [ __ ] off and it wouldn't have mattered like you would have come back and everything was the same price it was when you were there and you didn't miss a damn thing so use that sort of period when you can and if you have the resources obviously to like get the other aspects of your life like squared away um um that's like I think a big takeaway that I've like gotten over time um otherwise though but you got to remember like when it's the worst it's when everybody's getting blown out like that's when the opportunity is and just chill like you don't have to do anything well this is also like why we don't use a lot of Leverage like even though we were very active with the borrow and like we do I say that like we try to avoid leverage but like we obviously have used it um we try to do it more like not just like out right long but you gota like Leverage causes like an issue of like time so like you suddenly have to like have things happen in a like or at least like it adds a clock aspect to it if you could just like not do anything like it's great then just like don't fret just like chill I don't know people people get overworked I think it's because like the industry is moving so fast everyone feels they need to be doing something at a given time do you still believe in the industry as much as you did on day one like are you are you uh you mentioned earlier in the podcast that you were you know back back in the day in 2013 it was real crazy real Believers like do are you are you still a real believer and if so like what do you what do you see this transform pering in general I want to hear your philosophy I still buy the idea that like stateless sort of like money is like a very big important thing and I think like the ability to just like send value to whoever you want is like super useful I think also stable coins are like a massive just like leap and I think they they're a huge tool um that being said like I think the industry is getting it's become more of a casino as like time has gone on um not that it wasn't in the past it was just a smaller aspect of the flows um I think it's like just dominates now and like people don't even try to hide it um I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing I just like think it is what it is I I agree like I mean casinos in real life kind of suck um but I mean look at bunk your odds are way better than double zero right and it's probably more fun and you get to tweet about it yeah and you get to be part you get to be part of a community which I think is missing yeah people want to be part intern I like I said like I don't feel strongly either way about it I just like it has definitely become a bigger portion of like the ecosystem like as basically every year since 2017 once Ico started it kind of like just never came back do you do you think uh you know to the serious people out there building on crypto do you think there's anything that's you know valuable that's going to get built that we're not paying attention to be it games or real world assets or deepin or any of the [ __ ] that people are talking about these days are you focused on I don't know I I tend to like not give it a ton of thought until it's too late and that's fine because like most of the time it's just been a fade um like I was even like to go stable coins for a really long time like when tether came out I was like this is stupid I was like why would you use dollars and then like as time went on I was like ah like this is why so like I don't know I'm probably just like irrationally pessimistic about like things initially but like you gotta remember there's been so many cycles of this stuff right like it was stos and then it was like remittances and then it was like every like two years it was like a new thing that like I don't know so those have generally just been a fade yeah I I I honestly I like that like I I like I like that approach because I think I think that that's how you see the market with Clear Eyes is when you when you recognize that there their Tailwinds to this of useful things that are probably going to work but at the end of the day we're Traders and we're here to make money and we're here to focus on that and that we just know that this is the most inefficient market we've seen in our lifetime and let's just figure out how to take advantage of that in the in the biggest way possible I mean I actually think that if you focus too much on the fundamentals you get lo you just get lost in the Weeds on it and so it's just about okay well what what's what's what are the good trades how do we how do we make money and so I mean it's I know I know I know it sounds sounds kind of kind of silly to be like all right we'll throw out the fundamentals but it's true I've just seen so many people in crypto get sidetracked by that I yeah I don't and maybe I'm just not smart enough to like be in the weeds like thinking about like the ramifications of all this stuff so I like here's the example like real world asset it's like I cannot Square in my head how that's going to work in crypto but like maybe I'm wrong and like people just figure it out but like in my mind I'm like I don't understand like how these two are going to jve would you buy it on a narrative like Oh Real World assets seem to be G gaining traction amongst the community of short-term investors I would like to get ahead of that before it migrates from telegram to Twitter and then I'll I'll pitch it back out when when the thing goes parabolic like do you do you do those short-term types of meme or or narrative trades or not really more like we'll be like all right this worldwide asset thing's flying three names have like tripled like what are the other names that haven't and like why should we own those and like not give like that would be more like what we do then like smart like we're just like not early enough to like be like catching the whole thing like we're just like reactive but but you did you did do a ton of VC in like I guess it was 18 19 and 20 during the doldrums of that bare market right and then you thousand xed a bunch of [ __ ] yeah I think like a lot of of that logic was just like tokens have become very out of Vogue um like there was like a period in like 2019 2020 where like it had been like tokens are worthless like Equity is the thing like this was all like a joke and we were like I don't know like I think people still like tokens like I think they're like so we were just kind of like doing that also we we got like we did like very well out of the gate and we were just like financing everything we were getting a look at for a period because like we just had so much money coming in from the trading side that like we just like kept cutting sort of checks um so like that was like Al just like it was just like luck that we like it was all happening sort of at the same time um so like that was also like part of the thesis was just like we have like a lot of excess capacity like we're not we have like we're new we haven't done a lot in Venture anyway like let's just see where this stuff like goes and then we just like sort of had caught like a period where there had been massive underinvestment on the token side of things I I honestly think we're sort of in that period right now I wonder how you're think you're thinking about Venture right now but seems like prices haven't necessarily caught up with what tokens are actually doing right now I'm still seeing deals you know for 15 20 20 25 mil of things that probably can come out at 50 50 to 100 if the if the if the market stays hot so like I I I actually think that that that seems like it's it's a good time to start the the spray and prey again from from my perspective I tell you what something that's been interesting and like I was like didn't like even really understand that I didn't understand it was just like how much of the building of like other Primitives on bitcoin is and how hot that is in Asia um like just a whole Market that's like big and like relatively cheap on like the Venture side that like we're just like ignoring sort of here um that's just like everything they're talking about and you saw this happen right a couple of these tokens like roofed and like went to billion dollar valuations and like nobody had even heard of them here is is this is really all coming out of Asia that's as far as I see it I mean like we one of our guys was over in Hong Kong for a month and he was like this is the only thing people are talking about over here is like ordinals and stuff like that and like building defi on bitcoin he's like but nobody talks about it here that's that's that's kind of interesting I mean should should be should be very good for Bitcoin miners that's for sure just get get the get get get get the get the fees up as a business I parentally hate like it should be very good for them yeah yeah it's it's it's funny it's like it's it's such a terrible business because you know you know that your income's basically going to zero time but at the same time these things 10x in the last bull cycle so I it just I I've seen I've just seen so I like of all of the like bad investment I've ever seen like in this industry over my time like 90% of it was like miners like it's just like always like every time terrible for terrible outcomes for everybody except for like the Handful in Asia that you don't have access to that like crush it marathon's done okay yeah I think that you're right though that has like changed a lot now that a lot of them are like public but like that's just scarred into my brain so like I think I can't shake it well speaking of that what's what's the worst investment you've ever made in crypto I mean we had a lot of rugs so like there's a lot of just zeros like there's a lot of just like smoldering like crators in like the book like um so like those are probably some I think the biggest ones that I like [ __ ] up were when I was at Circle we were trading OTC and we just started trading eth OTC and it was the second asset we had got and we had a New York Tech fund that was coming in buying 100,000 lots of e like units every day and I remember just like thinking about it being like these guys don't know what they're doing these guys are clowns like instead of just like looking being like Oh like this is like a thing and like people are like throwing real money into it at the time it wasn't a ton um and like basically just like not getting balls long eth then was like a huge mistake especially cuz I had I was seeing it like I was like watching the flows and like I was impacting the market and I was just like fading myself and I was like I don't know looking back on I was like that was like the easiest layup that I just didn't take yeah I mean this this Market this this Market it'll it'll teach you it'll teach you a lot of lessons that that that that's for sure there there there there always going to be things that you know you you you sold out before the before the Thousand X or that you you know you you held for too long and then you just get like rugged on completely like Luna um that that's I mean that that's just part of the Part Of The Addictive addtive part of it we did that round that they did in like January and like the money was gone in like February oh really like we oh yeah yeah that was a that was a huge one that we just like got obliterated on yeah we like punched that ticket and then it was like dead remember remember when Doan and the some Trading Company Executives who she'll go unnamed went around and tried to raise money at the last minute from everybody in the market to try and prop up the price of Luna I that that that was the craziest pitch I have ever heard in the history of my business Endeavors they that was insane I I couldn't even believe it they're like yeah yeah we want to raise a billion dollars well how do how do you know a billion dollars is the right amount and Doan's like yeah well you know it's it's we we looked at all the exchanges and that's how much is on the offer in the stack and we we just want to take it out I remember saying like well what if there's more in the stack like an iceberg you know e extra volume that's there that you can't see he's like oh well we just think that the news from the raids will you know scare off the offer so you just like give us a100 million and I I just remember thinking through this I was like is this a real industry like I mean no it's like like you said not a serious industry not I remember I remember I remember that pitch super well so we called it's like I remember asking like hey I'm on the phone with do hey how big is the hole well you know it's you know two two to three billion and you want to raise a billion to cover a two to3 billion dollar hole take out take out the offers you know take out the offers and'll scare the market higher yeah it just it was crazy um anyway I'm sure you've seen a bunch of those d what's the worst pitch you've ever seen in crypto oh God I mean some of the original pitches in the Ico boom were just like they were existing like venture-backed companies that were just like we're going to do a token and that was it like they'd be like they'd take their existing pitch deck that they just used for whatever their like series B was or whatever and then like the end they would just be like we're gonna launch a token we there was a ton of those this went on for like months when like the Ico boom was going and people were like this is just free money I'm G to like launch of tokens so we saw I at least a dozen of those where I was like there's nothing here besides like your existing Equity pitch and then like now it has a token and you can only invest in the token so there was some funny ones there was like I mean there like other ones it was like what was the um the one it was like it was for like chefs I think was that called like Ambrosia or something like that I remember that one being like this is the 2017 Ico pitches were the best those were like the like most Half Baked by far I know it was just nice because they were they also was just so clear what was happening that you understood that you were basically investing into this thing that just had nothing absolutely nothing behind it whereas as as we've progressed things have been dressed up a little bit people you know put put little flares on it oh no no no this you know we're we're actually solving this issue I'm like guys guys just tell me just tell me how the tokens going up that's that that that that that's what really matters at the end of the day it's funny a man yeah God that was that was a special time in cryp I still stand by 2017 with the wildest period I've ever traded through I like 2021 was but like doesn't hold the candle to 2017 I mean it was it it's just so much so much fun honestly back then also I was I was brigh eyed and bushy tailed so maybe I have just a little bit of nostalgia Nostalgia for those days I mean by the time 2021 came around it was definitely a little bit more jaded U but you know in in in in in 2017 I was you know sitting there clicking spamming my eth to get into these icos hoping that you know i' paid enough gas to [ __ ] [ __ ] get in you remember those what is it like the was it the SNT Ico where like the like eth just stopped working for like two days yeah it was like how is this I was like how is this okay like everybody's just like accepting this yeah Future Finance baby yeah I remember I remember the bch fork happening and there was like a very sharp guy that we had on the desk who was like convinced that like oh like the fork value will come out and like Bitcoin will go down by whatever it is and like instead they both just like rallied after and like bitcoin price never even went down and he's like he's like I don't understand people aren't like pricing the fork I was like dude it doesn't [ __ ] matter like nobody cares I was like they're just gonna buy both now yeah at at the at the end of the day the only thing that matters is how many eyeballs are on an asset and so if if there's if there's a fork happening more people are looking at it I guess it's going up know it's just funny funny how that works we made a fortune on that trade because okx was still crediting you the fork even though so the way because they have coin margin futures like they still do but like that was the dominant one they had then and that was like really the most liquid future because bitx wasn't as hot as it was so we were massively short the back of the curve and you post spot as collateral but they credit you the fork right so you get the fork for free and the curve collapsed like into sort of the event and we made a fortune on this trade because we just like kept putting more and more of it on and like just the market just like didn't care and I remember like talking to Jeremy and Sean at Circle about it and they were like like explaining it and they like they kept like trying to find like the loophole I was like no like the only loophole here is like okay X like just take our money but like they always have that risk but like really we're always wearing the same risk we have anyway I was like this is this is free I was like it's free money just people just like choose not to like want it interesting the only free money I've ever been given in crypto is when the uh the eth work uh versus eth Fork happened and uh we FTX under credited us eth work versus our eth so we complained over the customer service Channel and then SBF replied oh sorry guys just just take take some more e work and like just you know magically air dropped us looking back on it didn't matter right like why not like give him free anyway yeah have some fun our devops guys did a cool trade with that one where they um because like so like I forget how exactly they did it but they um because like all the assets like became worthless on the eth proof of work like right like because you didn't have to like deliver them like all the pools got super imbalance like immediately and you had like a couple blocks to do it but our guy who runs devops was able to have like an eth node running the first day like on the first block and they were like he was able to like drain all of it and like take like he got like a ton of free E grp work on the other I it was like a really complicated trade that he like put off but like it ended up making like a ton of money and I was like this is just the dumbest sort of reason but like why not that's a sick trade we did we we we we ran something similar but way less sophisticated which is that we actually came in after after the chain and we started everything was priced ridiculously low and we thought there was a reasonable chance that some of these things could turn into meme coins so we just like bought all of the all of the meme coins that were on eth that were priced at effectively zero for no for no U for like the usdc that we had on there it didn't end up working I think maybe at some point during the bull market it might got yeah I still have them but I basically like own a bunch of these meme coins on eth that I bought for literally like $5 and I own 10% of the supply I'm just like maybe one day you gotta go Lobby you gotta Lobby okay start listing them and that's how you get it Dan I I'm late for a date with my wife I gotta jump but you guys keep going yeah do what you gotta do I got a jet too actually yeah okay so it's been well dude this was this this this was an aw awesome uh awesome awesome conversation ton of ton of content super packed thanks for coming on you got to come on again once you get the fish put together yeah seriously uh this fish is never getting put together s in the Box forever raise a dow we'll raise a dow for a task rabbit to put together it's he it's [ __ ] heavy we had to carry it up here all right I for the next one I'll see but it wouldn't fit here it's too big that's so funny maybe you should make a Game of Thrones style uh boss chair for yourself made out of uh ancient oh whale bones yeah that' be pretty sick yeah have the intern do that there's a CMS intern on Twitter just hit him up and get that thing assembled be like listen you're hired you just got to make me a chair all right great great to meet you Dan thank thank you so much really appreciate [Music] it
